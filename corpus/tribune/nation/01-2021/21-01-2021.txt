21-01-2021||New Delhi||IMA announces relay hunger strike from Feb 1 against AYUSH ministry notification||The IMA on Thursday announced a pan-India relay hunger strike of doctors starting February 1, in protest against a notification issued by the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) that authorises postgraduate practitioners in specified streams of Ayurveda to perform general surgical procedures, stating that it will lead to “mixopathy”.The Indian Medical Association (IMA) is giving immediate directives to all members across the country to launch the “Save Healthcare India Movement”, the doctors’ body said in a statement.Under the campaign, the IMA will launch a massive awareness drive across the country as this is a clear threat to the safety of healthcare of people.Doctors would take turns to sit on the hunger strike 24x7 from February 1 and the IMA would release posters and banners to raise awareness on the issue across the country, the statement said.“All IMA members shall update their Members of Parliament and MLAs regarding the true picture of the notification and the integration policy. The IMA will also give its representations to all state governments. Under this movement, all NGOs will be updated about the core issues,” it added.Besides, all IMA members will write and convey their feelings to the Prime Minister, the association said.“Representatives of the IMA shall visit various places across the country to raise awareness among the public and apprise various associations from different countries of this ‘unscientific’ notification,” it said, adding that the global voice of modern medicine would echo the feelings of the Indian Medical Association and its members.The IMA has condemned the notification issued by the CCIM, a statutory body under the AYUSH Ministry, authorising postgraduate practitioners in specified streams of Ayurveda to be trained to perform surgical procedures such as excisions of benign tumours, amputation of gangrene, nasal and cataract operations.The doctors’ body further said the recent policy tilt — as evidenced in the medical pluralism advocated by the National Education Policy 2020 and the four committees of NITI AAYOG for officially integrating the systems of medicine in medical education, practice, public health and administration as well as research ostensibly for a “One Nation, One System” policy — would “ring the death knell of all systems of medicine as a whole”.“The IMA respects all streams of healthcare. We object mixing of the streams as it is unsafe and unscientific...one doctor cannot give all systems of medicine to one patient. Mixing the Pathies and providing substandard healthcare is definitely wrong. The IMA demands withdrawal of the CCIM order and dissolution of the NITI AAYOG committees for integration. The IMA appeals to the government to consider the sensitivity of the medical fraternity and take appropriate steps. The IMA will be constrained to intensify the agitation until the steps towards implementing mixopathy are abandoned,” it added.

21-01-2021||New Delhi||IED attacks a major threat, looking for better solutions: CRPF DG||Calling IED attacks a “major threat”, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) chief on Thursday said even the best technology available currently is “not perfect” and the force is scouting for better solutions to stop troop casualties caused by these crude bombs.“Yes, it is a major threat. There are tools to detect IEDs (improvised explosive devices) but none of them is perfect. This is a field in which internationally all organisations are trying,” CRPF director general A P Maheshwari said during a press conference.He was asked if they have found a technology that effectively checks this menace that has claimed the lives of hundreds of CRPF troops and maimed many others in the last decade.IED attacks are majorly carried out in the Maoist violence-affected states and the CRPF said it has detected 460 such devices from all across the country, including Jammu and Kashmir and northeastern states.As many as 418 recoveries of these crude explosives, hidden beneath black top roads and jungle tracks to target security forces, have been recovered from the Naxal violence-hit areas in 2020.The DG said IED attack are a “challenge” for the security forces and the menace gets magnified in the core Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected areas as one “cannot even walk an inch without being careful”.The core areas are heavily mined and even deep search metal detectors are not really useful, he said.There are minerals of different kinds beneath the earth and hence the gadgets do not function efficiently, the DG said.“However, whatever best technology is available they are with us. Even DRDO and IIT-Delhi are working on it (IED detection solutions).”     “Globally we are making surveys like in Israel and the US. But yes there is a lot of scope of improvement and agencies are working on it. As soon as they are available, we will be the first to induct them,” he said.Vikas Singhal, a Deputy Commandant-rank officer of the CRPF’s specialised jungle warfare commando unit CoBRA, was killed after he suffered fatal injuries due to an IED blast in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma district in December last year.The DG refuted that there was any “laxity” in evacuating the officer or there was a “delay” in providing medical care to him, saying people on the spot tried their level best.The force is putting in place some “systemic improvements” to ensure that injured troops are provided medical care as quickly as possible.“I have had a series of meetings with my officers after the wife of the martyr talked to me and raised some concerns.”                  “We are taking certain more measures like creation of helipads at forward bases for quick evacuation of injured personnel, providing more life saving equipments, posting more surgeons in remote areas and training all the personnel in undertaking first-aid like those from the medical wing,” the DG said.“Every situation is a new situation and we analyse and take measures. We are doing our best for our troops,” he said.   The DG said the CRPF has recently created five field surgical units or health care centres in the remote anti-Naxal operation bases in south Chhattisgarh to ensure that the “golden hour” of saving a life is not lost.Talking about operations in Jammu and Kashmir, the DG said a total of 215 terrorists were killed by security forces there last year.The force also apprehended 251 militants while eight surrendered before it, according to official data.“We are in complete integration with other agencies like local police and the Army. We don’t deny the possibility of radicalisation (of the local youth) through various means. As the trends go, the youngsters from within the local population are getting incited...but they are getting neutralised,” he said.He said the “overall situation (in Jammu and Kashmir) is under control and we are prepared to meet any oscillation on that security grid”.     “We have also made deeper inroads into the local population. Things are changing (in JK) and people are also supporting us. JK is an integral part of the country. We would like that prosperity comes there and there is complete assimilation and whatever the barriers are, they are removed. Complete assimilation thought-wise should also be there,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ied-attacks-a-major-threat-looking-for-better-solutions-crpf-dg-201703

21-01-2021||New Delhi||Bird flu: FSSAI advises consumers not to eat undercooked chicken; says no need to panic||In view of the bird flu scare, regulator FSSAI on Thursday advised consumers not to eat half-boiled eggs and undercooked chicken and ensure proper cooking of poultry meat as it came out with a detailed set of guidelines.The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has also urged consumers and food businesses “not to panic” and ensure proper handling and cooking of poultry meat and eggs for safe consumption as outlined in the guidance document.Outbreak of bird flu or avian influenza has been confirmed in ‘poultry birds’ in six states—Kerala, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab.In India, bird flu is spread mainly by migratory birds coming into the country during winter months between September and March.In a statement, the FSSAI said it has issued the guidance document titled ‘Safe handling, processing and consumption of poultry meat and eggs during bird flu outbreak’ suggesting precautions to be taken at retail meat shops, and by consumers and those handling/ processing poultry meat.According to the regulator, bird flu is an infection caused by avian influenza viruses. These flu viruses occur naturally among birds. Wild birds worldwide carry the viruses in their intestines, but usually do not get sick from them. However, bird flu is very contagious among birds and can make some domesticated birds, including chicken and ducks, very sick and kill them.Most strains of avian influenza virus are mainly found in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts of infected birds, and not in meat. However, highly pathogenic viruses, such as the H5N1 strain, spread to virtually all parts of an infected bird, including meat.Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus can be found inside and on the surface of eggs laid by infected birds. Although sick birds will normally stop producing eggs, eggs laid in the early phase of the disease could contain viruses in the egg-white and yolk as well as on the surface of the shell.“Proper cooking inactivates the virus present inside the meat and eggs. Poultry meat and eggs from areas with outbreaks in poultry should not be consumed raw or partially cooked,” the FSSAI said.However, to date, no evidence indicates that anyone has become infected following the consumption of properly cooked poultry or poultry products, even if these foods were contaminated with the avian influenza virus, it noted.Suggesting major “dos and don’ts”, the FSSAI advised consumers not to eat half boiled eggs and undercooked chicken and also not keep raw meat in open as well as not have direct contact with raw meat.It also said that people should not have direct contact with birds in the infected areas, avoid touching dead birds with bare hands and use mask/ gloves at the time of handling raw chicken.Further, the regulator advised consumers not to purchase eggs/ poultry meat sourced from bird flu infected areas and avoid going to open markets that sell poultry in infected areas.For retail shops, the FSSAI asked them not to bring any live or slaughtered/dead poultry birds from the avian influenza outbreak areas and also not allow it to enter into the food chain.People handling raw meat should wear gloves, masks and wash their hands properly with water and soap, especially before and after handling the raw poultry and eggs. Further, contact should be avoided with bird droppings, it added.As per the guidelines, all surfaces and utensils that have been in contact with the raw meat should be washed and disinfected.Clean and sanitise the knives and cutting boards between cutting/ slaughtering two birds, it said, adding that all the waste generated from the retail poultry shop must be properly disposed.While handling and cooking of poultry meat, the FSSAI suggested not to wash the chicken in running water as it may cause water splashing and spread of droplets contaminating the surroundings.It also said that people should use gloves and masks during the handling and preparation of raw poultry/ poultry products. After handling raw poultry meat, wash hands and other exposed parts with soap and water.Do not use the same chopping board or the same knife that is used for cutting raw poultry meat for any other food item before sanitising it or thoroughly washing it with soap/ detergent, it added.The regulator also mentioned that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has stated it is safe to consume poultry meat and eggs and there is no epidemiological data to suggest the disease can be transmitted to humans through cooked food. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bird-flu-fssai-advises-consumers-not-to-eat-undercooked-chicken-says-no-need-to-panic-201699

Chandra, who has contested Lok the Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections in West Bengal as a BJP candidate, said he felt compelled to say that Netaji’s idea of harmonious co-existence of people of various communities in India was facing serious threat.While stating that he and some other members of the Bose family would be present at the function at Victoria Memorial on Saturday, Bose said if the communal situation in the country was allowed to deteriorate further, the unity of India would come under threat.Chandra Bose said while Modi’s slogan of “Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas” sounded good, it was high time that the idea behind the slogan was followed in letter and spirit.Modi’s visit to Kolkata on Saturday to pay homage to Bose is widely believed to be aimed at impressing the Bengali voters before the fast approaching Assembly elections in the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/netajis-kin-worried-about-unity-of-country-on-eve-of-grand-birthday-events-201692

21-01-2021||New Delhi||Govt under misconception that only Punjab, Haryana farmers in battle against agri laws: Hemant Soren||Raising questions over the Centre’s offer to suspend the farm laws instead of repealing them, Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren on Thursday said the government is under a “misconception” that only the farmers of Punjab and Haryana are in this “battle” and asserted that tillers across the country want the scrapping of the “repressive” legislations.He said if the farmers’ agitation is not dealt with empathetically by the government, it will soon spread to different parts of the country.In an interview with PTI, Soren also said the impasse between the government and the farmers over the new agri laws was tarnishing India’s image at international forums.After making the farmers suffer on the streets for months, the central government has suggested to suspending the three contentious farm laws for one and half years instead of repealing them completely, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) executive president said.“The government is under the wrong impression that only the farmers from Punjab and Haryana are in this battle. They are living with a big misconception. Farmers across the country, be it Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Northeast or any other place, have the same sentiment,” Soren said.“They (farmers) are all connected to the ground. We have seen similar protests last year on NRC-CAA, which started at the university level but later engulfed the whole country,” he said.If farmers feel so strongly why doesn’t the government withdraw the laws, asked Soren and alleged that the Centre was showing a “dictatorial attitude”.The farm agitation if not empathetically dealt with and resolved by the Centre, will soon spread to different parts of the country, he asserted.“The new farm laws are repressive. They legitimise black marketing and hoarding. I can’t support these laws. How is it possible that the highest offices of the central government can’t figure out a working solution to the demands being put by the protesting farmer bodies in almost two months?” Soren said.“They (farmers) are all connected to the ground. We have seen similar protests last year on NRC-CAA, which started at the university level but later engulfed the whole country”Asked if the Jharkhand government will pass a legislation to nullify the farm laws as done by some states ruled by the Congress, he said his government is closely observing the developments and will wait to see the final decision of the Centre in this regard.“Farmers feed the people of the country; they are only demanding a fixed Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their crops. If necessary, we will constitute a high-level committee to look into the matter and recommend a concrete resolution,” he said.Soren highlighted that his government recently approved a farm loan waiver scheme benefiting over 8 lakh farmers with an initial budget of Rs 2,000 crore and also gave the nod for a crop insurance scheme for farmers.“Our government has also increased the MSP for paddy from Rs 1,868 to Rs 2,050 per quintal,” the Jharkhand chief minister said.Soren’s remarks come a day after the government proposed to suspend the three contentious farm laws for 1-1.5 years and set up a joint committee to find an amicable solution in the interest of the farming community.During the tenth round of negotiations between three central ministers and protesting farmer unions, the two sides decided to meet again on Friday after the union leaders hold their own internal consultations on Thursday to decide on the government’s new proposal.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Haryana and Punjab, have been protesting at several border points of Delhi since November 28 last year, demanding a repeal of the three laws and a legal guarantee to the MSP system for their crops.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the MSP and do away with the “mandi” (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.Soren, who last month completed one year in office, said his government’s priority has been the holistic development of the state to ensure that no section is left behind.“Immediately after the swearing-in, we approved the decision to withdraw all cases relating to the Pathalgadi movement. In November 2020, the state assembly passed a unanimous resolution recommending the central government for including Sarna adivasi as a separate religion code in Census, 2021,” he said highlighting some of the achievements of his government.“During the pandemic, we learnt how to deal with a widespread infectious disease and at the same time, gained the trust of the citizens by bringing back stranded workers, running community kitchens, connecting them to MNREGA and other livelihood programmes,” Soren said.Soren said his government is consistently working to boost the state’s economy as well as livelihoods of people in the wake of the lockdown impact.

21-01-2021||New Delhi||TN Guv to take call on remission of Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convict in 3-4 days, SC told||Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit will decide in three to four days on the state government’s 2018 recommendation to grant remission to AG Perarivalan, who is serving life term in Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, the Supreme Court was informed on Thursday.A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer and Indu Malhotra, hearing a plea of the 46-year-old convict seeking suspension of his life sentence in the case till the MDMA probe is completed, posted the matter for further hearing after four weeks.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said although Assistant Solicitor General KM Nataraj was appearing for the Centre in this matter, he had received instructions to inform the court that a decision in the matter would be taken in three to four days.The bench said it was good that the Governor was deciding the issue and had the decision been taken earlier, it could saved the court lot of efforts.Mehta regretted for approaching the court late.The bench then asked senior advocate Gopal Shankarnaryanan, appearing for Perarivalan, whether this arrangement was acceptable to him or not.Shankarnarayanan said it was good that a competent authority was taking a decision but requested the court to keep the plea pending, in case the decision was not acceptable to them.Advocate Balaji Srinivasan was appearing for the state government in the case.The bench recorded the submission of Mehta and then posted the matter for further hearing after four weeks.The state government had earlier told the top court that the Cabinet has already passed a resolution on September 9, 2018, and recommended to the Governor for the premature release of all seven convicts in the case.Besides Perarivalan, other six convicts sentenced to life imprisonment include Nalini Sriharan and her husband Murugan, and Santhan, Jayakumar, Ravichandran and Robert Pyas.All seven were convicted by a special TADA court for their role in the assassination of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi on May 21, 1991, during an election rally at nearby Sriperumbudur and sentenced to death but later it was commuted to life imprisonment.Earlier on November 27, 2020, the top court had extended the parole of Perarivalan by one week and directed the state to provide escort to him while visiting the doctor.Perarivalan was first granted parole from November 9 to 23, 2002, by the Madras High Court on medical grounds, which was extended by the top court after he had submitted that he had 25 per cent blockage in kidney and needed surgical intervention.The CBI, in its affidavit of November 20, 2020, has told the Apex Court that the Tamil Nadu Governor had to take a call on grant of remission to Perarivalan.The probe agency has said Perarivalan was not the subject matter of further investigation carried out by the CBI-led Multi-Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA) which is conducting a probe on the aspect of “larger conspiracy” as per the mandate of the Jain Commission report.On November 3, 2020, the top court had expressed unhappiness over the pendency of a plea by a convict seeking pardon in the case for over two years with the Tamil Nadu Governor.The CBI, in its 24-page affidavit, said: “It is for the His Excellency Governor of Tamil Nadu to take a call on the issue whether remission is to be granted or not and in so far as relief is concerned in the present matter CBI has no role.”Perarivalan’s counsel had earlier said his role was only limited to procuring nine-volt batteries, which were allegedly used in the improvised explosive device (IED) that had killed Gandhi.The top court had earlier dismissed a plea of Perarivalan seeking recall of the May 11, 1999, verdict upholding his conviction, saying the material brought on record does not inspire confidence to interfere with the verdict in which he and three others were initially awarded the death sentence, later commuted to life term.Gandhi was assassinated on the night of May 21, 1991, at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu by a woman suicide bomber, identified as Dhanu, at a poll rally. As many as 14 others, including Dhanu herself, were also killed.In its May 1999 order, the top court had upheld the death sentence of four convicts — Perarivalan, Murugan, Santham and Nalini.In April 2000, the then Tamil Nadu governor had commuted the death sentence of Nalini on the basis of the state government’s recommendation and an appeal by former Congress president and Rajiv Gandhi’s widow Sonia Gandhi.On February 18, 2014, the top court had commuted the death sentence of Perarivalan to life imprisonment, along with that of two other prisoners — Santhan and Murugan — on the grounds of an 11-year delay in deciding their mercy pleas by the Centre.

21-01-2021||New Delhi||India to face higher security challenges in line with rising stature, influence: Army Chief||Army Chief Gen MM Naravane on Thursday has said India will face increasingly higher security challenges in tune with its rising stature and it must enhance indigenous defence capabilities to maintain strategic influence and freedom of action as external dependence for weapons creates vulnerabilities in times of crisis.In an address at a seminar on Army-industry partnership, Gen Naravane talked about twin challenges of COVID-19 pandemic and the “belligerence” on the northern borders that his force faced in 2020, and said the government’s focus on self-reliance will boost the country’s overall strategic objectives.He also said the unresolved borders and wars in the past with “our adversaries” challenged the myth of ‘no conventional war’, adding that proxy war, ‘Left-wing extremism’ and insurgencies were likely to keep the Army occupied.“India is now a rising regional global power in Asia, more particularly in South Asia. As we rise in our stature and influence, we will face increasingly higher security challenges,” he said at the seminar organised by the Society of Indian Defence Manufacturers (SIDM).Referring to increasing security challenges along India’s unresolved northern borders, he said a continuous and concerted capability building of the Army through modernisation to address these security challenges was a national imperative.Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a tense standoff in eastern Ladakh for over eight months.The Chief of Army Staff said India was lagging behind slightly, considering the quick pace of defence modernisation being undertaken by its adversaries, and called upon the indigenous industry to invest in research and development to boost the country’s overall military capabilities.“The continuous and heavy dependence of the armed forces on equipment of foreign origin needs to be addressed in the right earnest through indigenous capability development and towards meeting the modern day defence requirements,” he said.“The defence industry is a big enabler for self-reliance and capability building and it is a prerequisite to maintain our strategic influence and freedom of action,” Gen Naravane said.He further said: “We are committed to procuring indigenous equipment and weapon systems as nothing is more motivating for any army then to fight and win its wars with indigenous technologies and weapons.”Encouraging the private industry to take advantage of the government’s reform measures to boost domestic defence production, he said the Army was strongly committed to support them.“Our external dependence for weapons and ammunition creates vulnerabilities during times of crisis. However, in the past few years, we have tried to reverse this trend by boosting indigenisation and focusing on dual purpose high-end technology,” he added.“It may be noted that 75 per cent of our priority one projects in the 13th Army plan, costing over Rs 1,50,000 crore are supporting efforts towards the Make in India programme,” Gen Naravane said.At the seminar, an MoU was signed between the Indian Army and the SIDM that will provide for further impetus to indigenisation under the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ initiative. This MoU was signed on the occasion of 25 years of Army-industry partnership with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) officials said.

The training of NCC should be provided in border areas and coastal areas. We have identified more than 1,100 schools in such areas where NCC training would be given soon,” Singh said.While there were just 28 per cent girl cadets in the NCC earlier, their numbers have increased to be 43 per cent of the total cadets, the minister said in his speech at an NCC camp here.A total of 1,000 cadets, including 380 girl cadets, drawn from all states and Union territories of the country, are participating in this nearly month-long camp that will culminate on January 28.On coronavirus vaccines, the minister said, “Two vaccines are being manufactured in the country. We consider the entire world as one family. We will do vaccination not only in India but also provide these vaccines to our neighbouring countries where it is required.”“Moreover, if it is needed, we will provide vaccines to other countries of the world too,” he stated.From Wednesday onward, India has been sending COVID-19 vaccines under grant assistance to Bhutan, Maldives, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and Seychelles. India started its vaccination drive on January 16 with Covishield, manufactured by Serum Institute of India, and Covaxin, manufactured by Bharat Biotech.The minister said, “The government has decided that when it comes to employment, the NCC cadets would be given preference. As far as I know, this preference is being given. In the selection process, NCC cadets are given additional marks too.” The NCC, which comes under the Defence Ministry, is the largest voluntary youth organisation of the country which was raised in 1948.

21-01-2021||New Delhi||Jaipur Literature Festival announces programme for 2021 virtual edition||American linguist Noam Chomsky, 2020 Booker Prize winner Douglas Stuart, doctors Randeep Guleria, Chandrakant Lahariya and Gagandeep Kang and Carnatic music exponent TM Krishna will be among the over 200 speakers at the Jaipur Literature Festival’s upcoming virtual edition next month, organisers said on Thursday.Set to take place between February 19-28, the 10-day literary event will feature a line-up of speakers from across the world, consisting of writers, poets, playwrights, thinkers, politicians, journalists, cultural icons and recipients of major literary awards.The programme, according to the organisers, promises to be “vast and kaleidoscopic” with themes ranging from ‘Technology and AI’, ‘Politics and History’, and ‘Environment and Climate Change’, to ‘Poetry and Music’, ‘Food and Literature’, and ‘Democracy and Constitutions’. A special session on the COVID-19 pandemic will be one of the major highlights of the edition.Doctors and co-authors Randeep Guleria, Chandrakant Lahariya and Gagandeep Kang will participate in a discussion revolving around India’s fight against the virus.“It’s been a joyous challenge to work on the programming for Jaipur Literature Festival 2021. We look at our transformative times and try to understand the future through the lens of the present and the past. Our hybrid digital outreach has opened up a new universe of possibilities,” said festival director Namita Gokhale. Chomsky’s session will evaluate the ten principles that have fuelled the idea behind his latest book, “Requiem for the American Dream: The 10 Principles of Concentration of Wealth and Power”, as he unravels its roots and its troubling impact on American society, culture and politics. While the talk with Glasgow-born author Douglas Stuart will dissect the thought process behind his Booker Prize-winning debut novel “Shuggie Bain” that follows the bond between a son and his mother, fractured by alcoholism, poverty, aspiration and human misery, Marina Wheeler, a Queen’s Counsel in England, will open the portals of memory as the daughter of a woman traumatised by the Partition of 1947 that divided British India into Pakistan and India. The festival will also shed light on the Aztec empire, their history and their conquest, through author and historian Camilla Townsend’s Cundill History Prize-winning “Fifth Sun: A New History of the Aztecs” that talks about complex and riveting history of the Aztecs based entirely on direct translations of the annals written in the neglected Nahuatl language.Other themes that will be explored through the course of the festival will include, ‘Mental Health’, ‘Economics’, ‘Translations’, ‘Geopolitics’, ‘Historical Fiction’, and ‘Travel’.“There is so much more to experience and reflect upon — from Gulabo Sapera and the dance of the serpents to the science, art and philosophy of Indian food — from the tragic life of the great Bangla writer, poet, and playwright Michael Madhusudan Dutt to the one and only M S Subbulakshmi.Shekhar Pathak and Ramachandra Guha tell us of the people’s history of the Chipko Movement.“We present S Hareesh’s award-winning novel ‘Moustache’, translated from Malayalam. In ‘Brown Baby’, British writer Nikesh Shukla explores shifting ideas of home. We pay tribute to the genius of S R Faruqi as we present his posthumously published novel, ‘Kabze Zaman’. These are some glimpses of the treats in store - a few surprises still await!” Gokhale added.  At a special session, a distinguished panel consisting of author and the 16th Chief Election Commissioner of India Navin B Chawla, former Chief Election Commissioner of Nepal Neil Kantha Uprety, and the Chief Election Commissioner of Bhutan Dasho Kunzang Wangdi will decipher and evaluate the electoral process. In another session, director and writer Devashish Makhija’s latest book, “Oonga” will be launched, followed by a conversation exploring the book that captures the inherent paradox between dystopian ‘development’ and utopian ideologies, through the journey of a little boy in the midst of a clash between Adivasis, Naxalites, the CRPF and a mining company.The speakers line-up also includes names like author and historian Vincent Brown, writer George Packer, Meenakshi Ahamed, philosopher Michael Sandel, scholar and academic Rupert Snell, and academic and columnist Gautam Choubey.“A year after the world was felled by the pandemic, we have persevered and shown that human endurance can and will prevail, fuelled by knowledge and information, empathy and the right to justice.“The Jaipur Literature Festival is representative of these ideals and will continue to be a platform to celebrate the joy of knowledge,” said festival producer Sanjoy K Roy.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaipur-literature-festival-announces-programme-for-2021-virtual-edition-201678
21-01-2021||Ravi S Singh||MoS Kataria expresseses concern over increasing water conflicts between states||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 21Union Minister of State for Jal Shakti Rattan Lal Kataria has expressed concern over increasing water conflicts in the country, while presiding over a review meeting of the Central Water Commission.He lauded CWC’s premier role in country efforts to better manage water resources. Kataria’s concern over water conflicts was in the context of water disputes among states often degenerating into an emotive and political issue.Consequently, the disputes become long drawn and defy amicable resolutions.A number of states are involved in long-standing disputes on waters of inter-state rivers.Dispute on Ravi-Beas waters between Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, and on Cauvery waters between Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Puducherry are among the major inter-state disputes. Taking note of Kataria’s concerns, CWC officials informed him during the meeting that the water conflicts would be resolved expeditiously following passage the Inter-State Water River Disputes (ISWRD) Amendment Bill which is pending in Parliament.The proposals of the Bill, which seeks to amend the Inter-State River Water Disputes Act, 1956 include streamlining  the process for speedy, time-bound, and permanent resolution of the disputes.  The officials underlined that the passage of ISWRD Bill and the Dam Safety Bill was important for a holistic management of water resources in the country.Kataria was informed that there will be better water management by formation of river basin organisations.Also, 79 new flood forecasting stations have been made operational in the last one year.Consequently, 11,721 forecasts were issued in the year 2020 from 328 forecasting stations set up across 19 river basins.Recurring floods caused by Brahmaputra river also figured in the meeting. A need was expressed for setting up a project at Upper Siang/Brahmaputra which shall be highly beneficial for the state of Assam.Regarding alleged plans of China to set up a super hydropower station at Brahmaputra at Medong, Tibet, Kataria was apprised that any attempt to divert water of Brahmaputra shall act as an encroachment on the entitled rights of lower riparian states like India and Bangladesh.It would adversely affect the availability of water in the Brahmaputra basin during the lean season.The meeting, however, took note that there are official platforms -- like the Expert Level Mechanism -- set up between India and China in the year 2006 to discuss various issues related to trans-border rivers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mos-kataria-expresseses-concern-over-increasing-water-conflicts-between-states-201669

His fans and admirers took to social media to remember the actor whose untimely demise was followed by a high-profile investigation.SDMC’s Congress councillor Abhishek Dutt in September 2020 had moved the proposal to name the road after the actor.“It was cleared by the SDMC House in its meeting yesterday,” a senior official said.The Andrews Ganj councillor in the BJP-led South Delhi Municipal Corporation had sent the proposal to the civic body’s road naming and renaming committee.In the written proposal to the committee, Dutt had said that a large number of people living in the area abutting Road No 8 hail from Bihar, and had claimed “they have been demanding” to name the stretch from Andrews Ganj to Indira Camp as ‘Sushant Singh Rajput Marg’.So, it is proposed that Road No 8 be named after the actor in his memory, Dutt had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/street-in-delhi-to-be-named-after-sushant-rajput-who-would-have-turned-35-today-201667

The two are family members of the deceased and they were supposed to raise the girl and protect her,” the judge said, observing that the case falls under the rarest of rare category.The duo was awarded death sentences twice on two separate counts of gang rape and murder, the prosecutor said.The victim’s family had lodged a complaint with the Banda police on March 14, 2019 when their daughter went missing after she went to write her Class 6 examination, Khan said.During the probe, the police found the girl’s severed head 45 foot away from her body in Berkhedi Maujahar area of Banda, he said, adding that the post-mortem report confirmed that she had been gangraped. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-two-sentenced-to-death-for-rape-murder-of-minor-relative-201663
21-01-2021||New Delhi||Health Minister assures people on safety, efficacy of COVID vaccines||Vaccination against COVID-19 will lead to people not transmitting the disease and its eradication in some time, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has said on Thursday as he unveiled IEC posters to address the emerging issue of vaccine hesitancy in some sections of the population.Commenting on the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, he said: “The paradox is that countries across the globe are asking us for access to the vaccines while a section of our own is fomenting misinformation and doubt for narrow political ends.”More than eight lakh health-care workers were vaccinated against COVID-19 in the country till 7 am on Thursday, according to the Health Ministry.Vardhan reminded everyone of the achievements of India, the second-most populous country in the world, which is seeing a steady decline in the number of active coronavirus cases.“The elimination of polio and small pox was made possible by large-scale immunisation. Once immunised, not only that person is not capable of catching the disease, he or she is also unable to transmit the disease to others, thus passing on the social benefit to the larger society he or she interacts with. This was also the logic of undertaking mass immunisation of women and children against 12 diseases under Mission Indradhanush.“The vaccination against COVID will similarly create persons incapable of transmitting the disease and eradicate the disease altogether in some time,” he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the Health Ministry.The minister urged everyone to counter the “vested campaigns of untruth and misinformation”.“Let us put a stop to these falsehoods,” he said.Vardhan appealed to people to seek correct information regarding the COVID-19 vaccines from credible and authentic sources such as the Health Ministry, the Information and Broadcasting Ministry, the Press Information Bureau (PIB), the MyGov website etc, according to the statement.He reiterated that “truth is powerful and shall prevail” and encouraged everyone to share the IEC posters to multiply the virtuous cycle of truth.Commenting on the safety and efficacy of the COVID vaccines, the Health Minister said: “All eminent doctors of well-known hospitals have taken the vaccines and praised the exercise for its desired end. It is only a handful of vested political interests who are interested in spreading rumour and encouraging vaccine hesitancy among those vulnerable to such propaganda in the population.“The paradox is that countries across the globe are asking us for access to the vaccines, while a section of our own is fomenting misinformation and doubt for narrow political ends,” he added.He said eminent doctors, along with many other health-care workers within the government, as well as the private sector, have taken the vaccines and returned to work without any side-effects.

21-01-2021||Vadodara||‘Kamalam’ has sweet, sour reactions from fruit traders, consumers||The decision of the Gujarat Government to rename dragon fruit as ‘Kamalam’ is getting mixed reactions from fruit traders and consumers in the state.Some traders celebrated the decision saying that the earlier name had a ‘Chinese sense’ to it while others said that name-changing will adversely impact their earnings.“Kamalam is a good name, dragon name seems to be close to China. We are Indians and we support the new name,” said Kanu, a fruit vendor in Vadodara, while speaking to ANI.“I appreciate this decision of the government. We are with our country and our traditions,” said Hasmukh Pandya, a customer.Despite all the lauding, the decision to change the name of dragon fruit to ‘Kamalam’ was also criticised by some people.“This is going to impact the market and our earnings as there will be a lesser sale of the fruit. People know it by the name of Dragon-fruit and it will lose its popularity after name changing,” said Lakshman, a fruit trader.Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani announced on Tuesday that his government has decided to rename dragon fruit as “Kamalam” as the outer shape of the fruit resembles a lotus. ‘Lotus’ is also the symbol of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“The name of dragon fruit is associated with China and we have changed it,” Rupani added.Kamalam in Sanskrit means lotus. Dragon Fruit that has become increasingly popular in recent years is a tropical fruit with a unique look and taste. —ANI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kamalam-has-sweet-sour-reactions-from-fruit-traders-consumers-201652
21-01-2021||Washington||Biden's inaugural address written by Indian-American earns praise||US President Joe Biden's powerful inaugural speech, penned by Vinay Reddy, has received glowing tributes for its meticulous crafting and emphasis on the importance of democracy, unity and hope in the midst of challenging times.Reddy - an Indian-American from Telangana who wrote the speech that outlined Biden's goals for his administration, focusing on healing from the current state of division in national politics - has been praised for his “calming” and “inspiring” words.Here are some of the memorable quotes from Biden's speech: "This is America's day, this is democracy's day, the day of history and hope. Today we celebrate a triumph, not of a candidate, but of a cause. We have learned again that democracy is precious, democracy is fragile. At this hour my friends, Democracy has prevailed."      "For without unity, there's no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only state of chaos...this is our historic moment of crisis and challenge...unity is the path forward.”                "Here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never happen. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Not ever."                 "Here's the thing about life. There's no accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days when you need a hand. There are other days when we are called to lend a hand. That's how it has to be. That's what we do for one another."         About halfway through his inauguration speech, President Biden said something very important about the work of Washington - and how he envisions his presidency."Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path," Biden insisted, adding, "Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war"."Hear me out as we move forward,” Biden said at one point in his speech, vowing to be a “president for all Americans”, while asserting: "We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue”.Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian, described Biden's inaugural speech as “modest, austere, grave, calming, cleansing” and “inspiring” in a tweet, while other commentators and media columnists said the president “gave the speech the moment demanded.”             "Biden's speech is about appealing to ‘our better angels', ‘history, faith, and reason', ‘dignity', ‘respect', ‘unity'. It's literally a rebuttal to Trump's 'American carnage' Inaugural address," journalist Matt Fuller tweeted."Joe Biden gave the speech the moment demanded. Well done,” Time magazine columnist David French tweeted."Biden is meeting the moment here by being direct about the challenges we face, the gaslighting, the viciousness and the need to come together. Hell of a speech,” said Tommy Vietor, former NSC spokesman for President Obama said.Last month, Biden named his long-time associate Reddy as his speechwriter.Reddy serves as a speechwriter on the Biden-Harris Transition and was the Senior Advisor and Speechwriter for the Biden-Harris Campaign. He previously served as chief speechwriter to former Vice President Biden in the second term of the Obama-Biden White House, after which, he worked as Vice President of Strategic Communications at the National Basketball Association.During the Obama-Biden administration, he also served as senior speechwriter at the US Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services, deputy speechwriter for the Obama-Biden re-election campaign, and speechwriter for his home state Senator, Sherrod Brown of Ohio.Reddy grew up in Dayton, Ohio, the second one of the three sons in an immigrant family and is a product of Ohio public schools from kindergarten to Miami University to The Ohio State University College of Law. He currently lives in New York with his wife and their two daughters. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bidens-inaugural-address-written-by-indian-american-earns-praise-201649

CM Mamata Banerjee will lead a procession in Kolkata on the day, and has demanded that the day be declared a national holiday and Desh Prem Diwas.A permanent exhibition and a Projection Mapping Show on Netaji will also be inaugurated by the PM on the occasion and a commemorative coin and postage stamp released.A cultural programme ‘Amra Nuton Jouboneri Doot’, based on the theme of Netaji, will also be held.Before this event, the Prime Minister will visit the National Library, Kolkata, where an International Conference ‘Re-visiting the Legacy of Netaji Subhas in the 21st century’ and an artists’ camp are being organised. The Prime Minister will interact with the artists and conference participants.Earlier on January 23, the Prime Minister will distribute 1.06 lakh land pattas/allotment certificates in Sivasagar, Assam.Taking into account an urgent need to protect the land rights of indigenous people of the state, the Assam government came out with a comprehensive new land policy with a renewed emphasis on protecting the land rights of the indigenous people.“The issuance of patta/allotment certificates for indigenous people of Assam has been given highest priority in order to instill a sense of security amongst them,” a PMO statement said.Assam had 5.75 lakh landless families in 2016. The present government has distributed 2.28 lakh land pattas/allotment certificates since May 2016. The ceremony on January 23 marks the next step in this process.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-to-be-in-bengal-assam-on-january-23-in-a-pre-poll-pitch-201645

21-01-2021||New Delhi||Sharp division among Central Trade Unions on new Labour Codes||The meeting convened by Union Labour Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar on Wednesday to discuss draft rules of the Union government’s four Labour Codes yet again witnessed sharp division among Central Trade Unions (CTUs) in line with their ideological moorings.It was the third meeting in the series convened by Gangwar concerning the rules, but the Unions remained divided as in the earlier two meetings.While a group of 10 unions dominated by Left-leaning orientation outrightly rejected the Codes at the meeting, other four including the RSS-affiliate BMS pushed for amendments to the proposed rules.The meeting was “tripartite involving workers’ representatives, employers and the Union government for “consultation” and build consensus on the proposed rules.The Parliament had passed the Codes to ring in reforms to labour laws by subsuming 40 extant laws or streamlining them.The government has to frame the rules to make the Codes operational.Those opposed to the Codes per se are INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF and UTUC.Leaders of these unions told Gangwar during the meeting that they were not in a position to discuss on the Codes which have been already rejected by them.They demanded putting the Codes on hold, and to initiate discussions on each of them afresh with the CTUs.These unions had boycotted the earlier two consultation meetings convened by Gangwar on grounds, including that they were held virtually.On the other hand, BMS at the meeting today demanded protection of contract workers in Codes. It objected to the exclusion of contract labour from their purview up to 50 workers.BMS leaders demanded that strict compliance of ESI and EPF by contractors must be provided in the laws.BMS Pawan Kumar said it was also demanded that “employer’s liability” to pay wages, EPF, ESI and other benefits should be ensured even when in the condition when one contract worker was employed.Also, government establishments should not be exempted from the ambit of the Codes.BMS other demands include scrapping the proposal for “fixed employment”, and provision of financial support for welfare schemes.Meanwhile, sources said the series of consultation meetings regarding the rules with stake-holders by the Ministry is over, and the government will finalise them soon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sharp-division-among-central-trade-unions-on-new-labour-codes-201619

21-01-2021||Mumbai||Sherlyn Chopra: Sajid Khan should issue a public apology||Actress and adult content creator Sherlyn Chopra, who has levelled an accusation of sexual harassment against Sajid Khan, has said that she just wants a public apology from the actor-filmmaker.Sherlyn, who is among several actresses who have levelled sexual harassment charges against Sajid, didn’t seem too keen to initiate legal action.“What I am going to achieve by doing that (legal action)? I just want him to issue a public apology not just to me but to all those women with whom he has tried to indulge in inappropriate acts. He has been a habitual offender where he asks women to come to his home for discussion about work and then he gets into his shameless acts,” Sherlyn told IANS.Sajid Khan has been accused of sexual harassment by multiple women. Back in 2018, assistant director Sonali Chopra, actress Rachel White and a journalist had accused him of sexual misconduct. Recently, late actress Jiah Khan’s sister Karishma had revealed that Jiah was allegedly harassed by Sajid.Sherlyn brought fresh #MeToo charges against the filmmaker and accused him of flashing his privates while discussing a role. In recent tweets, she also alleged that he asked her to touch his private parts.“It is not cool to cross the line decency. We have made laws in this country that there must be consent between two persons before getting into a physical relationship.” Talking about the incident, Sherlyn said: “In April 2005, I lost my father and after a few days, I went to Sajid Khan’s place to discuss a film role. I wanted to keep myself busy with work so that I could forget the pain of losing a parent. When I went to meet him, he randomly asked me to touch his private parts.”“I told him that it’s not right and I left his place. I was terrified by that incident and all these years, I was blaming myself, thinking that I shouldn’t have gone there to meet him. I feel meeting him is one of the unfortunate events of my life. I have decided to talk about it because if not me then some other woman would have gone through such an incident, so I feel it’s my responsibility to show his true side to people,” she added.Sherlyn also slammed top celebrities of Bollywood for not speaking up against issues like sexual harassment at the workplace.“I don’t understand how serial offenders like him (Sajid Khan) get support from the film industry. The Khans and the Kapoors continue to work with him knowing his controversial background. I don’t understand why they (film industry) don’t raise their voice against such shameless activities,” she said.“Otherwise, they talk about the importance of mental health and what not, but inside their homes, they are involved in drugs or such kind of activities. I don’t have a filmi background, so nobody told me that there are different meanings of meeting for dinner or at home, but I don’t want any other women to go through such a traumatic experience in life,” said Sherlyn.She also advised people to change their mindset about women. “People tell me I am an adult content creator, so I should be okay with these things. I want to tell those stupid people that if a woman is an adult content creator or a prostitute, actor, married or unmarried or from any other walk of life, her opinion matters the most in such things, otherwise you have no right to go ahead with it. I want to tell such people to grow up and change their mindset when you deal with women,” she said.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sherlyn-chopra-sajid-khan-should-issue-a-public-apology-201614

21-01-2021||New Delhi||Supreme Court rejects petitions seeking review of Aadhaar verdict||The Supreme Court has dismissed petitions seeking review of its verdict that upheld the validity of the Aadhaar scheme more than two years ago.“In our opinion, no case for review of judgment and order dated September 26, 2018, is made out,” a five-judge Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar said, rejecting a batch of review petitions by 4:1.“We hasten to add that change in the law or subsequent decision/judgment of a coordinate or larger Bench by itself cannot be regarded as a ground for review. The review petitions are accordingly dismissed,” the top court noted in its January 11 order.While Justice Khanwilkar, Justice Ashok Bhushan, Justice S Abdul Nazeer and Justice BR Gavai dismissed the review petitions, Justice DY Chandrachud, who had earlier delivered a dissenting verdict, allowed them.The Supreme Court had on September 26, 2018, upheld the validity of Aadhaar scheme, but struck down or read down as many as six provisions, including those on linking of bank accounts, mobile phones and school admissions to the unique identification number.By a 4:1 verdict, a five-judge Constitution Bench led by the then Chief Justice of India, Dipak Misra, had, however, ruled that Aadhaar would remain mandatory for filing of I-T returns and allotment of PAN.In a relief to the government, it had upheld the constitutional validity of 12 other provisions, including Section 59 of the Aadhaar Act, which extended validity to the data collected during 2009 to 2016, when the law was not there.The top court had ruled that banks and telecom companies cannot insist on Aadhaar for opening of accounts or giving mobile connections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-rejects-petitions-seeking-review-of-aadhaar-verdict-201390

21-01-2021||New Delhi||Govt offers to put farm laws on hold for 1.5 years||In a development that indicated a thaw in the freeze over the three contentious farm laws, the BJP-led Union Government today offered to suspend implementation of the legislations for a year and a half or any period agreed upon mutually between the protesting farmers and the Centre.Also readUnion Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who briefed the media after the 10th round of negotiations with the two sides, said the government was ready to submit an affidavit in the Supreme Court to dispel any doubts on their proposal.Unions won’t shift rally to KMP e-wayThe unions appeared firm on their demand for the repeal of the laws, though they said they would hold internal consultations tomorrow on the fresh offer. Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said, “The government proposed to suspend the farm laws for one and a half years. We rejected the proposal but since it has come from the government, we will meet tomorrow and deliberate over it.”Tomar said he was hopeful of reaching an amicable solution in the next round of talks on January 22. “It will be victory for Indian democracy the day the agitation ends and farmers return to their homes,” he said. The government, he said, was keen on ending the deadlock on Parkash Purb of Guru Gobind Singh. “The farmers remained stuck on their demand for repeal… I am glad they have decided to discuss the matter… the matter is heading towards a conclusion,” he said. Regarding the SC order on the laws, Tomar said the government would honour its decision.3 more farmers dieSanyukta Kisan Morcha leader Darshan Pal said the unions agreeing to discuss the proposal didn’t signify they had given up their demand for repeal of the laws. Viewing the proposal as a "partial victory", some union leaders said the government appeared to be on the “back foot” and “worried”, especially after their decision to hold their tractor rally on R-Day.Another farm leader, Kavitha Kuruganti, said, “Besides keeping the laws on hold, the government proposed forming a committee that will discuss the future of the laws--whether to amend or repeal them.”At one point during the discussion, the committee was projected as one that would also look into the MSP demand but towards the end, it was specified that it would only be about the three laws, a union leader said. The farmers also flagged issues related to NIA summons to some leaders and the arrest of three farmers in Shimla.Earlier in the day, a group of farm union leaders met top officials of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh Police to discuss the route and arrangements for their tractor rally. But the unions rejected a suggestion by the police to hold their rally on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway instead of Delhi's Outer Ring Road, sources said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-offers-to-put-farm-laws-on-hold-for-1-5-years-201295

But you can’t malign people like this and cast aspersions on them and the court. Why do you need to brand people like this? How can you play with people’s reputation like this? We have serious objections to them being called biased,” a Bench headed by CJI SA Bobde said.Senior advocate Dushyant Dave and advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing farmers’ unions, told the Bench that the unions were not interested in making any representation to the court-appointed panel as they wanted the farm laws repealed.The Bench, which issued notice to the government on applications filed by BKU (Lokshakti) and others for reconstitution of the panel, posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.While staying the three farm laws, the top court had appointed a four-member panel to talk to farmers to end the stalemate over the legislations. But farmer leaders objected to the names of committee members, saying the panel members had already expressed their “pro-farm law” views. Beside Mann, the other members of the committee were Pramod Kumar Joshi (Director, South Asia international Food Policy), agricultural economist Ashok Gulati and Shetkari Sanghatana leader Anil Ghanwat.“We have serious objections that members of the committee are criticised and called names,” the CJI said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-fumes-over-biased-tag-for-panel-members-201301

I believe at our best, America is a beacon for the globe. And we lead not by the example of our power, but by the power of our example,” he declared.PM Modi greets US prezPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday congratulated Joe Biden on his inauguration as the 46th US President and said he was committed to taking India-US ties to greater heights.Seeking to set the record straight after Donald Trump refused to concede, Biden pointed out that he had won with the most votes ever cast for a presidential ticket in American history — 74 million. The voters “have delivered us a clear victory. A convincing victory,” he underlined.China sanctions PompeoChina has imposed sanctions on 28 US indivduals, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over “crazy actions that interfered in China’s internal affairs”, its foreign ministry said.His first priority was assembling a group of scientists to evolve an action plan to deal with the pandemic.He called for healing and cooperation between political opponents while hailing Vice-President Kamala Harris “who will make history as the first woman, first Black woman, first woman of South Asian descent, and first daughter of immigrants ever elected to national office in this country”. He also thanked the African-American community for repeatedly supporting him, even during “those moments when this campaign was at its lowest”.To Trump’s supporters, Biden said he understood their disappointment. “I’ve lost a couple of elections myself. But now, let’s give each other a chance. It’s time to put away the harsh rhetoric. To make progress, we must stop treating our opponents as our enemy. We are not enemies. We are Americans.” Biden pledged to be a President who seeks to unify. “Who doesn’t see Red and Blue states, but a United States. And will work with all my heart to win the confidence of the whole people. For that is what America is about: the people. And that is what our administration will be about,” he promised. Biden said he would attempt an economic revival and improve health care. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-era-biden-calls-for-end-to-uncivil-war-201337
21-01-2021||New Delhi||Expect immigration relief for Indians||On assuming office, the new US President, Joe Biden, will begin overturning many of his predecessor Donald Trump’s orders to address four simultaneous national crises: the pandemic, recession, climate change and racial inequality.At least a dozen reversals are expected on the inaugural day though only a couple will be implemented right away. This is because most need approval from a narrowly divided Congress and a Senate which Democrats control 50-50 with the tie-breaking vote to Vice-President Kamala Harris.15 executive actions“On Inauguration Day, President Joe Biden will sign roughly a dozen actions,” the incoming White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain has said.In fact, some of the proposals might make it to the Congress and the Senate later than expected because Biden’s first priority will be to get his Cabinet choices confirmed. The process has been delayed because of delays in counting and the confirmation of electoral votes by the Congress and the Senate.Among the reversals that Biden’s transition team has said will be announced on inaugural day, Indians will be acutely interested in the US Citizenship Bill of 2021, the legislation to modernise the immigration system.Highly skilled Indian IT professionals who come to the US on H-1B work visas have been the hardest hit by Trump’s tweaks to the immigration system. It now imposes a 7 per cent per country quota on allotment of the Green Card and raises wage-based entry barriers. In fact, the Trump administration was making the immigration system tighter through executive orders as late as January 12 and January 15.The Biden Bill also clears employment-based immigration backlogs and makes it easier for graduates of US universities with advanced degrees in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programmes to stay in that country besides improving the access to Green Cards for workers from the low-wage sectors.Biden will also eliminate the limits on employment-based Green Cards by a country, which have kept many Indian families waiting for long.The presidential executive in the first 10 days will cover the four concurrent national crises. It will begin to tackle the health crisis by rejoining the WHO, setting up thousands of community vaccination centres and go in for a mask mandate on federal property and for interstate travel for 100 days. The recession will be addressed by a federal moratorium on evictions and moratorium on student loan debt.He will look into climate change by cancelling the Keystone pipeline and rejoining the Paris Agreement, and will tackle deep racial inequality by resuming citizenship for young and undocumented immigrants.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/expect-immigration-relief-for-indians-201339

Armed with a borrowed SLR and helped by his friend Gursewak Singh who is doubling as his professional cameraman, Karandeep recorded his first rap in one go.“Don’t know how it went, but I am keen to release this song on my YouTube channel soon,” the Hapur lad said minutes after completing his first mega project. Karandeep, whose father Ravinder Singh is a truck driver in Hapur, came to the protest site for the first time.A trained vocalist, who has been recording covers of popular songs and releasing those on his YouTube channel ‘Karrandeep’, an extra ‘R’ in the name is only for a different effect, says the song titled ‘Kisan di Takrir’ was his way to get attached to this historic farm protest.“My kin have farms in Punjab. I wanted to do my bit. My brother encouraged me to go to the protest site. So, here I am doing what I always wanted to do,” the postgraduate said.“Today was the first time I visited a protest site. I came here (Ghazipur) as this is only 50 km from my place,” he explained. His journey from a cover artiste to an upcoming rapper had a few obstacles. Not having a good quality camera was his big headache. “My brother has a high-end phone, but I couldn’t get it as he is away,” Karan said.“Finally, a friend gave me his SLR. I wanted to contribute and even if it doesn’t work out, I will not give up,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rapper-a-truck-drivers-son-lifts-spirits-at-ghazipur-201347

This is because most need approval from a narrowly-divided Congress and a Senate which democrats control 50-50 with the tie breaking vote to Vice President Kamala Harris.“On Inauguration Day, President-elect Biden will sign roughly a dozen actions,’’ the incoming White House chief of staff Ron Klain has said.In fact, some of the proposals might make it to the Congress and the Senate later than expected because Biden’s first priority will be to get his Cabinet choices confirmed. The process has been delayed because of delays in counting and the confirmation of electoral votes by the Congress and the Senate.Among the reversals that Biden’s Transition Team has said will be announced on inaugural day, Indians will be acutely interested in the US Citizenship Bill of 2021, the legislation to modernise the immigration system.Highly skilled Indian IT professionals who come to the US on H-1B work visas have been the hardest hit by Trump’s tweaks to the immigration system. It now imposes a seven per cent per country quota on allotment of the Green Card and raises wage-based entry barriers. In fact, the Trump administration was making the immigration system tighter through executive orders as late as January 12 and January 15.The Biden Bill also clears employment-based immigration backlogs and makes it easier for graduates of US universities with advanced degrees, in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) to stay in the US besides improving the access to green cards for workers from the low wage sectors.Biden will also eliminate the limits on employment-based green cards by country, which have kept many Indian families waiting for long.Presidential executive in the first 10 days will cover the four concurrent national crises. It will begin to tackle the health crises by rejoining the WHO, setting up thousands of community vaccination centers and a mask mandate for all federal property and interstate travel for 100 days. The recession will be addressed by a federal moratorium on evictions and moratorium on student loan debt.Climate change by cancelling the Keystone pipeline and rejoining the Paris Agreement and the fourth, deep racial inequality by resuming citizenship for young, undocumented immigrants, stopping; all deportations and reversing a travel ban on visitors from 13 predominantly-Muslim countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/biden-to-bring-immigration-relief-for-indians-201231
21-01-2021||Satya Prakash||SC rejects petitions seeking review of its verdict that upheld validity of Aadhaar||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 20The Supreme Court has dismissed petitions seeking review of its verdict that upheld the validity of the Aadhaar scheme more than two years ago."In our opinion, no case for review of judgment and order dated 26.09.2018 is made out," a five-judge Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar said, rejecting a batch of review petitions by 4:1."We hasten to add that change in the law or subsequent decision/judgment of a coordinate or larger Bench by itself cannot be regarded as a ground for review. The review petitions are accordingly dismissed," the top court noted in its January 11 order.While Justice Khanwilkar, Justice Ashok Bhushan, Justice S Abdul Nazeer and Justice BR Gavai dismissed the review petitions, Justice DY Chandrachud -- who had earlier delivered a dissenting verdict -- allowed them.The Supreme Court had on September 26, 2018 upheld the validity of Aadhaar scheme but struck down or read down as many as six provisions, including those on linking of bank accounts, mobile phones and school admissions to the unique identification number.By a 4:1 verdict, a five-judge Constitution Bench led by the then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra had, however, ruled that Aadhaar would remain mandatory for filing of IT returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN).While rejecting allegations of surveillance state created by Aadhaar scheme, the top court had asked the Government to put in place a robust data protection regime as early as possible.In a relief to the Government, it had upheld the constitutional validity of 12 other provisions including section 59 of the Aadhaar Act which extended validity to the data collected during 2009 to 2016 when the law was not there.The top court had ruled that banks and telecom companies cannot insist on Aadhaar for opening of accounts or giving mobile connections. Similarly, Schools, Central Board of Secondary Examination, National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) and University Grants Commission can’t ask for Aadhaar, it had said.The verdict adversely affected the Government’s push to link Aadhaar with mobile connections and bank accounts s the top court had held that mandatory linking of Aadhaar with mobile connections and bank account cannot be made. It had struck down the amendment brought in Prevention of Money Laundering Rules which mandated linking of Aadhaar with bank accounts.Noting that Aadhaar was aimed at extending benefits of welfare schemes to marginalised sections of society and to serve larger public interest, the SC had upheld the law taking into account the dignity of people -- not only from personal but from the community point of view.“It is better to be unique than the best. Because, being the best makes you the number one, but being unique makes you the only one,” Justice Sikri (since retired) who had written the majority verdict for himself, the then CJI Misra and Justice AM Khanwilkar had said.There was nothing in the Aadhaar Act that violated right to privacy of an individual, the majority had ruled.There were two other verdicts – one each by Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Ashok Bhushan. While Justice Bhushan had concurred with the other three judges, Justice Chandrachud had dissented and declared the Aadhaar Act unconstitutional.While upholding the law, the majority declared unconstitutional some of its provisions, including the one relating to national security exception under the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016.The majority verdict had also struck down Section 57 of Act which permitted private entities like telecom companies or other corporates to avail of Aadhaar data. It also ruled that Aadhaar authentication data (metadata) cannot be stored for more than six months as against five years provided in the Act.The top court had directed the government to ensure that Aadhaar numbers were not issued to illegal immigrants.The majority had rejected Congress leader Jairam Ramesh’s petition challenging passage of the Aadhaar Bill as a Money Bill by the Lok Sabha even as Justice Chandrachud had termed it a fraud on the Constitution.Taking into account the presentation made by UIDAI CEO, it said the data collected by the authority was safe.There had been minimal demographic and biometric data collected by the Unique Identification Authority of India for Aadhaar enrolment, Justice Sikri said unique identification proof empowered and gave identity to the marginalised sections of society and there was no possibility of obtaining a duplicate as there existed a sufficient defence mechanism, it had said.The regulation which dealt with storage of metadata of transactions was also set aside and the court had said it needed to be amended.It had read down section 33(1) of the Aadhaar saying that an individual, whose information is sought to be released, should be afforded an opportunity of hearing.Section 47, which provided for the cognizance of offence only on a complaint made by UIDAI or its authorised officers, needed "suitable amendment to include the provision for filing of such a complaint by an individual/ victim as well whose right is violated", it had said.It had termed as "susceptible to misuse" and struck down section 57 which empowered the private entities to seek and use Aadhaar authentication for business purposes. "This is clearly impermissible as a contractual provision is not backed by a law and, therefore, first requirement of proportionality test is not met," the bench had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-rejects-petitions-seeking-review-of-its-verdict-that-upheld-validity-of-aadhaar-201207
21-01-2021||New Delhi||Centre offers suspension of agri laws for a mutually-agreed period; farmers say will discuss proposal||In a major development on Wednesday, the BJP-led Centre offered to suspend implementation of the three contentious farm laws for “one to one-and-a-half years” or a period “mutually decided by the two sides”.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government is also ready to give an affidavit in the Supreme Court to dispel any doubts on the proposal.On the issue of MSP, the government offered a committee but farmers rejected it, according to the Samyukta Kisan Morcha.However, agitating unions said they are firm on their demand for a complete repeal of the three laws but will still discuss the government’s proposal on Thursday.Their next meeting with the three union ministers is now scheduled for January 22.Briefing the media, Tomar said he was “hopeful of positive result (in other words farmers taking up the offer of the government) in the next meeting”.“It will be a victory for Indian democracy the day farmers end the agitation,” he added.Tomar said being the ‘parkash utsav’ of Guru Gobind Singh, it was an important day and it was the effort of the government to arrive at some decision today.“While the farmers, as usual, were stuck on their demand for a repeal, the government, with a big heart, was willing to offer amendments. Today’s day is dedicated to Guru Gobind Singh. We began by extending our wishes to unions and gave them the proposal to setup a joint committee to discuss all issues related to agitation and find solutions.“I am glad they have decided to discuss the matter (amongst themselves). I am sure that the matter is reaching towards a conclusion. I am hopeful of a positive result on January 22,” he said. Regarding the Supreme Court order on the laws, Tomar said the government will honour its decision as also of the committee set up by it to look into the matter.Samyukta Kisan Morcha leader Darshan Pal said just because unions have agreed to discuss the government’s proposal tomorrow does not mean that they have given up the demand of complete repeal of the three laws. “First the 32 Punjab unions will discuss the proposal, later it will be taken up with farmer organisations from across India,” he said.Viewing the proposal as a “partial victory”, some leaders said the government appeared to be on “back foot” and “worried”, especially after their decision to hold the tractor rally on January 26, the Republic Day.  Speaking on the developments of the day, ‘morcha’ leader Kavitha Kuruganti said “to increase the unions’ belief and trust in the fact that they are very serious about the suspension idea, the government said they are willing to do this through an undertaking in the Supreme Court.“Along with it, the government also talked about forming a committee that will then give recommendations regarding future of these laws, whether they should be amended or repealed etc,” she saidThe modalities of the committee will be discussed after unions agree to the proposal of the government.  “At one point during the discussion, the committee was projected as one that will also look into the MSP demand. Towards the end it was specified that it will only be about the three laws. The government also said laws can be suspended for mutually agreed period,” leaders said  While the Centre remains firmly against repealing the controversial laws, Tomar reportedly also told farmers they could approach the SC because “many farmers are also supporting the laws”.Unions, however, said since the laws have been formulated by the Parliament, they should also be repealed by it.“Farmers presented multiple replies in Parliament by the minister (Tomar) where he has stated that agriculture is a state subject, and in one reply also that Agriculture Marketing is a state subject,” leaders said.They also flagged issues related to NIA summons to some leaders and arrest of three farmers from Shimla.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-offers-suspension-of-agri-laws-for-a-mutually-agreed-period-farmers-say-will-discuss-proposal-201179
21-01-2021||New Delhi||Farmers’ protest: SC takes exception to aspersions cast on 4-member panel||The Supreme Court on Wednesday took strong exception to the casting of aspersions on a four-member committee appointed by it to talk to farmers agitating against farm laws even as it issued notice to the Centre on a plea seeking reconstitution of the panel after the recusal of BKU leader BS Mann.“If you don’t want to appear before the committee, we can’t compel you. But you can’t malign people like this and cast aspersions on them and the court. Why do you need to brand people like this? How can you play with people’s reputation like this? We have serious objections to they being called biased,” a Bench headed by CJI SA Bobde said.Also read: SC refuses to entertain Delhi Police plea against tractor rally on Republic DaySenior advocate Dushyant Dave and advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing farmers’ unions told the Bench that the unions were not interested in making any representation to the court-appointed panel, saying they want the farm laws to be repealed.The Bench, which issued notice to the Government applications filed by BKU Lokshakti and others for reconstitution of the panel, didn’t fix a date for further hearing.While staying the three farm laws, the top court had appointed a four-member panel to talk to farmers to end the stalemate over three farm laws. But farmer leaders objected to the names of committee members, saying the panel members had already expressed their pro-farm laws views.Beside Mann – who recused—the other three members of the committee were Pramod Kumar Joshi (Director, South Asia international Food Policy), Agricultural Economist Ashok Gulati and Shetkari Sanghatana leader Anil Ghanwat.The Bench—which had earlier said its intervention had been misunderstood—said it wanted to provide a solution.“We have serious objections that members of the committee are criticized and called names. I am very sorry to see what is appearing in newspapers,” the CJI said.During the hearing, the CJI wondered how could it be said that the panel members were disqualified simply because they had previously expressed their opinion on the issue.“How do you come to that conclusion? They are brilliant minds in the field of agriculture. They are experts. How can you malign them because they expressed some views in the past? Every judge and lawyer has expressed some views in past and they’re doing something different now. Don’t people change their opinions after hearing contradictory point of view? Men of integrity do that. We don’t understand this. The Supreme Court appoints a committee and their reputation is torn to shreds...” an anguished CJI said.The committee has not been given powers to adjudicate and it was only meant to assist the court, clarified the top court which had on Tuesday said that prior expression of opinion can’t be a disqualification for someone to be a member of a panel.Expressing its anxiety over the situation, the court told Bhushan that the farmers should maintain peace and asked the Attorney General that it should talk to farmers’ unions to ensure law and order.The Bench told Dave not to aggravate the situation on the issue relating to its earlier order when he was not present for constituting the four-member committee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protest-sc-takes-exception-to-aspersions-cast-on-4-member-panel-201175

It has to be enquired immediately on war footing as to who that person is. Whoever is responsible for the leakage must be punished for treason and this journalist who was in possession of sensitive military operations he has to be punished. The government must order a proper enquiry. Whoever is responsible, whoever is party to the leakage of this sensitive military operation deserves no mercy. He has to be punished.”The ex-minister, flanked by former home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, former external affairs minister Salman Khurshid and Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said today that “Leaking of official secret is a criminal act but leaking of official secret about military operation, a national security matter, that too sensitive military operations especially a military strike is treason, anti national.”It is not just criminal action it is anti national activity, said Antony. He said only three or four or five ministers and officials could have known of the operation.Antony said how three days before the Balakot strike on February 26, 2019, one journalist came to know the details of the air strike.“It could have affected the operations. I don’t know whether it did not or. Effectiveness of the operation could also have been affected if details are known in advance to someone. How did a person not authorized to have this information end up having it?” he asked adding that a handful of people would know.“After working with the military people I am very sure no military officer will leak such sensitive information to journalists or others so these documents were leaked to one journalist from among those four or five civilian people who are in the top position in the government, either the ministers or officers concerned with national security. Only they can leak these documents,” he said.Shinde said the leakage must be probed under the Official Secrets Act with the Congress adding that the matter would be raised in Parliament and demand of a JPC made at an appropriate time after speaking to other parties.Azad demanded a probe into whether Arnab was simply bragging his proximity to the government or whether he actually got help from the government to manipulate the TRPs through unlawful means.“This matter is not the concern of one political party but of the entire country, how two persons—editor of a national channel and CEO of BARC – manipulated the TRPs. TRP itself gives you a greater role in national news networks and more advertisements. If someone has become richer, got more finances and ads not in normal course or merit but through criminal conspiracy and by manipulating TRPs artificially, this is a matter of great concern,” Azad said.He asked whether the TRP and BARC system should function at the cost of national security.Khurshid mentioned the alleged unsavoury references in the chats about the judiciary with Dasgupta once asking Arnab to “Buy the judge” and asked whether the judiciary would take cognizance of the issue.“Irresponsible statements have been made in relation to a case. The comments are very painful and therefore some questions arise. Have attempts been made to influence the judiciary? Have any wrong decisions been secured through this influence?” asked Khurshid.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/leakage-of-military-secret-treason-those-involved-deserve-no-mercy-antony-201171
