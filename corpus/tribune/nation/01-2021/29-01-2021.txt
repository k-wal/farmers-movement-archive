They have served the Navy and the Army. Please try to sort it out with the authorities. Why push them into the litigation cycle again? There in their years of retirement now…These women (officers) have served the nation. Why should they be made to go to the AFT (Armed Forces tribunal) again? Sit down with them and sort it out,” a Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud told Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain.Maintaining that the 2020 judgements have to be implemented in letter and spirit, Jain assured the Bench those genuine issues that were resolvable within the framework of the rules and will be resolved.In two verdicts in 2020, the top court had held that serving women Short Service Commission Officers in Indian Navy and Army were entitled to Permanent Commission on a  par with their male counterparts.There are issues of arrears of salary, gratuity and pension that needed to be resolved.Earlier this month, 11 women army officers had moved the Supreme Court seeking compliance of its directions to the Centre for grant of permanent commission, promotions and consequential benefits to them “in an inclusive, fair, just and reasonable manner”.Lieutenant Colonel Ashu Yadav and 10 other women Army officers alleged that the directions were not being complied with in “letter and spirit”. The procedures for grant of permanent commission were “vitiated with arbitrariness, unfairness and unreasonableness”, they alleged in the petition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/these-women%C2%A0have-served-the-nation-says-sc-asks-centre-to-sort-out-their-issues-205136
29-01-2021||New Delhi||Online schooling can help reduce inequalities in educational outcomes, says Economic Survey||While most of the schools remained closed due to Covid-induced restrictions, children were taught online and percentage of enrolled children from government and private schools owning smart-phones increased enormously “from 36.5 per cent in 2018 to 61.8 per cent in 2020 in rural India”.  If utilised well, the resultant reduction in digital divide between rural and urban, gender, age and income groups is likely to reduce inequalities in educational outcomes, stated the Economic Survey tabled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament today. Quoting the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2020 Wave-1 (Rural), it pointed that percentage of enrolled children from government and private schools increased from 36.5 per cent in 2018 to 61.8 per cent in 2020 in rural India. The Survey says India will have the highest population of young people in the world over the next decade. The ability to provide high-quality educational opportunities to them will determine the future of the country. India has attained a literacy level of almost 96 per cent at the elementary school level but it is still behind in achieving 100 per cent literacy. As per the National Sample Survey, the literacy rate of persons of age seven years and above at the all-India level is 77.7 per cent and female literacy remained below national average among social groups of SC, ST, OBC, including religious groups of Hinduism and Islam.To provide quality education in schools and institutions of the government in affordable and competitive manner, the government had announced the new National Education Policy, 2020 replacing the 34-year old National Policy on Education, it said. Meanwhile, it also noted the initiatives launched by the government to make education accessible to children and facilitate learning during the pandemic, including PM eVIDYA that aims to enable multi-mode and equitable access to education for students and teachers. Around 92 courses have started and 1.5 crore students are enrolled under Swayam MOOCs which are online courses relating to NIOS, it added. To mitigate the effect of COVID-19, Rs 818.17 crore is allotted to States and UTs to promote online learning through digital initiatives and Rs 267.86 crore for online teacher training under Samagra Shiksha Scheme, it saidPRAGYATA guidelines on digital education have been developed with a focus on online/blended/digital education for students who are presently at home due to the closure of schools, while the 'Manodarpan' initiative for psychological support has been included in Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/online-schooling-can-help-reduce-inequalities-in-educational-outcomes-says-economic-survey-205132
29-01-2021||Ravi S Singh||Economic Survey validates concerns about impact of Covid-19 on jobs||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 29The Union Government’s Economic Survey Report - 2021 has validated the gnawing concerns that Covid-19 pandemic induced lockdown had adversely impacted the job and livelihoods in service sectors more than the manufacturing sector.With regard the labour law reforms rung in by the government through passing of the four codes by Parliament, the report expressed optimism of them having salubrious effect on the economy. They will give leg up to the MSME sector which has taken a hit due to the lockdown.Till this report, it was a moot point on whether the service sectors or the manufacturing sector had been greater victim.The report says that the public health response needed to slow transmission of Covid pandemic together with the need for social distancing and minimising contact, meant that service sectors reliant on face-to-face interaction, particularly wholesale and retail trade, hospitality, and arts and entertainment, have “seen large contractions than manufacturing”.It puts the matter in perspective saying that the service sectors contribute a significant portion of both incomes and employment in most economies“The scale of disruption in these sectors has, therefore, had severe impact on the livelihoods of sections engaged in these sectors.”The lockdown led to local, regional and global supply disruptions hitting economic activity, rendering a “first order “ supply  shock. This in turn led to demand shock both through disruptions in the labour market, which affect household  income, and through the precautionary motive to save, which stemmed from the uncertainty   amidst the health crisis.With regard to the labour law reforms, the reports termed them as among major structural reforms having potential for “unparalleled opportunity to grow and prosper”. They will contribute to job creation in the primary and secondary sectors.It underlined that these “historic” reforms will benefit MSMEs to increase employment, enhance labour productivity and thereby wages.The reforms were undertaken by rationalising or merging a clutch of 41 central labour laws into four in the form of codes.The codes will become operational after  the Union Government frames “rules” under them.The Labour Ministry has held a series of “tripartite” consultations on draft of the proposed rules. The rules are  likely to be announced during this Budget Session of Parliament.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/economic-survey-validates-concerns-about-impact-of-covid-19-on-jobs-205131

Giving an additional attempt or relaxation in age for some candidates would amount to extending differential treatment to similarly placed aspirants at the examination.Questioning the Centre for filing a “routine affidavit” without specifying the level at which the decision was taken, the Supreme Court had on Thursday asked the Centre to file a fresh affidavit with regard to not granting an extra chance to civil services aspirants who missed their last attempt in 2020 exam during COVID19 pandemic.“It is a policy decision but the affidavit does not say anything at whose level this decision has been taken,” it had said, taking exception to the affidavit filed by an under-secretary.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-why-cant-you-give-once-time-relaxation-to-those-who-missed-civil-services-2020-sc-asks-centre-205130

29-01-2021||New Delhi||If not resolved, farmers’ agitation will spread: Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said the only solution to the farmers’ issue was throwing the new agri laws in the “waste paper basket” and warned that if not resolved, the agitation will spread to other parts of the country.In a no-holds-barred attack at the Centre, Gandhi accused the government of trying to intimidate and discredit the farmers, using the National Investigation Agency.“It is very obvious that the farmers are very agitated because the government is destroying their livelihood. It is destroying the livelihood of our labourers and it is going to give the middle class a shock in the coming times because the prices of food are going to skyrocket,” the former Congress chief said at a press conference.“What is being done to the farmers is absolutely criminal. You (government) are beating them, you are threatening them, you are bullying them, you are trying to discredit them,” he said.The government needs to talk to the farmers and provide a solution to them, he said.Gandhi asserted that the only solution is repealing these laws and “putting the laws into the waste paper basket”.“The government must not think that the farmers are going back home. They are not going home and my concern is that this situation is going to spread. We do not need this situation to spread, we need a conversation with farmers and we need a solution,” Gandhi asserted.Responding to a question, he said the farmers’ movement is going to spread to other states and cannot be suppressed.The whole issue is not just about farmers and this will go from farmers to workers to urban areas and slums, he said.Asked about the Republic Day violence, he said, “Who allowed the farmers to enter the Red Fort; is it not the home ministry’s job to stop them from doing so.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-not-resolved-farmers-agitation-will-spread-rahul-205112

29-01-2021||New Delhi||PM weakening India by attacking farmers: Rahul||The Congress hit out at the Centre on Friday over the farmers’ protest against the new farm laws, with former party president Rahul Gandhi alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “weakening” India by “attacking” farmers.The remarks by Gandhi came a day after the Congress alleged that the government was trying to divide and intimidate the farmers to break their protest against the three laws.“PM is weakening India by attacking our farmers and workers. Only anti-national forces will benefit,” Gandhi tweeted.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also slammed the government over the issue.“Farmers’ trust is the country’s capital. Breaking their trust is a crime. Not listening to their voice is a sin,” Priyanka Gandhi tweeted.“Threatening and intimidating them is grave sin. Attack on farmers is an attack on the country.” “Mr Prime Minister, do not weaken the country,” she added.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at several border points into Delhi since November-end, demanding repeal of the three laws and a legal guarantee to the minimum support system for their crops.Enacted last September, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the MSP and do away with the wholesale market system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-weakening-india-by-attacking-farmers-rahul-205100
29-01-2021||New Delhi||Kota woman undergoes robotic surgery for rare disease||A 31-year-old woman suffering from a rare form of hereditary disease was operated through robotic surgery at a hospital here.The woman, who is from Kota, Rajasthan, suffered from multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A), a rare inherited condition in which patients develop a progressively growing tumour at more than two glands, either thyroid gland, parathyroid gland or adrenal glands.The patient presented with a history of hoarseness of voice and swelling in the neck that had developed two months ago, according to Arun Prasad, senior consultant, surgical gastroenterology and bariatric surgery at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals.The patient was admitted to the hospital on January 7 and post-evaluation, it was revealed that she had developed two tumours—one in the thyroid and the adrenal gland, an organ that lies near the kidney and pancreas of the person in a remote place in the tummy.“This is an uncommon condition and only 1 out of 35,000 people report this problem, predominantly reported from the western part of the country. Tumour of adrenal can cause devastating fluctuations in blood pressure leading to stroke, bleeding in the brain and eventual paralysis,” Prasad said.A multidisciplinary approach was required and to ensure precision, minimal blood loss and avoid any post-operative complications, a robot assisted surgery was planned for the extraction of the tumour, doctors said.Explaining about the surgery, Prasad said: “This was a challenging surgery for us as we had to make large incisions at two places and if not done with precision, it could have damaged other blood vessels and surrounding muscles of the patient.”      This could have led to either a painful post-operative recovery or additional life-threatening complications. Hence, it was decided to go with a robot-assisted surgery as opposed to a traditional surgical procedure, he said.“We were able to locate the exact site of extraction through master controls for hand movements and precision-guided robotic arms while on a computer operated console.“We were successfully able to extract the tumours without causing harm to any adjoining muscles or vessels, with minimum blood loss,” Prasad said, adding that the surgery was performed on January 14.In and around Kota, this rare disease is affecting the people, Prasad claimed.“This female patient is one such unfortunate victim of this rare hereditary disease. In the past, her brother and father both succumbed to this fatal disease,” he said.The condition, known as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN Type 2A), affects hormone producing glands of the body, Prasad said.He underscored that the problem lies in the fact that there are no specific symptoms that could pick up this disease early. Hence, he added, public and healthcare awareness is of paramount importance.All blood relatives and people in the village need genetic and medical screening for the disease, Prasad said.Suresh Singh Naruka, consultant, ENT, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals said an accurate diagnosis followed by surgery at an early stage is a useful intervention for management of this rare condition.“Early surgical removal is the only curative option as any delay can make these tumours cancerous and also resistant to chemo, as well as radiotherapy,” Naruka said.“Therefore, a radical approach both from a therapeutic and surgical point of view was undertaken. Patient tolerated the procedure well and after 48 hours of post-operative care was discharged on January 16,” Naruka added.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kota-woman-undergoes-robotic-surgery-for-rare-disease-205098

29-01-2021||Kolkata||Former Bengal minister Rajib Banerjee quits TMC||Hours after quitting as the MLA of the West Bengal Assembly, Rajib Banerjee on Friday resigned from the primary membership of the TMC, intensifying speculation that he might soon switch over to the BJP.He sent his resignation letter to TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee, thanking her for the opportunities given to him to serve the people of the state."I do hereby tender my resignation as a member of the All India Trinamool Congress as well as from all other positions held by me in the party and its associates with immediate effect," Banerjee, who had stepped down from the state cabinet last week, wrote in his resignation letter.The former forest minister, after ending his two-decade-old relationship with the TMC, said he would always value the time he spent as a member of the party.Earlier in the day, the former forest minister, who represented the Domjur Assembly seat, visited the state assembly in the morning and submitted his resignation to Speaker Biman Banerjee."I have resigned as MLA of the state assembly. I have submitted my resignation letter to the speaker. I thank my party supremo Mamata Banerjee for providing me with an opportunity to serve the masses," he said.Replying to a query about chances of his switchover to the BJP, Banerjee said, "If you want to serve the masses, you need to be associated with a political party. People always want a politician to be associated with a party. But I have not spoken with BJP leaders so far".He, however, stressed that he will "continue to serve the people of my constituency in the days to come".Incidentally, Union Home Minister Amit Shah is scheduled to address a rally in Banerjee's home district Howrah on January 31.Extending his gratitude to the chief minister, the former minister said, "Mamata Banerjee is like a mother figure to me. I am indebted to her for providing me with this platform... This is an emotional moment for me".Joining the growing list of dissenters who have put the ruling camp in a tight spot ahead of the assembly elections, Banerjee last week put in his papers as the cabinet minister and said he was forced to take this decision after being publicly humiliated by a section of the party's leaders for airing his grievances over their style of functioning.He is the third minister to quit the state cabinet in the last two months after Suvendu Adhikari, who crossed over to the BJP, and Laxmi Ratan Shukla, who expressed his desire to quit politics.The TMC leadership, over the past one month, held several rounds of dialogue with Banerjee to address his grievances. State parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee and the party's poll strategist Prashant Kishor had met the leader and tried to pacify him.According to TMC sources, he had been having differences over various issues with the district chairman of Howrah and state minister Arup Roy.Banerjee, a popular mass leader in Howrah, influences eight of the 16 assembly seats in the district.Elections to the 294-member assembly are likely to be held in April-May this year. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-bengal-minister-rajib-banerjee-quits-tmc-205096

Not only have the number of protesters at Ghazipur increased with farmers from Uttar Pradesh and neighbouring Haryana joining in, support is also growing at Singhu and Tikri despite tension and clashes. While throughout the night on Thursday meetings in Tikait’s support were held in several villages in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, on Friday the 'mahapanchayat' in Muzzafarnagar  decided that Ghazipur agitation would continue.BKU president Naresh Tikat, who had earlier called off the agitation at Ghazipur, asked supporters to go and  support the protests at the Delhi-UP border. After his (Naresh Tikat's) earlier announcement there were visible signs of  thinning of protests at Ghazipur. However sources say even though an “agreement” was reached with the Tikait brothers that the protest site will be vacated, the increase in security forces and presence of Loni MLA Nand Kishore Gujjar and his supporters "vitiated the atmosphere"Asserting that he will not surrender and will also call more people to join the protest if needed, Rakesh Tikait on Thursday broke down saying that "he would rather commit suicide than leave and end the protest against the farm laws".As Rakesh Tikait declared he would continue the protest at the Ghazipur border and not vacate till talks with the government were held, Naresh Tikait quickly called an emergency meeting and appealed to supporters to reach Ghaziput and scheduled a mahapachayat in Muzzafarnagar.Apparently, Naresh Tikait also said that it was “their mistake” to support BJP candidate, Union Minister Sanjiv Balyan, against RLD chief Ajit Singh in the last Lok Sabha elections.   BKU founder, late Mahendra Singh Tikait, is revered by farmers as "second messiah" after late Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh in the western UP region.Sources say optics of Rakesh Tikait, a jat/kisan leader, becoming sentimental and breaking down was enough to stir emotions among his community who “collectively felt humiliated”.“Rakesh Tikait lost badly when he contested the polls a few years back.

29-01-2021||New Delhi||Agriculture sole bright spot in COVID-induced lockdown, says Economic Survey||India’s agricultural sector has proved its resilience amid adversities of COVID-induced lockdown with agriculture and allied activities clocking a growth of 3.4 per cent at constant prices during 2020-21, the government’s economic report card has said. In fact, according to the Economic Survey tabled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament ahead of the Union Budget on February 1, “agriculture and allied activities were the sole bright spot amid the slide in GDP performance of other sectors, clocking a growth rate of 3.4 per cent at constant prices during 2020-21 (first advance estimates)”.As the survey applauded the contribution of the sector to the emerging “green shoots of the Indian economy” it also added that recent agricultural reforms (against which farmers are agitating) are “a remedy and not a malady”“The three agricultural reform legislation are designed and intended primarily for the benefit of small and marginal farmers which constitute around 85 per cent of the total number of farmers and are the biggest sufferer of the regressive APMC regulated market regime. The newly introduced farm laws herald a new era of market freedom which can go a long way in the improvement of farmer welfare in India,” it said According to the document, the share of agriculture and allied sectors in Gross Value Added (GVA) of the country at current prices is 17.8 per cent for the year 2019-20. Total food grain production in the country is estimated at a record 296.65 million tonnes, higher by 11.44 MT than 285.21 MT achieved during 2018-19.Exports amounted to approximately Rs 252,000 crore with major destinations being USA, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Nepal and Bangladesh, and major produce exported including marine products, basmati rice, buffalo meat, spices, non-basmati rice, cotton raw, oil meals, sugar, castor oil, and tea. But while India occupies a leading position in the global trade of the aforementioned agri-products, its total agri-export basket accounts for a little over 2.5 per cent of world agri-trade. The survey, while noting agri-related announcements under the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, said “given the large proportion of resource-constrained small and marginal farmers in India, timely availability of adequate credit is fundamental for the success of farming activities.Meanwhile, the survey also reported good news from allied sector. It said contribution of livestock in total agriculture and allied sector GVA increased from 24.32 per cent (2014-15) to 28.63 per cent (2018-19). Livestock sector contributed 4.19 per cent of total GVA in 2018-19.Fish production reached an all-time high of 14.16 million metric tons during 2019-20. The GVA by the sector to the national economy stood at Rs 2,12,915 crore constituting 1.24 per cent of the total national GVA and 7.28 per cent of the agricultural GVA.The Food Processing Industries (FPI) sector has been growing at an Average Annual Growth Rate (AAGR) of around 9.99 per cent as compared to around 3.12 per cent in Agriculture and 8.25 per cent in manufacturing at 2011-12 prices.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/agriculture-sole-bright-spot%C2%A0in-covid-induced-lockdown-says-economic-survey-205089

It added that 163 fatalities have been recorded in a span of 24 hours.Eight states and UTs account for 85.89 per cent of the new deaths. Maharashtra saw the maximum casualties (50).

29-01-2021||New Delhi||India reaping ‘lockdown dividend’ by saving lives and livelihood: Eco Survey||India is reaping the “lockdown dividend” from the preventive measures it adopted at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic indicating its willingness to take short-term pain for long-term gain, said the Economic Survey tabled in Parliament on Friday.The document also said despite the hard-hitting economic shock created by the global pandemic, India is witnessing a V-shaped recovery with a stable macroeconomic situation aided by a stable currency, comfortable current account, burgeoning forex reserves, and encouraging signs in the manufacturing sector output.“India is reaping the ‘lockdown dividend’ from the brave, preventive measures adopted at the onset of the pandemic...,” it said in the opening chapter titled ‘Saving Lives and Livelihoods Amidst a Once-in-a-Century Crisis’.Unlike Oscar Wilde’s cynic, ‘who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing,’ India’s policy response to the pandemic stemmed fundamentally from the humane principle advocated eloquently in the Mahabharata that ‘Saving a life that is in jeopardy is the origin of dharma.’     “Therefore, the ‘price’ paid for temporary economic restrictions in the form of temporary GDP decline is dwarfed by the ‘value’ placed on human life,” said the survey.The document further said India recognised that while GDP growth will recover from the temporary shock caused by the pandemic, human lives that are lost cannot be brought back.The response drew on epidemiological and economic research, especially those pertaining to the Spanish Flu, which highlighted that an early, intense lockdown provided a win-win strategy to save lives, and preserve livelihoods via economic recovery in the medium to long-term.“To implement its strategy, India imposed the most stringent lockdown at the very onset of the pandemic. This enabled flattening of the pandemic curve and, thereby, provided the necessary time to ramp up the health and testing infrastructure,” it said.Faced with enormous uncertainty, India adopted a strategy of Bayesian updating to continually calibrate its response while gradually unlocking and easing economic activity.As per the survey, India has transformed the short-term trade-off between lives and livelihoods into a win-win in the medium to long-term that saves both lives and livelihoods.By estimating the natural number of cases and deaths expected across countries based on their population, population density, demographics, tests conducted, and the health infrastructure, the survey compare these estimates with actual numbers to show that India restricted the COVID-19 spread by 37 lakh cases and saved more than 1 lakh lives.According to the document, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Bihar have restricted the case spread the best; Kerala, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have saved the most lives; Maharashtra has under-performed the most in restricting the spread of cases and in saving lives.India was amongst the first of the countries that imposed a national lockdown when there were only 500 confirmed cases.The stringent lockdown in India from March 25 to May 31 was necessitated by the need to break the chain of the spread of the pandemic.The 40-day lockdown period was used to scale up the necessary medical and para-medical infrastructure for active surveillance, expanded testing, contact tracing, isolation and management of cases, and educating citizens about social distancing and masks, etc.“The lockdown provided the necessary time to put in place the fundamentals of the ‘5 T’ strategy - Test, Track, Trace, Treat, Technology,” the survey said.As the first step towards timely identification, prompt isolation and effective treatment, higher testing was recognised as the effective strategy to limit the spread of infection.At the onset of the pandemic in January 2020, India did less than 100 COVID-19 tests per day at only one lab.However, within a year, 10 lakh tests were being conducted per day at 2,305 laboratories. The country reached a cumulative testing of more than 17 crore in January, 2021.The sharp decline in the number of days to add the next cumulative 1 crore tests show the dedicated efforts to expand the testing infrastructure. The requisite resources of PPEs, masks and sanitizers were also expanded at a fast pace, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-reaping-lockdown-dividend-by-saving-lives-and-livelihood-eco-survey-205084

29-01-2021||Mumbai||Rape victims’ testimony not confidence-inspiring: Bombay HC judge||A Bombay High Court judge, facing flak for her interpretation of sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, had in two recent rulings acquitted two persons accused of raping minor girls, after noting that the victims’ testimony did not inspire confidence to fix criminal liability on the accused.Justice Pushpa Ganediwala recently acquitted a man accused of groping a 12-year old girl’s breast because he did not make skin-to-skin contact, and days earlier, ruled that holding the hands of a five-year-old girl and unzipping pants do not amount to ‘sexual assault’ under the POCSO Act.In two other judgments, she acquitted two persons accused of raping minor girls after noting that the testimony of the victims did not inspire confidence to fix criminal liability on the accused persons.“No doubt, the testimony of the prosecutrix (victim) is sufficient for conviction of the accused. However, the same ought to inspire confidence of this Court. It ought to be of sterling quality,” Justice Pushpa Ganediwala said in one of the judgments.In the second judgment, she said sole testimony of the victim in rape cases is sufficient to fix criminal liability.“However, in the present case, considering the sub-standard quality of testimony of the prosecutrix, it would be a grave injustice to send the appellant behind bars for 10 years,” her order said.In the judgments, delivered on January 14 and 15, she questioned how could a single man gag the victim, undress both of them and rape without leading to a scuffle. She wondered how an unmarried couple was allowed to stay in a house by the family members and how did it find the privacy to indulge in physical relations.In the judgment of January 15, Justice Ganediwala was hearing an appeal filed by one Suraj Kasarkar, 26, against his conviction for rape of a 15-year-old girl. He was sentenced to ten years in jail.The prosecution’s case is that in July 2013, Kasarkar barged into the girl’s house and raped her. The accused in his appeal claimed that he and the girl were in a consensual relation, adding the case was lodged against him at the behest of the girl’s mother after she learnt of the relation.Justice Ganediwala while acquitting the accused noted that the alleged act of forceful sexual intercourse is unbelievable to the natural human conduct.Her order noted that the girl while deposing before the trial court said she was 18 years old and that she had falsely claimed she was 15 years old in the FIR at her mother’s instance.The order said that the deposition of the victim on the alleged incident does not inspire the confidence of the court.“It seems highly impossible for a single man to gag the mouth of the prosecutrix (victim) and remove her clothes and his clothes and to perform the forcible sexual act without any scuffle. The medical evidence also does not support the case of the prosecutrix, the order said.“Had it been a case of forcible intercourse, there would have been scuffle between the parties. In medical report no injuries of scuffle could be seen, Justice Ganediwala said adding the defence of consensual physical relations does appear probable.In the judgment of January 14, Justice Ganediwala was hearing an appeal filed by 27-year-old Jageshwar Kawle, who was convicted under the POCSO Act and Indian Penal Code (IPC) for raping a 17-year-old girl. He was sentenced to ten years.The prosecution’s case was that the accused took the girl to his sister’s house for two months and had sexual intercourse with her several times.The court order noted that except the statement of the victim that the accused had sexual intercourse with her there was “absolutely nothing” to support the case of rape.In the order, Justice Ganediwala also wondered as to how did other members of the house allow an unmarried boy and girl to sleep together and also how could the victim and the accused get privacy to indulge in sexual intercourse.Justice Ganediwala was appointed as a district judge in 2007 before which she was an advocate. She was elevated as Additional Judge of the Bombay High Court in February 2019. On January 20 this year, the Supreme Court Collegium approved her appointment as a permanent judge of the high court. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rape-victims-testimony-not-confidence-inspiring-bombay-hc-judge-205079
29-01-2021||New Delhi||Hyderabad encounter: SC gives 6 months more to inquiry commission to file its report||The Supreme Court on Friday gave another six months to three-member inquiry commission, headed by former apex court judge VS Sirpurkar, to file final report on the circumstances leading to the encounter killing of the four accused in the gang-rape and murder of a veterinarian in Hyderabad.The other members of the commission include former Bombay High Court judge Rekha Sondur Baldota and ex-CBI director DR Karthikeyan.A bench of Chief Justice Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said: “We will extend it by six months.”The bench perused an application filed by the commission seeking some more time for filing the report in the case and passed the order.This is the second time the top court has granted six months’ time to the commission to file its final report, since it was setup on December 12, 2019.The top court had on July 24, 2020, granted the Commission six-month extension to submit final report.On December 12, 2019, the top court had appointed a three-member inquiry commission headed by former apex court judge VS Sirpurkar to inquire into the circumstances leading to the encounter.It had then stayed proceedings pending in the Telangana High Court and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in the case and sought an SIT report, saying no other authority shall inquire into the matter pending before the commission of inquiry till further orders.It had ordered that security to the three-member commission shall be provided by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the six-month deadline for submission of the report by the commission shall start from the first day of hearing and it shall have all the power under the Commission of Inquiry Act for conducting inquiry into the December 6, 2019, encounter deaths.The top court had noted that “conflicting versions about the incident demand an inquiry to uncover the true facts”.It had directed that the panel would sit at Hyderabad and all expenses, including for the secretarial staff would be borne by the Telangana government. Further, the state would render all assistance required by the commission.Two petitions were filed in the Supreme Court, one by lawyers GS Mani and Pradeep Kumar Yadav, and the other by advocate ML Sharma, seeking independent investigation against the police officers concerned.The PIL, filed by Mani and Yadav, claimed that the alleged encounter was “fake” and an FIR should be lodged against the police officers involved in the incident.The Telangana Police had said that the accused were killed in an exchange of fire. The incident took place around 6.30 am when the accused were taken to the site of offence for the reconstruction of the scene of crime as part of the investigation.The four accused were shot dead on NH-44 near Hyderabad — the same highway where the charred body of 27-year-old veterinarian was found.The police had claimed that on November 27, 2019, the woman veterinarian was kidnapped, sexually assaulted and later found murdered.It had said the accused had subsequently burned the body of the woman.

It shows that the Indian side attaches importance to the ties with China, we appreciate this,” Zhao said.“Meanwhile, we stress that the boundary issue shall not be linked with the overall bilateral relations. That is an important experience we have gathered through many years’ effort to keep the ties moving forward,” the spokesman said.“We hope the Indian side will work with us to properly manage the differences, promote practical cooperation and bring bilateral relations back on track,” Zhao said.In his address on Thursday, Jaishankar outlined eight broad principles and three “mutuals” to mend strained ties between India and China, and said the two countries were truly at crossroads and their choices would have profound repercussions, not just for them but for the entire world.The minister said the developments in eastern Ladakh last year brought the relationship under “exceptional stress” and India was yet to receive a credible explanation for the change in China’s stance or reasons for amassing troops in the border areas.The two countries are locked in a military stand-off in eastern Ladakh since May 5, 2020. India and China have held several rounds of military and diplomatic talks to resolve the face-off in eastern Ladakh, but no significant headway has been made so far.

However, police personnel stopped them from going towards the protest site.    “We had come to make arrangements for drinking water and toilet facilities for the farmers. The police prevented the DJB's water tankers from reaching the farmers," Jain told reporters."The police personnel present on the spot said they had been ordered not to allow water tankers to reach farmers. The BJP government in the Centre has denied this basic facility to our farmers," he alleged.  Chadha said the "farmers are not terrorists" and appealed to the BJP government to treat them with respect.     The BJP government is preventing the farmers from accessing basic facilities such as drinking water, toilets and langar (community kitchen), he claimed. "The Delhi Police should show us the order based on which they prevented the water tankers from reaching the farmers," he said, adding that authorities have also stopped AAP's langar service at the Singhu border.  The police on Thursday intensified barricading, completing shutting small passages being used by farmers to travel to the Delhi side on foot, and deployed more personnel at the protest site.The development came after around 400 police personnel were injured during the farmers' tractor parade on Republic Day.     A total of 33 FIRs have been registered in connection with the violence during the rally.On Thursday, the Delhi Police issued 44 lookout notices to protesters and farmer leaders named in an FIR.

29-01-2021||New Delhi||Contempt of Court: Comedian Kunal Kamra refuges to apologise to SC||Comedian Kunal Kamra—who is facing criminal contempt of court proceedings for “scandalising the judiciary”—has defended his controversial tweets, saying if powerful people and institutions continued to show the inability to face rebukes and criticism, “we would be reduced to a country of incarcerated artists.”In an affidavit filed in response to criminal contempt of court notice issued by the top court, Kamra said, “I believe there is a growing culture of intolerance in the country where taking offence is seen as a fundamental right and is elevated to the status of much loved national indoor sports.”Raising the issue of arrest of another comedian Munawar Farooqi, in Madhya Pradesh, he expressed hope that the court will protect the right to free speech.On Friday, a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan deferred the hearing by two weeks after petitioners seeking contempt action against the comedian sought time to file their response to his affidavit.Another stand-up comedian, Rachita Taneja, facing contempt over her social media posts, urged the top court to separate her case from that of Kamra.The Bench gave her three weeks to file her response to the contempt notice after senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi sought time on her behalf.“Foundation of the Supreme Court is surely based on much stronger foundation... criticism of the court can never be contempt,” Rohatgi submitted.He said that there is a public perception as to why one case of a journalist was taken up for hearing during the court’s vacation. The Supreme Court observed that criticism of courts is “growing and everybody is now doing it” now.During the hearing on a separate plea, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Taneja, said that he will file a reply to petition against her.Maintaining that courts were not beyond criticism in a democracy, Kamra said, “If this Court believes I have crossed a line and wants to shut down my internet indefinitely, then I too will write Happy Independence Day postcards every 15th August just like my Kashmiri friends.”He said judges were the most powerful but enjoyed no protection from jokes.“I do not believe that any high authority, including Judges, would find themselves unable to discharge their duties only on account of being the subject of satire or joke,” Kamra stated in his affidavit.He said irreverence and hyperbole were essential tools for the comedic enterprise.The Supreme Court had on December 18 issued notices to Kamra and Taneja on separate petitions seeking initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against them for scandalising the judiciary. It had asked them to respond to the petitions in six weeks and explain why criminal contempt proceedings shouldn’t be initiated against them.However, it had said the contemnors needn’t appear before it in person.The petitions against Kamra and Taneja were filed after Attorney General KK Venugopal gave his consent to initiate criminal contempt of court proceedings against both the comic artists.They had allegedly insinuated the Supreme Court after it gave bail to Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami in an abetment to suicide case.Terming Kamra’s tweets as “highly objectionable”, Venugopal had said in his opinion it “constitutes criminal contempt of court.”The tweets were not only in bad taste but crossed the line between humour and contempt of court, the Attorney General had noted.In one of his tweets, Kamra showed the Supreme Court in saffron colour with a BJP flag in place of the Tricolour. He tweeted that honour had left the building (Supreme Court) long back and it was “the most supreme joke of the country”.He also made nasty comments about a sitting Supreme Court judge.Taneja had circulated a caricature that allegedly depicted a quid pro quo relationship between the judiciary and the government concerning the Ayodhya verdict. She had also allegedly insinuated the top court for giving bail to TV journalist Arnab Goswami.The consent of either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General is necessary, under section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, for initiating contempt proceedings against a person in the Supreme Court. --- With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/contempt-of-court-comedian-kunal-kamra-refuges-to-apologise-to-sc-205050

29-01-2021||Shubhadeep Choudhury                                                                       ||Mamata questions media’s silence on Rajdeep Sardesai issue||Tribune News Service                                                                         New Delhi, January 29West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress head Mamata Banerjee has questioned the media’s silence on the action initiated by the India Today TV channel against its consulting editor-and-senior anchor Rajdeep Sardesai for tweeting and broadcasting that the farmer killed during the protest demonstration in Delhi on January 26 was shot by police.It was later found that the farmer Navneet Singh died of head injury suffered when his tractor toppled sideways.On Thursday, the India Today group took  Sardesai off-air for two weeks and deducted his salary for a month as part of disciplinary action over the incorrect tweet. Rajdesai had also announced on live television, that the man who had died during the farmers’ tractor rally in Delhi on January 26, had been “shot.”Sardesai, later, deleted his tweet and mentioned on air that the farmer had been killed in an accident after his tractor overturned.In a tweet, Mamata said she was “shocked at what is happening to senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai”“It is also surprising how most in the media are silent on this issue. In our democratic system we must raise our voice. The media is an important pillar of our democracy”, Banerjee further wrote in the tweet.Sardesai had earlier wrongly tweeted that Pranab Mukherjee was dead when the former President was still in coma in the Army Research and Referral Hospital in Delhi. Sardesai later apologised “for falling for fake news being circulated on Pranab Mukherjee passing away”.“I am deeply distraught for falling for this fake news. It was unprofessional of me to not reconfirm it before tweeting. Apologies to all.. and prayers with the family”, Sardesai had then tweeted.Sardesai has not yet reacted on the latest episode involving him.Meanwhile, Editors Guild of India, of which Sardesai had remained President, defended him, albeit in a different context.In a press statement on Friday, the Guild condemned the filing of FIRs against journalists including Sardesai and Mrinal Pande (National Herald) for sharing “unverified” news during the farmers’ tractor rally in Delhi on January 26. “The Editors Guild of India strongly condemns the intimidating manner in the way in which the Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh Police have registered FIRs against senior editors and journalists  for reporting on the farmers' protest rallies and the ensuing violence that took place in the national capital on 26th January”, the guild said in a statement.“The journalists have been specifically targeted for reporting the accounts pertaining to the death of one of the protestors on their personal social media handles as well as those of the publications they lead and represent. It must be noted that on the day of the protest and high action, several reports were emerging from eyewitnesses on the ground as well as from the police, and therefore it was only natural for journalists to report all the details as they emerged. This is in line with established norms of journalistic practice”, the statement by the guild added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-questions-medias-silence-on-rajdeep-sardesai-issue-205046

I mean, I do believe that it is absolutely essential to have a de-escalation of the situation, namely in the Line of [Control],” the UN Chief said.Guterres was responding to a question by a Pakistani journalist on tensions between India and Pakistan over the situation in Kashmir. The question also referred to the statement Guterres had issued in August 2019 on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir where he had appealed for maximum restraint.“I think it’s absolutely essential for the two countries to be able to come together and seriously discuss their problems, and I think it’s essential that human rights are fully respected in all territories that you mentioned,” Guterres said during his press briefing on Thursday.“Now, things have not moved in the right direction. Our good offices are always available, and we will insist within it of finding peaceful solutions for problems that have no military solution.

29-01-2021||New Delhi||RLD chief Ajit Singh speaks to Tikait brothers, announces support to BKU||Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Ajit Singh has announced support to the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), the members of which are staging a protest against the Centre’s new farm laws at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border.The former union minister had spoken to BKU president Naresh Tikait and spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, RLD vice president and his son Jayant Chaudhary said.“It is a matter of life and death for farmers but do not worry. All have to stay together, united in this — this is Chaudhary saahab’s (Ajit Singh’s) message,” the RLD vice president said in a tweet in Hindi.The Tikait brothers, sons of legendary farm leader Mahendra Singh Tikait, are leading the BKU, the members of which are camping at the UP Gate (Ghazipur border) for two months now demanding a rollback of the contentious farm laws brought by the Centre in September last year.The RLD, which was virtually wiped out in the last Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, was founded by Singh, son of Chaudhary Charan Singh, a former prime minister and a farmer leader from western Uttar Pradesh.

29-01-2021||New Delhi||BSP also to boycott President's address: Mayawati||The Bahujan Samaj Party will boycott the president's address to the joint sitting of both Houses over the Centre's stand on the farmers' demand to repeal the new agri laws and its "dilly-dallying" approach on matters of public interest, the party's chief Mayawati said on Friday.She made the announcement just hours before President Ram Nath Kovind's address to the joint sitting of both Houses, making BSP the 19th party to announce boycott of the address.A day before the start of the Budget session of Parliament, as many as 18 opposition parties, led by the Congress, the NCP, the Shiv Sena and the TMC, had decided on Thursday to boycott the president's address in solidarity with the farmers protesting against the new farm laws.“In protest over (the Centre) not accepting the farmers' demand of repealing the three controversial agri laws and adopting a dilly-dallying approach in matters of public interest, the BSP has decided to boycott the president's address in Parliament,” Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi.“Also, I request the Centre to take back the farm laws and normalise the situation in Delhi. Innocent farmers should not be made a scapegoat in the wake of the violence on Republic Day. There is a lot of truth in the objection of BKU and other leaders from UP in this matter,” she said.While 16 opposition parties issued a joint statement announcing their decision to boycott the president's address, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) had also separately announced their decision to boycott the address.The parties that jointly announced that they will boycott the president's address were the Congress, the Nationalist Congress Party, the National Conference, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the Trinamool Congress, the Shiv Sena, the Samajwadi Party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the CPI, the Indian Union Muslim League, the RSP, the People's Democratic Party, the MDMK, the Kerala Congress (M) and the All India United Democratic Front.

29-01-2021||United Nations||UN chief lauds India's Covid vaccine assistance to nations||India's vaccine production capacity is one of the best assets the world has today, UN chief Antonio Guterres has said as he applauded India for supplying COVID-19 doses to nations around the world to combat the catastrophic global health crisis.The UN Secretary-General also expressed hope that India will have all instruments necessary to play a major role in ensuring a global vaccination campaign becomes possible as the world fights the pandemic.“I would like to say how much we count on India. I mean, India has one of the most advanced pharmaceutical industries. India played a very important role in the production of generics for use that was a very important element of democratisation of access to medicines all over the world,” Guterres said.He was responding to a question by PTI during a press briefing on Thursday on India helping countries around the world in the fight against the global pandemic by supplying COVID-19 vaccines.“And we strongly hope that India will have all the instruments that are necessary to play a major role in making sure that a global vaccination campaign becomes possible. I think that the production capacity of India is one of the best assets the world has today, and I hope the world understands that it must be fully used,” he said.Guterres added that he reiterated during his briefing to the UN Member States on his priorities for 2021 that licences should be made available for companies around the world to be able to produce some of the vaccines that already exist.“I know that, in India, there is a production, a very high level of production, both of Indian-developed vaccines, and I think there is a perspective, very important perspective, of also others. And we are in contact with Indian institutions for that.”India has airlifted more than 6 million COVID-19 doses to nine countries in Phase-I under its initiative termed ‘Vaccine Maitri’. Contractual supplies to various countries are also being undertaken in a phased manner and New Delhi has said it will gradually supply to the COVAX facility of the World Health Organisation.COVAX is the global initiative to ensure rapid and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all countries, regardless of income level.This month, COVAX had announced that, pending WHO emergency use listings, nearly 150 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford candidate are anticipated to be available in the first quarter of 2021, via existing agreements with the Serum Institute of India (SII) and AstraZeneca.The Joe Biden administration has also applauded India for sending crucial supplies of the COVID19 vaccine to a host of South Asian nations, describing India as “a true friend” who is using its pharma to help the global community.“We applaud India's role in global health, sharing millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccine in South Asia. India's free shipments of the vaccine began with the Maldives, Bhutan, Bangladesh & Nepal & will extend to others. India's a true friend using its pharma to help the global community,” the US State Department's account for the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs had tweeted.India has assisted more than 150 countries through urgent health and medical supplies. New Delhi has pledged 15 million dollars for GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, and operationalised the COVID-19 Emergency Fund for its neighbours with an initial contribution of 10 million dollars.India has already rolled out a massive coronavirus vaccination drive under which two vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, are being administered to frontline health workers across the country. The country plans to vaccinate about 300 million citizens in the first six months.Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and the Maldives have received India's COVID-19 vaccines under grant assistance in sync with its ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy.India also began commercial exports of COVID-19 vaccines and sent two million doses each to Brazil and Morocco.Underlining that the priority for 2021 is to respond to COVID-19, Guterres told the General Assembly earlier in the day that vaccines are the first great moral test before the world. He voiced concern that the world is falling short and vaccines are reaching a handful of countries quickly, while the poorest countries have almost none.“Science is succeeding, but solidarity is failing. Governments have a responsibility to protect their populations, but COVID-19 cannot be beaten by one country at a time. If the virus is allowed to spread like wildfire in the global South, it will inevitably mutate; it is mutating, becoming more transmissible, more deadly and, eventually, more resistant to vaccines, ready to come back to hound the global North.”He cited recent studies to say that vaccine hoarding could cost the global economy up to USD 9.2 trillion, with almost half of that impact in the wealthiest countries themselves.“There is only one victor in a world of vaccine haves and vaccine have-nots: the virus itself.” The total number of coronavirus cases has topped 100.7 million globally, while the deaths have surged to more than 2.18 million, according to Johns Hopkins University.

We will get water from our villages," Rakesh Tikait said after a notice from the Ghaziabad administration to the farmers to end their protest.Stating that he will not surrender and will even call more people to join the protest if needed, Rakesh Tikait broke sown saying that "he would rather commit suicide than leave and end the protest against the farm laws".Mahendra Singh Tikait is revered by farmers as "second messiah" after late Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh in the western UP region.The farmers' agitation received a jolt when the protesters who took part in a tractor rally wreaked havoc on the roads of Delhi on Republic Day.The police said unions had promised to carry out their rally in protest against the three central farm laws on approved routes, but deviated from it and marched towards central Delhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rakesh-tikaits-tears-do-the-trick-protesters-increase-at-ghazipur-border-205013

They sought repeal of farm laws in a joint statement and demanded an impartial investigation into the Centre’s “nefarious role in orchestrating the Republic Day events in the Capital” while accusing the government of attempting to discredit the farmers’ movement.Motion condemning Red Fort incident likely‘Centre behind violence’The Congress-led grouping, meanwhile, said farm laws were brought in without consultations and lacked national consensus.“Parliamentary scrutiny was bypassed and the laws were pushed through muzzling the Opposition in a brazen violation of parliamentary rules, practices and conventions.

Stating that the traffic flow must resume between Delhi and Haryana, the residents announced the decision to hold a panchayat tomorrow to decide the future course of action if their demand was not met. In Rewari, local petrol pump dealers along with residents of some villages held a meeting on the Delhi-Jaipur highway bordering Shahjahanpur to demand that the protesters should clear the highway. They also threatened to remove the barricades if the farmers failed to do so, giving the local administration some anxious moments. They claimed that the dharna was adversely affecting the sale of fuel and resulted in sanitation issues and other problems for the nearby villages.In Yamunanagar, a group of miscreants threw stones at a religious place and damaged several vehicles late last night during a protest march by the locals against the incidents of violence in Delhi on Republic Day. A case has been registered.Sources said police presence had been beefed up in view of the voices being raised against the closure of borders to avert any confrontation between the farmers and those protesting their presence.Till January 26, villagers around the Singhu and Tikri borders were extending all sorts of services to the protesting farmers, even ensuring a regular flow of supplies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-tikri-singhu-locals-pull-away-want-stir-sites-vacated-204764

While the reason behind the withdrawal of security forces was not announced, security officials said they had been asked to go back as they were on duty since previous morning. All senior police officials left the spot around 1.30 a.m.Electricity supply at the protest site, which had been cut, was also restored after midnight.The situation was tense at the Ghazipur border after the tractor rally organised by the farmers' unions on Republic Day turned violent in the national capital.A major movement of farmers back towards Ghazipur and Singhu protest spots started overnight in solidarity with Bharatiya Kisan Union spokesperson Rakesh Tikait, after he defied orders by the local administration to vacate the protest site. The Congress and RLD backed the farm union.Tikait, among 37 leaders booked by Delhi Police for the Republic Day incidents, alleged there was a plot to “attack and kill” farmers and refused to budge despite Ghaziabad DM’s orders to clear the site by night.Also read: Hundreds of farmers across Haryana move to rejoin Singhu, Ghazipur, Tikri protest sites RLD chief Ajit Singh speaks to Tikait brothers, announces support to BKUDelhi Police serve summons to farmer leaders for questioning over January 26 incidentsRakesh Tikait's tears do the trick, protesters expected to increase at Ghazipur borderArrangements for drinking water, other facilities in place for farmers at Ghazipur border: SisodiaDeep Sidhu says Red Fort events now look like a police trap; will join investigationRakesh Tikait takes a dig at Baba Ramdev, says he will not run in ‘salwar kameez’“Police officials are here to take us away and a BJP MLA is waiting with supporters to attack and kill farmers,” Tikait alleged. “Anyone from the BJP will be taken hostage.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and RLD chief Ajit Singh backed Tikait.Following his emotional outburst, farmers on tractors-trailers from the states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Punjab started moving towards various Delhi border protest sites in large numbers around midnight.The Jind-Chandigarh highway was blocked by farmers at Kandela village in Haryana. Slogans of Punjab-Haryana unity were raised by the gathered farmers.In a late-night message, Punjab farmer leaders Jagjeet Singh Dallewal and Rajinder Singh Deep SinghWala appealed to people to reach Delhi borders to “save the farmers' movement”. They said the police attempt to clear the Ghazipur border was just the beginning, the same would be attempted at Singhu and Tikri also.Several protesters at Ghazipur waved the Tricolour, with some waving flags of farmer unions like Kisan Ekta Manch amid a continuous sloganeering of "Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan", while many were lying down on mattresses covered in blankets as they braved bone-chilling cold and wind."Zaroorat padi to khade rehke dharna denge, tum dharne pe baithe rehne ki baat karte ho (I can protest while standing, and you are asking whether I am going to continue the sit-in)," Jagat Singh Rathi, 78, told PTI.

We have not seen any such order to vacate the protest site. When the Supreme Court has said that farmers have a right to protest then what?

The fact that Singhu looks empty is a mere optical illusion.“Just because there were too many people in the run up to the parade, now that they have gone back, it looks like this,” said Baldev Singh, general secretary, All India Kisan Sabha.The Sanyukta Kisan Morcha, however, on the eve of Republic Day had announced that all the farmers, who would join the tractor march, would stay back and living arrangements would be made for them.According to Baldev Singh, the protest site also appeared to be less crowded because there were protesters who had been camping here since the very first day, and had waited till Republic Day before returning home.“But then some other members of their families will join us. The protest is only getting stronger,” Baldev Singh said.The agitation to demand the repeal of the three laws was their “single point agenda” and they were not going to move from Singhu until they are met, added Ashwini Kumar, district president, Punjab Kisan Union.Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Urgrahan, whose organisation has been leading the protest at the Tikri border, said there were many people who had come to Delhi to participate in the tractor parade and now they have left for their home. That’s why the site appears to be less crowded.It is perhaps the low population at the Singhu border that has caused several service providers to temporarily shut shop, including langars, ironing service, and the Kissan Mall.At the Singhu protest site, most dismissed the idea of the thinning crowd and said the services were unavailable because they were restocking supplies.“The agitation is as strong as ever. People are going home and returning. The Kissan Mall is shut today only because we are waiting for some fresh supplies. It will be open again from tomorrow,” said a volunteer of Khalsa Aid that runs the mall.A similar response was shared by Roshan Singh, who has been running a langar serving breakfast, lunch and dinner at the site for nearly two months.On Thursday afternoon, the langar was deserted and the stoves were out.“We served food in the morning but are closed now because we ran out of products. Our enthusiasm about the protest has not at all decreased,” he said.The set up where the ironing services were being provided has simply disappeared.For Gurjeet Singh, a farmer from Patiala, the movement continues to remain solid.While he arrived at Singhu in November with a group of 20, only five are currently present at the site.“Many people have just gone back to take care of things at home. Like one person in our group has gone back for his sister’s wedding, another has gone back because of a medical issue.“What happened on Republic Day was the government’s way of maligning our movement, but it has had no impact whatsoever on the enthusiasm of our agitation and we are stronger than ever,” he said.As far as the future of the farmers protest is concerned, the February 1 farmers march to the Parliament stands postponed, and farmer leaders are chalking out their further strategy.Meanwhile, a fast would be observed on January 30, the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, said Baldev Singh.Nearly 400 policemen were injured during the tractor parade of the farmers who have been protesting against three central farm laws at Delhi’s borders since late November.The Delhi Police on Wednesday had alleged that farmer leaders made inflammatory speeches and were involved in the violence during the tractor parade, as it warned that no culprit will be spared.The police have filed 33 FIRs in connection with the violence during the rally. Nineteen people have been arrested and around 50 detained. Thirty-seven farmer leaders have also been named in an FIR. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protest-security-heightened-at-singhu-tikri-and-ghazipur-borders-204630

29-01-2021||New Delhi||Boeing gets US government nod to offer F-15EX jet to India: Official||US aerospace major Boeing on Thursday said it received approval from the US government to offer its F-15EX multi-role combat jet to the Indian Air Force.Ankur Kanaglekar, the head of fighters’ sales of Boeing Defence and Space in India, said the F-15EX could offer a future-ready and multi-role solution to the IAF in the form of unmatched payload and performance.Interacting with a group of journalists, he said Boeing had received marketing licence from the US government for the F-15EX, paving the way for its supply to India. F-15EX is the latest and most advanced version of the multi-role, all-weather and day and night versions of the F-15 aircraft family.In April 2019, the IAF issued an RFI (request for information) or initial tender to acquire 114 jets at a cost of around $18 billion, which is billed as one of the world’s biggest military procurements in recent years.The top contenders for the deal include Lockheed’s F-21, Dassault Aviation’s Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon, Russian aircraft MiG 35 and Saab’s Gripen.The company said the F-15EX would be exhibited at the next edition of Aero India in Bengaluru beginning next week.Boeing also shared its 2021 growth strategy for the Indian market and exuded confidence in the fundamentals of India’s aviation and defence industry.The company reiterated its commitment to being trusted partners to the Indian armed forces and airline customers as the world weathers the challenges of the pandemic.“India’s aerospace industry is persevering through the global pandemic, which has brought significant challenges. The nation’s fundamental growth drivers remain resilient and robust, making India an attractive business destination globally, and Boeing is committed to the advancement of India’s aerospace industry,” said Salil Gupte, president, Boeing India.“We are excited about the potential for partnership and growth in India and look forward to the dialogue with our customers, partners and industry at Aero India 2021,” he said.The company said it would hold discussions with customers and industry partners about its range of capabilities in multi-role fighter aircraft, vertical lift platforms, aerial multi-role tankers, unmanned systems and commercial platforms, in addition to technologies, services, world-class sustainment and training capabilities.It said Boeing’s exhibit at Aero India themed ‘Building The Future Together’ would focus on its partnerships with India’s armed forces and highlighted the strategic investments the company had made to develop the country’s indigenous aerospace and defence ecosystem.“At the exhibit, Boeing will feature a range of advanced capabilities including the F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet, F-15EX, KC-46A, AH-64E Apache, P-8I, Chinook, 737-10 and 787-9,” it said.In his comments, Kanaglekar mentioned that Boeing discussed the advantages of the F/A-18 Block III offering for the Indian Navy.“The Super Hornet’s unique differentiators for the Indian Navy include its two-seater carrier-compatibility capability which provides operational flexibility, and opportunities to integrate future technologies related to manned-unmanned interface from aircraft carriers,” he said.“The F/A-18 Super Hornet recently successfully concluded ski-jump tests at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, demonstrating its compatibility with Indian Navy carriers,” Kanaglekar said.In addition, the company announced the Boeing India Repair Development and Sustainment (BIRDS) hub initiative that envisions a competitive MRO ecosystem for engineering, maintenance, skilling, repair and sustainment services of defence and commercial aircraft in India.It said the initiative is a first that will benefit Indian customers with best-in-class solutions, efficient turnaround times, and optimal economic value, all available in-country.

The administration will be responsible if something bad happens here. ‘Chalne do goli ab’. And one more thing, if we catch any BJP worker or MLA we, will keep them hostage here,” he added.“Look at the hooliganism now. We will thwart them. Let them shoot us. Keep sitting here and let the hangars run as usual,” he said.The political controversy was a running script from the stage as before Tikait, another BKU activist Dharmendra Malik first raised the issue of a BJP MLA and his people trying to create violence in Ghazipur.“All I want to say that both administration and the BJP people want to create violence here,” Malik said.“The BJP MLA is sitting down with his people and we know that some persons have come from Khoda as well. We will sort them out but the administration will be responsible if violence happens here,” he added.The farmers at the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh Ghazipur border had been sitting on protest against the three farm laws since November 26 last year, demanding the repeal of the three farm laws and ensuring the minimum support price (MSP) for their produce.Earlier in the day, there was heavy deployment of security personnel, comprising the Uttar Pradesh and Delhi Police, the Central Reserve Police Force and the Rapid Action Force at the Ghazipur protest site.Farmers have blocked the Delhi-Meerut highway from one side since November 26 last year.Rakesh Tikait, who has been named in the FIR by the Delhi Police in connection with the Republic Day violence also made a presence at the Ghazipur border, after going underground for last two days.A team of senior officials of the Ghaziabad police and administration also arrived at the Ghazipur border to apprehend him.BKU leader Rakesh Tikait dares police, says arrest farmers but stop trying to scare themRakesh Tikait today dared the police and local administration to come out clean with their intentions after water and electricity were cut at Ghazipur border.Addressing the farmers from the main stage, Tikait, who has also been named in the Delhi Police FIR for his role in the violence on Republic Day, said if the police had been told to arrest the leaders, they should do that rather than resorting to scare tactics. “There must be people from the intelligence and police here. I want to tell them that if your bosses have told you to take action against us, then please do arrest us,” Tikait said.“Trying to scare us by cutting off water and electricity will not scare us away. Please come to us and explain what is the plan of action from the administration. If they want us to vacate, they must tell us that, or if they want us to be arrested, please take us,” the BKU leader said.Tikait further said the administration played a part in trying to break the unity of unions by giving the fringe groups easy entry to the Red Fort.“How can anyone explain the number of people at a heavily-fortified place like the Red Fort. Then to break farmers and the Sikhs, a religious flag was unfurled there. The police have played a role in this controversy,” he said. — With IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plan-to-attack-farmers-bkus-rakesh-tikait-refuses-to-surrender-204574
29-01-2021||New Delhi||India has flattened its Covid graph; 146 districts have no new cases for 7 days: Vardhan||India has flattened its Covid graph and 146 districts have reported no new case of the viral disease in the last seven days, 18 in 14 days, six in 21 days and 21 districts in the last 28 days, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Thursday.This has been achieved due to pro-active testing with more than 19.5 crore Covid tests conducted in the country so far, Vardhan, who chaired the 23rd meeting of the high-level Group of Ministers (GoM) on Covid through video-conference, said, according to a statement issued by the health ministry.The current testing capacity is 12 lakh tests per day, the minister added."With the 'Whole-of-Government' and 'Whole-of-society' approach envisaged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has successfully contained the pandemic. Less than 12,000 cases were reported in the last 24 hours and the active caseload has reduced to just 1.73 lakh," he said.Also read: India carried out 5th highest no of COVID vaccination till Jan 26: GovtVardhan said a meagre 0.46 per cent of the 1.73 lakh active Covid cases is on ventilators, 2.2 per cent is in the ICU and 3.02 per cent is on oxygen support.The minister said 165 cases of a new UK variant of the virus had so far been reported in the country and the patients were kept under supervised quarantine and surveillance.India had flattened its Covid graph, he said.A total of 146 districts across the country had no new cases for the last seven days, 18 for the last 14 days, six for 21 days and 21 districts had not reported fresh cases of the coronavirus infection in the last 28 days, Vardhan said.The Health Minister mentioned that India had supported other countries with the supply of the Covid vaccines during this global public health crisis and trained the personnel of several nations in vaccine administration."By being a 'mitra' to the global community, India has earned global trust by supplying indigenously made vaccines at this crucial hour," he was quoted as saying in the statement.Dr Sujeet K Singh, Director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), presented a detailed report on the current and future scenario of Covid in India, drawing a comparison with the trajectory of the confirmed cases and growth rates of the viral disease in other countries.India had reported a seven-day growth rate of 0.9 per cent, amongst the lowest in the world, he said.Singh presented a granular analysis of the trajectory of the pandemic in India, pointing towards critical parameters like day-wise confirmed new cases with the growth rate, recovery rate, case-positivity rate, trend of active cases, concentration of cases in particular districts and other trends such as fatality and the spread of the new UK-variant cases across different states.India's Case Fatality Ratio is showing a declining trend from 3.4 per cent in mid-June 2020 to the current rate of 1.4 per cent due to effective clinical management, he said.The NCDC director said Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu had the highest recovery rate of 99.79 per cent, followed by Arunachal Pradesh (99.58 per cent) and Odisha (99.07 per cent), while Kerala had a recovery rate of 91.61 per cent because of its present high active caseload.He said that Mumbai, Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Kottayam and Kozhikode are the top five districts in the country currently in terms of reporting the highest number of active cases.Maharashtra and Kerala accounted for 70 per cent of the active cases in India at the moment, Singh said.He advised caution in the coming months, based on the nature of the transmission of the virus being witnessed in other countries and due to its mutant strain being reported throughout the world.Through a detailed presentation, Dr Vinod K Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog, and Rajesh Bhushan, Union Health Secretary, apprised the GoM of the progress of the development of vaccines in the country and the vaccination drive launched by the Prime Minister on January 16, the statement said.The health secretary showcased the logistics of the vaccination exercise and the gains made so far. He said over 1.12 crore doses of the vaccines were distributed among the states and Union territories within three days (from January 12-14) prior to the start of the exercise and an additional 1.15 crore doses were supplied to the states and Union territories by January 20.A total of 69,000 programme managers, 2.5 lakh vaccinators and 4.4 lakh other team members have been trained so far and 93,76,030 health-care workers and 53,94,098 frontline workers are now registered on the Co-WIN portal.Dr Paul said India currently occupied the sixth spot in the world in providing vaccination coverage and would move to the third place in the next few days.He said 16 AEFI hospitalisations out of 23 lakh vaccinations so far translate to just 0.0007 per cent with no case of severe or serious AEFI or death due to vaccination reported so far.The GoM also discussed issues regarding balancing domestic requirements vis-a-vis requests from other countries for Indian vaccines.The GoM meeting was joined by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State for Health Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai and Minister of State for Ports, Shipping and Waterways, and Chemical and Fertilisers Mansukh Mandaviya. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-has-flattened-its-covid-graph-146-districts-have-no-new-cases-for-7-days-vardhan-204557

29-01-2021||Satya Prakash||'You are not doing anything’: SC to govt on irresponsible TV news reporting||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 28Noting that certain contents aired by TV news channels have an “instigating effect”, the Supreme Court on Thursday said the Government wasn’t doing anything to check such reporting.“The fact of the matter is that there are programmes which have an instigating effect and you being the government is doing nothing about it… There are programmes which instigate or impact a community. But as a government, you do nothing,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.“Fair and truthful reporting is normally not a problem. Problem is when it is used to agitate others. It is as important as providing ‘lathis’ to policemen. It is an important preventive part of the law and order situation,” it said while hearing PILs filed by Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and Peace Party seeking directions to the Centre to stop dissemination of “fake news”.The petitioners have demanded strict action against TV channels for allegedly spreading communal hatred against Muslim by stating that Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi in March last year was responsible for spread of COVID19.Mehta pointed out that pre-censorship was not permissible. Self-regulatory bodies such as News Broadcasters Association and News Broadcasters Standards Authority (NBSA) had their own mechanism, he added.The top court – which had in November last year said that a statutory regime to regulate TV channels in India was needed as self-regulation by TV channels wasn’t good enough—asked the parties to file their affidavits in three weeks.During the hearing, the CCJI said, “Yesterday, you shut down the internet and mobile because of the farmers’ visit to Delhi…You have shut down internet mobile…These are problems that can arise anywhere. I don’t know what happened on the TV yesterday.”“People can say anything. We are on broadcast which can instigate and cause riots. There is loss of life. People say anything these days. There are situations which can destroy property, life,” the Bench said.“Control over some news is as important as some preventive measures that can check law and order situations. I don’t know why you are blind to this. I don’t mean anything offensive but you are doing nothing about it,” the CJI said.Wondering why a private body like NBSA should look into complaints against the media, the top court had earlier asked the Centre to create a mechanism to address grievances against fake news circulated by TV channels and media.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/you-are-not-doing-anything-sc-to-govt-on-irresponsible-tv-news-reporting-204543
29-01-2021||New Delhi||Jaishankar outlines eight broad principles for addressing strained India-China ties||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Thursday suggested three “mutuals” and eight broad propositions in order to bring back India-China ties.The minister gave no indication whether any of this was being discussed by the two nations.“The three mutuals – mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests – are determining factors. Any expectation that they can be brushed aside, and that life can carry on undisturbed despite the situation at the border, that is simply not realistic,’’ he said while delivering the keynote address at the 13th All India Conference of China Studies headed by former Indian envoy to China Ashok Kantha.Jaishankar also underlined the importance of stabilising the relationship through eight broad propositions. Most of them were mentioned in the five-point consensus reached by Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in September last year. Looking back, Indian officials say it was not implemented in letter and in spirit.Among Jaishankar’s fresh eight principles are: Agreements already reached must be adhered to in their entirety; the LAC must be strictly observed and respected; border area peace and tranquillity is the basis for development of relations in other domains; there should be a recognition that a multi-polar Asia is an essential constituent of a multipolar world; sensitivity cannot be one-sided; as rising powers, both will have aspirations and their pursuit cannot be ignored; management of differences is essential to ties; and, the two civilisational states must always take the long view.The minister said the Modi government had made efforts to reduce the infrastructure gap with China since 2014; he conceded that nevertheless, the infrastructure differential remained significant and, as India saw at Galwan Valley last year, consequential.These events have profoundly disturbed the relationship because they signalled a disregard for commitments. “Significantly, to date, we have yet to receive a credible explanation for the change in China’s stance or reasons for massing of troops in the border areas,” said India’s longest-serving ambassador to China.Jaishankar also recalled past instances of divergences such as the practice of stapled-visas, the reluctance to deal with some Army commands, the opposition to India’s membership of NSG and a permanent seat at UNSC. In trade, promises of market access did not match delivery; there was blocking of UN listing of Pakistani terrorists and violation of Indian sovereignty by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Even the border areas saw frictions on some occasions.The minister said he didn’t have a definitive answer to offer on immediate concerns or more distant prospects vis-a-vis China. But the development of our ties can only be based on mutuality. Discussions are under way through various mechanisms on disengagement at the border areas, but the policies must take into account the learnings of the last three decades, he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-outlines-eight-broad-principles-for-addressing-strained-india-china-ties-204529
29-01-2021||New Delhi||MHA asks police to issue look-out notices against farmer leaders named in FIRs||The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has asked Delhi Police to issue lookout notices against the farmer leaders who have been named in the multiple FIRs the police have registered in connection with the violence during tractor rally on January 26.A decision in this regard was taken after a high-level meeting in the MHA, where it was decided to direct Delhi Police to ask the accused farmer leaders to submit their passports, sources said.Showcause notices have also been served on the farmer leaders in which they have been asked to explain as to why action should not be taken against them when they have breached the agreement with Delhi Police for granting permission to hold the rally, sources said, adding that they had been told to respond within three days.Sources said the police had been asked to serve notices on all 37 farmer leaders, including Yogendra Yadav, Baldev Singh Sirsa, Darshan Pal, Rakesh Tikait, Medha Patkar and others, who had been named in the FIRs.Meanwhile, names of Punjabi actor-singer Deep Sidhu and gangster-turned-social activist Lakha Sidhana have been added to the FIR, which was registered in connection with the violence that took place at Red Fort, police said.In this case, the police have registered a case at Kotwali police station of North district under various sections of the IPC, including the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act and others, they said, adding that even the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act and the Arms Act had been invoked.‘Absolutely wrong’, says Punjab CM on issuance of lookout notices against farmer leadersTerming the issuance of lookout notices against farmer leaders as “absolutely wrong”, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday said treating the farmers as a flight risk was not only illogical but condemnable.“Where will they flee?” asked the chief minister, pointing out that most of them were small farmers with small land holdings and not big corporate raiders like Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi and Mehul Coksi, who had fled over the past few years after looting the country of billions of rupees.“You failed to stop these bigwigs but are now targetting these small farmers fighting for their survival,” said Capt Amarinder, urging the Centre to immediately direct the Delhi Police to withdraw the lookout notices.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mha-asks-police-to-issue-look-out-notices-against-farmer-leaders-named-in-firs-204526

A set of people with a premeditated motive of violence and with no links to Samyukta Kisan Morcha were allowed to enter the Red Fort and hoist a flag in a sacrilegious act. Delhi police sat pretty on chairs as people stormed the Red Fort. This was a colossal security lapse and Amit Shah must be sacked for it,” said Surjewala describing Shah as India’s “weakest” Home Minister.The Congress also drew parallels between the Red Fort violence and the Delhi riots that followed anti-CAA-NRC protests last year.“There is a pattern to the manner in which legitimate protests are discredited. It is for all to see,” the Congress said.OPPOSITION PARTIES BACK FARMERSCPM Polit Bureau: “We hail the farmers’ tractor parade and extend full support to the Samyukta Kisan Morcha’s decision to continue the peaceful struggle till these retrograde farm laws are repealed.”Mamata Banerjee: The government has treated the farmers with a casual attitude. It must repeal farm laws.Randeep Surjewala: The abiding message of the Republic Day events was that the Government must listen to the people, shun arrogance and rescind farm laws.Sharad Pawar: What happened in Delhi yesterday is the failure of the Centre.
