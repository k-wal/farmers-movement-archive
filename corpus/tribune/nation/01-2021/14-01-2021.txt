If the government allows people’s participation in the drafting of Bills, it would be able to make laws the way people want them to be,” he added.He also termed the Supreme Court’s stay to the implementation of the laws as a “moral defeat” of the government, and praised the farmers for protesting in a peaceful manner.“If the farmers carry on the agitation in a non-violent way, the government would not be able to do anything. The moment it turns violent, the government will crush it,” the Gandhian activist said.Hazare also said he does not see any immediate end to the impasse between the government and farmers as both sides are “adamant” on their stands. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hazare-writes-to-pm-to-launch-hunger-strike-on-farmers-issues-in-delhi-198474

It also came to our notice that the fraudsters were engaged in using illegal techniques like VoIP calling.”   The accused used to cheat those based in Spain by promising them services of Microsoft Corporation, he said.A raid was conducted at the call centre in Ashram where many people were engaged in making and receiving calls. One of the accused, Mohammad Tauqueer Kidwai, present at the spot, accepted that he was the owner of the call centre and also runs a property and a travel agency, the officer said.A case was registered and during the course of investigation, five email accounts, four laptops and 10 hard discs from 10 CPUs, which were being operated by the accused, were seized from the spot, he said.Ten other people also joined the investigation but they were released after notices were served to them to join the investigation in future if required, the police said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/4-held-in-delhi-for-duping-spanish-citizens-by-posing-as-microsoft-executives-police-198473

If the result comes on time, then we can start the treatment after the result. This will be free of cost and nothing will be charged from the patients. The machine will be installed in couple of days,” Sadiq said.The NGO had set up a medical camp at the Singhu border on November 30 last year.Sadiq said the number of patients with hypertension, diabetes and skin issues have also increased.“We are also giving the facility of physiotherapy for the last two days. The timing is from 10 am to 6 pm. We have two portable ECG machines and our volunteers go up to two kilometres to conduct the test,” Sadiq said.A lot of protesting farmers are coming to get their blood pressure and sugar levels checked.The camp also has a hospital with eight beds, he said.“We first installed waterproof tents. The temporary hospital in the medical camp was set up on January 6. We have eight beds as of now. We have attended around 50 patients with minor emergency.“The hospital works 24/7. Three doctors take the eight hour shift. Volunteer doctors also come here to do ‘sewa’ (service). We also have para-medical staff. We have two oxygen cylinders here with us,” he said.Sadiq said earlier they lost around six boxes of the medicines, but now due to the waterproof tents, the medicines and staff are safe.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are staying put at various border points of Delhi since late November last year to protest against recent farm laws of the Centre. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ngo-plans-to-install-blood-count-measurement-machine-to-help-farmers-protesting-at-singhu-198452

As soon as this is received from the Chinese authorities, the company is expected to initiate the process of crew change,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava at a media briefing here on Thursday.Great Eastern Shipping, the owners of MV Jag Anand, told the Government that it had decided to undertake the crew change in Chiba, Japan, where the ship will disembark 23 crew members and take on their replacement. The disembarking crew will be flown back to their home towns in India from Tokyo.The released ship was in anchorage since June 13 while MV Anastasia with 18 Indians is still stuck at Caofeidian anchorage since August 3.MEA said it was continuously following up the issue with Chinese authorities. Last week, Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri had spoken to the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister and got early approval for crew change of Indian seafarers aboard two ships.About six dozen ships carrying Australian coal and manned by foreign seafarers have been waiting outside Chinese ports since June last year. Beijing has refused to let them unload but importers and ship charterers want the ships to wait.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mea-bid-to-free-remaining-sailors-from-floating-prison-off-china-coast-198450

It asked the builder to refund the money in four weeks.“The Occupation Certificate is not available even as on date, which clearly amounts to deficiency of service. The allottees cannot be made to wait indefinitely for possession of the apartments allotted to them, nor can they be bound to take the apartments in Phase 1 of the project. The allottees have submitted that they have taken loans, and are paying high rates of interest to the tune of 7.9% etc. to the banks,” the top court noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/one-sided-unreasonable-clauses-in-apartment-buyers-agreement-amount-to-unfair-trade-practice-sc-198443

Naturally, we will have to discuss the issue as a party. I will discuss the same in detail with my key colleagues and take them into confidence,” Pawar said.“Further steps will be taken after knowing their views. We will do this as soon as possible, he added.Munde told reporters that Pawar and other leaders of the party will take a call on the issue of his resignation.Maharashtra NCP president and state minister Jayant Patil said Munde will not resign just because someone has made allegations, but asserted the issue will discussed inside the NCP and a decision will be taken based on facts.Talking to reporters, Jayant Patil said any conclusion should be reached only based on police probe outcome into the matter.The Water Resources Minister said so far there has been neither any discussion in the party over Munde’s resignation nor has the latter offered to resign.Munde was being blackmailed and he had made a complaint to the police. We should reach any conclusion based on the outcome of the police probe. We need not jump to a conclusion, Jayant Patil said.Jayant Patil said Munde had made a complaint about his alleged blackmailing by the woman at the Bandra police station, but the cops did not take appropriate action on the same.Hence, Munde had approached the Bombay High Court, Jayant Patil said.Now, the police should conduct an initial probe into the matter. I am sure you will take note if some woman is defaming a politician by levelling random allegations, he added.Seconding Pawar, Jayant Patil said the allegation against Munde is serious and added facts need to be checked.It is also not expected of the party to take any decision without verifying the truth if anyone levels allegation against someone, he said.Jayant Patil said the Shiv Sena-led government, of which the NCP is a key partner, is not interfering in the matter.The situation will definitely be reviewed inside the party. If need be, we will take appropriate positions based on facts at the level of the Chief Minister (Uddhav Thackeray), Jayant Patil said.It will not happen that he will resign just because someone has made allegations, he added.The 37-year-old woman, an aspiring singer, had said she wrote to the Mumbai police commissioner on January 10, stating that Munde repeatedly raped her in 2006. She also claimed that she approached the Oshiwara police here earlier but her complaint was ignored.Munde, an NCP leader from Beed district, has denied the allegations, claiming he is being blackmailed by the woman and her sister.Speaking to reporters separately, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut termed the issue involving Munde as personal and familial.I think we should leave it to Dhananjay Munde. It is completely his personal, familial matter. And he will find a way out of it, Raut said.He also said that the NCPs leadership is discerning and matured to take a call on the issue. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ncp-says-charges-against-munde-serious-bjp-seeks-resignation-198432

The apps that were found to violate our user safety policies were immediately removed from the Store, and we have asked the developers of the remaining identified apps to demonstrate that they comply with applicable local laws and regulations. Apps that fail to do so will be removed without further notice. In addition, we will continue to assist the law enforcement agencies in their investigation of this issue.”Sources in the police said their discussions with the Google, officials have been fruitful and Google is believed to have given instant loan apps five days to provide document/approval from NBFC/RBI/ authorities concerned to remain active on its Play Store.In a statement Google has said, “Providing a safe and secure experience across Google’s products is our top priority. Our global product policies are designed and implemented with this goal in mind, and we’re always working to improve our practices to enhance user safety.”Further, Google has said, all developers in the Play Store agree to the terms of Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement, which stipulates that apps must adhere to applicable rules and laws, including generally accepted practices and guidelines.

14-01-2021||New Delhi||Govt-farmers talks to take place as scheduled on Friday; Tomar says hopeful of positive discussion||Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday confirmed tomorrow’s talks with farmers as union leaders also said that they will be attending the meeting.The government’s ninth round of negotiations with protesting farmer unions will take place as scheduled on Friday and the Centre is hopeful of positive discussions, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said.“The government is ready to hold talks with farmers’ leaders with an open mind,” Tomar told reporters here.Clearing the confusion over the fate of the ninth round of talks, which was the only outcome in the last meeting on January 8, in the wake of the Supreme Court on January 11 appointing a four-member panel to resolve the impasse and a key member of the proposed committee subsequently recusing himself, Tomar said the talks between the government and the union representatives will take place as scheduled for 12 pm on January 15.The farmer unions have been maintaining that they were ready to attend the scheduled talks with the government, even as they have said they do not want to appear before the court-appointed panel and have also questioned its composition.Earlier in the day, Bhartiya Kisan Union president Bhupinder Singh Mann said he is recusing himself from the four-member committee.Farmer unions and opposition parties had called it a “pro-government” panel, insisting that its members have been in favour of the three laws in the past.Mann said he is thankful to the apex court for nominating him on the panel but would give up any position to prevent farmers’ interests from being compromised.“As a farmer myself and a union leader, in view of the prevailing sentiments and apprehensions amongst the farm unions and the public in general, I am ready to sacrifice any position offered or given to me so as to not compromise the interests of Punjab and farmers of the country,” he said in a statement.“I am recusing myself from the committee and I will always stand with my farmers and Punjab,” Mann added.The apex court had on Tuesday stayed the implementation of the three central laws till further orders and announced the formation of a committee to hear the grievances of the farmers and the opinion of the government.Apart from Mann, Shetkari Sanghatana (Maharashtra) president Anil Ghanwat, International Food Policy Research Institute’s Pramod Kumar Joshi and agriculture economist Ashok Gulati were appointed on the panel.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at the border of Delhi for several weeks, demanding the repeal of the laws they say will lead to the weakening of the minimum support price (MSP) system.The three contentious laws are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020. — With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-farmers-talks-to-take-place-as-scheduled-on-friday-tomar-says-hopeful-of-positive-discussion-198419

14-01-2021||New Delhi||Protesting farmer unions welcome Bhupinder Singh Mann's decision, but say will not accept any committee||Protesting farmer leaders welcomed Bhartiya Kisan Union president Bhupinder Singh Mann's decision on Thursday to recuse himself from a Supreme Court-appointed committee, and reiterated that they do not want any panel and will not settle for anything less than the repeal of the three contentious laws.They said the other three members of the committee should follow suit as the agitating unions had never demanded formation of any committee to resolve the impasse between farmers and the Centre over the new agri laws.Some leaders also invited Mann to join the agitation against the legislations.Mann said he is thankful to the apex court for nominating him on the panel but would give up any position to prevent farmers' interests from being compromised.Farmer unions and opposition parties had raised doubts over the composition of the panel, insisting that its members have been in favour of the three laws in the past."Mann's decision is a good step as there is no importance of any committee for farmer unions as it has not been our demand. Mann knew that no farmer union would appear before the court-appointed committee that's why he has taken this decision," farmer leader Gurnam Singh Chaduni told PTI.Chaduni is a senior member of the Sankyukt Kisan Moarch -- an umbrella body of around 40 protesting unions. He said that farmer leaders will not appear before the committee even if the rest three members also recuse themselves and new members are appointed.He asserted that farmers will not settle for anything less than the repeal of new agriculture laws.Another farmer leader, Abhimanyu Kohar, said that government knows that the court cannot repeal the laws and that it should stop playing with the sentiments of farmers who have been camping at several Delhi borders since November 28."This is a good thing that Mann has recused himself from the committee. Forming a committee is not a solution. The new farm laws have been enacted by Parliament and the court cannot do much. The government knows this that's why we are asking the government to repeal these three laws," Kohar said.Asked whether union leaders would attend the next round of talks with the government scheduled for Friday, he said that they are not against any dialogue and that they will hold talks with Union ministers.Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait also welcomed Mann's decision and invited him to join the ongoing agitation against the three laws.Sukhdev Singh, Punjab general secretary of BKU Ekta Ugrahan, said that they will accept any committee only if the government repeals the three farm laws first.Farmer leader Harinder Singh Lakhowal also said that they will not call off their protest until the government repeals these laws and gives a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops.Earlie this week, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the three central laws till further orders and announced the formation of the committee to hear the grievances of the farmers and the opinion of the government.Apart from Mann, Shetkari Sanghatana (Maharashtra) president Anil Ghanwat, International Food Policy Research Institute's Pramod Kumar Joshi and agriculture economist Ashok Gulati were appointed on the panel.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at several Delhi border points, demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and legal guarantee of minimum support price for their crops.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the MSP and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/protesting-farmer-unions-welcome-bhupinder-singh-manns-decision-but-say-will-not-accept-any-committee-198412
14-01-2021||New Delhi||2G scam: CBI commences fresh arguments in HC in appeal against acquittals||CBI commenced arguments afresh in the Delhi High Court on Thursday in its appeal against the acquittal of former telecom minister A Raja and others in the 2G spectrum allocation scam case.However, the arguments via video conferencing before Justice Yogesh Khanna had to be stopped after only a brief hearing due to connectivity issues.During the brief proceedings, advocate Vijay Aggarwal, appearing for some of the acquitted persons, told the high court that around 6,500 pages containing the final arguments of the accused and the CBI before the trial court were not found in the digital records supplied to him.The hearing will continue on Friday.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which had earlier concluded its submissions on the issue of ‘leave to appeal’, had to start arguing afresh due to change of judge.Leave to appeal is a formal permission granted by a court to a party to challenge a decision in a higher court.Earlier, the case was being heard on a day-to-day basis by Justice Brijesh Sethi, who retired on November 30 last year and had released the matter from his board on November 23, 2020 owing to paucity of time.Before demitting the office, Justice Sethi had decided various petitions and applications filed by the acquitted individuals and firms in the three cases, arising out of the 2G scam probe, lodged by CBI and ED.After finishing submissions in the CBI’s main case, the high court will take up the ED’s money laundering case in which also all the accused were acquitted by the special court.A special court had on December 21, 2017 acquitted Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and others in the CBI and the ED cases related to the scam.Besides Raja and Kanimozhi, the special court had acquitted former telecom secretary Siddharth Behura; Raja’s erstwhile private secretary R K Chandolia; Unitech Ltd MD Sanjay Chandra and three top executives of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (RADAG) -- Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair, in the 2G case filed by the CBI.Swan Telecom promoters Shahid Balwa and Vinod Goenka and directors of Kusegaon Fruits and Vegetables Pvt Ltd Asif Balwa and Rajiv Agarwal were also acquitted in the CBI case.The special court had also acquitted Swan Telecom (P) Ltd; Unitech Wireless (Tamil Nadu) Ltd; Reliance Telecom Ltd; film producer Karim Morani and Director of Kalaignar TV Sharad Kumar in the CBI case.On the same day, the special court also acquitted 19 accused, including Raja, Kanimozhi, DMK supremo M Karunanidhi’s wife Dayalu Ammal, Vinod Goenka, Asif Balwa, Karim Morani, P Amirtham and Sharad Kumar in the ED case.The special court had also acquitted Essar Group promoters Ravi Kant Ruia and Anshuman Ruia, Loop Telecom promoters I P Khaitan and Kiran Khaitan and four others in a separate case arising out of the 2G scam probe.On March 19, 2018, the ED approached the high court challenging the special court’s order acquitting all the accused.A day later, the CBI too challenged in the high court the acquittal of the accused in the case.

14-01-2021||New Delhi||Open to answering any queries from govt on privacy policy update: WhatsApp||Under fire over its recent privacy policy update, WhatsApp on Thursday said it is open to answering any questions from the government on the issue and is aware that the company will have to "compete" for users' trust with rivals such as Signal.In an interview to PTI, WhatsApp Head Will Cathcart said the Facebook-owned company remains committed to privacy and security of users across India and will continue to explain to users that their messages are end-to-end encrypted.Rival messaging platforms such as Signal and Telegram had seen phenomenal rise in downloads soon after WhatsApp sought user consent to its updated privacy policy that seeks to share some data with Facebook."We know we have to compete for users' trust when it comes to privacy and that's very good for the world. People should have choices in how they communicate and feel confident that no one else can see their chats," Cathcart said.Asked if WhatsApp had seen an exodus of users to rival apps like Signal and Telegram, Cathcart answered in negative."No. We're grateful that people continue to use and trust WhatsApp to communicate...We think competition on privacy is good because it will help make apps even more private and secure in the future,” he added.The comments come in the backdrop of a raging debate over WhatsApp's controversial update in its terms of service and privacy policy around how it processes user data and partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the social media giant's products.Asked if the government has sought clarification on the matter, Cathcart said: "We remain available to answer any questions and to explain our continued commitment to the privacy and security of users across India." According to sources, the government is examining and evaluating the recent privacy policy update announced by WhatsApp and discussions are on within the IT Ministry over the implications of the recent move by the messaging platform.In past years, WhatsApp has drawn flak from the government over misuse of the platform for the spread of misinformation. Since then, the Facebook-owned company has taken a number of steps to curb the spread of hate messages. Cathcart also noted that WhatsApp will also continue to “explain” to people and its partners how the platform protects the privacy and security of people's personal messages. He asserted that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can read users' messages or hear their calls with others on the messaging platform. He also clarified that the changes will not impact WhatsApp Payments as that has a separate privacy policy governing it.WhatsApp had informed users about the changes in its terms of service and public policy, through an in-app notification last week. Users have till February 8 to agree to the new terms in order to continue using the platform.This led to a user backlash and triggered memes on the internet over WhatsApp's alleged sharing of user information with Facebook. Many users have also started shifting to rival platforms, and apps like Telegram and Signal have seen millions of downloads globally in the immediate aftermath of the event.Cathcart argued that “some apps claim to have end-to-end encryption for group chats, and do no such thing”.He emphasised that WhatsApp's policy update does not affect the privacy of messages with friends or family in any way.“We're not keeping logs of who everyone in India is texting or calling. We do not share your contacts with Facebook or the other apps Facebook offers....You can download your account information right from WhatsApp to see for yourself the limited data we collect,” he added.Instead, this update includes changes related to messaging a business on WhatsApp, which is optional, and provides further transparency about how data is collected and used, he said."This has become all the more important over the last year with people needing to conduct commerce remotely," Cathcart said adding that WhatsApp works with Facebook to support millions of micro businesses around India.Cathcart further stated that the company is building new ways in the near term for people to shop on WhatsApp for businesses to manage and respond to messages.“When launched, this will be available to all, but it will be people's choice whether or not to choose to do so,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/open-to-answering-any-queries-from-govt-on-privacy-policy-update-whatsapp-198402

Prosecution also alleged that some content of the show was obscene even though minors were present in the audience.Accused's lawyer said allegations leveled against them were vague and the case was registered only due to political pressure.The police arrested the comedian and four others on January 1 on the complaint of Eklavya Singh Gaud (36), son of local BJP MLA Malini Laxman Singh Gaud.Gaud stated that he and his associates had gone to watch the programme but forced the organizers to stop it when some "indecent" comments were made against gods and goddesses and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.The accused were booked under IPC sections 295-A (outraging religious feelings) and 269 (unlawful or negligent act likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) and other relevant provisions.Later one more person was arrested for taking part in the program. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/comedian-munawar-faruqui-in-jail-for-two-weeks-moves-hc-for-bail-198399

He used to threaten and exploit them sexually, the SHO said, adding that teams of the cybercrime cell are looking into the matter in detail.To a question, Khan said it would be premature to link this case with the Irrigation Department junior engineer, who was arrested in November last year for alleged sexual exploitation of children and selling their videos and photographs of nefarious acts on dark net to paedophiles across the globe.The arrested junior engineer, a resident of Chitrakoot district, is alleged to have victimised about 50 children in the age group of 5-16 years in the districts of Chitrakoot, Banda and Hamirpur.According to police, they had seized a laptop, hard disk, sex toys, eight mobile phones, Rs 8 lakh in cash and other digital evidence carrying huge amount of child sexual abuse material from the engineer. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scanning-laptop-hard-disk-of-expelled-bjp-leader-held-for-sexual-abuse-of-children-police-198396

14-01-2021||New Delhi||MeToo: Ramani had no right to accuse me of sexual harassment as she had no proof, Akbar tells court||Former Union minister M J Akbar told a Delhi court on Thursday that journalist Priya Ramani had “no right” to accuse him of sexual misconduct that allegedly took place decades ago as she could not prove it.The remedy against misconduct at the workplace was always available and that Ramani’s accusation was not in good faith or the public interest, he said.Akbar made the submission before Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Kumar through senior advocate Geeta Luthra during the final hearing in a criminal complaint filed by him against Ramani for allegedly defaming him by accusing him of sexual misconduct more than 20 years ago when he was a journalist.Ramani had made an allegation against Akbar in the wake of #MeToo movement in 2018.“Ramani called Akbar media’s biggest predator. When you cast an aspersion on someone, you have to show evidence and what investigation you have done.“After 25-30 years, you don’t go to court. You say there was no law. What is this law which was not present since 1860,” Luthra asked.She said there was no evidence, proof or verification to what Ramani accused.“This witness (Ramani) has no truth. There is no evidence, proof or verification. Irresponsible statements like calling someone a predator was made,” she said.She added there were “thousands of tweets, reporting in newspapers, magazines. What could she have done more to damage my (Akbar) reputation? It came at no cost to her. The cost is to Akbar.”“For her, it was something said irresponsibly without good faith, due process. This is not in good faith. I can say it is not in the public interest. She has no basis to call him a predator,” she said.The counsel further said that Ramani maligned Akbar and her allegations spread like wildfire.“Remedy against misconduct at the workplace was always available. You cannot make allegations without due process after 2-3 decades. Because you cannot prove it and it’s false, you don’t have the right to do it.“Ramani maligned Akbar and her tweets and allegations spread like wildfire,” she said.The court will further hear the matter on January 18.Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani on October 15, 2018.He resigned as Union minister on October 17, 2018.Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as ‘media’s biggest predator’ that harmed his reputation.He has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment against the women who came forward during #MeToo campaign against him.Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar while they were working as journalists under him.He termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/metoo-ramani-had-no-right-to-accuse-me-of-sexual-harassment-as-she-had-no-proof-akbar-tells-court-198381

Our movement will continue till the government withdraws the farm laws," he told IANS.Also read:Tractor march from Delhi borders on January 26 to be peaceful, says RajewalBhupinder Mann recuses himself from SC panel on farm lawsSpeaking on the preparations for programmes planned by the farmers on January 26 on the occasion of Republic Day, Tikait said they have started procuring tricolours.He said that the farmers' organisations, led by Samkyukta Kisan Morcha, have decided to continue all the other previously announced programmes to intensify the movement, including taking out a parade across the country on Republic Day."Our preparations for the January 26 event are complete.

Amid growing criticism, including from his own union, BKU’s Bhupinder Singh Mann (one of the four experts nominated by the Supreme Court for negotiations with farmers protesting against the three farm laws) today recused himself from the committee.Meanwhile amid the growing social media buzz on unions “tractor parade” on the Republic Day, farmers’ leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said the January-26 plan will be revealed after the meeting with the Union ministers. He also urged everyone to maintain peace and harmony and not pay heed to “false and unfounded inflammatory propaganda and rumour mongering” on the tractor march to "malign and scuttle the movement".Even as Rajewal said unions will finalise the contours of January 26 tractor march after their meeting with Central ministers on Friday, BKU leader from Uttar Pradesh Rakesh Tikait announced the programme for the day saying that farmers will hold simultaneous parade from Red Fort to India Gate on the Republic Day.“The Republic Day Parade has been cut short, it will now be from Rashtrapati Bhawan to India Gate, I am told. We will march from Red Fort to India Gate and meet it there. It will be a historic event,” Tikait said in what is being seen as breaking ranks in the agitation.S. Bhupinder Singh Mann Ex MP and National President of BKU and Chairman of All India Kisan Coordination Committee has recused himself from the 4 member committee constituted by Hon'ble Supreme Court pic.twitter.com/pHZhKXcVdT  Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar expressed hope of positive discussions tomorrow.Clearing the confusion over the fate of tomorrow's meeting (the only outcome of the January-8 talks) after the SC ruling on Tuesday and Mann recusing from the court-appointed panel today, Tomar said the talks will be held as scheduled. While they have already specified that they will not appear before the court-appointed panel, farmer unions said they were ready to attend the scheduled talks with the government.In his statement, Mann said he was thankful to the Supreme Court for nominating him to the committee to start a dialogue with unions on the laws. However, as a farmer leader and union leader, “in view of the prevailing sentiments and apprehensions amongst the farm unions and public in general, I am ready to sacrifice any position offered or given to me so as to not compromise the interests of Punjab and farmers in the country, I am recusing myself from the committee and I will always stand with my farmers and Punjab,” Mann said after the union he headed also distanced itself from him.After being selected by the SC, he had urged everyone to put forward their views before the panel.Union leaders claimed others on the panel will "also resign soon".Rajewal said efforts were being made to malign the agitation through ‘dushprachar’ (false propaganda). “The whole world is watching. This is not just a farmers' movement. It has become a mass movement across the country. A movement is successful only when it is completely peaceful, if there is violence it collapses."Misconceptions/false inflammatory propaganda are being spread about the 26 January movement. Some people are saying that the national flag should be hoisted at the Red Fort, some are saying the Parliament will be stormed,” he said, accusing “anti-farmer forces and government agencies” of trying to malign and scuttle the peaceful agitation of farmers and common people. Urging everyone to maintain peace and calm, he told the farmers that the tractor march will be “from” Delhi borders. The exact outline of the programme for January 26 will be given after tomorrow's meeting.Also read:Tractor march from Delhi borders on January 26 to be peaceful, says RajewalIf govts can last 5 years, so can farmers' protest, says BKU leader TikaitProtesting farmer unions welcome Bhupinder Singh Mann's decision, but say will not accept any committee||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-farmers-talks-ahead-of-ninth-round-mann-recuses-himself-from-sc-appointed-committee-198375

He said since his earnings came down due to the lockdown, he sought a moratorium on loan repayment.According to the complainant, in November last year, a person called him and offered to settle his dues worth Rs 34,000 for Rs 17,500. After the complainant agreed, the caller sent a person to his house to collect the amount.Later, the complainant asked the caller to help in settling his another outstanding loan of Rs 1.4 lakh. The caller offered to settle it for for Rs 21,700.Subsequently, he sent another person to the complainant’s house to collect the cash, the official said.However, last month, a representative of a financial company from where the complainant had taken loan came to his house to ask for the dues.The complainant showed him the settlement letter and it was later found later that he was duped by fraudsters, the official said. Later, the police managed to nab one of the accused who had collected money from the complainant, he said.Based on information provided by the accused, the police raided the call centre and nabbed 10 other people, the official said.A case has been registered against the accused under relevant sections, the police added.

14-01-2021||New Delhi||Govt examining WhatsApp’s user policy changes amid privacy debate||The government is examining and evaluating the recent privacy policy update announced by WhatsApp, amid an outcry over the controversial changes linking data of WhatsApp users to Facebook’s other products and services, according to sources.Internal discussions are on within the IT Ministry over the implications of the recent move by the Facebook-owned messaging platform, they said.The issue needs to be looked at, in detail, given that concerns have been raised by a large section of users, including some top business leaders, they added.WhatsApp, which has over 400 million users in India, counts the country among its biggest markets globally.Sources further said that WhatsApp’s policy update would also be evaluated in the context of the current legal framework.While the IT Ministry has not yet approached WhatsApp seeking an explanation on the matter, a decision on the same is likely to be taken soon.Also read: Open to answering any queries from govt on privacy policy update: WhatsAppThe development comes amid a raging debate over WhatsApp’s controversial update in its terms of service and privacy policy around how it processes user data and partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the social media giant’s products.WhatsApp had informed users about these changes through an in-app notification, last week. It said users would have to agree to the new terms and policy by February 8, in order to continue using the platform.This led to a user backlash and triggered memes on the internet over WhatsApp’s alleged sharing of user information with Facebook. Many users have also started shifting to rival platforms such as Telegram and Signal, and these platforms have seen millions of downloads globally in the immediate aftermath of the event.While many tech leaders — namely Elon Musk — advocated using other platforms such as Signal, in India too, a number of business leaders, including Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma and PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam spoke of moving to rival platforms.Mahindra said he had installed Signal while Nigam said he had moved 1,000-plus ‘PhonePe-rs’ to Signal, and recreated all his workgroups and moved family groups.Paytm’s Sharma, who has in the past too questioned the rising clout and practices of foreign big-tech companies, had recently tweeted: “How long we will be taken for granted by such blatant double standards ? Self claimed ad claiming respect of our privacy v/s actual policy.”In the tweet, Sharma had shared a picture of WhatsApp ads in Indian dailies alongside a foreign media report that quoted WhatsApp as saying that European users do not have to share data with Facebook.Amid the public furore, WhatsApp, on its part, has sought to assuage users’ concerns saying its latest policy update does not affect the privacy of messages on the platform.In a blogpost earlier this week, WhatsApp emphasised that it did not share users’ contact lists or data of groups with Facebook for advertisement purposes. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-examining-whatsapps-user-policy-changes-amid-privacy-debate-198366

The letter has questioned him as to why the state government has not passed legislation against the farm laws when five non-BJP ruled states had already done so.Requesting the summoning of a special Vidhan Sabha session to bring in legislation against the national farm bill, Vikramarka cautioned KCR that his party would lose the support of the farmers in case he did not do so. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, he said, had already collected signatures of 2 crore people against the three farm bills.In November 2020, Vikramarka had organized a mega tractor rally at Khammam, involving scores of farmers, to protest against union government.In December 2020, Vikramarka held a protest (Raytu Kavatu) against the new farm bills and raised voice against KCR.Recently, Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka also organized a relay fast at Indira Park in Hyderabad to “expose KCR who had taken U-turn on New farm billsHe has already announced a statewide Program Raytutho mukhamukhi (Direct interaction with farmers’).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-leader-accuses-trs-of-u-turn-on-farm-laws-198363
14-01-2021||New Delhi||Modi to launch Covid vaccination drive on January 16||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch the rollout of India’s COVID-19 vaccination programme on January 16, the Union Health Ministry said on Thursday.He is likely to interact via video link with some healthcare workers from across the country, who will be receiving the shots on the first day, according to sources.Modi is also likely to launch the Co-WIN (COVID Vaccine Intelligence Network) App, a digital platform created for real-time monitoring of COVID-19 vaccine delivery and distribution, they said.The Health Ministry said: “The massive countrywide COVID-19 vaccination drive will be rolled out by Prime Minister from January 16. This would be the world’s largest immunisation exercise. Therefore, it has been decided by the Ministry of Health in consultation with the office of the President of India to reschedule the Polio vaccination day, also known as the National Immunisation Day (NID) or ‘Ravivar’ to 31st January.”A limited number of sites out of the 2,934 inoculation sites have been shortlisted from where the beneficiaries can interact with the Prime Minister and the authorities in those centres have been asked to make provisions for IT infrastructure for providing a two-way interactive communication facility to enable it to link and interact with the national launch site through a video link, they have said.Officials at New Delhi’s AIIMS and Safdarjung hospitals, which are among the shortlisted facilities, said they were “ready for a two-way communication”.Around three lakh healthcare workers will get vaccine shots at 2,934 sites across the country on the first day of the massive nationwide COVID-19 vaccination drive, a senior official said.Each vaccination session will cater to a maximum of 100 beneficiaries.According to the guidelines issued to the shortlisted vaccination centres, healthcare workers (those registered in Co-WIN to be vaccinated) on the launch shall include not only doctors, nurses but also nursing orderlies, safai karamcharis, ambulance drivers, and would be from a mixed age group, including above 50 years.The full initial procurement of 1.65 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccines — Covishield and Covaxin — has been allocated to all states and UTs in proportion to their healthcare workers database.“Therefore, there is no question of discrimination against any state in the allocation of vaccination doses. This is the initial lot of supply of vaccine doses and would be continuously replenished in the weeks to come. Therefore, any apprehension being expressed on account of deficient supply is totally baseless and unfounded,” the Ministry said on Thursday.States have been advised to organise vaccination sessions, taking into account 10 per cent reserve/wastage doses and an average of 100 vaccinations per session per day.Therefore, any undue haste on the parts of the states to organise unreasonable numbers of vaccination per site per day was not advised, the Ministry had said on Wednesday.The states and UTs have also been advised to increase the number of vaccination session sites that would be operational every day in a progressive manner as the vaccination process stabilises and moves forward.According to the government, the shots will be offered first to an estimated one crore healthcare workers and around two crore frontline workers, and then to persons above 50 years of age, followed by persons younger than 50 years of age with associated comorbidities.The cost of vaccination of healthcare and frontline workers will be borne by the Central Government.

14-01-2021||Madurai||Rahul Gandhi watches jallikattu in Tamil Nadu; says it's a message to Centre||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday watched the bull taming sport jallikattu here, noting the animals were not getting injured as was being made out and said his visit was a message to the Centre that wants to "suppress" the Tamil culture.The BJP ridiculed Gandhi for his 'hypocrisy' by witnessing jallikattu and praising the sport, reminding that the Congress-led UPA had banned it in 2011.Sharpening his attack against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the NDA government over the three contentious farm laws which have put farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana on the warpath, he accused the government of "conspiring to destroy" peasants to benefit a select few businessmen.Flanked by senior Congress leaders KC Venugopal, Puducherry Chief Minister V Narayanasamy and TNCC President K S Alagiri, Gandhi witnessed jallikattu at Avaniapuram here and said his visit was aimed at sending out a message to "those who think they can run roughshod on Tamil people."The former party president was joined by DMK Youth Wing Secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin on the dais.Jallikattu is held in the state, especially with much vigour in this district, coinciding with the Tamil harvest festival Pongal which heralds the auspicious Tamil month Thai."One of the main reasons I came is, today the government in Delhi is under the impression that they can destroy the cultures of this country. They believe that they can suppress the emotions of Tamil people, they believe they can crush the language of the Tamil people, they can suppress the spirit of the Tamil people.""I came to give them a message that nobody can suppress the Tamil spirit," he told reporters at the airport here before returning to Delhi.After witnessing jallikattu he got a sense of why Tamil people appreciate it, Gandhi said."There was a sense. Many people had mentioned to me that jallikatu is harmful to the bulls. I witnessed it today, and I must say that the way it was done there was absolutely no chance of the bull getting injured.""In fact if it was anyone to get injured it was the young men doing jallikattu. I am happy to say that there have been some changes to make it safer for everybody," he said.Gandhi further said he flew down from Delhi to watch the hugely popular event "because I think Tamil culture, Tamil language (and) Tamil history are essential for the future of India and need to be respected by everybody." The Tamil spirit cannot be crushed, he said, adding he was 'completely' against the idea of one particular idea, language and notion."There are many different languages, ideas and all these contribute to our strength and that is my message," he said.However, the BJP lashed out at the Congress leader over his visit to the temple town today.Party national general secretary and Tamil Nadu in-charge, C T Ravi accused Gandhi of insulting Tamil 'makkal' (people) on jallikattu with his hypocrisy.Taking a dig at Rahul's visit to Avaniyapuram, Ravi made a referrence to the UPA government banning the sport by adding bulls in the list of performing animals."Dear @RahulGandhi, Your Govt in 2011 labelled #Jallikattu as cruel & barbaric. Your Party manifesto supported ban on Jallikattu. Today, you are in Tamil Nadu to watch this traditional sport live. Aren't you insulting lovely Tamil Makkal with your hypocrisy? Happy Pongal," Ravi said in a tweet.Hitting out at the Centre on the contentious farm laws, Gandhi alleged that the government was "conspiring to destroy" the ryots and asserted that his party will stand with them."The government is not just neglecting them (farmers), the government is conspiring to destroy them. There is a difference. Neglecting is ignoring...they are not ignoring them," he said in response to a query."They are trying to destroy them, because they want to benefit two or three of their friends. They want to give what belongs to the farmer to two or three of their friends," he alleged."You are suppressing the farmers (and) helping a handful of businesses," he said.Extending his party's support to the farmers, Gandhi said the laws will indeed be repealed."Mark my words…these laws-- the government will be forced to take them back," he said, adding he was "proud" of what the farmers were doing (protesting against the laws).Charging Narendra Modi with "not supporting" the common man during the coronavirus pandemic, Gandhi asked "whose Prime Minister are you?""Are you the Prime Minister of the people of India or the Prime Minster of two-three selected businessmen?" he asked.He also sought to know why Modi was "silent" on the months long Sino-India standoff, asking "why are the Chinese people sitting inside Indian territory."Earlier, Gandhi attended the Pongal celebrations with people of Thenpalanji village in the district and also had food with them. He took photos with local youth and interacted with some elderly people. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-gandhi-watches-jallikattu-in-tamil-nadu-says-its-a-message-to-centre-198357

14-01-2021||New Delhi||Effectiveness of India's maritime preparedness tested in two-day mega exercise||India's preparedness to deal with all possible challenges in the maritime domain, including contingencies from peace to war-time, was tested in a two-day multi-agency military exercise that covered the 7,516 km-long coastline and exclusive economic zone, officials said on Thursday.The second edition of exercise 'Sea Vigil', which concluded on Wednesday evening, particularly focused on the efficacy of the measures initiated to plug gaps in the coastal security set up following the Mumbai terror attack in 2008, they said.The Indian Navy said the "envisaged objectives" of the exercise were met by the whole-hearted participation of all stakeholders.The exercise involved deployment of the entire coastal security apparatus and more than 110 surface assets of the Indian Navy and the Coast Guard participated in the exercise that was billed as India's largest coastal defence drill, the officials said."The conceptual and geographical expanse of Sea Vigil included the entire coastline and exclusive economic zone of the country and contingencies from peace to war-time were exercised. In addition, mitigation measures, on shore, in case of any breach in coastal security were also validated," the Navy said in a statement.The Indian Navy and the Coast Guard have taken a series of measures to bolster India's coastal security after the Mumbai terror attack in which over 166 people, including 28 foreigners from 10 nations, were killed by a group of Pakistani terrorists.The group of 10 Pakistani terrorists carried out the coordinated attack on a railway station, two luxury hotels and a Jewish centre on November 26, 2008, after they sneaked into India's financial capital using a route in the Arabian Sea.The inaugural edition of the Sea Vigil exercise took place in January 2019.In addition to assets of the Indian Navy, a large number of platforms of the Marine Police and the Customs Department were also deployed during the second edition of the mega drill."The entire coastline was kept under surveillance by the Indian Navy and Coast Guard aircraft, and helicopters were also pressed into service to reinforce special operations personnel operating onboard offshore platforms," the Navy said.It said the security mechanism of ports was validated and their crisis management plans were assessed to tackle emergencies. State police teams, Indian Navy Marine Commandos and Commandos from the National Security Guard carried out drills to tackle possible acts of "maritime terrorism", the Navy said."This exercise also validated the technical surveillance infrastructure called the National Command, Control, Communication and Intelligence (NC3I) Network. The Information Management and Analysis Centre (IMAC) at Gurugram and its various nodes across Indian Navy and Coast Guard stations were exercised for coordinating the surveillance and information dissemination mechanism," the Navy said.It said the cooperation and coordination among various agencies involved in the maritime domain is a "reassuring sign" of progress made in the realm of coastal defence."The exercise would go a long way in enhancing coastal defence and national security in the maritime domain," the Navy said.The Sea Vigil exercise took place at a time when India and China are locked in a bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh.In sync with the national security doctrine, the Indian Navy significantly increased its deployment of warships, submarines and other assets in the Indian Ocean Region, in an attempt to send across a message to China that Indian armed forces are fully prepared to deal with any challenge. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/effectiveness-of-indias-maritime-preparedness-tested-in-two-day-mega-exercise-198343

14-01-2021||London||Bengaluru world’s fastest-growing tech hub: Report||Bengaluru has emerged as the world’s fastest-growing mature tech ecosystem in the world since 2016, followed by the European cities of London, Munich, Berlin and Paris, with India’s financial centre of Mumbai in sixth place, according to new research released in London on Thursday.Dealroom. co data analysed by London & Partners – the Mayor of London’s international trade and investment agency – reveals that investment in the Karnataka capital of Bengaluru grew 5.4 times from USD 1.3 billion in 2016 to USD 7.2 billion in 2020, with the Maharashtra capital of Mumbai growing 1.7 times from USD 0.7 billion to USD 1.2 billion in the same period.The UK capital of London registered an impressive three times growth between 2016 and 2020, rising from USD 3.5 billion to USD 10.5 billion.“It’s fantastic to see that Bengaluru and London ranked as the top two fastest-growing global tech hubs for VC investment. Our two great cities share mutual strengths in entrepreneurship and innovation – creating lots of opportunities for tech investors and companies to do business across both regions,” said Hemin Bharucha, Chief Representative of India at London & Partners.“London has a strong trade and investment relationship with cities across India and today’s figures show the opportunities for future partnerships between UK and India on technology. Despite the pandemic, tech companies in London and India are continuing to lead the way in creating game-changing technologies – especially in high growth sectors such as EdTech and Fintech,” he said.“The UK government’s recent Brexit deal with the European Union brings certainty for Indian companies and investors looking to London and we look forward to welcoming more Indian businesses to the UK capital in the years ahead,” he added.Bengaluru is also ranked sixth for the world’s tech venture capitalist (VC) investments, on a global list topped by Beijing and San Francisco, New York, Shanghai and London making up the top five. Mumbai comes in at No. 21 in the worldwide ranking, with Boston and Singapore among the other high-ranking cities.Skillmine, a Bengaluru-headquartered tech company offering new generation IT consulting and managed services which expanded to London last year, highlighted access to “like-minded tech entrepreneurs alongside a deep tech talent pool” as the highlight of what has been referred to as India’s Silicon Valley in the past.“It has been exciting to be part of Bengaluru’s emergence as a world-class tech hub. From here we expanded our business operations into London in May last year, as well as into the Middle East and America markets. London is a global tech hub with access to a thriving tech talent pool alongside growth capital and a wide customer base. We are excited to grow our business in the city,” said Anant Agarwal, Managing Director, Skillmine.Behind Bengaluru and London, the other fast-growing tech hubs include the two German cities of Munich and Berlin and the French capital of Paris, all three more than doubling their investments in the 2016-2020 period. The UK capital, however, cemented its status as Europe’s leading tech hub – with London companies receiving over three times the amount of investment than any other European tech city.“London is the global tech capital of Europe. Despite the challenges brought about by Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic, London’s tech sector continued to thrive in 2020 and has an important role to play in the city’s economic recovery. London is already home to some of the world’s best technology companies and will remain open to international investment and tech talent from all over the world,” said London Mayor Sadiq Khan.Despite the global pandemic and the UK’s exit from the EU, London tech firms raised USD 10.5 billion in 2020 – significantly more than the total amount raised in 2017 (USD 7 billion) and 2018 (USD 5.9 billion) and close to the record in 2019 (USD 10.7 billion).“It’s brilliant to see how resilient London’s tech sector has been, despite all the challenges of 2020. International investors have shown real confidence in London, with new venture capital funds setting up here to invest in high-growth companies in sectors like fintech, cybersecurity and health tech. This is because London continues to be the gateway to the European market and a fantastic place to set up and scale a tech company,” said Laura Citron, CEO of London & Partners.The new research from Dealroom. co and L&P also reveal that mega funding rounds for London-based tech companies increased VC investment levels for UK tech in 2020, with British tech firms raising a record USD 15 billion in 2020. Additional findings show that London is now home to 1,252 VC firms – more than any other European city.Following the outbreak of the global pandemic and an increase in remote working in 2020, enterprise software technologies emerged as a top sector for VC investors.London saw an 82 per cent increase in enterprise software investments last year, with the UK capital’s firms raising a total of USD 1.9 billion.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bengaluru-worlds-fastest-growing-tech-hub-report-198312

14-01-2021||New Delhi||3 lakh health-care workers to get Covid vaccine on day 1 of inoculation drive||Around 3 lakh health-care workers will be inoculated at 2,934 sites across the country on the first day of the massive nationwide COVID-19 vaccination drive which is set to begin from January 16, official sources said.Each vaccination session will cater to a maximum of 100 beneficiaries and the Union Health Ministry has advised states not to organise “unreasonable numbers of vaccination per site per day”.“States have been advised to organise vaccination sessions taking into account 10 per cent reserve/wastage doses and an average of 100 vaccinations per session each day.“Therefore, any undue haste on the part of states to organise unreasonable numbers of vaccination per site per day is not advised,” the ministry said on Wednesday. It also said that states and UTs have also been advised to increase the number of vaccination session sites that would be operational every day in a progressive manner as the vaccination process stabilises and moves forward.“Around 3 lakh frontline healthcare workers will be inoculated at 2,934 sites across the country on the first day of January 16,” a source said.The government on Tuesday hinted that vaccine recipients, for now, will not have the option to choose from the two vaccines—Oxford COVID-19 vaccine, Covishield, manufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII) and indigenously developed Covaxin of Bharat Biotech—that have been approved for restricted emergency use in India.According to the Health Ministry getting vaccinated for COVID-19 will be voluntary. Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan had said on Tuesday, “At many places in the world more than one vaccine is being administered. But, presently, in no country vaccine recipients have the option of choosing the shots.”        According to the government, the shots will be offered first to an estimated one crore healthcare workers, and around two crore frontline workers, and then to persons above 50 years of age, followed by persons younger than 50 years of age with associated comorbidities. The cost of vaccination of healthcare and frontline workers will be borne by the central government, officials had said.All 1.65 crore doses of COVID-19 vaccines—1.1 crore of Covishield and 55 lakh of Covaxin—procured by the Centre have been allocated to all states and UTs in proportion to their healthcare workers database, it said.According to official sources, most of the 1.1 crore Covishield doses from Pune-based SII have been shipped to 60 consignee points across India from where they will be sent to smaller centres.Of the 55 lakh doses of indigenously developed Covaxin of Bharat Biotech ordered by the Centre, the first tranche of 2.4 lakh doses has been dispatched to 12 states.Covaxin has been sent to 12 sites—one each in Ganavaram, Guwahati, Patna, Delhi, Kurukshetra, Bengaluru, Pune, Bhubaneswar, Jaipur, Chennai, Lucknow and Hyderabad, an official source said.Covaxin has been developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Health Ministry officials said that there will be a gap of 28 days between two doses of COVID-19 vaccines and its effectiveness can be seen only after 14 days, and urged people to keep following COVID appropriate behaviour.The ministry, which has listed series of frequently asked questions (FAQs) on COVID-19 vaccine, also stated that it was advisable to receive a complete schedule of the anti-coronavirus vaccine irrespective of the past history of coronavirus infection as this will help in developing a strong immune response against the disease. On whether a person with an active COVID-19 infection is vaccinated, AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria said a person with active and symptomatic COVID-19 infection may increase the risk of spreading the same to others at the vaccination site and thus infected individuals should defer vaccination for at least 14 days after the symptoms are resolved.Elaborating on the possible side-effects of COVID-19 vaccine, Guleria said that as is true for other vaccines, some will have some degree of side effects in some individuals which could be in form of mild fever, pain at the site of injection, body ache, etc.States have been asked to making arrangements to deal with any COVID-19 vaccine-related side effects as one of the measures towards safe vaccine delivery.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/3-lakh-health-care-workers-to-get-covid-vaccine-on-day-1-of-inoculation-drive-198306

14-01-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||India, Taiwan to ink labour mobility pact||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 13India and Taiwan are negotiating a labour mobility pact that will institutionalise the movement of professionals from here to Taipei, said sources.With falling demographics like its East Asian peers Japan and South Korea – Taiwan last year recorded more deaths than births – India senses an opportunity to make the island nation a destination for its skilled workers. “We are looking at every sector,’’ said the sources.India needs to move fastSources said India will have to move fast on a labour mobility pact because Taiwan has already signed one with Malaysia but has not activated it.Taiwan currently employs about 7 lakh foreign workers and feels the need for more. There are 10,000 Indians living in Taiwan, the biggest group being of students.There are also several very rich Indians based in Taiwan with business in gems and jewellery but the labour mobility pact would ensure many more could become expatriates in a country that by law prohibits different wage scales for local and foreign workers. With a minimum pay of $24,000 annually, Taiwan is an attractive destination for Indian workers, said the sources.Thailand, which began sending workers to Taiwan 20 years ago, and Vietnam have an advantage because of their huge ethnic Chinese community. As a result, there are no language barriers. After the Galwan clash, the die has been cast for a prolonged chill in Sino-Indian ties, giving the idea a second life. But the mobility of Indian workers to Taiwan could run aground on the language issue as there are a few Mandarin speakers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-taiwan-to-ink-labour-mobility-pact-198271

The organization aims to achieve its goals by persuading the government and other stakeholders to establish frameworks that honour Indian values.India’s school textbook revision is under discussion of the new NCF expected this year.The Education Ministry has said that the new NCF will entail a review of school textbooks and the process is underway.“The new National Curriculum Framework for School Education has been initiated.  NCERT will be expected to make changes in the textbooks in accordance with the new NCF.  Subject experts will initiate this process for school education, and give interim reports. While redesigning textbooks, it is to be ensured that nothing but the core content is placed in textbooks and cognitive load is decreased.

Kumar said the “benign and well-meaning intervention” by the Supreme Court to resolve the crisis was unlikely to end the stalemate as the committee set up by it comprised members who generally supported the laws. “The court’s order could result in prolonging the agitation given the public reaction of the farmers’ representatives,” he said.Bar Council of India chairman Manan Kumar Mishra, however, said, “There’s nothing political about it. The SC is examining the three farm laws. It has stayed the implementation of the laws.”Asked about setting up a four-member panel to talk to farmers’ organisations, Mishra said, “It’s aimed at getting the farmers views before the validity of the farm laws under challenge is decided.”While staying the three farm laws, an SC Bench had on Tuesday appointed a four-member committee to talk to farmers’bodies and file a report in two months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/experts-question-mediation-attempt-of-sc-over-impasse-198263

In a unanimous verdict, a five-judge Constitution Bench, headed by then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, had said the 158-year-old Victorian era law was “manifestly arbitrary” and violated a woman’s right to equality and right to non-discrimination guaranteed under Article 14 and Article 15 of the Constitution as it treated them as chattels. The top court had, however, said adultery would be a ground for divorce in matrimonial proceedings and cautioned that the verdict should not be taken as a licence to indulge in such acts.Striking down the adultery law, the top court had said, “This (Section 497 IPC) treats the woman as a chattel. It treats her as the property of man and totally subservient to the will of the master. It is a reflection of the social dominance that was prevalent when the penal provision was drafted.”“The enforcement of forced female fidelity by curtailing sexual autonomy is an affront to the fundamental right to dignity and equality,” said the top court. It treated a married woman as a property of the husband,” the Bench had said.It had said, “In treating a woman as chattel for the purposes of this provision, it is clear that such provision discriminates against women on grounds of sex only, and must be struck down on this ground as well.”Issue referred to Constitution Bench||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-decriminalise-adultery-in-armed-forces-centre-to-sc-198262

"We urge India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, maintain ceasefire on the LoC and to improve communications. We welcome India’s commitment to social and economic development of Kashmir and seek further details of their plans,” said Buckland."We continue to talk frankly to India about our human rights concerns and call for all remaining restrictions to be lifted as soon as possible."The minister's disclosure that Johnson had been talking to PMs Modi and Imran Khan came hours after Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla seemed to disapprove of countries taking up matters in other nations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/allow-team-to-visit-kashmir-valley-for-first-hand-assessment-of-situation-uk-minister-198225

Subheg Singh (23), one of the members of the club, said: “While we were busy supplying essential items to the protest sites on Delhi borders, we observed that farmers, especially the elderly, were having a hard time in finding locations. We then decided to have a map that could help protesters reach specific points.“The map will also come in handy if there’s a medical emergency. For instance, if somebody suffers cardiac arrest then the initial few minutes are crucial. If the location for first aid and immediate medical support at the protest site is known, it can prove to be a life-saver.”Several club members contributed to the project by sharing information among other technical details with the cartographer to ensure accuracy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-tikri-facilities-mapped-out-for-protesting-farmers-198222

14-01-2021||Geetanjali Gayatri||Despite casualties, farmers won’t give in||Tribune News ServiceSonepat, January 13As farmers complete 50 days of their agitation at Delhi’s entry points tomorrow, their struggle against the three central laws seems to be far from over despite several rounds of negotiations with the government and the Supreme Court taking it upon itself to break the impasse.Chilled to the bone in freezing cold, they have seen it all—mornings of despair as farmers died in sleep and evenings of hope on the eve of talks. The Delhi ice, however, has shown no sign of thaw and the powers that be not warming up to them.Protesters unsure of what they wantIt is good the Supreme Court has stayed the laws. Farmers are not willing to come to a consensus even after many rounds of talks. They do not even know what they want. — Hema Malini, BJP MPAfter pushing their way through the first barricade on November 26 last year, the farmers appear to have adapted well to living by the roadside — not letting their anger out despite the hardships, says a farmer leader.Bharatiya Kisan Union Haryana chief Gurnam Singh Charuni alleges the government is barbaric to let farmers suffer in harsh winter and go about its business with such “indifference” even as casualties among the protesters continue to rise.“The Centre, more specifically the BJP, is insensitive to the plight of the farmers. We complete 50 days tomorrow. But the way things are moving, it could be 50 more days—or even months. We started out on November 26 with the sole motive of getting the laws repealed and were hopeful of returning home in a couple of days. Nobody ever thought a government could be so harsh that it will leave its farmers die out in the cold. But struggles do take time. There are no shortcuts to victory,” says Charuni.Facing heat, Haryana Deputy CM Dushyant calls on PMUnder pressure, Haryana Deputy CM Dushyant Singh Chautala on Wednesday called on PM Modi. Sources said the two discussed the prevailing political and law and order situation in Haryana vis-à-vis farmers’ agitation. Chautala apprised the PM of his meeting with JJP MLAs on Tuesday and the feedback he got from them on the need for reforms. TNSAt Singhu, the count of protesters has been steadily rising. A large number of women, children and elderly are among those camping endlessly, with some families making this Haryana-Delhi border as their makeshift home. Open kitchens have slowly made way for tin sheds covered with tarpaulins while trailers have doubled up as multi-purpose rooms. There is no dearth of food and other essentials.Union leader Baldev Singh Sirsa says they have several “achievements” to their credit in 50 days. “We have wiped out the politically motivated divide between Punjab and Haryana. All attempts to divide us have fallen flat,” he claims.Putting out a list of 115 farmers who he claims to have died during the agitation, Sirsa said, “We will accept nothing less than repeal of the black laws. Fifty days or five months, we are here to stay—and win. The martyrs sacrifice won’t go waste.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/despite-casualties-farmers-wont-give-in-198181
