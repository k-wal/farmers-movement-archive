The unchallenged psychiatric evidence from Dr Forrester is that Mr Fletcher is a very high risk of suicide and has a high chance of completed suicide if extradited. Mr Fletcher is impulsive and has also planned to take his own life,” argued Fletcher's barrister Ben Keith.James Stansfeld, appearing on behalf of the Indian authorities, countered the arguments and stated that Indian government assurances in the case would provide adequate medical care for the accused.“The Appellant (Fletcher) is a fugitive from proceedings in India. He is sought to serve a lengthy sentence of imprisonment for serious offences. He can be, and will be, provided with appropriate care in India and in transit from the UK,” said Stansfeld.The appeal is being argued on the grounds of Section 91 of the Extradition Act, which prohibits extradition from the UK if it would be “unjust or oppressive” to the person. During closing submissions in the Nirav Modi case last month, his legal team had raised similar Section 91 arguments when citing his severe depression and high risk of suicide.Therefore, the outcome of the Fletcher appeal – in which the judge has reserved his judgment to be handed down in the coming weeks – could go on to have some bearing on the Nirav Modi extradition case, which is scheduled for a ruling at Westminster Magistrates Court in London on February 25.According to court documents, Ivor Fletcher was arrested in the Kullu region of India with charas in biscuit-shaped packets wrapped in khaki-coloured paper in an attache case and his appeal against his arrest in the case went up to the Supreme Court in India, where it was dismissed in August 2011.India put in an extradition request in June 2018 for his return to serve his sentence after he was discovered in the UK, following which he was arrested and the UK Home Secretary ordered his extradition in March last year following a magistrates' court ruling in India's favour.During Thursday's hearing, the High Court was told that because Fletcher suffers from severe recurrent depression and a form of long-term personality disorder which puts him at a high risk of committing suicide, further exacerbated by the COVID-19 lockdown, it would be unjust and oppressive to extradite him to an Indian prison.Meanwhile, the Indian authorities argue sufficient provisions are in place to take his mental health into consideration in prison, including regular monitoring.The judge will hand down his ruling at a future date after weighing up both sides of the argument.

Currently, Google Pay, Phone Pe and Paytm have a majority of the market share in this segment,” the survey by online platform Localcirlces said.Early this month, WhatsApp informed users of an update in its terms of service and privacy policy regarding how it processes user data and partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the social media giant’s products.It also stated that users will have to agree to the new terms and policy by February 8, 2021, in order to continue using WhatsApp.However, the mobile messaging app has deferred the update to May after it received flak over its new privacy policy and terms of service.Around 92 per cent people in the survey said they will not use Whatsapp payment features if the app shares information with Facebook and third parties.Around 79 per cent respondents said that they are not likely to use Whatsapp Business Accounts if the instant messaging app decides to implement the policy in May.The survey found that while 55 per cent of citizens have downloaded alternative apps, 21 per cent are actively using it.“Many users may have already had the Signal and Telegram apps on their phones before the new Whatsapp policy changes were proposed,” the report said.Another survey by market research and analysis firm BM Nxt, said 82 per cent users expressed displeasure over the new policy of Whatsapp and 72 per cent respondents said they were open to switching to other messaging platforms. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/majority-of-whatsapp-users-may-not-use-payment-features-if-it-shares-info-with-fb-survey-204639

The nervousness of the government is evident from how it is installing security forces on all borders. The government wants to show this movement as ‘violent’ again and again but the Samyuktaa Kisan Morcha has a unanimous approach to ensure that the movement will remain peaceful.”SKM stated that it would not be intimidated by the notices being sent by the Delhi Police and would respond to the same.“The BJP government, along with its state governments, is trying its best to put an end to this movement by blaming the SKM for the events of January 26, and it is not acceptable.”Today, a ‘Sadbhavana Yatra’ was taken out by farmer union leaders at Singhu Border against the divisive forces trying to divide the protesting farmers along religious and state lines.The yatra, which covered about 16 km at the Singhu Border protest site, with various leaders namely Balbir Singh Rajewal, Jagjeet Singh Dallewal, Darshan Pal, Gurnam Singh Chaduni, Jagmohan Singh, Jangbir Singh, Rajinder Singh, Amarjeet Singh and others, also put out a message to all protesting farmers that there was no need to feel intimidated by the increased police and security forces’ presence.The union insisted that instead of taking action against the real criminals, the police are instead arresting farmers who were protesting peacefully.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-will-not-be-intimidated-by-notices-sent-by-delhi-police-samkuyta-kisan-morcha-204626
28-01-2021||New Delhi||Congress and Left Front reach agreement on more West Bengal Assembly seats||Moving at a steady pace, Congress party and CPI(M)-led Left Front on Thursday successfully worked out seat-sharing formula with regard to 116 more constituencies of West Bengal for the assembly elections slated to take place in the state soon.Senior leaders of Congress and Left Front – bitter foes in the past – met at WBPCC office “Bidhan Bhavan” in Kolkata this morning for about two hours to discuss sharing of seats.CPI(M) leader and Left Front chairman Biman Bose, CPI(M) state general secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra, RSP state unit general secretary Biswanath Choudhury, Forward Bloc state committee general secretary Naren Chatterjee and CPI state secretary Swapan Banerjee took part in the meeting on behalf of the Left Front.The Congress party was represented by WBPCC chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of Congress in West Bengal assembly Abdul Mannan and two others.Later, addressing a press conference in the presence of Congress leaders, Biman Basu said that 68 out of the 116 seats would be contested by Left Front candidates while the remaining 48 seats would be fought by Congress nominees.In a previous meeting, the two sides worked out allocation of 77 assembly constituencies which were different than the 116 decided upon on Thursday.With Thursday’s decision, the number of seats with regard to which Congress and Left Front could reach an agreement rose to 193.West Bengal Assembly has 294 seats. Leaders of Congress and Left Front said they were confident that by the end of next month they would be able to work out the allocation of seats for the remaining 101 constituencies also.It was also announced that the allies would jointly organise a rally at the Brigade Parade Ground of Kolkata on February 28. This will be the first joint rally by Congress and CPI(M)-led front at the iconic venue.CPI(M) and Congress had a loose arrangement regarding sharing of seats in the 2016 assembly elections. While the ruling TMC improved its tally in the polls, Congress benefited from the seat sharing arrangement as it won more seats than CPI(M).Attempts were made by the two sides to work out a seat-sharing formula during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.However, the plan failed to materialise primarily owing to Congress leader PR Dasmunsi’s widow Deepa’s refusal to give up her claim over Raiganj seat in favour of CPI(M)’s Md Salim, who was the sitting MP from Raiganj then.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-and-left-front-reach-agreement-on-more-west-bengal-assembly-seats-204625

Accordingly, the fact sheets will be changed,” Bhargava said.He said there were two types of blood thinners.(Click here for the latest developments on Covid-19 epidemic)“There is absolutely no issue in administering the COVID vaccine to the elderly or others on anti-platelets like aspirin. The second category of blood thinners are the anti coagulants where there is a mild issue of local hematoma or swelling developing after the jab is given. This can be resolved by stopping the administration of anti coagulants about two days prior to the COVID vaccine,” Bhargava said.The fact sheets of both COVAXIN and Covishield currently mention that those on blood thinners should avoid COVID jabs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/safe-to-give-covid-jab-to-those-on-blood-thinners-icmr-204621

Webley produced handguns and long guns from 1834-1979 when the company ceased to manufacture firearms and instead turned its attention to producing air pistols and air rifles.In 2010, Webley and Scott restarted the production of shotguns for commercial sale.Webley is famous for the revolvers and automatic pistols it supplied to the British Empire’s military, particularly the British Army, from 1887 through both World War I and World War II.Singh said an understanding has been reached with 15 gun houses in different states of the country till now for selling the revolver. The company will not sell directly but through gun houses, he said.“Revolvers, pistols, airguns will be made in this unit. Keeping in mind the vast market potential, the decision to set up this unit had been taken,” Singh had earlier said, adding that the project had been completed with the help of the Centre and the state government.“We had applied for the licence in 2017 and got it in March 2019 under which we can make revolvers, pistols and ammunition,” he had said.Singh added that they would also make goods for the defence and paramilitary forces later.While Sial has a stake of 51 per cent, the British firm has 49 per cent and this unit has been completed in a year’s time.Since there is demand for revolvers, the unit will be manufacturing it initially. Its cost would be Rs 1.55 lakh. Other products will be brought in the market later, he had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/webley-scott-to-launch-made-in-india-revolvers-204616

Another side of the wall is being dug out, it will require 10 more days to completely bring out the structure," said Mallick.He, however, expressed apprehension that some portion of the structure might have been damaged due to use of machines while digging the area under the beautification drive.The ASI team, however, carried out the excavation works by using scientific methods. The remains were in the premises of the 11th century Suka-Sari temple complex close to Shree Lingaraj Temple.

28-01-2021||Vibha Sharma||Govt likely to bring a motion condemning the Red Fort incident in Budget Session||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 28The Narendra Modi government is likely to bring a motion condemning the Red Fort incident during the Budget session of Parliament beginning on Friday.While the broad framework is expected to be around the actual act, which the BJP has dubbed as “attack on democracy”,  sources say the motion may also include the background of agitation, including the process of 11 round of talks with farmers’ unions on the three contentious farm laws.Sources said the government wanted Parliament to pass a resolution condemning the incident after taking into consideration “the sense of the House”.An angry mob of supporters protesting against the laws stormed the historic Red Fort on January 26 and hoisted a Sikh religious flag, breaking through police barricades to storm the complex.Also read: Bengal assembly passes resolution demanding withdrawal of new farm lawsThe “strategic move” by the ruling BJP is unlikely to find any opposition from rival parties in Parliament, it is believed. In all likelihood, it may be supported by all political parties if their views, post the incident, were any indication.While the BJP has called the act of protesters hoisting the flag at Red Fort as an “attack on democracy”, the Opposition parties, particularly the Congress, have blamed the Centre.Rivals called the Republic Day mayhem as “government conspiracy” to discredit the farmers’ agitation, also questioning how a section of aggressors were allowed to storm the Red Fort while Delhi police “looked the other way”.However, even as the Opposition sought to put the onus on the BJP-led government, it also distanced themselves from the “violence” in the agitation.Motions and resolutions are procedural devices to raise a discussion on the floor of the two Houses — the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha — on the matters of general public interest.The process of debate in the House is initiated by a member or Minister by making a motion. Broadly, the term ‘motion’ means any proposal submitted to the House for eliciting its decision.Every matter is determined by means of a question put from the Chair on a motion made by a member and resolved either in the affirmative or negative. The decision which has thus been elicited, turns the motion into a resolution or order of the House.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-likely-to-bring-a-motion-condemning-the-red-fort-incident-in-budget-session-204606

He had undergone an angioplasty procedure during which a stent was inserted into one of the blocked arteries.According to a source in Ganguly's family, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee may visit him at the hospital.She also called him up in the morning to enquire about his health.Senior CPI(M) leader Ashok Bhattacharya also paid a visit to Ganguly at the hospital.The former left-handed batsman was on Wednesday afternoon rushed to the private hospital on EM Bypass here from his Behala residence as he felt "dizzy with slight discomfort in chest".A green corridor was created by the city police for his smooth travel to the hospital.A statement issued by the medical establishment on Wednesday evening stated that several tests were carried out at the emergency ward, but there was "no change in his (vital health) parameters since his last hospitalisation".

About 40 farmers were present at the spot at that time, they said.Refuting the charges, Circle Officer Alok Singh said the protest ended after deliberations with the farmers and the police did not resort to lathicharge on the protesters.Whatever happened was in agreement with those present there, he said, adding that the protesting farmers returned home peacefully.Meanwhile, ADM Amit Kumar Singh said the project director of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Sanjay Misra, had written a letter complaining that work on the Delhi-Saharanpur highway was being hampered because of some anarchic elements.Acting on the letter, the protesters were removed from the national highway and sent home, the ADM said.The protest was launched on the national highway at Badaut on December 19 last year.

There has to be some other solution."  The November 23, 2020 order had been passed on a plea moved by a man who had contended that a photograph of his deceased wife was being circulated on various social media platforms wrongly depicting her as the victim of the unfortunate incident of rape and murder of a young girl at Hathras, Uttar Pradesh.On Thursday, during the hearing, the counsel for the husband told the court that all the links to the objectionable content have not been removed by Facebook and sought time to place on record the existing links/urls.The court, thereafter, gave him time till April 12 to place on record the links/urls, which are yet to be removed.The petitioner has also contended in his plea that even otherwise, revelation of the identity of the rape victim is an offence under the Indian Penal Code, though in the present matter image of a wrong person is in circulation.A 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14, 2020. She died on September 29, 2020 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital during treatment.

28-01-2021||Aditi Tandon||Budget Session from Friday; Congress seeks fiscal stimulus, boost to health, defence spending||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 28On the eve of the Budget Session of Parliament commencing on Friday, the Congress on Thursday issued a 10-point “to-do list” for Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman calling for an immediate and large fiscal stimulus to revive a sagging economy and significant boost for health and defence expenditure.Former finance minister P Chidambaram, while squarely blaming the government for pre-COVID economic slowdown and COVID-era economic mismanagement, said today that the Congress’ wish list for the Union Budget 2021-2022 was completely doable.“We recognise that there are some imperatives that fall outside economic management such as increase in expenditure on health infrastructure and increase in defence expenditure. We will support significant increase under both heads,” the former finance minister said refusing to comment on whether the Congress would support the proposed COVID cess the Government is mulling.“Cess on whom and cess on what? Once we know that, we will respond,” Chidambaram said a further cess on petrol and diesel, which are already highly priced, would not be advisable.The former finance minister, in his assessment of the economy, said Sitharaman had the distinction of presiding over the first recession in four decades.“The economy is in a recession. The recovery will be slow and painful, and the rate of GDP growth in 2021-22 (in constant prices) will be modest — no more than 5 per cent,” Chidambaram said listing potential solutions “should the Government care to heed”.Among Congress suggestions for economic revival are — impart a large fiscal stimulus to the economy, even belated; such a stimulus alone will put money in the hands of the people and stimulate demand.“Make direct cash transfers to 20-30 per cent of the families at the bottom of the economy at least for a period of six months, formulate and implement a rescue plan for the MSMEs to revive closed units; reduce tax rates, especially GST and other indirect tax rates on petrol and diesel; increase government capital expenditure; recapitalise public sector banks immediately and encourage them to lend without fear of investigative agencies probing every loan; abandon protectionist policies, reengage with the world and enter bilateral trade agreements with as many countries as possible thereby removing a bias against imports,” said Chidambaram.He also called for formulation of sector-specific revival packages for telecommunication, power, mining, construction, aviation, tourism and hospitality; review of amendments to tax laws that have been widely viewed as tax terrorism and comprehensive and time-bound review of the regulations made by the RBI, the SEBI and other regulatory agencies that have been widely regarded as over-regulation.On agriculture, the former finance minister said: “Agriculture will grow at a satisfactory rate if the government does not arbitrarily disrupt the sector with anti-farmer laws and retrograde import/export policies for agricultural produce.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/budget-session-from-friday-congress-seeks-fiscal-stimulus-boost-to-health-defence-spending-204569
28-01-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Nation in grip of corporates: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader and Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi on Thursday alleged that “one or two corporates” are controlling the country and added that this is not good for democracy.Gandhi said the farmers of the country have still not got a clear picture on the farm laws and the agitation could flare up again.He was speaking at a public function in Wayanad.The former Congress chief said that the Congress and UDF would sweep the upcoming Assembly polls in Kerala and added that several new faces will be contesting the election.Gandhi who is in the state for the past couple of days had interacted with girl students on Wednesday and had even asked a schoolgirl to translate his speech. He had called upon the girls students to be independent and equal to boys and asked them to be active in all walks of life.Gandhi was also involved in a series of discussions with senior state Congress leaders and its ally the Indian Union Muslim League regarding the sharing of seats. He is keen that a large number of women and youth contest the next election on Congress tickets.With the Congress and the UDF on the backfoot following the recent Kerala local body elections, where the ruling LDF had swept the polls, the Congress is active with altering of strategies including bringing in former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy as the chairman of the election supervisory committee as well as Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor as member of the election manifesto committee.The state Congress is expecting Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi as their star campaigners in the 2021 Assembly election, likely to take place in mid-April and the Congress is in a do-or-die battle to wrest power from the LDF.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nation-in-grip-of-corporates-rahul-gandhi-204564

Ganediwala came in a criminal appeal against the conviction and imprisonment of one year and five-year jail plus fines under different laws, awarded to the 50-year-old man for molesting the 5-year-old girl, by the Special Judge of Special POCSO Court, Gadchiroli, in October 2020.Partly allowing the appeal, the Bombay HC quashed aside the jail sentence of 5 years under the POCSO Act and modified the imprisonment as per the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to the extent the appellant-accused has already served as an undertrial.While considering these aspects, the high court referred to the definition of 'sexual assault' under Section 7 of the POCSO Act: "Whoever with sexual intent touches vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person or does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration is said to commit sexual assault."In the present case, since no actual touching of the private parts of the (girl's) body happened, the high court ruled it would come under the third part of the definition - "any other act with sexual which involves physical contact without penetration" Justice Ganediwala observed: "The acts of 'holding the hands of the prosecutrix', or 'opened zip of the pant' as has been allegedly witnessed by the (witness), in the opinion of this court, does not fit in the definition of 'sexual assault'."However, the court ruled that the offence of sexual harassment under IPC Sec. 354(A)(1)(i) that deals with 'physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures', is attracted.Accordingly, the high court set aside the appellant-accused' conviction under the POCSO Act Sec. 8, 10, 12, but pronounced him guilty under the IPC Sec. 354(A)(1)(i) which attracts a maximum of 3 years jail term.Justice Ganediwala said that since the appellant-accused had already undergone 5 months in jail, it was sufficient for the offence and directed him to be set free if not wanted in any other cases.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unzipping-pants-holding-minors-hand-not-sexual-assault-bombay-high-court-204559
28-01-2021||New Delhi||In 2020 India showed ability to meet all challenges, be it from coronavirus or at borders: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday that India last year showed it is capable of taking all steps to meet challenges, be it from coronavirus or at its borders.“We have to strengthen the emotion with which we dealt with big challenges last year, with one nation with one heart. We have to completely remove the ill effects of the pandemic on our economy,” he said at a rally of the National Cadet Corps (NCC) here.According to government projections released earlier this month, India’s GDP is estimated to contract by a record 7.7 per cent during 2020-21 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The prime minister said, “Last year, India has shown that it’s capable of taking steps to meet all challenges, be it from coronavirus or at its borders.”   Indian and Chinese armed forces are engaged in a bitter standoff at their border areas in eastern Ladakh since May last year.“Whether it is developing protective shield of the vaccine or destroying with modern missiles intentions of those challenging India, the country is capable on all fronts,” he stressed.If India is ‘aatmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) in vaccine, it is also trying with equal vigour to modernise its armed forces, Modi said.The prime minister asserted that all steps are being taken to ensure that every wing of India’s armed forces is the best, adding that the country now has excellent “war machines”.Referring to mid-air refuelling of three Rafale fighter aircraft while they were on way to India on Wednesday, Modi said it was done in UAE and Saudi Arabia, and Greece also helped. “This highlights our growing ties with the Gulf countries,” he said.This was the third batch of Rafale fighter jets that arrived in India after flying non-stop from France.About his government’s efforts to boost domestic defence manufacturing, Modi said, “India will soon be known as a big producer of defence equipment instead of a big market as it is today.”He said the indigenously developed Tejas fighter jet is exhibiting its glory in the sea and sky and an order of more than 80 of these aircraft have been placed by the government recently.“India is focusing on all necessary research and development so that it does not remain behind in developing artificial intelligence related warfare capabilities,” Modi mentioned. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-2020-india-showed-ability-to-meet-all-challenges-be-it-from-coronavirus-or-at-borders-pm-modi-204552

28-01-2021||Mumbai||Fadnavis' tweet on Delhi Metro ride sparks row in Maharashtra||An innocuous tweet by BJP's Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis taking a swipe at the Maharashtra government on the Mumbai Metro, ignited another war of words in the state on Thursday.Late on Wednesday, Fadnavis took a ride on the Delhi Metro, and posted his photos with a mocking comment on Twitter targeting the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance government back home."I travelled in Delhi Metro today to return back to the airport and reached in a very short span as compared to travel by road!" Fadnavis tweeted.He added: "Don't know when will I be able to travel in Mumbai Metro 3 to the airport, looking at the things messed up by the MVA on car shed issues." The sarcasm was not lost on the ruling MVA partners - Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party, and Congress which hit back vigorously and unitedly.Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said he was glad that Fadnavis appreciated the "Delhi Metro, developed by the Congress government.""The only metro (in Mumbai) completed was also by the (erstwhile Congress-NCP) government. Your government could not meet 2019 deadline," Sawant said.The Congress leader assured that with vast experience in governance, "the MVA will surely do what your (BJP-led Fadnavis government) could not, if the hurdles created by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government are removed." Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray's media advisor Harshal Pradhan cajoled Fadnavis to "feel proud of Maharashtra first" before lavishing praise on others."You should feel proud that India's best CM (Thackeray) has saved and given a forest to Mumbai in Aarey Colony. We are a growing state with a visionary leadership. Be proud of the fastest developing state," Pradhan suggested.Turning the tables on the opposition, NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase asked Fadnavis to help clear the obstacles allegedly created in the Mumbai Metro project by the BJP at the Centre."We want that these hurdles should be cleared, the state and Centre must jointly contribute to give a well-deserved Metro project to the citizens of Mumbai," urged Tapase.In an oblique reference to Fadnavis' remarks, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar assured that "the work on Mumbai Metro is proceeding satisfactorily" as per schedules.Environmentalist Zoru Bhathena, crusading for the protection of the Aarey Colony forests, had a poser for Fadnavis: "Did you find any Metro depots being built in the city forests inside Delhi".Bhathena's query pertained to the MVA-BJP state-Centre tug-of-war over the location of the proposed Mumbai Metro car shed at Aarey Colony - now declared a 'forest' - or at the new Kanjurmarg site, a few kilometres away.The BJP and Fadnavis are keen to retain the site at Aarey Colony, while the MVA wants to take it to the Kanjurmarg site, which has now been claimed by the Centre, and failing this, the MVA is eyeing a site in Bandra Kurla Complex where the proposed Bullet Train terminus is planned, giving palpitations to many.Hammering Fadnavis on this, Sawant said: "It was your government that messed up by doing a deal with Shapoorji Pallonji builders. It was your government that favoured private builders over a public metro. If you want to look for someone to blame for this mess, do look into the mirror." The CM's aide Pradhan added that actually Fadnavis should feel "sad" that he missed the opportunity to be a part of the golden era of Maharashtra especially since "the Sena and Thackeray were once in alliance with BJP".IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fadnavis-tweet-on-delhi-metro-ride-sparks-row-in-maharashtra-204540

28-01-2021||Indore||MP High Court rejects comedian Munawar Faruqui’s bail plea||The Madhya Pradesh High Court on Thursday refused bail to comedian Munawar Faruqui who is accused of passing “indecent” remarks about Hindu deities during a show, and noted that “promote harmony” is one of the constitutional duties.Liberty of a person has to be “balanced” with his duties towards other citizens, Justice Rohit Arya of the Indore bench of the high court said, citing a Supreme Court ruling.The court also turned down the bail plea of Nalin Yadav, another accused in the case.Faruqui and four others were arrested on January 1 following a complaint by a BJP MLA’s son that objectionable remarks about Hindu deities and Union Home Minister Amit Shah were passed during a comedy show at a cafe in Indore on New Year’s day. One more person was arrested subsequently.Faruqui and Yadav are in judicial remand and lodged in Indore Central Jail. A magistrate’s court and a sessions court rejected their bail pleas, following which they moved the high court.In its order, the high court said it would not comment on merits of the case, but based on the material seized, the witnesses’ statements and considering the fact that probe was going on, no case is made out for grant of bail.“The evidence/material collected so far suggests that in an organized public show under the garb of stand-up comedy at a public place on commercial lines, prima facie, scurrilous, disparaging utterances, outraging religious feelings of a class of citizens of India with deliberate intent, were made by the applicant,” it said.“Liberty of an individual has to be balanced with his duties and obligations towards his fellow citizens,” the order said, citing a past Supreme Court judgment.The court noted defence lawyers’ argument that Faruqui had come to Indore on an invitation by organizers, and  did not say anything that has been alleged.However, in the light of the statements of the complainant and witnesses and video footage of the show, “at this stage it is difficult to countenance to the submissions of the learned counsel for the applicant as complacency of the applicant cannot be ruled out”, it said.“It is not a case of no evidence. More so, the investigation is in progress,” the court added.There was a possibility that “more incriminating material” would be collected, and further, a similar case has been registered against Faruqui in Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, the high court noted.“That apart, there is also specific assertion by the counsel for the complainant that the applicant, along with other co-accused persons, (were) allegedly making outraging filthy jokes in social media deliberately against Hindu Gods, Lord Shriram and Goddess Seeta, hurting religious sentiments of Hindus for the last 18 months, despite protest on various social media platforms. There is nothing on record to the contrary,” it said.“Our country is a beautiful country and sets an example of coexistence amid diversities, be it religion, language, culture, geographical locations etc, to the world at large,” the high court said.“It is the constitutional duty of every citizen of the country and also of the states to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India irrespective of religious, linguistic, regional or sectional diversities and to value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture (Article 15A (e) and (f) of the Constitution of India),” it said.The government must ensure that “ecosystem and sustenance of coexistence is not polluted by negative forces”, it said.The high court did not comment on the part of the FIR where it is alleged that indecent jokes were also cracked about Union minister Shah.As per the First Information Report, the comedy show was held at a cafe in 56 Dukan area of Indore on January 1.Eklavya Singh Gaud, son of local BJP MLA Malini Laxman Singh Gaud, had filed a complaint against Faruqui and others.Gaud said  he and his associates had gone to watch the show where indecent jokes were made about Hindu gods and goddesses and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.He forced the organizers to stop the show, he said.Faruqui and others were arrested under IPC section 295-A (outraging religious feelings).They were also accused of holding the show amid COVID-19 pandemic without permission and booked under section 269 (unlawful or negligent act likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) and other relevant provisions.Faruqui’s lawyer Anshuman Shrivastava said they will move the Supreme Court against the high court’s order.The show was stopped by complainant Eklavya Singh Gaud when Faruqui had not even started his performance, and the FIR was based on controversies surrounding his earlier shows, the lawyer claimed.But Indore’s Inspector General Harinarayan Chari Mishra asserted that the police case was based on the January 1 program.

Earlier in January, he was diagnosed with 'triple vessel disease' and had a stent inserted in a coronary artery after suffering a mild heart attack."Mr Ganguly slept well all night. He had a light breakfast this morning. A series of tests will be conducted on him today to decide on the next course of treatment," the senior doctor, who is part of the panel attending to the cricketing icon, said.Noted cardiologist Devi Shetty might fly down to the city later in the day to examine Ganguly's condition, go through the test reports, and hold meetings with the doctors treating him, he said."Once the test results arrive, we will be able to determine if two stents have to be inserted to open the blocks in his arteries," he added.According to a source in the family, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called Ganguly in the morning to enquire about his health.Senior CPI(M) leader Ashok Bhattacharya also paid a visit to Ganguly at the hospital.The former left-handed batsman was on Wednesday afternoon rushed to the private hospital on EM Bypass here from his Behala residence as he felt "dizzy with slight discomfort in chest", the family source said.A green corridor was created by the city police for his smooth travel to the hospital.A statement issued by the medical establishment on Wednesday evening stated that several tests were carried out at the emergency ward of the hospital, but there was "no change in his (vital health) parameters since his last hospitalisation".Ganguly has been admitted "for a check up of his cardiac condition", the statement said.

28-01-2021||Mumbai||Centre wanted farmers to get provoked, says Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Thursday alleged that the BJP-led central government wanted the farmers to get provoked and turn violent so that their ongoing protest against three new agriculture laws got maligned.It was referring to the violence that erupted in Delhi during the farmers' tractor parade on Republic Day.The party said the violence was not in the national interest.The Maharashtra BJP, however, termed the Sena's allegation against the central government "baseless".In an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana', the Sena said, "The farmers' agitation against the three farm laws has been going on in a peaceful manner for the last 60 days. The protesters have been camping on Delhi borders, seeking repeal of the three new laws. There was neither any division among the protesting farmers, nor did they lose their patience.”"The central government could not do much about it. It wanted the farmers to get provoked and turn violent so that their protest gets maligned. On January 26, its wish came true. But it also brought a bad name to the country,” the Sena alleged.“It is easy to say that the farmers took the law into their own hands. But they have been seeking withdrawal of the farm laws. What about that?” it said.The self-respect of farmers from Punjab is troubling the Centre, the party claimed."It is not correct to blame only the farmers for the violence in Delhi. What the government wanted was brought to reality, but farmers and the police suffered due to it," it added."Who will hold the government accountable for what happened?” the Sena asked.It alleged that the BJP's "intelligence machinery" found that the violence was pre-planned and "terrorists have taken over the agitation"."The leader of the violent protest was one Deep Sidhu, associated with the BJP. Farmer leaders have said that Sidhu was instigating the farmers for the last two months, but everyone showed patience," the Sena added."The farmers want three agriculture laws repealed. But why is the government adamant?" it asked.Maharashtra BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said the Sena's charge against the Centre was “baseless”.“It is unfortunate that some people don't see beyond politics and want to spread anarchy in the name of farmers' protest,” he said.The tractor parade on Tuesday that was to highlight the demands of the farmer unions to repeal three new agri laws dissolved into anarchy on the streets of Delhi as tens of thousands of protesters broke through barriers, fought with police, overturned vehicles and hoisted a religious flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort.Delhi Police have registered several FIRs in connection with the violence.

28-01-2021||Mumbai||Distributors, exhibitors happy as MHA allows increase in theatre occupancy||Film exhibitors and cinema hall owners have welcomed the decision of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to increase the capacity of theatres and described the move as “a big shot in the arm” for the film industry that will help the entertainment sector get back on its feet.The MHA on Wednesday allowed cinema halls and theatres to operate with more people in fresh COVID-19 reopening guidelines, to be effective from February 1.Kamal Gianchandani, CEO of PVR Pictures, said they are thankful to both the MHA and Ministry of Information & Broadcasting for relaxing the capacity cap in theatres.“It is an extremely positive move and a big shot in the arm of the film entertainment sector. This has come in a timely fashion a lot of Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam films are being lined up for release in February. This move will help a lot of these films,” Gianchandani of PVR Pictures, the largest theatre chain in India, told PTI.According to the senior executive, the decision will also encourage Hindi film producers to release their films.“It will encourage a lot of Hindi producers who are ready with their films and for whom 50 per cent capacity was becoming a deterrent and this relaxation of capacity cap,” Gianchandani said.Post lockdown, the Centre had allowed reopening of theatres and multiplexes in several regions, including Delhi, parts of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat on October 15, 2020, with 50 per cent occupancy, functioning with stringent dos and don’ts, keeping in view the new normal.Theatres in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh opened in November, whereas cinema halls in Tamil Nadu and Kerala resumed operation in early January.So far only a handful of Hindi films, including “Ramprasad Ki Tehrvi”, “Suraj Pe Mangal Bhari”, “Shakeela”, “Madam Chief Minister”, and “Indoo Ki Jawani” have released in theatres.Big-ticket Hindi movies with A-listers like “83”, “Sooryavanshi”, “Jayeshbhai Jordaar”, “Shamshera”, “Brahmastra”,” Prithviraj” and “Laal Singh Chaddha” are still awaiting a release date.Both “Radhe - Your Most Wanted Bhai”, starring Salman Khan, and John Abraham’s “Satyameva Jayate 2” are scheduled for an Eid release. Shahid Kapoor’s “Jersey” will release on Diwali, while Ajay Devgn-starrer “Maidaan” will arrive in theatres on October 15 on Dussehra holiday.Leading distributor Akshaye Rathi, who owns eight theatres in Maharashtra, is hopeful that the increased capacity would translate into release of the much-awaited tentpole movies.The current box office environment, thanks to the recent success of south films like “Master” and “Krack”, is also conducive to release Hindi films, he added.“Cinemas thrive when tentpole films release. There are Tamil, Telugu films releasing but the impact of it is not as high in the Hindi belt. Hindi films generate a king share of business,” Rathi told PTI.Reliance Entertainment group CEO Shibasish Sarkar said the decision will help in increasing the business.“We intend to bring one big film in the last week of March and first week of April. We have not yet decided what and when,” Sarkar, whose company has “Sooryavanshi” and “83” lined up for release, told PTI.Bihar-based exhibitor Vishek Chauhan said it is the best news for the industry in a while.He said though the theatres in the state had opened on October 15, it has only been a downhill journey as there hardly any films released then.“The SOP (Standard operating procedure) that we are expecting will not give us a 100 per cent occupancy but maybe an 80-85 per cent. You can release any big film at 80 per cent occupancy. But now the ball is in Bollywood’s court,” Chauhan told PTI.Gianchandani said PVR Pictures, which has 835 screens across India, is prepared to welcome more audiences as they have all the necessary safety measures in place.“We mastered it extremely well in south India in terms of safety protocol we made at the theatres,” he said.Days after permitting 100 per cent occupancy in movie theatres while adhering to COVID-19 guidelines, the Tamil Nadu government withdrew its decision earlier this month and said the capacity shall be restricted to 50 per cent.The government, however, allowed theatres to screen additional shows as per a directive of the Madras High Court and said the order would be in force with immediate effect.“With ‘Master’, we have handled big crowds and there was no issue. Now with more people coming in theatres, there will absolutely be no problem,” Gianchandani added.However, Rajasthan-based senior distributor and exhibitor Raj Bansal rued that cinemas in the state continue to remain shut, even as almost every other region was up and running.“In our state, the cases are very much under control. There are about 10,000 people affected due to cinema halls being shut,” Bansal told PTI.He said he hopes theatres in Rajasthan will open soon and big releases will breathe new life into the state’s cinema halls starting Holi festival in March.Kunal Sawhney, Senior Vice-President, Operations and Business Development, Carnival Cinemas said the move was highly awaited as every other industry has opened up.“We wish that the government has seen the precautions that all cinemas have taken (so far). We are looking at a higher percentage of capacity to sell and open balance states which are not yet open,” Sawhney told PTI.Due to the shutdown, several films such as “Gulabo Sitabo”, “Shakuntala Devi” and “Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl” released on digital platforms. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/distributors-exhibitors-happy-as-mha-allows-increase-in-theatre-occupancy-204518

That, too, is an ongoing discussion,” she said in an apparent reference to the Coffee Club or United for Consensus. Comprising countries like Italy, Pakistan, Mexico and Egypt, the Coffee Club has opposed the permanent membership bid of India, Japan, Germany and Brazil.President Biden in his campaign policy document last year had reiterated its promise of supporting India as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.“Recognising India’s growing role on the world stage, the Obama-Biden Administration formally declared US support for India's membership in a reformed and expanded United Nations Security Council,” Biden Campaign's policy document on Indian-Americans had said last August.Thomas-Greenfield, in response to another question, favoured reforms in the UN Security Council. India is currently its non-permanent member for a two-year term that began in January this year.“I think there is general agreement across the board that reforms are needed in the Security Council. What those reforms will be and how they will be implemented, I think remains to be decided but you know changing the number of members that happened we move from 11 to 15 some years ago and there are efforts to push for more permanent members, and those discussions are ongoing,” she said.She was responding to a question from Senator Merkley.“I wanted to start by asking about the Security Council itself. At the same time that China and Russia often stymie actions in the Security Council. The Security Council is decreasingly representative of the geopolitical landscape with key powers like India, Germany, Japan not included as permanent members,” he said.“How do you approach the question of the Security Council? How do you consider that perhaps it needs to be reformed? How do you believe it can be made more effective and functional,” Merkley asked.

An electronic vaccine data system will be implemented as a control measure. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1-million-covid-vaccine-doses-to-arrive-from-india-on-feb-1-south-africa-health-minister-204495

Announcing that it had put off the march to Parliament on February 1, the SKM said that farmers across the country would observe fast on the death anniversary of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, on January 30.“The incident at the Red Fort where some persons participating in the tractor parade unfurled the flag of a particular religion hurt the sentiments of the people of the nation. We regret the incident even though we had no role in it. But as we had given the call for the tractor parade, in which lakhs participated, we express regret for the shameful incident,” said Balbir Singh Rajewal, one of the members on the seven-member SKM committee, after a marathon meeting at Singhu that lasted over five hours.SN SrivastavaBreach of agreement: Delhi Police ChiefThe unions didn’t follow conditions set for the rally that was supposed to be held from 12 noon to 5 pm with 5,000 tractors. He and other members blamed the government for hatching a conspiracy to defame their peaceful protest. “We will expose the conspiracy by the government in coming days. We obeyed the route plan given to us by the police but encountered barricades. Members of the Punjab Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee stood ahead of these barricades to ‘sabotage’ our protest. Sangharsh Committee members and Deep Sidhu are responsible for what happened at the Red Fort,” Rajewal told the media.Yogendra Yadav and Gurnam Singh Charuni said the protest would continue and more farmers would join in soon. The SKM, an umbrella body of agitating farmer unions, claimed several of their members were still missing. “FIRs have been registered against innocent farmers too. It was a conspiracy to weaken the brotherhood between the farmers of Haryana and Punjab,” the SKM leaders alleged. Rajewal questioned the working of the Delhi Police, asking: “How could the protesters enter the Red Fort which is a high-security area?” Most farmers, gathered at Singhu and Tikri for the tractor parade, returned on Wednesday. Pelted with stones on the Gharaunda flyover, a group of farmers chased the miscreants, parking their tractors on the highway, disrupting traffic.Doors for dialogue still open: JavadekarThe Centre has sent out feelers to farmers saying doors for talks were still open.

But we want to know your timeline,” it asked Attorney General KK Venugopal, who said pendency of recommendation had come down from 150 to 104 in December.The Bench — which also included Justice SK Kaul and Justice Surya Kant – said: “We need to put the houses in order.”“In five months, the Collegium cleared the names of nine judges and six are still pending,” it said. The Bench adjourned the hearing on the PIL on vacancies in high courts for two weeks, awaiting the Centre’s response.“We need the update on pending names as on January 29.

But the govt must properly protect those who can be impacted during the transition to this new system. China is next with 8.1 per cent growth in 2021, followed by Spain (5.9 per cent) and France (5.5 per cent).The IMF gave conditional backing to the farm laws saying they have the potential to represent a significant step forward for agricultural reforms in India. But the government must properly protect those who could be impacted during the transition to this new system as well as strengthen the social safety net, said IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath. She was basically reiterating the observations by IMF spokesperson Gerry Rice on January 15.“The measures will enable farmers to directly contract with sellers, allow farmers to retain a greater share of the surplus by reducing the role of middle men, enhance efficiency and support rural growth,” she said.The net may require further strengthening so as to ensure that the job market can accommodate those that may be impacted by the reforms.“And of course, the growth benefits of these reforms will depend, critically, on the effectiveness and the timing of their implementation, so need to pay attention to those issues as well with the reform,” her colleague Rice had observed.IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has also commended India for decisive action to deal with the pandemic and its economic consequences. She felt India had scored higher than the average for emerging markets on both monetary policy and fiscal policy side.Revising its figures, the IMF said in 2020 the Indian economy is estimated to have contracted by 8 per cent. China is the only major country which registered a positive growth rate of 2.3 per cent in 2020.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-only-major-economy-to-see-double-digit-growth-in-2021-international-monetary-fund-204334

28-01-2021||New Delhi||Budget day march to Parliament cancelled by farmer unions||As cracks began to appear in their ongoing agitation against the agri laws, farmer unions on Wednesday cancelled their planned march to Parliament on February 1 when the Budget would be presented.The decision by farmer unions came a day after massive violence during their tractor parade in the national capital that left nearly 400 police personnel injured.The farmer leaders, however, alleged that there was a conspiracy behind Tuesday’s incidents and demanded a probe.They said their agitation against the farm laws will continue and public meetings and hunger strikes will be held across the country on January 30.“The tractor parade was hit by a government conspiracy. Deep Sidhu is an RSS man. Police let him go after he hoisted a religious flag at Red Fort,” farmer leader Darshan Pal, who has been accused by police of making inflammatory speeches, alleged at a press conference.Sidhu is a former aide of actor and BJP MP Sunny Deol. Deol had distanced himself from Sidhu in December after he supported the farmers’ agitation.“We have cancelled our plan for a march to Parliament on budget day on February 1. But our agitation will continue and there will be public meetings and hunger strike across the country on January 30,” Pal said.Another farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal claimed that over two lakh tractors and lakhs of people participated in Tuesday’s parade and “99.9 per cent of the protesters were peaceful”.Even as the farmer unions continued to allege that “anti-social” elements had perpetrated the violence to “torpedo” their peaceful agitation against the farm laws, Tuesday’s incidents that have been widely condemned started taking a toll with Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu) and All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee withdrawing from the protests on the Delhi’s borders.Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav, who has been supporting the farmers’ agitation, said, “We regret the Red Fort incident and accept its moral responsibility. The incident should be probed. There is a conspiracy behind it.”Responding to a question on farmer leaders being named in FIR, Yadav said, “FIR, jail and torture are rewards of movements”.“We have video clippings and we will expose how a conspiracy was hatched to defame our movement,” Shivkumar Kakka said.As many as 37 farmer leaders, including Rakesh Tikait, Yogendra Yadav, Darshan Pal and Gurnam Singh Charuni, have been named in an FIR in connection with the violence during the tractor parade.Wielding sticks and clubs and holding the tricolour and union flags, tens of thousands of farmers atop tractors broke barriers, clashed with police and entered the city from various points to lay siege to the Red Fort during the Republic Day.Farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28, demanding a complete repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/budget-day-march-to-parliament-cancelled-by-farmer-unions-204158

From Singhu border the farmers started coming to Mukarba Chowk at 7.30 am and refused to take the right turn as agreed upon earlier. Their leader Satnam Singh Pannu delivered provocative statements and once the speech ended he called upon everyone to break the barricades. Darshan Pal Singh sat at Mukarba Chowk refusing to turn right,” said Shrivastava, adding that no one will be spared if found guilty.He said so far 19 persons had been arrested, 50 detained and 25 plus criminal cases registered against the culprits. “CCTV footages are being analysed and face recognition systems used to identify the guilty. Investigations are underway,” the police commissioner said.Shrivastava said the police had urged the farm leaders to lead the tractor parade and be present with each group to control them but “farmers from all the borders betrayed the agreement and broke barricades to enter the city”.He said Delhi police’s decision to exercise restraint – as per the agreed upon terms with the farmers – ensured that not even one life was lost due to police action.Shrivastava accused farm leaders of handing over their stage on January 25 to militant elements who delivered provocative speeches making their intentions for January 26 clear.“We maintained extreme restraint because we wanted to facilitate a peaceful tractor parade as agreed on. The farmer leaders however did not honour any terms of the tractor parade,” Shrivastava said.On the Red Fort events the top cop said several farmers unions hoisted their flags and religious flags which are now case property.Among the terms agreed upon with farmer leaders in five meetings regarding the parade were – the parade will start at 12 noon and end to 5 pm; top leaders will lead; leaders will accompany every group; there will not be more than 5,000 tractors and no firearm or deadly weapon will be carried.“The farm union leaders had signed an undertaking to honour these terms but they did not,” said Shrivastava.He said the police had learnt of the tractor parade plan on January 2 and was since then engaged with the farmers. Five meetings were held; routes agreed on and undertakings signed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-one-will-be-spared-delhi-top-cop-names-pannu-tikait-darshan-pal-for-violation-of-tractor-parade-terms-204157
28-01-2021||---||Two farmer unions break away from farmers’ agitation||New Delhi, January 27In an aftermath of the Red Fort siege and violence on capital’s roads during the tractor parade on Tuesday, divisions surfaced in the farm unions’ camp on Wednesday with the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee and the BKU (Bhanu) quitting the ongoing protests and announcing their own plans to struggle for justice.AIKSCC chief VM Singh and BKU Bhanu’s Bhanu Pratap Singh today addressed a press conference to announce that their organisations were withdrawing from the ongoing farmers’ protests which had lost the legitimacy and the moral authority to continue after what happened yesterday.Asked if the entire AIKSCC was dissociating from protests, VM Singh said he was dissociating as the national president of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan (RKMS). VM Singh said his organisation will leave the Ghazipur protest site. Read also: Farmer leaders Rajewal, Ugrahan, Darshan Pal, Yogendra Yadav, Chudhni named in FIRs for Delhi violenceBoth AIKSCC and BKU (Bhanu) are Uttar Pradesh based organisations.Singh attacked BKU’s Rakesh Tikait for admitting to inciting violence and asking supporters to carry batons, sticks and flags to the parade besides breaking barricades yesterday and said, “We have not joined this agitation for people to die. The farmers are not here to do what we saw yesterday. They are not agitating for someone to become a political leader.”Singh asked whether BKU’s Rakesh Tikait who has attended all 10 dialogues with the government ever raised the concerns of sugarcane farmers with the Centre.Singh also slammed Tikait for breaking barricades asking, “Why did they start early for the parade?”Singh added, “Whoever has done the wrong yesterday needs to be acted against. Ours is an agriculture dominated nation. Our agitation will continue but not in the current form. We cannot run the agitation with those who have their own separate roads and plans. We are withdrawing from the agitation,” VM Singh said.The announcements came even as Samyukta Kisan Morcha was holding its own meeting amid signs that they would dissociate from some farm organisations after the mayhem on capital roads yesterday.Meanwhile, farmer unions said VM Singh was removed from post of convener of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) a month ago.VM Singh was accused of taking pro-government positions. On December 14, he was removed as convener of AIl India Kisan Sangarsh Coordination Committee.He is taking a decision on behalf of a committee he is no more a convener of, claimed unions.Meanwhile, sources said from Ghazipur most farmers have returned home. Earlier, where there were around 3,000 tractors. Currently, around 150 to 200 tractors are remaining.BKU president Naresh Tikait had returned to Muzaffarnagar yesterday itself, they added. Traffic is smooth on the Uttar Pradesh-Delhi highway.However, Rakesh Tikait has refused to go back saying that he plans to stay put till the end of the agitation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-farmer-unions-break-away-from-farmers-agitation-204127
