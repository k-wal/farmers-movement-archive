19-01-2021||London||BBC apologises for ‘incomplete’ India map after complaint||The BBC on Tuesday apologised for any offence caused and rectified what it termed as the mistaken use of an inaccurate map of India, which had the boundaries of Jammu and Kashmir entirely missing, triggering a formal letter of complaint by Labour Party MP Virendra Sharma.In a video broadcast about President-elect Joe Biden on BBC World Service entitled ‘US Election 2020: What do countries around the world want from Joe Biden’, the graphic depicting the map of India was incompletely highlighted in red with the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir missing.Sharma, who is also chair of the Indo-British All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG), termed the action as “deeply insulting” in a letter addressed to the Director General of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Tim Davie, and called for an explanation of the editorial guidelines followed.“This map shows an incomplete India, it does not highlight Jammu and Kashmir which is recognised as a core and integral part of India. To represent Jammu and Kashmir as anything less than Indian is deeply insulting to millions of Indians living here in the UK and in India,” read his letter, issued on Monday.It called on the BBC to withdraw the graphic and republish with the correct geographical boundaries and also called for action to prevent this happening again.“The BBC World Service is a fantastic resource, an amazing part of our soft-power and a real force for good around the world, this record is under threat if the World Service is perceived as partisan and ‘anti-India’ as is currently being asserted online. As a member of the International Development Select Committee, I have seen the great work the World Service can do, I do not want to see that put at risk,” added Sharma, who represents the heavily Indian diaspora constituency of Ealing-Southall in west London.His letter followed a social media outpouring over the issue, with members of the Indian diaspora demanding immediate action.The BBC responded with an apology and updated the online broadcast with the map of India reflecting the boundaries of Jammu and Kashmir in the standard format used by the news channel in the UK.“From London we mistakenly published a map of India online which contained inaccuracies and is not the standard map used by BBC News. It has now been corrected. We apologise for any offence caused,” a BBC spokesperson said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bbc-apologises-for-incomplete-india-map-after-complaint-200745

19-01-2021||New Delhi||BJP slams Rahul Gandhi; says Congress does not want that the farmer-government talks should succeed||Hitting back at Rahul Gandhi over his attack on the Narendra Modi government over the farm laws and national security, the ruling BJP on Tuesday accused him and the Congress of trying to scuttle the ongoing talks between the government and farmer unions.  Union minister Prakash Javadekar said the Congress does not want the talks to succeed and had resorted to “obstructive tactics”. He also attacked its booklet “Kheti ka khoon” saying that it proved the Congress party’s “special love for ‘khoon’ (blood)”. Referring to killings during the partition, 1984 anti-Sikh riots and Bhagalpur riots, he said it was hypocritical of Gandhi to be talking about ‘kheti ka khoon’ when Congress has blood on its hands of farmers who committed suicide during Congress rule, lakhs of people who died during the partition and of Sikhs during the 1984 riots.Javadekar said farmers have suffered due to “destructive” policies of the Congress while the Modi government empowered them with its “pro-farmer policies”.Taking a swipe at Gandhi over his claim that food prices will rise due to the government’s policies, he said over 80 crore people are getting rice and wheat at subsidised rates of Rs 3 and Rs 2 respectively.On Gandhi’s attack on the government over China’s alleged incursion into India, Javadeka questioned, “Why does he not answer on China…Who gave away land to China…Under whose rule did Aksai Chin go out of India’s hands…Who took money from China for a private trust….Who gave away India’s UNSC permanent seat to China”. Accusing him of running away from the questions asked by BJP president JP Nadda, Javadekar said Gandhi displayed his “usual indecency” while referring to the chief of the party.On Gandhi’s charge that three-four people enjoy a monopoly in the economy, Javadekar said during the Congress rule that one family ran the country while under the Modi government people are in power.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-slams-rahul-gandhi-says-congress-does-not-want-that-the-farmer-government-talks-should-succeed-200732

19-01-2021||---||Love Jihad: UP govt moves SC for transfer of petitions from Allahabad HC||New Delhi, January 19The Uttar Pradesh Government has moved the Supreme Court seeking transfer of petitions challenging its ordinance aimed at checking unlawful religious conversion for inter-faith marriages.The state government has invoked Article 139A of the Constitution which empowers the Supreme Court to transfer to itself cases “involving the same or substantially the same questions of law” pending before the Supreme Court and one or more high courts.The Supreme Court had on January 6 refused to stay provisions of an Uttar Pradesh Ordinance and an Uttarakhand law aimed at checking unlawful religious conversion for inter-faith marriages.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde had, however, issued notice to the two states asking them to respond in four weeks to petitions filed by Vishal Thakre and others and NGO Citizens for Justice and Peace challenging the controversial UP Ordinance and the Uttarakhand law.Terming the provisions as “oppressive” and “obnoxious” the petitioners alleged that several innocent persons had been arrested on the basis of UP Ordinance against ‘love jihad’.The top court was hearing PILs against the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020 and Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018 which criminalise fraudulent religious conversion for interfaith marriages.Promulgated in November last, the UP ordinance prescribes imprisonment from one year to 5 years, or Rs 15,000 fine (in normal cases) minimum three years and maximum 10 years, and fine of Rs 25,000, if the girl is a minor or from the SC/ST community.  It prescribes a jail term of minimum three years up to 10 years, and Rs 50,000 fine in cases involving mass religious conversion. The offence is cognizable and non-bailable.According to the Ordinance, no person shall convert or attempt to convert either directly or otherwise any other person from one religion to another by use/practice of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage nor shall any person abet, convince or conspire such conversion.The petitioners have also challenged the validity of the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018 which has similar provisions on the ground of alleged violation of fundamental rights of citizens, contending their provisions went against public policy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/love-jihad-up-govt-moves-sc-for-transfer-of-petitions-from-allahabad-hc-200715

I believe people can understand that and practice that,” she said.She said China attaches high importance to the protection of the rights of the overseas students.“We request the universities and the colleges to stay in communication with them and ensure the courses online and any other format,” she said.To a specific question about the plight of Indian students, especially those from the medical field who spent a great deal of money, Hua said, “I totally understand this situation including the difficulties faced by the Indian students. Indeed, such problems widely exist globally.“Many Chinese students spend much money on overseas studies but due to COVID-19 and they still cannot resume their studies overseas and they have to take online courses,” she said.“We are seeing the reality of the rising of the second wave of COVID-19 across the world.

After being expelled from the AIADMK, Dinakaran floated a new party called AMMK and is said to be holding considerable influence in many parts of central and southern Tamil Nadu.“If you really want to defeat DMK, all anti-DMK parties need to come together as full force,” they say.Palaniswami, who is beleived to have discussed prospects of the NDA alliance in the poll-bound state in his meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah during his  Delhi visit, insisted that politics was not discussed. He said the seat allocation between NDA partners will be decided after the announcement of the poll schedule, for which there is still time.  He said he had requested Modi to inaugurate various completed infrastructure projects and also lay the foundation stone for the new infrastructure projects in the state. With Shah, he said he sought funds for the relief measures for the farmers of Tamil Nadu affected by the cyclones and rainsWhile Palaniswami has already been named as the AIADMK’s chief minister face, the NDA is yet to make a formal announcement.Banking heavily on megastar Rajinikanth, the saffron party appears to have also changed tack regarding relations with regional ally AIADMK after his decision to stay away from politics. Saffron leaders, who had earlier been insisting that it is the NDA that will take call on the issue, now say their regional ally (that is the AIADMK) will decide the chief ministerial candidate for the Assembly elections due in April-May 2021. The AIADMK passed a resolution in its last general council that the incumbent CM will be its face for the forthcoming polls, according to reports.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/admk-wont-take-back-sasikala-says-palaniswami-200710

19-01-2021||New Delhi||Earlier expression of view does not mean that person cannot be appointed in committee: SC||An earlier expression of view does not mean that a person cannot be appointed in a particular committee on that issue as the opinion can also change, observed the Supreme Court on Tuesday.The remarks of the apex court, which also said there is a “peculiar lack of comprehension” about constitution of a panel, assumes importance as some of the members of the recently constituted committee to resolve the deadlock between farmers and the centre over the farm laws had earlier reportedly expressed their views on the subject.One of the members, Bhupinder Singh Mann, national president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, had last week said he was recusing himself from the four-member committee.However, a bench headed by chief justice S A Bobde, which was hearing another matter, said, “A committee is appointed and if the person has expressed his views earlier on the issue, then it does not mean that the person cannot be in the committee.”“There is a very peculiar lack of comprehension about constitution of a committee,” said the bench, also comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran, which was hearing a matter relating to inadequacies and deficiencies in criminal trials.The bench observed that one person may have a view on the issue before being part of the committee but that opinion can change.In an “extraordinary” interim order on January 12, the apex court had stayed the implementation of the new farm laws till further orders and constituted a four-member panel to listen to the grievances and make recommendations to resolve the impasse.The committee comprises of Bhupinder Singh Mann, National President of Bhartiya Kisan Union, All India Kisan Coordination Committee; Parmod Kumar Joshi, Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute; Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, and Anil Ghanwat, President of Shetkari Sanghatana.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a month now against the three laws—the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act.Enacted in September 2020, the government has presented these laws as major farm reforms aimed at increasing farmers’ income, but the protesting farmers have raised concerns that these legislations would weaken the minimum support price (MSP) and “mandi” (wholesale market) systems and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.The government has maintained that these apprehensions are misplaced and has ruled out a repeal of the laws.

19-01-2021||New Delhi||Vaccine hesitancy in health workers must stop: Centre||As India entered the third day of COVID vaccination drive the government lamented lack of enthusiasm among health workers to accept the shot and said it was sad that the health staffers were declining the vaccines in many states.Punjab had reported the lowest vaccine beneficiary coverage alongside Tamil Nadu and Puducherry even as more than 4.5 lakh beneficiaries received the vaccines by 5 pm on Tuesday.The better performers on vaccination (in terms of percentage of listed beneficiaries reached) are Lakshadweep 89.3 pc; Sikkim 85.7 pc; Odisha 82.6 pc; Andaman and Nicobar Islands N 81.9 pc; Telangana 81.1 pc; Dadra and Nagar Haveli 80.9 pc; Arunachal 75.4 pc; UP 71.45 pc; Rajasthan 71.3.The poor-performing states are Tamil Nadu 34.9 pc; Puducherry 34.6 pc and Punjab 27.9 pc.The Health Ministry said although the three-day vaccine coverage in India was the highest anywhere in the world---higher than the weeklong coverage in some countries---vaccine hesitancy must stop.“It is sad that some health workers are declining to take the vaccines when the world is clamouring for them. Here we have our own safe vaccines and yet health workers are not coming forward. This vaccine hesitancy must stop for the health system to become COVID proof and non COVID services and surgeries to restart," Member Health NITI Aayog said adding that he was perfectly fine after getting COVAXIN at AIIMS on day one.Paul said the platforms on which Covishield and COVAXIN have been developed are immunogenic and very safe.“This is a very reassuring sign and this should dispel natural anxieties among people. Do not refuse vaccination if you are listed. If you refuse, you are not understanding your societal role. I also wonder why someone would not want to protect themselves and their families,” Paul said.He said if doctors and nurses are declining vaccines, it is sad.“I appeal to them to accept the vaccines because we do not know what shape COVID will take. We have to start non COVID programmes. I have taken COVAXIN. I have zero effect. Our system to respond to adverse events following immunization is robust and we must trust it,” he said, asking health workers to accept the vaccines.“Vaccine hesitancy has to stop…If we accept vaccines, the wall of vaccine-induced herd immunity will start rising,” he added.India has so far vaccinated 454049 health workers and active COVID cases have fallen to 2 lakh after seven months.The daily number of deaths is now less than 140 after eight months while per day deaths are also reducing.Only two states – Kerala and Maharashtra have more than 50,000 active cases each.Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said India’s vaccination rollout has been smooth and encouraging considering the vaccine coverage of other nations on day one vis-à-vis India.While France had 73 vaccinations on day one the UK had 19700, US 79458 and India 2, 07, 229.‘The most important issue is that if we take the first week data for vaccinations, the US in the first seven days saw 5,56, 208 vaccinations. We will cross that number by tonight in just three days,” Bhushan said.He said the UK had vaccinated 1, 37, 857 in the first week; France 516 and Russia 52000. India has already vaccinated over 4.5 lakh people on day three.The government said adverse events had been seen in just 0.18 pc of the vaccinated and hospitalizations in 0.002 pc of the beneficiaries.“These adverse events are the lowest in the world in the first three days,” Bhushan said, assuring that Indian AEFI response system was robust and time tested.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccine-hesitancy-in-health-workers-must-stop-centre-200691

But I spent that amount to purchase an ambulance. I named the ambulance as Sonu Sood Ambulance Service because I was inspired by his good work," Shiva said.Sonu Sood, who was in the city, launched the free ambulance service and praised Shiva for his work and felt that more "heroes" like him are needed to help the society."I feel privileged that I came for this ambulance inauguration. All thanks to Shiva. I have heard a lot about him that he has been saving lives and helping people, and we need more Shivas (people like him) in our society, so everyone should come forward and help others," Sonu Sood told reporters.This ambulance service will also save many lives, the actor said adding the pandemic (coronavirus) has taught so much that in emergencies everyone has to come forward like a family and help others.People like Shiva, they inspire others, and they inspire the society.It feels happy that this (ambulance service) will also help a lot of needy people and help save many lives, Sonu Sood added.Shiva, has been living near Tank Bund for the past over two decades.Shiva started rescuing people who jump into the lake to commit suicide, following the death of his younger brother by drowning in another lake.He has also been helping the police in retrieving bodies from lakes, a police official said.Hailing actor Sonu Sood, as a 'Real Hero', villagers of Dubba Tanda of Siddipet district in Telangana built a temple and installed a bust in December 2020 admiring him for his work in helping migrants reach their homes amid the COVID-19 pandemic. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/swimmer-who-saved-people-from-suicides-starts-sonu-sood-ambulance-service-200690
19-01-2021||New Delhi||India hopes for relaxed US visa regime under Biden||One of the biggest policy issues which will set the tone for the US-India strategic relationship under the new Joe Biden administration is work visas for Indians.For many Indians, especially those in the information technology industry, America remains a dream destination India is hoping that Biden will fulfil his poll promise to lift all immigrant visa restrictions that President Donald Trump had imposed during his tenure in the last four years.Even as President-elect Biden has already indicated that he plans to reverse the Trump administration's immigration policies on day one of his assuming office, whether it will include any reprieve for Indians is not clear yet.Reports suggest that the Biden administration will pave the way for citizenship in eight years for around 11 million illegal immigrants in the US but under the Trump administration, their efforts to immigrate to the US faced severe challenges. President Trump's inward-looking policies aimed at 'Make America Great Again' resulted in several protectionist measures in employment and trade.The focus of his presidency remained jobs and business for Americans first.President Trump, however, gave huge concessions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on internal issues like Kashmir, CAA, and Ayodhya over which the Democrats in the US, took an offensive stand.During his visit to India last February, President Trump refrained from even commenting on the communal violence in New Delhi over CAA.He also did not push his way with the Indian policymakers over the trade deal that the US was expecting to sign with India during his trip.Though the US-India relationship thrived at multiple levels and in unprecedented ways under the Trump administration, immigration remained a sore issue between the two sides. The rejection rate of H-1B visa applications went up considerably after Trump issued a temporary ban on work visas following the coronavirus pandemic.Now that the Biden administration is assuming office on Wednesday, policymakers are hoping for a relaxed immigration regime for Indian workers, which could provide a firm foundation for the relationship that President Biden and Prime Minister Modi will share.US President-elect Joe Biden already made a huge impact on the Indian American community when he chose Kamala Harris—an American of Indian descent—as his running mate. Apart from projecting himself as the architect of the US-India nuclear deal, he made it a point through his election campaign to use occasions like Diwali to reach out to the Indian community.Overall, India has been enjoying due attention and respect from both sides of the political aisle in the US. But with the controversial presidential election in the US, where Trump supporters believe that the polls were rigged against him, the Biden presidency is likely to face tremendous challenges while executing its policies.The coronavirus pandemic has already put tremendous strain on the global economy including that of the US with Republicans and Democrats still at each other's throats especially after the US Congress approved impeachment of President Trump, whether President Biden will be able to have his way on immigration remains to be seen. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-hopes-for-relaxed-us-visa-regime-under-biden-200688

19-01-2021||New Delhi||Tesla arriving soon: What fans can expect in India||Your dream of owning a Tesla electric car will soon be a reality as the company is set to begin its India journey with its highest-selling Model 3, before the premium Model S and Model X, which would be available later in the year and in early 2022.Arriving in India via Tesla Motors Amsterdam that will give the electric car-maker tax benefits related to dividend payments and capital gains, the Model 3 may start from around Rs 60 lakh. The base Standard Range Plus model now claims a driving range of 423 km per charge, while the Long-Range Model 3 can give you 568 km range on one single charge. CarDekho.com has even listed the price of three Tesla models with their expected arrival: Tesla Model 3 from Rs 60 lakh in as early as March, Tesla Model S from Rs 1.5 crore in July and Model X from Rs 2 crore in early 2022. The India arrival dates and prices, however, have not been revealed by Tesla, which now has a registered office in Bengaluru. According to Prabhu Ram, Head-Industry Intelligence Group (IIG), CMR, Tesla's bold bet on India will supercharge and transform the country's mobility future.  "Over the short-term, Tesla's entry will give a boost to the government's policy initiatives, strengthen EV manufacturing in India, spur new mobility startups, and most importantly, fasten the development of enabling EV infrastructure," Ram told IANS. Tesla is setting up its research and development (R&D) centre in Bengaluru to commence its India operations. The Karnataka government had earlier made a strong pitch to invite Tesla to the state. Tesla is also in touch with other state governments in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh to start its India operations. The move will also open India to select as one of the countries where Tesla cars can be purchased. People are eying its most loved car Â– Model 3 Â– which is built from the ground up as an electric vehicle with ultra-high strength steel and a low, solid centre of gravity. Model 3 achieved a US NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) 5-star safety rating in every category and subcategory with its energy absorbent crash structure, rigid passenger compartment, incredible side impact protection and one of the lowest rollover risks of any sedan on the road. Model 3 comes with the option of dual motor all-wheel drive, 20-inch Uberturbine wheels and performance brakes and lowered suspension for total control in all weather conditions.  A carbon fibre spoiler improves stability at high speeds, allowing the Model 3 to accelerate from 0-96 km in as little as 3.1 seconds. A 15-minute recharge at a Supercharger location can get it ready to go for up to 280 km. The inside of Model 3 is unlike any other car. You can use your smartphone as a key, and access all driver controls in the central 15-inch touchscreen. The all-glass roof extends from front to back, creating a sense of openness from every seat. In the US, the warranty on the base Model 3 variant is four years or 50,000 miles (whichever comes first) and on the battery and drive unit, the warranty is 8 years or 120,000 miles (whichever comes first). The electric vehicle (EV) market in India is expected to reach over 63 lakh unit-mark per annum by 2027, according to a recent report by the India Energy Storage Alliance (IESA). The demand for the batteries is also going to rise substantially over the same period. The EV sales in India stood at 3.8 lakh units in 2019-20, and the EV battery market reached 5.4GWh during the year. Tesla's entry will only boost the EV sector. "Over the long-term, India stands to leapfrog the current conventional mobility and build a strong foundation for e-mobility. With India's advanced capabilities in manufacturing and information technology, the country is potentially poised for success and lead the world in the post-Covid future," Ram noted. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tesla-arriving-soon-what-fans-can-expect-in-india-200678
19-01-2021||Mumbai||Centre should take note of Arnab’s purported chats: Deshmukh||Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Tuesday said the Centre should take note of the purported chats between Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and ex-Broadcast Audience Research Council head Partho Dasgupta in connection with Balakot air strike.The matter is “serious” as it relates to the national security, Deshmukh told reporters here, and later, in a tweet, said the state government will also take legal advice on this matter as “it is evident that they were privy to the plan related to national security”.The purported chats widely reported in media mentioned that Goswami was privy to the Balakot air strikes.Deshmukh’s remarks came after a Maharashtra Congress delegation led by state party spokesperson Sachin Sawant met him here, seeking a probe into the matter and registration of a case if necessary, for allegedly “leaking sensitive and classified information” about national security.Sawant also demanded Goswami’s immediate arrest in this connection.After the delegation met him, Deshmukh told reporters that, “It is a very serious matter. It is an issue of national security. The Centre definitely needs to take note of it.”Later, the minister in a tweet said, “We will also take legal advice on this matter as it is evident that they were privy to the plan related to National security.”           “The state government will take further legal action after discussions with senior police officials,” he added.In its memorandum submitted to Deshmukh, the Congress delegation said it is a matter of “gross concern” that Goswami was allegedly not only privy to the information of the highest secrecy regarding national security operations of the armed forces, but was also “openly sharing” it with Dasgupta.The Congress asked how Goswami could allegedly access the information about the Indian Air Force’s cross-border air strike in Pakistan days before it happened shows “compromise” of national security of the highest order.“We wish to request you to kindly order an inquiry and register a case if necessary under the Official Secrets Act- 1923 against Goswami for leaking sensitive and classified information about a national security Armed Forces operation to an unauthorised person days before it happened,” the memorandum said.Sawant alleged in a statement issued later that Goswami knew about the air strike three days in advance of it.“How come Goswami knew such a confidential and sensitive information? This is a kind of treason and Goswami should be arrested immediately,” Sawant said.The Congress delegation also accused the Republic TV of illegally using the satellite frequencies of Doordarshan without allegedly paying up-linking fees and reaching millions of additional subscribers for free in an illegal manner.“This matter of gross manipulation and causing losses of crores to the Indian taxpayers by using DD frequencies illegally needs to be investigated together with the TRP scam as it clearly points to a pattern of manipulating the law in the interest of greater eyeballs by Republic TV,” the delegation alleged in the memorandum.On Monday, the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) asked the government to set up a Joint Parliamentary Committee to probe the purported chats between Goswami and Dasgupta.Dasgupta was earlier arrested in the fake Television Rating Point (TRP) case.The Mumbai police earlier told a court that Goswami had allegedly bribed Dasgupta with lakhs of rupees to ramp up Republic TV’s viewership. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-should-take-note-of-arnabs-purported-chats-deshmukh-200676
19-01-2021||New Delhi||HC asks MEITY, CPIOs to reply to plea seeking details of Aarogya Setu app under RTI Act||The Delhi High Court Tuesday sought response from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and CPIOs of its various departments on a plea seeking details of Aarogya Setu mobile application.The high court, which observed that the issue of Aarogya Setu application is of “public importance,” was hearing the plea also challenging the Central Information Commission’s (CIC) order discharging show-cause notices against MEITY officers without hearing the complainant.The high court was of the prima facie view that the November 24, 2020 order of CIC was clearly passed without according hearing to the RTI activist who has filed a complaint with the commission after various government agencies failed to answer his RTI application seeking details of Aarogya Setu application which was launched on April 2, 2020 by the government, post the outbreak of COVID-19.Justice Prathiba M Singh issued notices and sought responses of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) and Central Public Information Officers (CPIO) of the ministry, National E-Governance Division (NeGD), Department of Electronics and eGov and National Informatics Centre.The high court directed the counsel for petitioner and RTI activist Saurav Das and various agencies to place a chart setting out the information sought by him, provided to him and yet to be provided and listed the matter for further hearing on February 24.Das, who is also a journalist, in his plea, has sought to set aside the final order passed by CIC on November 24, 2020, dropping penal proceedings against the CPIOs of various agencies for obstructing access to public records relating to the Aarogya Setu app under the Right To Information (RTI) Act.Advocate Vrinda Bhandari, representing the petitioner, sought direction to the CIC to provide an opportunity to him to participate in the show cause/penalty proceedings so that he can demonstrate the inadequate, incomplete, and false representations made by the CPIOs of the departments regarding the information sought for being in the public domain.Advocate Rahul Sharma, representing the ministry and various CIPOs of its department, submitted that a substantial amount of information is already available in public domain about the Aarogya Setu app and a large number of documents were placed before the CIC which led to discharge of show cause notices against the officers.The plea sought a direction to the CIC to conduct a fresh hearing under the provisions of the RTI Act after providing an adequate opportunity to the petitioner to be heard.It also sought to direct the CPIO of Department of Electronics and eGov to provide the information sought by him in his August 1, 2020 RTI application.The journalist had filed multiple RTI application seeking details pertaining to creation of the government’s contract tracing app Aarogya Setu. When he did not receive any reply, he approached the CIC with his grievances.In October last year, he was told by the authorities that the information relating to Aarogya Setu was not held by their respective departments and the CIC had then issued show-cause notice to the CPIOs after hearing the petitioner’s submissions, as to why penalty under the RTI Act should not be imposed on them for not adequately answering the RTI application.The RTI application has sought several details regarding the making of the government’s contract tracing app Aarogya Setu and the people behind it. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-asks-meity-cpios-to-reply-to-plea-seeking-details-of-aarogya-setu-app-under-rti-act-200674
19-01-2021||New Delhi||Cigarettes bad for health, smoking-vegetarianism-COVID link not fully understood: Scientists||A pan-India CSIR survey suggests that smoking and a vegetarian diet may provide protection against COVID-19, but there is no cause for either group to celebrate with scientists as well authors of the study cautioning that this is an observation and requires further research.Smoking is bad for health. Period. And the link between vegetarianism, smoking and less COVID-19 sero-positivity is only a reported association, stressed Anurag Agarwal, director of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrated Biology (CSIR-IGIB) and one of the authors of the survey. Sero-positivity means a positive result for antibodies in a blood test.The CSIR paper, yet to be peer-reviewed or published, also cites two studies from France and similar reports from Italy, New York and China, which reported lower infection rates among smokers.“There is some such data elsewhere for smoking. There are many (studies) that have found the opposite too. As I said this is an association. Smokers and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at greater risk of death. We do not advocate smoking,” Agarwal told PTI.“Most importantly, low sero-positivity can be due to lower production or faster loss of antibodies also. The topic needs further study,” he clarified.The CSIR survey, reported earlier this week, tracked about 10,000 of its employees on the prevalence of COVID-19, and found that nearly 10 per cent of the staff had antibodies.The study also found that smoking and vegetarianism are associated with lower chances of contracting the virus. It did not go into scientific details of why and how beyond reporting the observations.“Use of private transport, lower-exposure occupations, smoking, vegetarianism and ‘A’ or ‘O’ blood groups appeared to be protective, using sero-positivity as a surrogate for infection,” the authors of the pan-India survey said.For its study, CSIR took samples of 10,427 adult individuals working in its laboratories or institutions and their family members, based on voluntary participation, to assess the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.The study, piloted by CSIR-IGIB, Delhi, found that 1,058 (10.14 per cent) of the 10,427 had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The study did not specify how many of these are smokers or vegetarians.Agarwal said the study suggests that declining infections in India by October end last year may be linked to sub-community level immunity.“Most importantly, low sero-positivity can be due to lower production or faster loss of antibodies also. The topic needs further study,” he added.(Click here for the latest developments on COVID-19 epidemic)The key takeaway from the study, Agarwal said, is to be cautious since the disease spreads very fast and easily, and there is some optimism that the worst is behind us.He added that the antibody stability for six months found in the study is a good sign.Reacting to the conclusions drawn from the survey, immunologist Satyajit Rath noted that the research paper treats sero-positivity, or the presence of antibodies, as a surrogate for exposure to the virus, and sero-negativity as an evidence of protection against the pathogen conferred by smoking, vegetarianism, and other factors.“Nobody would interpret sero-negativity as evidence of protection, but only as lack of exposure,” Rath told PTI.Classically, sero-positivity is interpreted as evidence of prior exposure, not as evidence of susceptibility, he explained.“All interpretations about so-called roles for blood groups, smoking, and vegetarianism appear to be based on this incorrect interpretation,” Rath, from Delhi’s National Institute of Immunology (NII), added.A review of 174 cohort studies in August revealed an unexpected low number of current smokers among subjects tested for SARS-CoV-2 infections. The prevalence of current smokers suffering from symptomatic COVID-19 was frequently significantly lower than in the general population, it said.          Cohort study is a type of panel study where the individuals in the panel share a common characteristic. The World Health Organisation (WHO) associates smoking with an adverse progression of COVID-19 and has in the past called on people to quit smoking.There are also many published studies which suggest that quitting smoking might reduce the risk of a severe coronavirus infection.According to a study published in the journal Developmental Cell in May, cigarette smoke spurs the lungs to make more of the receptor protein which the novel coronavirus uses to enter human cells.The findings may explain why smokers appear to be particularly vulnerable to severe COVID-19, the researchers of the study said.Another study published in the journal Cell Stem Cell in November, pointed out that smoking cigarettes causes more severe infection by the novel coronavirus in the airways of the lungs.“In the absence of specifically designed studies, any hypothesis on the effect of smoking/nicotine uptake on symptomatic COVID-19 remains speculative,” according to an editorial published in the journal ‘Tobacco Induced Diseases’.While there isn’t much scientific literature on the effect of vegetarian diet on chances of getting ill with COVID-19, the CSIR study does suggest that vegetarianism is associated with less COVID-19 sero-positivity.K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, told PTI in an earlier interview that there is no proof at the moment that vegetarians are protected against COVID-19.However, he said people who take a lot of fruits and vegetables as part of their natural diet have better innate immunity, and might be able to fight the infection much better.According to immunologist Vineeta Bal, while the CSIR study provides useful data, there are some limitations to it.“The study is family based—transmission within the family is an important parameter in such a situation and data provides no information about it. Family as a unit is also important while analysing parameters such as smoking, food habits etc,” Bal, visiting professor at Pune’s Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, told PTI.“Samples are also primarily city based. Male-female ratios don’t reflect the population distribution. These concerns are important from a public health perspective as recommendations for issuing guidelines about food, smoking etc. should have a more sound and wider basis,” she said.She also noted that the CSIR study is an observational one and such studies can only highlight associations.“More focused studies will be needed to strengthen or refute observations reported in this study. In any case, I think it is premature to derive public guidelines out of this study for people to make an informed choice,” Bal said.

19-01-2021||New Delhi||We’ll keep our personal views on farm laws aside; repeal not good for future reforms: Members of SC-appointed panel||Under attack from protesting unions for their “pro-government” public stand on three contentious farm laws, members of a panel set up by the Supreme Court to resolve the crisis said on Tuesday they will keep aside their own ideology and views while consulting various stakeholders, even as they indicated a complete repeal won’t augur well for much-needed agriculture reforms.A key committee member and president of Maharashtra-based Shetkari Sanghatana, Anil Ghanwat said the farm sector reforms are much needed and no political party in the next 50 years will ever attempt them again if these laws are repealed.He, however, added the panel will listen to all farmers, including those supporting and those opposing the laws, and accordingly prepare a report for submitting to the apex court.He also said that the laws implemented in the last 70 years were not in the interest of farmers and about 4.5 lakh farmers have committed suicide.“Farmers are getting poor and are under debt. Some changes are needed. Those changes were happening but the protest began,” he added.After their first meeting here, Ghanwat said the first round of consultations with farmers and other stakeholders has been scheduled for Thursday.Noting that the “biggest challenge” is to convince the protesting farmers to appear before the panel, Ghanwat said they will be still given a priority as the panel wants the long-running protest to end at the earliest.Agri-economists Ashok Gulati and Pramod Kumar Joshi are the other two members of the panel who were present in the meeting.The Supreme Court had set up the four-member panel on January 11 to look into the contentious three farm laws, against which thousands are protesting on Delhi borders for almost two months now. But one of the members, Bhupinder Singh Mann, later backed out of the panel.Separately, nine rounds of talks have taken place between the government and agitating unions without any concrete resolution, while the tenth round is scheduled to be held on Wednesday.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting on Delhi borders for almost two months against the three laws enacted in September last year. They have alleged these laws will end the mandi and MSP procurement systems and leave the farmers at the mercy of big corporates, even as the government has rejected these apprehensions as misplaced.Briefing media after their meeting, Ghanwat said, “In today’s meeting, we have decided to hold our first meeting with farmers and other stakeholders on January 21 at 11 am. We will meet both physically and virtually depending on the convenience of farmers.”             Besides farmers, the panel will seek views of farmers’ bodies and other stakeholders such as farm exporters, traders, millers, ginners, dairy and poultry industry on the new farm laws, in addition to the central and state governments, he said, adding that a website will also be launched to invite suggestions.“The biggest challenge is to convince the agitating farmers to come and speak with us. We will try our level best and we will definitely want to speak with them,” Ghanwat said.It is not clear as yet whether an apex court-appointed panel can meet the protesting farmers at their place if they don’t appear before us, but the committee members wish to meet them and try to convince them, he added.On protesting farmers’ allegations that the panel members were “pro-government” and have openly expressed their support for the three laws in the past, Ghanwat said, “It is their view. Whatever might have been our earlier ideology, now we are on the Supreme Court-appointed panel. We cannot be one-sided.”        “Panel members will keep their personal views on farm laws aside while preparing a report to be submitted to the Supreme Court. ...Our duty is to listen to both sides and not impose our ideology,” he said.The committee has been appointed by the Supreme Court and it is up to the apex court whom to appoint, he said on whether any replacement would be made for Mann.Gulati said all members of the panel are “equal” and ruled out the appointment of a chairman of the panel.He said whatever are the best views and the collective wisdom of the committee on the farm laws, and also views of farmers and other stakeholders, that need to be collated and put in a proper framework and communicated to the Supreme Court.“That’s what we have to do. That’s our prime job,” Gulati said.Joshi said, “Our views may be different. When a responsibility like this is given by the court, we have to work in an unbiased and transparent way. In the report, we cannot give our views and that is very clear.”  He also said the committee is hopeful of completing the report within two months, as directed by the Supreme Court.Ghanwat said, “We have been given a responsibility and we will fulfil it properly. We want to request those farmers who don’t want to come before us that we are neither from any party nor from the government side. We are from the Supreme Court side,” he said.“People are dying in the cold. We don’t want this (protest) to continue not because of any political reasons but I am a farmer and I have been agitating for so many years too. When lives are lost in agitation, it is very disappointing and heartbreaking,” Ghanwat said.Ghanwat said his own organisation was also not fully in favour of the laws and it wanted some changes.“But, if the laws are repealed, no party that will come to power in the next 50 years will ever show courage to attempt to bring these reforms again. Farmers will continue to die. If we want change, come and talk to us. We will try to fully deliver what you want,” he said adding that reforms are needed to end the exploitative system in the agriculture sector.“To bring these changes, cooperate with the committee... We are one. I am also a farmer leader. To help Punjab farmers, many times I mobilised thousands of farmers from Maharashtra. There is no rivalry. We had an ideology, now it is not there...,” he said and added there will not be peace in the country when farmers are not able to live happily. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/well-keep-our-personal-views-on-farm-laws-aside-repeal-not-good-for-future-reforms-members-of-sc-appointed-panel-200663

China has a clear strategic vision. They want to shape the world. India has no strategic vision. China has tested India twice in Doklam and now in Ladakh. I am telling you unless India gives China a clear message and frames a strategy, China won’t sit silent. They will exploit the situation and the damage will be done. People will face the results. A dangerous situation is developing,” Gandhi said at a press conference amid satellite imagery-based reports of China building a village in Arunachal Pradesh.Gandhi said he was raising a red flag to the government that China was in Indian territory.“You think you can handle this with event management, you are mistaken. China is something else. China wishes to dominate and is working systematically. Your words are not going to matter. Your job is to protect India and you are not doing your job,” Gandhi said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dangerous-situation-developing-with-china-rahul-200644
19-01-2021||Aditi Tandon||With farmers out on roads, India has become a laughing stock: Rahul||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 19On the day the Supreme Court-appointed committee on farm issue began its deliberations, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has said India has become a laughing stock with farmers of the country sitting on the roads in harsh winters, and that the repeal of the controversial farm laws is the only way out of the deadlock.Addressing a press conference at the AICC headquarters on Tuesday, Gandhi accused the government of spawning monopolies and said four to five capitalist friends of Prime Minister Narendra Modi were now owning India.“Millions do not accept the nonsense that is going on. They understand the massive failures taking place. We are a laughing stock. We cannot give people jobs. Farmers are sitting on the roads in the cold and I do not understand why the Prime Minister feels this is something to be proud of. He is destroying the vision Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress painstakingly made for India. He is throwing that vision to the winds,” said Gandhi, calling upon youngsters to see the “tragedy unfolding in the country in the form of monopolies”.“This is not about the present. It is about the future. What we are seeing today across sectors from airports, infrastructure, power, telecom and retail is the development of massive monopolies in the country. I mean three, four, five people are now owning this country. This country is now owned by a limited group of people, who I call crony capitalists and have close relations with the Prime Minister, and who provide the Prime Minister media support,” he said, adding that agriculture was the last of the protected bastions to be overrun by these monopolies.Describing the agitating farmers as patriots working to protect the country, Gandhi said it was tragic that the country was “watching the ridiculous show”.“Why are the farmers of Punjab and Haryana standing there? Who are they? They are patriots protecting the livelihoods of people. I support them 100 per cent. Every single Indian should support them because they are fighting for us and for protecting the country from falling into the hands of few industrialists,” he noted adding that if the farm laws were to go through, the prices of essential commodities would rise.Asked if the Congress would seek an all-party meet to break the ongoing deadlock between the Centre and the farmers, Gandhi said there was no deadlock. “The government believes they can tire the farmers out and that the farmers can be fooled. Farmers cannot be tired out or fooled. They are wiser than the Prime Minister. There is only one solution, no other — the laws will have to be repealed,” said Gandhi adding that the Congress respected the ongoing farm agitation and was exerting pressure on the government in its own ways.Congress senior leader Rahul Gandhi addresses a press conference at the AICC headquarters in New Delhi on Tuesday. Tribune Photo: Manas Ranjan BhuiHe alleged that the farmers were the first of the government towards monopolisation of sectors and there was more to come.“You will understand this when you become slaves,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/with-farmers-out-on-roads-india-has-become-a-laughing-stock-rahul-200643

19-01-2021||Noida (UP)||Another FIR against makers, artists of Tandav web series in UP||An FIR has been lodged against makers and artists of Amazon Prime's web series “Tandav” in Uttar Pradesh's Greater Noida, police said on Tuesday.This is at least the third FIR to be filed in Uttar Pradesh against the makers of the web series.The complainant in the fresh case, lodged around 10 pm on Monday, alleges inappropriate depiction of UP Police personnel, Hindu deities, and adverse portrayal of a character playing the prime minister in the political drama, according to the FIR.In the latest FIR at Rabupura in Greater Noida, the accused have been booked, among others, under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, according to the FIR accessed by PTI.The FIR names as accused the series' director Ali Abbas Zafar, Amazon Prime's India head Aparna Purohit, producer Himanshu Kishan Mehra, writer Gaurav Solanki and actors Saif Ali Khan, Dimple Kapadia and Sunil Grover.Greater Noida Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajesh Kumar Singh said, “A local resident has made a complaint at the Rabupura police station in Greater Noida over depiction of Dalit insult, casteism and content inflammatory to religious sentiments in the web series 'Tandav' besides showing people on high-positions engaging in inappropriate talks.”          “An FIR has been lodged against the director of the web series, Amazon Prime's India head, the actors and writer. Since the SC/ST Act has also been invoked in the FIR, a gazetted officer will probe the case,” Singh added.The FIR has been lodged under Indian Penal Code sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 505(1)-1B (making any statement, rumour or report with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public), 505(2) (statements conducing to public mischief).                Charges under the Information Technology Act have also been invoked in the case, according to the FIR.The cast and crew of “Tandav”, faced with FIRs in Uttar Pradesh and social media clamour by a section demanding the series' ban, had on Monday issued an “unconditional apology” if their fictional show had unintentionally hurt sentiments.On Monday, an FIR was lodged at Hazratganj police station in Lucknow against Amazon's India head of original content, Aparna Purohit, series director Ali Abbas, producer Himanshu Krishna Mehra, writer Gaurav Solanki, and an unknown person on Sunday night.Another FIR was lodged in Shahjahanpur against Abbas and actors Saif Ali Khan and Zeeshan Ayyub on a complaint by BJP MLA Vikram Veer Singh from Katra constituency at Katra police station.

19-01-2021||New Delhi||India asks WhatsApp to withdraw changes to privacy policy||The Indian government has asked WhatsApp to withdraw the recent changes in the privacy policy of the messaging app, saying unilateral changes are unfair and unacceptable.In a strongly worded letter to WhatsApp CEO Will Cathcart, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said India is home to the largest user base of WhatsApp globally and is one of the biggest markets for its services.The proposed changes to the WhatsApp Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, without giving users an option to opt-out, "raise grave concerns regarding the implications for the choice and autonomy of Indian citizens," it wrote.The ministry asked WhatsApp to withdraw the proposed changes and reconsider its approach to information privacy, freedom of choice and data security.WhatsApp had on January 16 delayed the introduction of the new privacy policy after user backlash over sharing of user data and information with the parent company, Facebook Inc.Stating that Indians should be properly respected, the ministry said, "any unilateral changes to the WhatsApp Terms of Service and Privacy would not be fair and acceptable." With over 400 million users in India, the changes will have a disproportionate impact on the country's citizens, it said.It asked WhatsApp to provide details of the services provided by it in India, categories of data collected and permissions and consents sought.Also, WhatsApp has been asked to explain if it conducts profiling of Indian users on the basis of their usage, as well as explain the difference between the privacy policy in India and other countries.WhatsApp has also been asked to provide policy on data and information security, privacy and encryption.It has also been asked to detail data sharing with other apps and if it captures information about other apps running on the mobile phones of the user.Besides, complete technical architecture and server hosting data of Indian users have been asked to be furnished along with details of access to a third party.The changes "enable WhatsApp, and other Facebook companies, to make invasive and precise inferences about users which may not be reasonably foreseen or expected by users in the ordinary course of assessing these services, the ministry said.The updated terms would enable WhatsApp to collect "highly invasive and granular metadata" such as time, frequency and duration of interactions, group names, payments and transaction data, online status, location indicators as well as any messages shared by users with business accounts."The collection and onward sharing with Facebook companies, of sensitive personal data of individuals portends an ecosystem where any meaningful distinction between companies and WhatsApp will cease to exist," it said."This approach has the potential to infringe on core values of data privacy, user choice and autonomy of Indian users," it said.WhatsApp had earlier this month begun asking its 2 billion users worldwide to accept an update of its privacy policy if they want to keep using the popular messaging app.The new terms caused an outcry among technology experts, privacy advocates and users and triggered a wave of defections to rival services such as Signal.In the updated policy, it got a right to share data it collected from WhatsApp users with the broader Facebook network, which includes Instagram, regardless of owning any accounts or profiles there.Some businesses, as per the new policy, were to use Facebook-owned servers to store messages.This triggered an outcry regardless of WhatsApp's assertion that all private messages between friends and family members remain end-to-end encrypted.Stating that the changes proposed create systemic vulnerability, the ministry said the government expects WhatsApp "to take all information security safeguards as per law".It went on to state that the Personal Data Protection Bill is being discussed by a joint committee of the Parliament and making "a momentous change for its Indian users at this time puts the cart before the horse."Also, Indian users are being subjected to differential treatment when compared to their European counterparts where the changes do not apply."By not providing Indian users with the ability to opt-out of this data sharing with other Facebook companies, WhatsApp is treating users with an 'all-or-nothing' approach," the ministry said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-asks-whatsapp-to-withdraw-changes-to-privacy-policy-200631
19-01-2021||New Delhi||Government looking into WhatsApp privacy policy changes: Prasad||Amid a user backlash over a new privacy policy of WhatsApp, the Indian government on Tuesday said it is looking into the changes made by the popular messaging app, and asserted that sanctity of personal communication needs to be maintained.Speaking at the 15th India Digital Summit, Communications, Electronics and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad noted that national security will be central with regard to exposure of international companies, including those from China, in the country.WhatsApp has drawn massive criticism from users globally, including India over concerns that data was being shared with its parent company, Facebook. WhatsApp, on its part, has maintained that messages on the platform are end-to-end encrypted and that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook can see the private messages on WhatsApp’s platform.“This is an issue that my department is (working) on, and being the final authority, it will not be proper for me to make comments. But except to flag one thing very clearly. Be it WhatsApp, be it Facebook, be it any digital platform. You are free to do business in India but do it in a manner without impinging upon the rights of Indians who operate there,” Prasad said.He added that the sanctity of personal communications needs to be maintained.“I’ve only spoken on principles, given that my department is working. I have to await that,” he said.Earlier this month, WhatsApp had informed users of an update in its terms of service and privacy policy around how it processes user data and partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the social media giant’s products. Users had till February 8, to agree to the new terms in order to continue using the platform.However, WhatsApp drew flak from users across the globe, including India that ranks among the biggest markets for WhatsApp with over 400 million users.Following this, WhatsApp has now decided to delay the rollout of its new policy update to May 15, and said it will “do a lot more to clear up the misinformation around how privacy and security works on WhatsApp”.WhatsApp had also stated that it is open to answering any questions from the government on the issue and that it remains committed to the privacy and security of users across India.Asked about participation of Chinese companies in offering their products in India, Prasad said: “it will neither be prudent nor desirable for me to take the name of any country, except to highlight the general policy initiative which we are following”.“Yes, we banned apps because the issue was data privacy, issue was national security, issue was national sovereignty. Therefore, in any exposure of companies, national security angle will also be taken, be it private or government. As far as the relevant financial routes are concerned, some changes have also taken place with regard to countries having physical adjacency with India,” he said.Sharing his views about data, Prasad said data must be procured through free consent, it must be used for the objective for which it has been collected, and the data fiduciary who has procured that data must ensure proper safety and sanctity of that data.“I do acknowledge the implicit need for data movement across the globe to keep digital commerce intact. But the ground rule of that movement must be very clearly laid out. Next, there must be reciprocity in the data sharing of the world. And again, we shall never compromise on our digital sovereignty,” he said.Prasad said India produces billions of data with its population of 1.3 billion people.“I want India to become a big centre of data economy in the future. When I talk about the data economy, I mean data cleaning, data processing and data innovation. India has huge potential to become a data refinery... Therefore, the data economy must prosper in India by developing a complete ecosystem,” he said.He further stated that the “world is also looking towards our data law which we are going to bring very soon”.The Minister also spoke of the success of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme. He said the scheme was launched during the height of COVID in April 2020 and “... all the top companies have applied, and they have committed to making mobile phones and equipment worth Rs 10 lakh crores in the coming five years out of which Rs 7 lakh crore is for exports.“India is today the hub of mobile manufacturing and this process is irreversible... India must become the biggest manufacturing centre of laptops, of machine 2 machine equipment, of tablets etc. I want to develop that ecosystem – from mobile phones, to smart phones to laptops to tablets to IoT devices. India must become a huge center of these equipment manufacturing,” he said.On 5G, the Minister urged Indian players to create an Indian 5G model.“As far as 5G is concerned, 5G is still evolving. We missed 2G and 3G but we don’t want to miss 5G. Therefore, we developed an Indian test bed, and IITs are involved, so that all innovative aspects of 5G can be considered... Indian players must be proactive in creating an Indian 5G model,” he said.He added that 5G must be developed in order to enable inclusive character of its processes for sectors like healthcare, education and agriculture. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-looking-into-whatsapp-privacy-policy-changes-prasad-200628
19-01-2021||New Delhi||BJP chief poses questions for Rahul on China, farmers and COVID-19||BJP president J P Nadda on Tuesday hit back at Rahul Gandhi for his barb on the Modi government over national security and also targeted the Congress leader over a host of issues, including agriculture and COVID-19.Gandhi has attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the issue of national security after reports that China has built a village in Arunachal Pradesh."When will Rahul Gandhi, his dynasty and Congress stop lying on China? Can he deny that thousands of kms, including the one in Arunachal Pradesh he is referring to was gifted by none other than Pandit Nehru to the Chinese? Time and again, why does Congress surrender to China?" Nadda tweeted.The BJP chief also accused Gandhi of "provoking and misleading" farmers and asked why did the Congress-led UPA government "stall" the Swaminathan Commission report for years and did not increase the minimum support price (MSP)."Why did farmers remain poor for decades under Congress governments? Does he feel sympathy for farmers only in opposition?" he asked.Nadda said now that Gandhi has returned from his "monthly vacation", he would like to ask him some questions.Now that Mr. @RahulGandhi has returned from his monthly vacation, I would like to ask him some questions. I hope he will answer them in his today’s Press Conference."Does Rahul Gandhi have any intention to cancel the Congress party MoU with China and their Communist Party? Does he intend to return the Chinese largesse to trusts controlled by his family? Or will their policies and practices continue to be dictated by Chinese money and MoU?" the BJP chief asked."Rahul Gandhi spared no opportunity to demotivate the nation in the spirited fight against COVID-19. Today when India has one of the lowest cases and our scientists have come up with a vaccine, why hasn't he congratulated the scientists and lauded 130 crore Indians even once?" he asked on Twitter.Nadda alleged that Gandhi has been spreading lies that all Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) mandis will be closed down and asked him that wasn't action against the APMC Act a part of the Congress manifesto.Would that not have closed down mandis, he questioned the Congress leader."Rahul Gandhi enjoyed Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu. Why did his party ban it and insult Tamil culture when they were in power? Is he not proud of India's culture and ethos? I hope Rahul Gandhi gathers the courage to answer these questions," Nadda said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-chief-poses-questions-for-rahul-on-china-farmers-and-covid-19-200620

The vaccination at the remaining five centres in the city started at 10 am,” he said.He also said the administration was trying to conduct more vaccinations than the designated target of 100 per day at bigger medical facilities in Pune, like the Sassoon Hospital and the Kamla Nehru Hospital.On the first day of the inoculation on Saturday, a total of 1,802 beneficiaries out of the targeted 3,100 were given vaccine doses in Pune.Over 300 people had later complained of minor side- effects, as per the district administration.

The government has also given a nod for specialised training and capacity building of the CSMRS scientists at Swansea University, UK, and Norwegian Geotechnical Institute Oslo, Norway.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jal-shakti-ministry-reviews-water-resources-projects-across-nation-200610
19-01-2021||New Delhi||Climate change may change rainfall patterns in south India, intensify floods: Study||Future climate change will cause an uneven shifting of the tropical rain belt — a narrow band of heavy precipitation near the Earth’s equator — leading to increased flooding in parts of India, a new study warns.The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, examined computer simulations from 27 state-of-the-art climate models and measured the tropical rain belt’s response to a future scenario, in which greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise through the end of the current century.According to the research, a northward shift of the tropical rain belt over eastern Africa and the Indian Ocean could result in “intensified flooding in southern India”, and may impact global biodiversity and food security by 2100.The scientists, including those from the University of California (UC) Irvine in the US, said this “sweeping shift” of the rain belt was disguised in previous studies that provided a global average of the influence of climate change.However, they said climate change caused the atmosphere to heat up by different amounts over Asia and the North Atlantic Ocean.The current study highlighted the drastic alterations to come over future decades in India by isolating the response in the Eastern and Western Hemisphere zones.“In Asia, projected reductions in aerosol emissions, glacier melting in the Himalayas and the loss of snow cover in northern areas brought on by climate change will cause the atmosphere to heat up faster than in other regions,” said study co-author James Randerson from UC Irvine.“We know that the rain belt shifts toward this heating and that its northward movement in the Eastern Hemisphere is consistent with these expected impacts of climate change,” Randerson said.According to the scientists, the study combined the engineering approach of system’s thinking with data analytics and climate science to reveal subtle manifestations of global warming on regional rainfall extremes.“The complexity of the Earth system is daunting, with dependencies and feedback loops across many processes and scales,” said Efi Foufoula-Georgiou, another co-author of the study from UCI.

19-01-2021||Chandigarh||Modi govt should serve NIA notice on Arnab, not farmers: Jakhar||Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Sunil Jakhar on Tuesday criticised the BJP-led Union government for serving notices to the “peacefully” protesting farmers through the National Investigation Agency (NIA) while letting off journalist Arnab Goswami.“If anyone deserves to be investigated by the NIA right now it is Arnab Goswami who not only breached the Official Secrets Act but also compromised national security by sharing classified details with others,” Jakhar said in a statement.He urged farmers to bring up the matter in their meeting with Union ministers on Wednesday, saying it was their children who worked in the defence forces whose security had been jeopardized by Arnab.The PPCC President said that the information was apparently leaked to Goswami on national security issues by some moles sitting in the PMO or the defence ministry. Those moles needed to be identified and exposed, as they pose a very grave risk to the national security, he said, adding that strong action needed to be taken to deter leaks in future.Jakhar asked what if the secret information prior to Balakot strike which Goswami shared with his friend would have landed with the Pakistani Army.“It would have jeopardized the life and security of our air force personnel,” he remarked, while adding, instead of making the people of the country elated, as Goswami claims in his Whatsapp conversations, it would have led to grief and tragedy.He advised the Modi government that instead of serving NIA notices to the peacefully protesting farmers, it should serve it to Goswami and summon him for questioning.“What has come out is just parts of a single conversation and we don’t know to what extent Goswami has used this information to manipulate his channel’s TRP”, he pointed out, suggesting that Goswami might also be acting as a double agent.He’s positioning himself as the first one on the spot at Pulwama when a ghastly attack on our brave security forces happened there, points towards his knowing what Pakistan was up to.The PPCC president said, the government of India will never take action against Goswami but has instead been targeting the peaceful farmers in sheer frustration.“Intimidating of farmers through the use of NIA not only shows its moral bankruptcy but also proves how jittery the Modi government is”, he remarked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-govt-should-serve-nia-notice-on-arnab-not-farmers-jakhar-200600

(Will not let the country bow)," Gandhi said on Twitter as he posted a link of a news report about the alleged "Chinese village".Congress leader Randeep Surjewala also slammed the Prime Minister on the matter."Modiji where is that 56-inch chest?" he asked on Twitter.In a cautious reaction to the reports, India had on Monday said it keeps a constant watch on all developments having a bearing on the country's security, and takes necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.Congress leader P Chidambaram had on Monday demanded answers from the government on the issue, alleging that BJP MP Tapir Gao has claimed that China has built a 100-house village in the "disputed area" deep into Arunachal Pradesh.He said if the allegation made out by the BJP MP is true, will the government again give a clean chit to China or will blame the previous governments for it."Tapir Gao, an MP belonging to the BJP, has alleged that deep into Arunachal Pradesh, in a 'disputed area' within Indian territory, the Chinese have built  a 100-house village, a bazaar and a two-lane road in the last year."If this is true, it is clear that the Chinese have altered the status quo by converting a disputed area into a permanent settlement of Chinese nationals. What has the government to say about these startling facts?" he had said on Twitter.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it.India and China are locked in a bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh for over eight months.India and China have held several rounds of military and diplomatic talks in order to resolve the eastern Ladakh standoff, but no significant headway has been made for its resolution.

19-01-2021||Kolkata||Amartya Sen asks Visva-Bharati to withdraw allegation that he is illegally holding land||Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen has written to Visva-Bharati demanding that the university authorities withdraw the allegation that his family is in “illegal” possession of land in its Santiniketan campus and alleged that the accusations are a crude attempt at harassment.Sen had on Monday written the letter to Visva-Bharati Vice-Chancellor Prof Bidyut Chakraborty two days after the authorities of the central university asked the West Bengal government to measure the plot owned by him at Santiniketan as soon as possible to permanently resolve the dispute.The noted economist said in the letter that his father had purchased free-hold land from the market and not from Visva-Bharati—to add to their homestead and he has been paying taxes for them.Sen had also sent a legal notice earlier this year to the VC asking him to withdraw “false” allegation made to the news agencies that a plot of land owned by Visva-Bharati is unlawfully occupied by the economist.While the university was not able to provide any justification for the allegation, it has requested the West Bengal government “to measure the area of our homestead, Pratichi, to compare with the long term lease of land taken by my father in 1940 from Visva-Bharati”, Sen said in the letter.“This sudden abuse of an 80-year-old document is clearly a crude attempt at harassment or worse,” he said.“Among other errors it ignores the big fact, which I have stated many times (even in the context of this dispute), that a substantial amount of free-hold land was purchased by my father (in the market—not from Visva-Bharati) to add to our homestead on which khajna and Panchayat taxes are paid by me yearly,” the letter said.Hence the officiating registrar’s threat of legal action if the official discovers any additional land beyond the leased land seems hugely mischievous, Sen said.Stating that he is tired of the VC’s repeated claims despite emphatic denials on his part about his phone call to Chakraborty in 2019, Sen said that the VC insisted that the call was made either on June 2 or June 14.“On being informed that I was abroad for the entire month of June 2019 and came back to India only in July, the story was promptly altered by the V.C.’s office to assert that I had called in June or July but said the same things,” the letter said.“Rather than inventing new falsities and adding to their culpability, Visva-Bharati should withdraw the false allegations made by them, as my lawyer has asked,” Sen said.A controversy had erupted on December 24 last year, the day Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the centenary celebrations of Visva-Bharati when media reported that the university has written to the West Bengal government alleging dozens of land parcels owned by it were wrongfully recorded in the names of private parties including Sen.Sen, who now lives in the US, has said that the land, on which his house stands is on a long-term lease, which is nowhere near its expiry.Stating that the Visva-Bharati authorities had never complained to him or his family about any irregularity in holding the land, Sen has accused the VC of acting at the behest of the Centre “with its growing control over Bengal”.Visva-Bharati officials were not available for comment on the letter.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and several prominent intellectuals of the state have expressed their supports to the economist on the row. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amartya-sen-asks-visva-bharati-to-withdraw-allegation-that-he-is-illegally-holding-land-200592

19-01-2021||Washington||Indian-American organisations urge Supreme Court to give bail to Sanjiv Bhatt||Several civil rights activists and organizations from India and the US on Monday urged the Supreme Court to give bail to former police officer Sanjiv Bhatt.At a virtual press conference organized by the Indian American Muslim Council (IAMC) and Hindus for Human Rights, the organizations and activists argued that conviction of Bhatt in a murder case was wrong and based on fraudulent evidence.The Supreme Court of India has scheduled a bail hearing for Bhatt on January 22.Senior Congress leader and former minister Shashi Tharoor said he was “outraged by the injustice meted out” to Bhatt, whose “conscientious service to society” and “indomitable capacity for speaking truth to power” had put him in jail.“Sanjiv’s case is a reflection of the grim times that we live in, where constitutional values and fundamental privileges that have been granted by the constitution to all Indians appear in many cases to be diluted and in many cases perhaps even supplanted by illiberal forces,” Tharoor said.“All Indians with a conscience like Sanjiv Bhatt’s must stand up and fight back against such challenges that threaten to undermine the very foundation of our republic,” he said.Renowned documentary filmmaker and human rights defender Anand Patwardhan said Bhatt had been jailed “for no other reason than the fact that he opposed the massacre in 2002” and spoke against it. Patwardhan said the civil society “should build a movement for Bhatt’s release”.Human rights activist, classical dancer and actor Mallika Sarabhai said there was a “definite agenda” not only in Bhatt’s case but in most cases of most critics of the Modi government.“If anyone speaks against the government or asks a question, which is a fundamental right of our democracy, they are somehow punished. Raids are carried out against them, false cases are brought up, fraudulent charges are made, and they are made to silence,” Sarabhai alleged.Rasheed Ahmed, executive director of Indian American Muslim Council, said the Indian government must stop “politically managing Sanjiv Bhatt’s case and let the law take its course under the supervision of independent judges, not the judges who are either scared of government or have themselves becomes political”. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-american-organisations-urge-supreme-court-to-give-bail-to-sanjiv-bhatt-200579

He is on bail on an extradition warrant executed by the Scotland Yard in April 2017.The top court had earlier dismissed his plea seeking review of the 2017 verdict, which held him guilty of contempt for transferring USD 40 million to his children in violation of court orders. On August 31 last year, the top court had directed Mallya to appear before it on October 5, 2020.On Monday, a Bench headed by Justice UU Lalit deferred hearing for March 15 after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta sought time to file a report on Mallya’s extradition.Mehta shared a Ministry of External Affairs letter written to him on the status of extradition of Mallya and said the MEA had raised the issue with the UK, and the Indian Government was making all efforts to bring back the fugitive.The letter stated that the MEA had been informed by the UK Government that there was a legal issue that needed to be resolved before Mallya could be extradited to India.It said: “Under the United Kingdom law, extradition cannot take place until it is resolved. As the issue is judicial in nature, it is confidential and you will understand that Her Majesty’s government cannot provide any more details. We also cannot estimate how long this issue will take to resolve. Her Majesty’s government fully understands the importance of this case to the Government of India.

In a statement, the NBA, a representative body of Indian news broadcasters, said it was shocked to see hundreds of WhatsApp messages exchanged between the Broadcast Audience Research Council’s former CEO Partho Dasgupta and Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami.“These messages clearly establish collusion between the two in manipulating ratings to garner greater viewership numbers for the Republic TV month after month by fraudulently manually reducing the ratings of other channels to give Republic TV an unfair advantage. These WhatsApp messages not only reflect manipulation of ratings but are also about power play,” the NBA said.It said the messages exchanged referred to the appointment of secretaries, Cabinet reshuffle, access to the PMO and the workings of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.“This only confirms the many and continuous allegations made by the NBA in the last four years that the ratings were being manipulated by a non-NBA member broadcaster (Republic TV) in connivance with BARC’s top management officials.

Better to raise issues of principles and ensure the independence of BARC, which only the government can do.”Dasgupta’s remarks came on July 18, 2019, during a conversation where Arnab is asking him to moderate the landing market of a rival channel. Expressing his inability, Dasgupta says, “Unless the government helps, my hands are tied. I am fighting back. No one in the board understands news…” At this, Arnab tells the then BARC chief: “I am with you, I will speak to all and galvanise more support.” Dasgupta at this point asks Arnab only to raise matters of principle with the government.The chat is purportedly about TV 18 gaining due to a larger share of the landing market.

He filed his nomination today.Adityanath, however, has so far remained non-committal on any Cabinet reshuffle even as sources said Sharma was unlikely to remain a mere legislator.

A Gujarat cadre officer belonging to UP, Sharma has been among Modi’s trusted bureaucrats since he was the CM.Seen as low profile, Sharma is known for delivering time-bound results, said sources. His last posting at the Centre was Secretary, Union Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.Besides Sharma, the BJP has named Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma, its state president Swatantra Dev Singh and Lakshman Prasad Acharya as candidates for the council polls.

Who will come in the city and who will be allowed will not be seen by us,” a Bench headed by CJI SA Bobde said, terming the proposed tractor rally a “law and order” issue.“You are at liberty to invoke all powers under the law,” the CJI, who earlier maintained that farmers had a fundamental right to protest peacefully, told Attorney General KK Venugopal while hearing the Delhi Police plea to stop the rally. The matter will now be taken up on Wednesday when the farmers and the Centre hold the next round of negotiations.

The top court, which stayed implementation of the three farm laws on January 12, said, “We said this last time that entry to Delhi has to be seen by the Delhi Police. Invoke all your powers to see whether farmers can be allowed in the city.”Pointing out that such a rally could cause law and order problems and prove to be embarrassing for the nation, the police had sought an injunction against the march.As the Attorney General said “this is an extraordinary situation,” the CJI shot back, “But why do you want us to tell what powers you have?”Morcha forgives as Charuni clarifiesSonepat: BKU (Haryana) chief Gurnam Singh Charuni on Monday appeared before a six-member Sanyukt Kisan Morcha panel and gave an undertaking that he won’t share stage with any politician till the farmers’ stir was over.

BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari accepted the challenge thrown by Mamata, asserting he would defeat her in the election or quit politics.That Mamata chose Nandigram to make the big announcement reflects the TMC supremo’s determination to take the BJP, which has launched a spirited campaign to unseat her after a decade-long stint in power, head on.Addressing a rally here, Mamata said she was not worried about those joining rival parties as they were hardly around when the TMC was formed.She said these leaders left the ruling party to protect the money “they have looted in the last few years”. “I request our state party president Subrata Bakshi to approve my name from this seat,” said Mamata. Bakshi, who was on the podium, swiftly accepted the request.The TMC turncoat, however, said the final decision to field candidates will be taken by the BJP leadership after thorough discussion and not in an arbitrary way like in the ruling TMC. “If I am fielded by my party from Nandigram, I will defeat her by a margin of at least 50,000 votes, or I will quit politics,” he asserted.

Mr Modi’s commitment towards the development of the Somnath shrine area has been unparalleled. I have full faith that the prestige and honour of Somnath Temple would be enhanced under PM Modi’s chairman-ship.”Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani said, “Congratulations to PM Modi on becoming chairman of the trust for the Somnath Temple – a temple which was resurrected on the sacrifices of several people, a temple which was revived by Rani Ahilyabai and later by Sardar Patel.”The Somnath Temple, believed to be one of the jyotirlinga shrines of Lord Shiva, was the subject of intense disagreement between India’s first President Rajendra Prasad and first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, as historical records reveal.Nehru disapproved of then President Prasad inaugurating the newly revived Somnath Temple in 1951 and also of his ministerial colleagues’ participation in the process of resurrection of the temple. Former Congress leader from Gujarat KM Munshi who initiated the Somnath Temple revival after India’s independence records Nehru’s disapproval of his ministers’ participation in the temple rebuilding process in his book “Pilgrimage to Freedom.”The trust meeting was held virtually. Some of the past Chairpersons of the Trust include Jamsaheb Digvijaya Singh, Kanaiyalal Munshi, Former Prime Minister Morarji Desai, Jay Krishna Hari Vallabh, Dineshbhai Shah, Prasanvadan Mehta and Keshubhai Patel.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-new-head-of-somnath-temple-trust-shah-hails-development-200247

Ltd”.It demanded that the Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) membership of Republic TV should be suspended with immediate effect till the case related to manipulation of ratings is pending in court.According to the statement, the NBA urged the BARC to come up with a clear statement about the veracity of its ratings in the period during the audit and also conduct an audit of the Hindi news segment.“Expunge the data of the erring broadcaster and restate the real position of rankings of all news channels from the beginning,” it demanded from the ratings agency.The BARC should explain the concrete steps taken by it in the last three months to secure the ratings and bring transparency to the process as well as create a system, whereby any change to the ratings that impacts the news ecosystem is done only after due consultation with a BARC sub-committee of NBA nominees, it said.The NBA also asked the BARC to explain what penal actions are provided for in its constitution against broadcasters who have indulged in manipulation of ratings of this magnitude and what action will be taken in the current case.The ratings of news channels must remain suspended till the time all details of such actions taken by the BARC are shared with the stakeholders, it said.The NBA’s board also wants to place on record that the “corrupt data released month after month” has not only led to reputation loss, but has also caused huge financial losses to news broadcasters, for which the BARC is duty-bound to give an explanation, the statement said.Dasgupta, who was arrested in the fake Television Rating Point (TRP) case, is now in the ICU of the state-run JJ hospital in central Mumbai.A diabetic, he was rushed to the hospital from the Taloja Central Prison in Navi Mumbai on Saturday after his blood sugar levels went up on Friday midnight.As the controversy surrounding the alleged TRP scam grew, the BARC, which provides TRP data, announced a temporary suspension of the weekly ratings of news channels across languages in October last year.The NBA is the largest organisation of news broadcasters, consisting of almost all major news networks of the country. Republic TV, however, is not a member of the NBA. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ratings-must-remain-suspended-till-barc-takes-action-to-address-concerns-nba-200225

The news channel said the report is based on satellite images accessed exclusively by it.“We have seen recent reports on China undertaking construction work along the border areas with India. China has undertaken such infrastructure construction activity in the past several years,” the MEA said.“In response, our government too has stepped up border infrastructure including the construction of roads, bridges etc, which has provided much needed connectivity to the local population along the border,” it added.The ministry also asserted that the government remains committed to the objective of creating infrastructure along the border areas for the improvement of livelihood of its citizens, including in Arunachal Pradesh.“Government keeps a constant watch on all developments having a bearing on India’s security and takes all the necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” it said.In its report, NDTV showed two images of the area where it said the village has been set up. According to the channel, the first image dated August 26, 2019 did not show any human habitation but the second one of November 2020 shows a row of structures.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC). China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet, while India contests it.India and China are locked in a bitter border row in eastern Ladakh for over eight months.The army as well as the Indian Air Force have been maintaining a high state of operational readiness along the entire stretch of the LAC with China, including in the Arunachal sector in view of the eastern Ladakh standoff.India and China have held several rounds of military and diplomatic talks in order to resolve the eastern Ladakh row, but no significant headway has been made for its resolution.Earlier this month, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat visited various forward posts near the LAC in Arunachal Pradesh and reviewed India’s operational preparedness.He also visited several key installations, including “forward most air maintained” posts in Dibang Valley, Lohit sector and Subansiri valley, according to the Army.

19-01-2021||New Delhi||Why former IAS officer AK Sharma joining BJP has resulted in turbulence in UP politics?||His entry on the Uttar Pradesh political scene has created massive turbulence in the state, setting it abuzz with possibilities. Speculations are that top IAS officer (now retired) AK Sharma has been earmarked for an important portfolio, including deputy chief minister, in the Yogi Adityanath government.Adityanath has remained non-committal on the possibility as also on speculations of reshuffle of his Cabinet.But given the proximity that Sharma enjoys with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sources say he is unlikely to remain a mere legislator in the state.Besides, PM Modi cares for past relationships and talent, they say citing the example of Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and top bureaucrats like RK Singh, Hardeep Puri and S Jaishankar, all ministers in his council.A day after he joined the saffron party after opting for voluntary retirement from the IAS, Sharma was last week named by the saffron party as its candidate for the upcoming legislative council polls in UP.Today he also filed his nomination papers, according to reports.Ever since he joined the BJP, the political corridors have been buzzing with various possibilities for Sharma, a Gujarat-cadre officer hailing from Uttar Pradesh.He is one of trusted bureaucrats of PM Modi ever since his days as the Gujarat chief minister.A low-profile officer, Sharma is known for delivering time-bound results, say sources.Recently he took voluntary retirement as the Secretary of the Union Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises.Besides Sharma, the BJP also named Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma, its state president Swatantra Dev Singh and Lakshman Prasad Acharya as candidates for the polls.Currently there are two Deputy CMs in UP, Keshav Prasad Maurya being the second one. The polling for 12 legislative council seats in UP will be held on January 28.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-former-ias-officer-ak-sharma-joining-bjp-has-resulted-in-turbulence-in-up-politics-200172

It is a lucky place for me. So this time I feel that I should contest the assembly polls from here. I request our state party president Subrata Bakshi to approve my name from this seat,” Banerjee said.Bakshi, who was on the podium, swiftly accepted the request.Nandigram was the scene of massive public protest against “forcible” land acquisition by the then Left Front government for the creation of a special economic zone.The protracted and often bloody protests added to Banerjee and her party’s political heft and catapulted the TMC to power in 2011, marking the end of the Left Front rule of 34 years.Adhikari is considered the face of the movement in Nandigram, some 130 km south-west of Kolkata.After switching over to the BJP, Adhikari has often accused Banerjee of having forgotten the people of the area who helped her gain power in the state.Banerjee is at present the MLA from Bhawanipore in south Kolkata.“If possible, I will contest from both Bhawanipore and Nandigram. In case I am unable to contest from Bhawanipore, someone else will,” she said.Banerjee said she would never allow “a handful of people” to sell out Bengal to the BJP.“Those who have left the party have my best wishes. Let them become president and vice president of the country. But don’t you dare to sell out Bengal to the BJP. As long as I am alive, I won’t allow them to sell out my state to the BJP,” she said.Assembly elections in the state are likely in April-May. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-to-challenge-suvendu-adhikari-on-his-home-turf-nandigram-in-assembly-polls-200164
19-01-2021||New Delhi||Farmers have constitutional right to take out tractor rally: Unions||Protesting union leaders on Monday said that farmers have a constitutional right to take out their tractor rally peacefully and asserted that thousands of people will participate in the proposed event on January 26.The Supreme Court said on Monday that the Delhi Police is the first authority to decide the entry of protesting farmers into the national capital.Also read: On farmers' planned tractor rally on Republic Day, SC says entry into Delhi to be decided by policeBhartiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal) Punjab general secretary Paramjit Singh said that farmers are not going to hold their rally on Rajpath and in other high-security areas, adding that they would only take out it on the Outer Ring Road in Delhi and that there will be no disruption in the official Republic Day parade.“We are stuck at the Delhi borders. We have not decided to sit at these borders ourselves, we have been stopped from entering Delhi. We will take out the rally peacefully without disrupting any law and order. We will exercise our constitutional right and we will definitely enter Delhi,” Singh told PTI.Another farmer leader Lakhbir Singh, who is vice president (Punjab) of All India Kisan Sabha, said that farmers will return to protest sites after taking out the tractor rally on the Outer Ring Road on January 26.“We will not go to any place where there might be a government gathering, and all our tractors will have a national flag and the flags of our farmer unions,” Lakhbir said.Asked about their stand in case the Delhi Police does not give them permission for the tractor parade, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said that farmers have constitutional rights to hold the tractor rally peacefully.“If the Delhi Police has some issues over law and order on Republic Day, they can sit with Sankyukt Kisan Morcha and tell about alternatives routes for the tractor rally. Thereafter, our farmers’ committee will decide the same. But, it is very clear that their tractor rally will be taken out in the national capital on January 26,” Ugrahan told PTI.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at several Delhi borders since November 28, demanding a repeal of farm laws and legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops.While hearing a petition, the Supreme Court told the Centre that the proposed tractor rally by farmers on the Republic Day on January 26 is a matter of “law and order” and Delhi Police is the first authority to decide who should be allowed to enter the national capital.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, while hearing the Centre’s application seeking an injunction against the proposed tractor or trolley march or any other kind of protest which seeks to disrupt the gathering and celebrations of the Republic Day, said that police has all the authority to deal with the matter.The tenth round of talks between the government and the protesting farmer unions is scheduled on January 19. On the same day, the Supreme Court-appointed committee to resolve the impasse will hold its first meeting.The previous nine rounds of formal talks between the Centre and 41 farmer unions have failed to yield any concrete results to end the long-running protest at Delhi’s borders as the latter have stuck to their main demand of a complete repeal of the three acts.The Supreme Court had on January 11 stayed the implementation of the three laws till further orders and appointed a four-member panel to resolve the impasse.Bhartiya Kisan Union president Bhupinder Singh Mann, however, recused himself from the committee last week. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-have-constitutional-right-to-take-out-tractor-rally-unions-200151
19-01-2021||New Delhi||Don't join WhatsApp if not accepting new policy: HC||The Delhi High Court on Monday said accepting the new privacy policy of social messaging app WhatsApp was a "voluntary" thing and one can choose not to use or join that platform if one did not agree with its terms and conditions."It is a private app. Don't join it. It is a voluntary thing, don't accept it. Use some other app," Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva said to the petitioner, a lawyer, who has challenged WhatsApp's new privacy policy which was slated to come into effect in February but has been deferred till May.The court also said that if the terms and conditions of most mobile apps are read, "you would be surprised as to what all you are consenting to"."Even Google maps captures all your data and stores it," the court said.The court further said it could not understand what data would be leaked according to the petitioner and since the issue requires consideration, it will be listed on January 25 due to paucity of time on Monday.The central government also agreed with the court that the issue needs to be analysed.   WhatsApp and Facebook, represented by senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Mukul Rohatgi, told the court that the plea was not maintainable and many of the issues raised in it were without any foundation.They further told the court that private chat messages between family and friends would remain encrypted and cannot be stored by WhatsApp and this position would not change under the new policy.The change in policy would only affect the business chats on WhatsApp, they said.The petition, by a lawyer, has contended that the updated privacy policy violates users right to privacy under the Constitution.The plea has claimed that the new privacy policy of WhatsApp allows full access into a user's online activity without there being any supervision by the government.Under the new policy, users can either accept it or exit the app, but they cannot opt not to share their data with other Facebook-owned or third party apps.              The lawyer appearing for the petitioner claimed that the option not to agree with the new policy was given to users in European nations, but not in India.

The cause of death was septicemic shock and cardiac arrest and it has nothing to do with the vaccination,” the state’s Additional Chief Secretary (Health) Amit Mohan Prasad told reporters in Lucknow.He said that some persons were spreading false news regarding the vaccine and vaccinations, and people should not trust them.“The two vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin) used in the country are safe,” Prasad added.A total of 20,076 healthcare workers got their first jabs in UP on Saturday as Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a country-wide vaccination drive against the pandemic.After Mahipal died on Sunday night, Moradabad District Magistrate Rakesh Singh said that a high-level medical inquiry would be held.“The case of Mahipal is exceptional and a high-level medical inquiry will be ordered,” he said while asserting that the vaccines are fully safe and no major side effects have been reported among others vaccinated.Chief Medical Officer Milind Chandra Garg said that the cause of death was a cardiac problem.“Deceased Mahipal’s heart was found enlarged and it had blood clots, according to the postmortem report,” he said.The report of the postmortem, conducted by three doctors, stated that the death was caused by “cardio-pulmonary disease” and there was “no relation with corona vaccine”, the CMO said.He said that some employees were suffering from fever after taking the shots. “They were facing general problems but not like Mahipal,” he said.Mahipal’s son Vishal said that his father called him to the hospital as he was having breathing difficulty.“My father was suffering from cough, but after vaccination he had a fever and felt a heaviness in breathing. On Sunday, he was admitted in the government hospital where he expired at night,” he said.Mahipal’s family members claimed that he never had any cardiac problem and was “quite healthy except for the fever and cough”.“My father did not suffer from corona even when he performed his duty properly during the pandemic,” his son said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/health-worker-dies-in-ups-moradabad-day-after-receiving-covid-shot-govt-says-not-related-to-vaccine-200145

Invoke all your powers to see whether farmers can be allowed in the city,"  the CJI tells Attorney General KK Venugopal.The Delhi Police had filed a plea seeking direction to stop farmers'proposed tractor rally on Republic Day. "Who can be allowed or not are matters of law and order will be dealt by police. We cannot be the first authority here. Does the Union of India need Supreme Court to tell it what powers it has under the Police Act?" CJI told Venugopal.As the Attorney General said: "This is an extraordinary situation," the CJI shot back, "But why do you want us to tell what powers you have?" Now, Bhartiya Kisan Union Lokshakti's plea seeking removal of the remaining three members of the court-appointed four-member committee after the recusal of Bhartiya Kisan Union leader Bhupinder Singh Mann will also be taken up on Wednesday.Maintaining that principles of natural justice would be violated if the panel members continued as they had already supported these laws, it had urged the court to select people who can do the job “on the basis of mutual harmony”.Beside Mann, the other three members of the committee were Pramod Kumar Joshi (Director, South Asia international Food Policy), Agricultural Economist Ashok Gulati and Shetkari Sanghatana leader Anil Ghanwat.They were mandated to talk to the agitating farmers on the Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Act 2020, Farmers Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act & Amendment to Essential Commodities Act and file a report before the court in two months. The committee is said to have decided to go ahead with its proceedings even after recusal of Mann.Bhartiya Kisan Union Lokshakti had earlier written to the Delhi Police commisioner seeking permission to hold the farmers protests at Ramlila Maidan in the capital. CJI SA Bobde had on January 12 asked farmers' unions to write to Delhi Police for such permission.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/on-farmers-planned-tractor-rally-on-republic-day-sc-says-entry-into-delhi-to-be-decided-by-police-200119
