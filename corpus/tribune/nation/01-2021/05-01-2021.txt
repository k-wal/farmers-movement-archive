The Chinese also suffered significant casualties."      It said on August 28 and 29, Indian troops in a precautionary deployment, pre-empted Chinese "expansionist designs" and occupied heights along the southern bank of Pangong Tso. The report said Indian troops, braving inclement weather, continued to be deployed on these heights."Advance Winter Stocking (AWS) and winter preparations for the enhanced strength have been completed and troops are well entrenched to counter any misadventure by Chinese forces. While the Indian Army is prepared for any eventuality, talks are also progressing to resolve the issue in an amicable manner," it said.The report said the Indian Army has resolutely countered adversaries on the Line of Control (LC) and the LAC. The force carried out relentless counter-insurgency and counter-terror operations."There has been no let-up in operational readiness along the LC, LAC, hinterland and the security of military establishments. Indian Army has not just ensured force preservation but has also ensured that operational readiness remains unaffected in order to safeguard the borders of the nation," the report said.It said a 'whole of government' approach was adopted against the "terror ecosystem" and that the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir had seen progressive improvement due to consistent efforts by the security forces."On one hand, high level of alertness by troops along the Line of Control (LC) blunted Pakistan's endeavours to infiltrate terrorists into the Valley, at the same time, high tempo of kinetic operations in the hinterland ensured denial of operational space to terrorist organisations," it said.The report said ceasefire violations committed by Pakistan Army were given a befitting reply by Indian troops causing significant casualties to the military of the neighbouring nation."Counter infiltration grid was strengthened resulting in neutralisation of a number of terrorists along the LoC. A number of attempts to smuggle arms, ammunition and contraband were also foiled along the LoC," it said.The report said well synergised, intelligence-based operations had resulted in significant successes against terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir."Residual terrorist strength in the Valley now is below 200 and local recruitment is decreasing giving a serious blow to the nefarious designs of Pakistan to 'indigenise' the movement and fuel unrest in the Valley," it said."Attempts to spread violence south of Pir Panjal Range have been comprehensively defeated by proactive operations. All possible steps are being taken to provide a secure environment to the Awaam (people) of Jammu and Kashmir," it added.It said a significant reduction in protests had been witnessed in Jammu and Kashmir, providing an opportunity to the people to lead a peaceful life."Attempts of inimical elements to mislead people by running disinformation campaigns were defeated by proactively monitoring the situation and engaging with the local population," it said.The report also mentioned the government's efforts to modernise the defence forces as well as various aspects of the functioning of the Indian Air Force as well as the Indian Navy.

05-01-2021||Haridwar||Rooting out foreign MNCs next target: Ramdev||Yoga guru Baba Ramdev on Tuesday said his institution Patanjali Yogpeeth has become a people’s movement for swadeshi, yoga and ayurveda, and rooting out foreign multi-nationals from the Indian market was his next target.He was addressing an event marking the 26th foundation day of Patanjali Yogpeeth.“The journey Patanjali Yogpeeth began from zero 26 years ago has now grown into a people’s movement for swadeshi, yoga and ayurveda. We want our country to become self-reliant in terms of edible oil. We want its dependence on Indonesia and Malaysia to end,” the yoga guru said.Patanjali is going to take a major step towards large-scale oil palm plantation and maximise production of mustard oil in India, which will help save foreign currency worth Rs 2.5 lakh crore, he added.“The market cap for Patanjali Yogpeeth and Ruchi Soya at present is put at Rs 1.5 lakh crore to Rs 2 lakh crore. Our next target is to uproot foreign MNCs like Colgate, Nestle, Coca Cola, Pepsi and their subsidiaries like Hindustan Unilever,” Ramdev said.Describing Patanjali Yogpeeth as an iconic role model for ‘vocal for local’, Ramdev said after the movement for swadeshi, his institution will revolutionise the education sector in the country.He said institutions like Patanjali University, Patanjali Ayurved College and Acharyakulam are laying the foundations of a spiritual India.Later talking to reporters, he said the ongoing agitation by farmers has been hijacked by vested interests.The real farmers should be on guard against such elements and try to find a middle-of-the-road solution through negotiations with the government, he said.On the indigenous vaccines against COVID-19, Ramdev took a dig at opposition parties, saying, “It does not contain cow blood or pig fat. It does not cause impotency. It cannot kill an opposition leader either. However, like all vaccines it has some side effects.” Thanking the Indian scientists for developing the vaccines, he advised people with low immunity or those suffering from blood pressure, heart diseases and diabetes to take the doses.

Two of them succumbed to their injuries. One injured was referred to the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital and others are being treated at the Kalimpong facility," said Pai.Asked whether the organisers of the programme that took place on Sunday night were granted permission and did they follow COVID-19 protocols, the officer said that a case was being registered against them.Pai said that the district administration had been in touch with the families of the deceased and injured persons and offering all possible assistance.The two deceased were identified as Anita Cihettri (40) and Banita Gurung (46), both residents of the Chandraloke area.West Bengal Tourism Minister Gautam Deb and Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA) chairman Anit Thapa met family members of the deceased and handed over cheques of Rs 2 lakh each as assistance to them.Darjeeling MP Raju Bista wrote to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, requesting her to conduct a judicial investigation into the event and deaths."I have been informed that the administration gave permission for a musical programme to be organised, but they did not take adequate precautions to ensure people's safety and social distancing norms as mandated under the Disaster Management Act, 2005,” the BJP MP alleged in his letter.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-killed-in-stampede-at-musical-programme-in-bengal-194132
05-01-2021||New Delhi||Modi must speak more often in Parliament: Pranab in last book||Prime Minister Narendra Modi must listen to the dissenting voices and speak more often in Parliament, using it as a forum to disseminate his views to convince the Opposition and inform the nation, felt former president Pranab Mukherjee.  According to Mukherjee, the mere physical presence of the prime minister in Parliament makes a tremendous difference to the functioning of this institution. "Whether it was Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee or Manmohan Singh, each of these former PMs made their presence felt on the floor of the House." "PM Modi, now in his second term, must take inspiration from his predecessors and provide visible leadership, through his enhanced presence in Parliament to avoid situations that had precipitated the parliamentary crisis we witnessed in the first term," Mukherjee wrote in his memoir 'The Presidential Years, 2012-2017; which he completed before his death last year. The book, published by Rupa Publications, released on Tuesday.Modi, Mukherjee said, must "listen to the dissenting voices and speak more often in Parliament. He must use it as a forum to disseminate his views to convince the Opposition and inform the nation".He said during the UPA years, he would resolve difficult issues by remaining in constant touch with the leader of the Opposition and senior leaders of both the UPA and the NDA. "My job was to run the House, even if it meant meeting and convincing members of the Opposition alliance. I would be present at all times in the House in order to defuse contentious issues, whenever they arose." But he lamented that the NDA government, during its first term of 2014-19, failed in its primary responsibility to ensure the smooth and proper functioning of Parliament. "I attribute the acrimonious exchanges between the Treasury and Opposition benches to the arrogance and inept handling by the government. But the Opposition is not without blame either. It had also behaved irresponsibly," he wrote.Mukherjee said he had consistently maintained that disruption hurts the Opposition more than the government, as a disruptive Opposition loses the moral authority to put the government on the mat. "It also gives the executive an undue advantage to curtail Parliament sessions on the pretext of the prevailing chaos." According to the former president, the moral authority to govern vests with the prime minster."The overall state of the nation is reflective of the functioning of the PM and his administration. While Dr Singh was preoccupied with saving the coalition, which took a toll on governance, Modi seemed to have employed a rather autocratic style of governance during his first term, as seen by the bitter relationship among the government, the legislature and the judiciary," he wrote."Only time will tell if there is a better understanding on such matters in the second term of this government. It is also important for the government to keep in mind the demands and aspirations of the section of the population that has not voted for it, because the government represents and belongs to all sections of the people, regardless of their voting preference," he added. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-must-speak-more-often-in-parliament-pranab-in-last-book-194129

05-01-2021||---||India, US should jointly draw military red lines in future: US envoy||New Delhi, January 5The outgoing US Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster on Tuesday suggested that over the next five years, India and the US should jointly draw red lines in the maritime domain.“Our mission over the next five years and beyond should be to give this (Quad) endeavor further form and substance–to develop guidelines and, if necessary, even redlines,” he observed while speaking at a webinar.The US envoy was not convinced that Indian economic reforms based on Aatmanirbhar Bharat policy were enough to attract US firms from China. “It remains to be seen whether all of these policies are compatible and mutually reinforcing, or whether they will lead to higher tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade,” he said.Juster admitted to “frictions and frustrations” on the trade and investment front and the inability of both countries to conclude “even a small trade package”. Moreover, there were growing restrictions in India on market access for certain US goods and services, increasing tariffs, new limitations on the free flow of data, and a less-than-predictable regulatory environment for investors, complained the US Ambassador.Suggesting that India should not be fixated on the price of the imported military equipment, he suggested that defence procurement should be about quality and strategic interoperability across services – and “perhaps even with other friendly forces”.Juster is expected to leave India over the next week. His shifting had become imminent after Donald Trump lost the US Presidential elections and the Biden administration will bring in a replacement more in sync with its thinking.Juster pointed out that India and the US have increased interoperability between the military services with common equipment such as Apache attack helicopters, Chinook heavy-lift helicopters, M777 ultra-lightweight artillery and high end military transport and P-8i maritime reconnaissance. Both have also adapted their internal institutions to this regional orientation.“And we have come to a consensus on the geographical contours of this region –stretching from the shores of the East Coast of Africa to the West Coast of the US,” he added.Making a case for a deeper Indian involvement in the Indo-Pacific region, Juster said over 50 per cent of international trade passes through its waters, rich in natural resources and fast becoming the center of gravity of the evolving international system.“The region needs stability, leadership, and a democratic model for development that does not threaten the sovereignty of other countries.  This is why a strong and democratic India is an important partner to promote peace and prosperity,” he suggested. “The US and India both recognise that much of the Indo-Pacific region –if not the world –is depending on our efforts,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-us-should-jointly-draw-military-red-lines-in-future-us-envoy-194126

05-01-2021||New Delhi||All Indian vaccines being developed for storage at 2-8 degree Celsius: Department of Biotechnology Secretary||All Indian vaccines being developed against the coronavirus will have to be stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius as the logistics have been worked out while considering temperature as a factor, Department of Biotechnology Secretary Renu Swarup said on Tuesday.        Swarup said Bharat Biotech’s COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin and Oxford-AstraZeneca's Covishield had robustly undergone immunoassay lab tests.“(For) all our vaccines, we are looking at right now…..(we) are targeting 2-8 degree because our logistics are worked out on that basis and we are working on that,” Swarup said at a press briefing.She said the DNA vaccine candidate being developed by Zydus Cadila, and the Biological E's mRNA vaccine work at storage temperatures of 2-8 degrees Celsius.  “Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna which requires a minus 70 degree Celsius (cold) chain, this (the Biological E's vaccine candidate) is basically at the 2-8 degree Celsius,” said Swarup.The Zydus Cadila candidate has been granted approval to conduct the phase-3 trial while the Biological E candidate is in its phase-1 clinical trial stage.Swarup said Dr Reddy's Laboratories had partnered with Russia's Gamaleya Institute and a vaccine was being developed for India targeting storage at 2-8 degrees Celsius.“They (Dr Reddy's Laboratories) have started phase 2/3 trials in the country. They have completed the first part of the phase 2 trial on 1,000 subjects and they are now looking at interim data which is to be analysed.“They also have large global trials, like the Astrazeneca and that data is also being looked at. What they are targeting is for India to try and see how it could be at 2-8 degrees,” said Swarup.There are 30 vaccine candidates in India at different stages.The country's drugs regulator on Sunday granted emergency use approval to Oxford-AstraZeneca's Covishield and also to the indigenously developed Covaxin even though not enough data on the latter's efficacy and safety was available, which has triggered a debate.Seeking to ally apprehensions on this, Swarup said, “These two vaccines which have been spoken about right now, we have had the robust immunoassays which have been studied through within the laboratories.”Referring to the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), Faridabad, an institute under the DBT, Swarup said the lab had sets of immunoassays – which are biochemical tests – that run all these vaccines through them.“So anything that comes out of this immunoassay lab gives you the confidence that it has gone through the robust assay system which gives you the immunogenicity and the safety data as we move forward,” said Swarup.

They waved saffron flags and also uploaded a 10-second video of the act on YouTube.As part of the security protocol, all visitors to the ASI monument are checked using metal-detectors, they cannot carry posters or any writing material. However, the use of selfie-sticks is not banned.Physical checking has been stopped at the gates of Taj Mahal after it reopened for visitors following the coronavirus-induced lockdown.“Tourists carry all kinds of clothes inside the premises. It is difficult to prevent them from carrying pieces of clothing like handkerchiefs or dupattas and they can be of different colours and may have any religious connotation.“However, we are updating our surveillance around the site, increasing and intensifying intelligence gathering and even patrolling. There are some steps internally that we are contemplating to ensure that such incidents do not happen again,” CISF commandant Rahul Yadav told PTI. “We have to be sensitive towards tourists as well and keep their convenience in mind. We have to be tourist-friendly,” he said.          On the complaint of the CISF, the four youths have been booked under Section 153A (Promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act.The video, which has gone viral on social media, shows three of the youths waving the flags while the fourth is recording the act and even giving instructions to them to pose.

05-01-2021||New Delhi||Plea in HC for damages relating to Lutyens property forfeited in 1998||A lawsuit was filed in the Delhi High Court seeking damages related to a property in Lutyens’ Delhi, whose forfeiture was set aside, due to its alleged illegal use for 21 years.The suit has been filed by children of a 94-year-old woman, Veera Sarin, who recently approached the Supreme Court to declare the national emergency imposed by the government in 1975 as unconstitutional.The suit has sought from the Central government damages of Rs 2.20 crore, Rs 9.89 lakh, Rs 43.5 lakh for loss of market rent, outstanding maintenance charges and outstanding property tax respectively in relation to illegal use and occupation of a property in Ansal Bhawan, Kasturba Gandhi Marg here from May 1999 to July 2020.Plaintiffs Rajiv, Deepak and Radhika Sarin, through advocate Sidhant Kumar, have filed the suit against Directorate of Estates, Ministry of Labour and Employment and Competent Authority Under Smugglers And Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of property) Act (SAFEMA), in relation to their KG Marg property which was taken over by the Central government authorities.The plaintiffs said they are the owners of the property which was forfeited by the authorities under (SAFEMA) in 1998 and it was leased out to Directorate of Estates (DoE) prior to forfeiture. As a consequence of the forfeiture, DoE  stopped paying rent to the plaintiffs admittedly from May 1, 1999.It said the forfeiture was set aside and quashed by the Delhi High Court in December 2014 and despite several attempts by Sarins, the authorities were not releasing the property to them.Pursuant to the June 2020 order of the high court, Sarins got the possession of the property in July 2020.“This court by order dated July 28, 2020 directed Defendant No. 1 (DoE) to pay arrears of rent as per the last paid rent to the plaintiffs at the rate of Rs 20,500 per month from May 1, 1999 to July 2, 2020. This court further granted liberty to the plaintiffs to claim further amounts towards market rent, mesne profits, compensation and interest by instituting appropriate proceedings,” the suit said, adding that thereafter, the present proceedings are initiated.The plea is likely to come up for hearing before the high court next week. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-in-hc-for-damages-relating-to-lutyens-property-forfeited-in-1998-194114

On a farm in Neendoor, around 1,700 ducks had died due to the viral infection.Officials have said around 40,000 domestic birds, including 34,000 in the Kuttanad region alone, will be culled to check the spread of the H5N8 virus.Though the situation has been brought under control, authorities have sounded a high alert in the districts, considering the potential of the virus to infect humans.The Alappuzha district collector has banned the use and trade of meat, eggs and waste of domestic birds, including ducks and chicken, in Kuttanad and Karthikappalli Taluks, officials said.In Indore, the presence of bird flu was first detected on December 29, when about 50 crows were found dead on the Daly College campus of the Residency area, and tests run on two of the carcasses confirmed the presence of the pathogen.Madhya Pradesh veterinary department deputy director Pramod Sharma said 155 crows were detected with the H5N8 virus in the Residency area in the last eight days.The deadly avian influenza has not been found in any other bird species apart from crows in Indore so far, he said.“Samples from 120 live hens and roosters from the area and 30 migratory birds from Sirpur Lake have been sent to a laboratory in Bhopal to check for bird flu. The reports are awaited,” Sharma said.Survey is being carried out in the Residency area to check people with symptoms like cold, cough and fever, a state health department official said but added that no case of the H5N8 infection has been found in humans.Jammu and Kashmir sounded an alert and started collecting samples to check the health of winged guests flocking to the Union territory during winters, officials said as neighbouring Himachal Pradesh reported cases of bird flu.Joint teams of the animal husbandry and wildlife departments on Tuesday visited the Gharana wetland in the outskirts of Jammu and collected 25 bird droppings for testing to ascertain whether any of the birds are infected with the avian influenza, officials said.Following the bird flu outbreak in neighbouring Kerala, the Tamil Nadu stepped up surveillance on inter-state borders and announced a contingency plan for the management of possible human cases.“The avian influenza spreads rapidly, there could be a likelihood of humans getting affected. So, as a precaution, the directorate general of health services has evolved a contingency plan for the management of human cases,” Tamil Nadu health secretary J Radhakrishnan said.Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar directed health officers in border districts of the state to remain vigilant in the view of avian flu outbreak in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. He also said guidelines would be issued to all the districts to take necessary action.In Himachal Pradesh, rapid response teams have started collecting samples of poultry from an area of 10-km radius from the periphery of the Pong Dam Lake, animal husbandry deputy director (epidemiology) Dr Munish Batta said.“Our priority at this stage is to ensure that the infection does not spread from migratory birds to domestic poultry,” he added.Fortunately, there has so far been no report of any unusual sickness or death among the poultry in the area, Batta said.Officials in Rajasthan said samples sent from Kota and Baran district have been found positive with the avian influenza.State agriculture and animal husbandry department minister Lal Chand Katariaheld said that avian influenza has been found in three districts of the state—Jhalawar, Kota and Baram.Till Tuesday morning, 625 birds have died in 16 districts of the state.

05-01-2021||Chandigarh||GSI draws up strategic plan to step up exploration||With the demand for rare earth elements (REE) increasing significantly, the Geological Survey of India (GSI) has drawn up a strategic plan for enhancing REE exploration in India that outlines a roadmap for the next five years.REEs are a group of seventeen metals that are used in a wide range of critical products enabling many emerging green energy technologies, high tech applications and defence systems. This includes electronics, medical instrumentation, renewable energy, alloys, high strength magnets, ceremics, hybrid vehicles, lasers, nuclear science, biofuels and rechargeable batteries.REEs are characterized by high density, high melting point, high conductivity and high thermal conductance. These are relatively abundant in the Earth’s crust, but minable concentrations are less common than for most other elements. The REE-bearing minerals are diverse and often complex in composition with a very low concentration of metal, making it difficult to locate and identify.At present, India obtains its REE raw materials from foreign sources like Canada, Russia and China. According to available information, China id the world’s largest produced or REEs, with an output of 132,000 metric tonnes in 2019, followed by the Unites States with 26,000 metric tones. India produced 3,000 metric tonnes that year. According to the GSI plan, these  mineral commodities need to be explored with modern concepts and tools for possible breakthrough requiring high investments in sophisticated survey and spatial data management technologies to produce more detailed data and information of areas and depths so far unexplored.Specific and high precision laboratory studies aimed at guiding and substantiating field studies pertaining to ore localization are the need for success exploration for REE minerals, the plan adds.Intensified exploration efforts in the blocks delineated in and around the first order target areas by detailed surveys and follow up exploratory drilling, all potential blocks in hard rock terrain tol be taken up phase wise for exploratory drilling and laboratory analysis for resource augmentation, reconnaitory and detailed surveys to delineate potential blocks and systematic general exploration of shoreline and inland areas are among steps listed out by the GSI.GSI will also focus its exploration efforts on various potential geological environments and areas which warrant accelerated exploration efforts. Concentration of REE elements will also be studied in the suitable bauxite deposits having a genetic linkage with REE rich segments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gsi-draws-up-strategic-plan-to-step-up-exploration-194111
05-01-2021||New Delhi||Cong failed to recognise end of its charismatic leadership: Pranab in last book||The Congress’s failure to recognise the end of its charismatic leadership was among the many reasons for its 2014 Lok Sabha polls defeat, according to former president Pranab Mukherjee who felt lack of extraordinary leaders reduced the establishment to a “government of averages”.Mukherjee made these comments in his memoir “The Presidential Years, 2012-2017” which he wrote before his death last year. The book released on Tuesday.He also wrote that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had not discussed the issue of demonetisation with him prior to his announcement on November 8, 2016 but it did not surprise him as suddenness is absolutely necessary for such announcements.In the book, Mukherjee mentioned that on the day of the results of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he directed his aide-de-camp to keep him informed of the trends every half an hour.When the results were announced in the evening, he was “greatly relieved over the decisive mandate but also disappointed at my one-time party’s performance”.“It was difficult to believe that the Congress had managed to win just 44 seats. The Congress is a national institution interlinked with people’s lives. Its future is always a concern of every thinking individual,” he wrote in the book, published by Rupa Publications.The former Congress leader and Union minister attributed this defeat to many reasons.“I feel the party failed to recognise the end of its charismatic leadership. Tall leaders like Pandit Nehru ensured that India, unlike Pakistan, survived and developed into a strong and stable nation. Sadly, such extraordinary leaders are not there anymore, reducing the establishment to a government of averages,” he wrote.According to Mukherjee, when he looked back on his years as president, he derived satisfaction not only from the fact that he followed the rule book in letter and spirit in dealing with governments and issues of the day, but also because he never veered from the constitutional parameters that have been laid down for an Indian head of state.He wrote he had very cordial relations with Prime Minister Modi during his tenure.“However, I did not hesitate to give my advice on matters of policy during our meetings. There were several occasions when he echoed concerns that I had voiced. I also believe that he has managed to grasp the nuances of foreign policy quickly,” the book said.Mukherjee’s approach to maintaining cordial relations with Modi was rooted in the fact that “I believe in the parliamentary form of government and its principle”.“Modi had received a decisive mandate from the people to administer the country. Administrative powers are vested in the Council of Ministers, which the PM heads. Therefore, I did not breach my jurisdiction. Whenever tricky occasions arose, the issues were resolved,” he wrote.“At an event in which PM Modi released a book and I was present, I remarked that it was not that I did not have any differences with him, but that both of us knew how to manage those differences, without bringing them out in public,” he added.However, Mukherjee lamented that the NDA government, during its first term of 2014-19, failed in its primary responsibility to ensure the smooth and proper functioning of Parliament.“I attribute the acrimonious exchanges between the Treasury and Opposition benches to the arrogance and inept handling by the government. But the Opposition is not without blame either. It had also behaved irresponsibly,” he wrote.According to Mukherjee, the mere physical presence of the prime minister in Parliament makes a tremendous difference to the functioning of this institution.“Whether it was Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Atal Bihari Vajpayee or Manmohan Singh, each of these former PMs made their presence felt on the floor of the House.“PM Modi, now in his second term, must take inspiration from his predecessors and provide visible leadership, through his enhanced presence in Parliament to avoid situations that had precipitated the parliamentary crisis we witnessed in the first term,” the book said.Modi, Mukherjee said, must listen to the dissenting voices and speak more often in Parliament, adding he must use it as a forum to disseminate his views to convince the Opposition and inform the nation.On foreign relations, Mukherjee felt that Modi’s stopover in Lahore was “unnecessary and uncalled for, given the conditions that prevailed” in India-Pakistan relations.“It was evident that one could expect the unexpected from Modi, because he had come with no ideological foreign policy baggage. He was to continue with these surprises: he made a sudden and unscheduled stop at Lahore in December 2015 to greet his then Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, on the latter’s birthday; and he initiated an annual informal summit with the Chinese president - one was held at Wuhan in China in 2018 and the other, more recently, at Mamallapuram in Tamil Nadu in 2019.” On Modi not discussing about demonetisation with him before announcing it, Mukherjee wrote: “I am of the firm opinion that demonetisation could not have been done with prior consultation because the suddenness and surprise, absolutely necessary for such announcements, would have been lost after such a process.” “Therefore, I was not surprised when he did not discuss the issue with me prior to making the public announcement. It also fitted in with his style of making dramatic announcements,” he said.However, after delivering his address to the nation, Modi visited Mukherjee at Rashtrapati Bhavan and explained to him the rationale behind the decision.“He desired an explicit support from me as a former finance minister of the country. I pointed out to him that while it was a bold step, it may lead to temporary slowdown of the economy. We would have to be extra careful to alleviate the suffering of the poor in the medium to long term,” Mukherjee said.“Since the announcement was made in a sudden and dramatic manner, I asked the PM if he had ensured that adequate currency was there for exchange,” he added.

05-01-2021||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Prima facie Umar Khalid, Tahir Hussain, others conspired together, says court||There was reasonable ground to prima facie show that former JNU student leader Umar Khalid, suspended AAP Councillor Tahir Hussain and others conspired on north-east Delhi riots last year, a court here said on Tuesday while taking cognisance of the supplementary charge sheet filed in the case.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Dinesh Kumar said there was sufficient material on record to proceed against Khalid in the case related to the communal violence in Khajuri Khas area in February last year.The court said a witness statement was sufficient to show that during the relevant time, Khalid was allegedly in contact with Hussain, accused as the main conspirator who had funded the communal riots and instigated the mob from his house to rob the people and burn down properties.It noted that the prosecution has alleged in the charge sheet that Khalid was an active participant in the criminal conspiracy to instigate communal riots in various parts of Delhi.“Due to the instigation by the accused persons, a mob had gathered which had robbed persons and burnt down the properties including houses and shops. They had also destroyed the public property,” it said in its order.It noted that the prosecution has relied upon the statement of a witness named Rahul Kasana and a perusal of his statement under section 161 (examination by police) CrPC would show that he has stated that he was working as the driver of Hussain at the relevant time. The court said as per his statement, Kasana had seen accused Hussain allegedly distributing money to the persons who were participating in the demonstration against the Citizenship Amendment Act.It said the statement alleged that on January 8, 2020, he had taken Hussain to Shaheen Bagh where the latter had entered in an office after deboarding the car and after sometime he had seen Umar Khalid along with Khalid Saifi allegedly entering inside the office. The court said: “After about 1­-1.5 hours, accused Tahir Hussain had come out of the office. The statement of this witness is sufficient to show that during the relevant time, accused Umar Khalid was in contact with accused Tahir Hussain against whom there is sufficient material on record to prima facie show that he was the main conspirator who had funded the communal riots and instigated the mob from his house to rob the persons and to burn down the properties".Thus, there is reasonable ground to prima facie show that accused Umar Khalid, accused Tahir Hussain and other accused persons had conspired together to commit offences as mentioned in the charge sheet. Hence, there is sufficient material on record to proceed against accused Umar Khalid.”The court directed the investigating officer to supply a copy of the supplementary charge sheet to Khalid through the concerned Jail Superintendent.Meanwhile, the court also issued notice to the police on an application moved by Khalid alleging that a “vicious media campaign” was being conducted against him. The application claimed that sections of the media were getting access to the charge sheet even before the accused or his counsel got it.The police had filed the supplementary charge sheet against Khalid in the case on December 26 last year. The main charge sheet was filed against  15 persons, including Hussain, in June last year.Khalid was arrested in the case in October, 2020, and was in judicial custody. He was arrested in September last year in a separate case related to the conspiracy in the riots and booked under the stringent anti-terror law — Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 last year after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-prima-facie-umar-khalid-tahir-hussain-others-conspired-together-says-court-194106

05-01-2021||Islamabad||Pakistan's Supreme Court orders reconstruction of vandalised Hindu temple||Pakistan's Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered authorities to start the reconstruction of a century-old Hindu temple that was vandalised by a mob in the restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa last week and instructed them to recover the money for the restoration work from the attackers whose act has caused "international embarrassment" to the country.The apex court, which took notice of the attack and ordered the local authorities to appear before the court on January 5, also directed the Evacuee Property Trust Board (EPTB) to submit in court details of all functional and non-functional temples and gurdwaras across Pakistan.The attack on the temple in Terri village in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's (KP) Karak district last week by members of radical Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam party (Fazal ur Rehman group) drew strong condemnation from human rights activists and the minority Hindu community leaders.During the hearing on Tuesday, a three-member Bench headed by Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed ordered the EPTB to start the reconstruction work.Chief Justice Ahmed said the attack on the temple had "caused international embarrassment to Pakistan".The court also directed the EPTB to clear encroachments from temples across the country and take action against officials involved in the encroachments.The EPTB is a statutory board that manages religious properties and shrines of Hindus and Sikhs who had migrated to India following the partition.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary, police chief, and Shoaib Suddle, the head of a commission on minorities' rights, were present during the hearing.Suddle, who visited the temple in Karak district and presented a comprehensive report in the case to the apex court on Monday after it asked him to probe the attack, told the court that the provincial EPTB "did not protect the shrine".Justice Ijazul Ahsan then questioned Inspector General of Police Sanaullah Abbasi on how the attack could have happened when there was a police check post next to the temple."Where were your intelligence agencies?" Justice Ahsan asked.Abbasi told the court that 109 people involved in the attack were arrested. He also said that 92 police officials, including the Superintendent of Police and Deputy Superintendent of Police were suspended.Chief Justice Ahmed though said that "suspension was not enough".The police chief told the court that a protest by the JUI-F was going on near the site on the day of the incident."Out of the six ulema at the protest, only Maulvi Mohammad Sharif incited the crowd," he said.The judge also pulled up the EPTB chairman, saying he should "not sit on the chairman's seat with government mentality"."Your employees are doing business on the land meant for shrines. Arrest them and start the reconstruction of the temple," said Justice Ahmed.The court ordered the EPTB to recover the money for the temple restoration from the attackers."You (EPTB chief) have to recover money from the people who did this, from this Maulvi (Sharif) and his followers," said the Chief Justice.Justice Ahsan observed that the EPTB "has the money to construct its own buildings but does not have money for Hindus".The Bench directed that details of functional and non-functional shrines, records of disputes on EPTB lands and a report on the performance of the EPTB chairman be submitted to the court in two weeks.The court said a detailed judgement would be released later and adjourned the hearing for two weeks.In his report, Suddle suggested opening of four Hindu temples for international tourism, including Param Hans Ji Maharaj Samadhi (the one attacked in Karak), Hinglaj Mata Mandir in Hingol National Park of Balochistan's district Lasbela, Katas Raj complex in Punjab's district Chakwal and Parhlad Bhagat Mandir in Punjab's district Multan.He also recommended that lodging and boarding arrangements and security similar to Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib should be provided at those Hindu temples.Last week, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan said that his government would rebuild the temple.The temple was attacked by the mob after members of the Hindu community received permission from local authorities to renovate its decades-old building. The mob had demolished the newly constructed work alongside the old structure.Leader of Hindu Community Peshawar Haroon Sarab Diyal said a samadhi of a Hindu religious leader existed at the temple site and Hindu families from across the country do visit the samadhi on every Thursday.The samadhi of Shri Paramhans Ji Maharaj is considered sacred by the Hindu community. It was built where he died in 1919 in Teri village of Karak.The controversy over the samadhi erupted many decades ago.According to the details submitted to the Supreme Court in 2014 in a case about it, the Hindus had been visiting the shrine till 1997 when it was dismantled by the locals.The apex court in 2014 ordered the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to restore and reconstruct the Hindu shrine.The order was issued over a petition of a Hindu lawmaker who had claimed that the shrine had been occupied by an influential cleric of the area.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.The majority of Pakistan's Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with Muslim residents. They often complain of harassment by the extremists. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistans-supreme-court-orders-reconstruction-of-vandalised-hindu-temple-194103
05-01-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC asks Bollywood producers to reply on Bennett Coleman’s plea to reject defamation suit||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday sought response of leading bollywood producers on an application by Bennett Coleman and Company Ltd seeking rejection of the lawsuit filed by them against the media house and others in which they have sought to restrain them from making irresponsible remarks.Justice J R Midha issued notice on the application filed by Bennett Coleman and Company Ltd, Times Now editor-in-chief Rahul Shivshankar and group editor Navika Kumar and asked the Bollywood producers to file a reply within three weeks and listed the lawsuit for further hearing on March 23.The lawsuit by four Bollywood industry associations and thirty-four leading producers, including those owned by Aamir Khan, Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan, Karan Johar, Ajay Devgn, Anil Kapoor, Rohit Shetty, as also Yash Raj Films and R S Entertainment, has also sought that the channels be restrained from interfering with the right to privacy of persons associated with the industry.The high court had earlier sought replies of AGR Outlier Media Pvt Ltd (Republic TV), its editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and reporter Pradeep Bhandari, Times Now editor-in-chief Rahul Shivshankar and group editor Navika Kumar, and intermediaries Google, Facebook and Twitter on the leading Bollywood producers’ plea.In the fresh application, the Times group has raised the issue of jurisdiction and claimed that the Delhi High Court has no territorial jurisdiction to entertain the lawsuit against it and no cause of action has arisen in favour of the producers and against the media houses, considering that the plaint allegedly complains of defamation of unidentifiable group of person and as such, defamation is not made out.“Even otherwise, no defamatory content has been published by the defendant (Times group) herein against the plaintiff (producers) which amounts to defamation as alleged or otherwise or at all. Hence the present suit is not maintainable and as such, the present suit is liable to be dismissed,” the application stated.It said “All the plaintiffs reside within the territorial jurisdiction of Mumbai. Substantially, the defendants also reside within the territorial jurisdiction of Mumbai.“From a plain reading of the plaint, it can be seen that the plaintiffs have failed to provide any reason/justification as to how the cause of action, in whole or in part, as alleged or otherwise or at all has arisen in favour of the plaintiffs and against the defendants within the territorial jurisdiction of this court. Hence, the present suit is liable to be returned to the court of appropriate jurisdiction wherein the alleged cause of action has arisen in favour of the plaintiffs, if any,” it said.The court has extended its interim order asking media houses AGR Outlier Media Pvt Ltd and Bennett Coleman and Company Ltd to ensure that no defamatory content will be uploaded on social media platforms or displayed on their channels.The high court was earlier assured by the counsel for the media houses that they will follow the programme code and the Cable TV Networks (Regulation) Act.It had questioned the plaintiffs for not making individual celebrities parties in the suit and they are being represented through associations.The suit has said, “This comes in the wake of these channels using highly derogatory words and expressions for Bollywood such as ‘dirt’, ‘filth’, ‘scum’, ‘druggies’ and expressions such as ‘it is Bollywood where the dirt needs to be cleaned’... and ‘cocaine and LSD drenched Bollywood’”.Those who have filed the suit are The Film and Television Producers Guild Of India (PGI), The Cine and TV Artistes’ Association (CINTAA), Indian Film and TV Producers Council (IFTPC), Screenwriters Association (SWA), Aamir Khan Productions, Ad-Labs Films, Ajay Devgn Fflims,Andolan Films, Anil Kapoor Film and Communication Network, Arbaaz Khan Productions, Ashutosh Gowariker Productions, BSK Network and Entertainment, Cape of Good Films, Clean Slate Filmz and Dharma Productions.The list includes Emmay Entertainment and Motion Pictures, Excel Entertainment, Filmkraft Productions, Hope Production, Kabir Khan Films, Luv Films, Macguffin Pictures, Nadiadwala Grandson Entertainment, One India Stories, R.S. Entertainment (Ramesh Sippy Entertainment), Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra Pictures, Red Chillies Entertainment, Reel Life Productions, Reliance Big Entertainment, Rohit Shetty Picturez.The other plaintiffs are Roy Kapur Films, Salman Khan Films, Sikhya Entertainment, Sohail Khan Productions, Tiger Baby Digital, Vinod Chopra Films, Vishal Bhardwaj Pictures and Yashraj Films.In the plea, the producers have sought that the defendants (media persons) shall take down all the defamatory content published by them against the film industry.It claimed that the privacy of the members of Bollywood is being invaded and their reputations are being irreparably damaged by painting the entire industry as “criminals seeped in drug culture”. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-hc-asks-bollywood-producers-to-reply-on-bennett-colemans-plea-to-reject-defamation-suit-194102

A part of user metadata in our system which has non-anonymised, plain-text email IDs and phone numbers got compromised," the company informed."On August 18, 2020, an unauthorised attempt on our servers was detected and terminated when in progress," it added.According to JusPay, no full card numbers, order information, card PINs and passwords were leaked."We conducted a thorough audit on the day of the incident which confirmed that our 'Secure Data Store', which hosts the 16-digit encrypted card numbers, was not accessed and remains secure. The cyber-attack was identified in an isolated/separate system," JusPay elaborated."We can confirm that the compromised data does not contain any transaction or order information, as the intrusion was terminated before such an access."Rajaharia had told IANS that the data was being sold on the Dark Web for an undisclosed amount via crypto-currency Bitcoin."For this data, hackers are also contacting via Telegram," he said, adding that if the hackers can find out the hash algorithm used to generate the card fingerprint, they will be able to decrypt the masked card number."In this condition, all 10 crore cardholders are at risk," Rajaharia noted.JusPay said that it had made significant investments in security and data governance and its policies were aligned to globally accepted data protection standards."We did identify gaps in some of the older access keys and moved them to non-access key-based authentication supported by hosting providers. We have also made two-factor authentication (2FA) mandatory for all the tools accessed by our teams," said the company.According to Saurabh Sharma, Senior Security Researcher (GReAT), Kaspersky (APAC), data leaks due to internal vulnerabilities has become a common instance in India, especially in the last two years."Enterprises and institutions have begun to understand the importance of having a strong security framework to save themselves from an external attack by a cybercriminal. However, they tend to overlook the internal vulnerabilities that can prove to be  very damaging to their reputation and business if exploited by the bad guys," Sharma told IANS.Regular network and server evaluation, proactive detection of zero-day vulnerabilities and patching them immediately, launching attractive bug-bounty programmes and promptly informing the users of a potential leak are some of the "mandatory steps that  large enterprises and institutions should follow in order to stay away from cybercriminals and save their reputation”, he added.

This is a very unfortunate incident and can happen with anyone,” Adani Wilmar Deputy CEO Angshu Mallick told PTI.He said recently a senior IT executive was reported to have collapsed on a treadmill while exercising. “Does that mean treadmill is bad”?Rice bran oil, he said, is one of the world’s most healthy oils and contains natural antioxidants.“Gamma Oryzonal present in rice bran oil reduces bad cholesterol and improves lipid profile. Sourav Ganguly became our brand ambassador endorsing our Fortune rice bran oil. The rice bran oil is not a medicine but only cooking oil. There are several factors which affect heart ailments including dietary and hereditary issues,” he said.Gujarat-based Adani Wilmar is an equal joint venture between infrastructure conglomerate Adani Group and Singapore’s Wilmar Group. Formed in 1999, the Rs 30,000 crore turnover firm sells cooking oil under the ‘Fortune’ brand.Besides edible oils, it sells food products such as wheat flour, besan, rice, pulses, sugar, and soya nuggets under the Fortune brand.It is also into castor oil and personal care business under which it manufactures soaps. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fortune-cooking-oil-advt-featuring-ganguly-taken-off-air-temporarily-194090

05-01-2021||New Delhi||India gets its first women's team in disaster combat||In yet another example of shattering of the proverbial glass ceiling, the first batch of over 100 women disaster combatants and rescuers has been inducted in the country's federal calamity force NDRF.An all-woman team of freshly trained National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel was recently deployed for contingency duties on the banks of the Ganga river in Uttar Pradesh's Garh Mukteshwar town, said a senior force officer."The first women rescuers' team is already on ground. Recently, the UP Government requisitioned an NDRF team and they (women) went there (Garh Mukteshwar). The team handled the rescue boats and related equipment," NDRF Director General SN Pradhan told PTI in an interview."These personnel have all the skills to be called complete rescuers," he said.The move to include women personnel in the NDRF combat ranks was in the works for some time. The force, since it was raised over a decade ago, was till now an all-male affair.More than 100 women personnel have joined the NDRF over the last few months and they are being deputed with its battalions across the country as soon as they finish their pre-induction course and training, said the DG.He said the numbers were expected to go over 200 women personnel in the near future.The female personnel who are joining are in the constabulary and sub-officer (Sub Inspector and Inspector) ranks.As per authorisation, each NDRF battalion of over 1,000 personnel can have 108 woman rescuers.Pradhan, however, said as there were "pre-existing" vacancies in the feeder agencies or the paramilitary forces who send them to the disaster response force on deputation, it would take more time for the full strength of female combatants to join.The DG said the women personnel would add to the strength and skills of the force in rescuing disaster victims and even in calamity mitigation."We can deploy both components of an all-woman NDRF team or a mix squad of male and female personnel for responding to a situation. We prefer the second because if there is complement of women personnel, it makes a great difference on the ground where women, children and old persons are being rescued," said Pradhan."The skill sets of women are stronger in some aspects... so that can be leveraged, especially in situations where women are victims," he said.He further said the initial feedback to the first women's team in disaster combat had been good."They are performing well. From initial feedback, I think they will be a great efficiency multiplier and also a great symbol of pride, inclusion and gender sensitivity, which is also part of the Prime Minister's 10-point agenda for disaster response," he said.The DG also said the force was continuously creating women-oriented infrastructure at its existing and futuristic bases across the country.Every NDRF battalion has been seconded by a Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) like the CRPF or the ITBP and the parent force is responsible for feeding its manpower, who are sent on a time-bound deputation to the force.The NDRF has 12 operational battalions at present located in various states.It is a specialised unit that was raised in 2006 for specific tasks of relief and rescue during natural and man-made disasters or life threatening situations.

05-01-2021||New Delhi||I-T dept questions Robert Vadra for 2nd day in benami assets case||The Income Tax department questioned Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, for the second consecutive day on Tuesday in connection with its probe against him under the benami assets law, official sources said.A team from the Chandigarh investigation unit of the department, that is handling the probe, was seen going inside Vadra’s office in the Sukhdev Vihar area of the national capital around 3 pm.Vadra is married to Congress leader and Sonia Gandhi’s daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.After he was questioned on the first day on Monday, the 52-year-old had said the aim of the tax department’s action was to “digress” from the “real issues” concerning the country like the farmers’ agitation.On Monday, he was questioned for about eight hours and his statement was recorded as part of the proceedings related to the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, sources had said.Tax department sources had said Vadra was asked to join the investigation at their office but as he cited the prevailing COVID-19 restrictions, I-T officials decided to visit his premises.Officials had said the questioning was linked to the purchase of some land parcels by a firm linked to Vadra in Rajasthan’s border town of Bikaner in which another central probe agency, the Enforcement Directorate, had filed a money laundering case in 2015.The ED has questioned Vadra in this case in the past and had attached assets worth Rs 4.62 crore of his firm Ms Sky Light Hospitality (P) Ltd (now LLP) in 2019.Sources said the ED shared case documents of this probe along with that of possession of some alleged undisclosed assets abroad with the tax department for action under the anti-benami law that is enforced in the country by the latter.“Everyone knows it is (political vendetta). Whenever Priyanka (his wife Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra) moves out for helping farmers...and other issues then whom will they (probe agencies) come to?” Vadra had said to reporters after the tax department team left.“They will come to Robert Vadra. I don’t want to go into political issues but they (government) are digressing from real issues...like the farmers issue,” he had said.Vadra had said he had “nothing to hide and worry about” and that the truth will prevail.When reporters asked him if the latest questioning pertains to proceedings under the anti-benami law, he had said “it was general and nothing related to that (benami).”The I-T department has also been probing Vadra on charges of alleged possession of some undisclosed assets in the UK.The ED too is investigating these charges, under the anti-money laundering law, against the businessman.The ED has accused Vadra of money laundering in the purchase of a London-based property at 12, Bryanston Square worth 1.9 million GBP (British pounds), which is allegedly owned by him and this transaction involves the role of absconding defence consultant Sanjay Bhandari. Bhandari has never joined the I-T or ED probe in this case and is stated to be based abroad.

He looked forward to receiving Johnson in India at the earliest opportunity after normalisation of the situation, added the news release.US President Donald Trump had declined PM Modi’s invite to be the Chief Guest at the 2019 Republic Day celebrations but made up for it by attending the ‘Namaste Trump’ rally in Ahmedabad. But, Trump had conveyed his regrets nearly three months in advance, giving South Block enough time to invite South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.India had suffered a last-minute pull out in 2013 when the Sultan of a West Asian monarchy declined the invitation with just a month to go for the Republic Day. But the King of Bhutan Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, who was the Chief Guest barely eight years back, graciously stepped in.PM Modi had converted the guest list at Republic Day parades from a statement of intent regarding the foreign policy into an event that appeared to suggest India’s coming out party. The first two parades during his tenure continued with the tradition of inviting India’s close allies. But in 2017 there were seven chief guests and 10 in 2018. Last year, plans to continue with the multi-person format did not work out, and South Block invited the Brazilian President.Johnson announced the pull out on a day his Foreign Office announced the filling up of the vacant High Commissioner’s slot here with Deputy National Security Adviser Alex Ellis.The previous incumbent Philip Barton is now the Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign Office. Ellis takes over at a time when Britain is eyeing a major defence deal; its previous mega order of advanced jet trainers to the Indian Air Force having run its course.

05-01-2021||Kolkata||West Bengal sports minister Laxmi Ratan Shukla resigns||West Bengal minister of state for sports Laxmi Ratan Shukla resigned from the council of ministers and also quit the post of president of Howrah Town Committee of TMC on Tuesday triggering off speculations about his joining the BJP.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, however, said that Shukla, a reputed cricketer, wrote to her saying he wanted to be relieved from his political and administrative responsibilities as he wanted to focus on sporting activities.“I have no issue with him. I have given direction that his resignation be accepted. He wants to concentrate on sports and he has our best wishes. He is going to continue as a TMC MLA,” Banerjee told reporters here at an event.Shukla is the second minister to step down from the Mamata-led council of ministers.Earlier, Suvendu Adhikari, who was transport and irrigation minister in the Mamata cabinet, resigned from his post and joined the BJP in less than a month’s time after severing all connection with the TMC.Shukla, too, has been invited by the BJP to join the party. BJP state vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar said Shukla would be given the respect he deserved if he joined the BJP. West Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said the new year would see an exodus of people from TMC.Interestingly, WBPCC chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who is also leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, also said that Shukla was welcome to join the Congress.“Our doors are always open for him,” Chowdhury said.Following Shukla’s resignation, Baishali Dalmia, TMC MLA and daughter of the late BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmia, also opened up with regard to problems she was facing in TMC.Baishali, whose recent meeting with Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar raised eyebrows, told a TV channel that while CPI(M) and BJP left her alone, it was the functionaries of her own party TMC who did not tire of creating obstacles for her, she said.Baishali, whose constituency Bally is adjacent to Shukla’s constituency Howrah Uttar, said she could well understand the circumstances under which Shukla decided to put in his papers.At least 13 legislators have left TMC and joined BJP since December. With the assembly elections slated to be held in the state early next year, the exodus does not augur well for the party.In a related development, Rajib Bandopadhyay, the disgruntled West Bengal forest minister, skipped his scheduled meeting with education minister and TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee.The meeting was arranged to placate Bandopadhyay who is said to be upset about corruption and nepotism by some leaders in Howrah district where he represents the Domjur assembly seat.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-sports-minister-laxmi-ratan-shukla-resigns-194079

"But the same BJP Govt imposes cuts of Rs 37,530 crore in allowances of 113 lakh Armed Forces and Central Govt Employees and Pensioners," he tweeted.The Congress leader said the Prime Minister must not forget that he has imposed cuts of Rs 11,000 crore on 15 lakh soldiers and 26 lakh military pensioners and the same BJP government at the Centre has no time to provide 'heated tents and equipment' to our soldiers braving brazen the Chinese incursions in Ladakh.On Tuesday a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court cleared the redevelopment plan for the Central Vista with a 2:1 majority on Tuesday, although with riders.The bench held that there were "no infirmities in clearances given, change in land use and the environmental clearances". However, it imposed some riders like clearance from the heritage conservation committee.The project envisages a new Parliament building, with a seating capacity of up to 1,200 MPs. The project is estimated to be constructed by August 2022, when the country will celebrate its 75th Independence Day.On December 10, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone for the new Parliament building.

One of them alleged that he had paid Rs 16 lakhs to an official, who is also in custody. Twenty-four people, most of them attending a funeral, were killed and 17 others injured when the roof of a shelter at the cremation ground in Ghaziabad’s Murad Nagar collapsed on Sunday.In a statement on Tuesday, the UP government said, “Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed that the National Security Act be slapped against the accused persons. He also directed that loss of public money during the construction work be recovered from the contractor and engineers.” The CM also announced an aid of Rs 10 lakh to the kin of each deceased.Meanwhile, the NHRC issued notices to the UP Chief Secretary and the Director General of Police, seeking a detailed report about the incident within four weeks.“The report must contain review of all crematoriums, burial grounds and other such buildings, which are used by the general public for community activities in the state and maintained by the local administrative authorities. The authorities concerned must ensure proper maintenance of such places to avoid any untoward incidents in future posing danger to human lives,” the statement issued by the commission added.The rights panel said it has asked the state government, through its senior officers, about the present status of investigation as well as the condition of the injured.Police too arrested two more accused in the case.Contractor Ajay Tyagi, who went into hiding after the incident, was nabbed on Monday night near the Ganga Canal bridge of Sathedi village by a joint team of Murad Nagar and Niwari police, officials said.Sanjay Garg, owner of AS Construction Company, was arrested on the basis of Tyagi’s statement.The Ghaziabad police had on Monday arrested Murad Nagar Palika Executive Officer Niharika Singh, Junior Engineer Chandra Pal and Supervisor Ashish as they were involved in the tender process for building the structure. They were sent to a 14-day judicial custody.According to police, Tyagi said he made Grag a partner in the project as he needed his financial help.                       The shelter corridor was designed to increase the construction cost so that a big amount could be misappropriated by officials, SSP Kalanidhi Naithani said in a statement. Tyagi alleged that on the instruction of Junior Engineer Chandra Pal, he paid Rs 16 lakh to Executive Officer Niharika Singh at her office, the SP said.Tyagi and Garg were produced before a court, which sent them to a 14-day judicial custody, said advocate Omvir Morta.A tender of Rs 55 lakh was awarded to Tyagi for renovation and construction of the shelter three months ago.Police said probe is underway to examine how much substandard material was used in the construction. After investigation, corruption charges will be added, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/crematorium-roof-collapse-nsa-to-be-slapped-against-accused-nhrc-seeks-report-within-4-weeks-194054
05-01-2021||Kolkata||British actor Banita Sandhu refuses to be treated for mutant Covid strain at Kolkata govt hospital||British actor Banita Sandhu, who is in the city to shoot for a movie, tested positive for Covid on Monday and was admitted to a private hospital after she refused to be treated in a government facility, health department sources said.Sandhu, who was shooting for 'Kavita & Teresa', reached the city on December 20 and she travelled in the same flight with the youth who tested positive for the mutant coronavirus strain on his return from the United Kingdom.She was detected with the COVID-19 on Monday afternoon and steps were initiated to ascertain whether she has been infected with the new strain, an official said.After Sandhu was taken to the Beliaghata Infectious Diseases Hospital where a separate unit has been set up to keep those returned from the UK, the 23-year-old actress refused to come out of the ambulance alleging that the hospital lacked proper infrastructure."We had to inform the state secretariat and the health department as she was unwilling to come out of the ambulance and at one point of time, she wanted to leave."The British High Commission was informed as we cannot let her go like this which is against the protocol. We had to inform the police also. They (police personnel) came and surrounded the ambulance so that she cannot leave," the official said.Sandhu, who co-starred with Varun Dhawan in 'October', was counselled several times by senior doctors of the hospital but their efforts went in vain."Eventually, with the permission of the health department, she was admitted to a private hospital," the official said adding that Sandhu has been kept in an isolated cabin there.Before leaving Beliaghata ID hospital, the actress was made to sign a declaration that she was unwilling to get admitted there as "she felt the medical establishment lacked infrastructure".Steps have been taken to get the genetic analysis of her samples to ascertain whether she has been infected with the mutant coronavirus strain, Variant of Concern 202012/01 (VOC-202012/01), another official of the health department told PTI."We will be sending her samples for genetic analysis to Kalyani's National Institute of Biomedical Genomics to ensure whether the actress is infected with the new strain of the coronavirus or not. After that we will follow the necessary protocol once the result is out," the official said.'Kavita & Teresa' by Swiss-Indian filmmaker Kamal Musale is about love and compassion inspired by the life of Mother Teresa, according to the website of the movie.

05-01-2021||New Delhi||We welcome Supreme Court judgement giving go-ahead to Central Vista project: Puri||Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Tuesday welcomed a Supreme Court judgement giving a go-ahead to the Central Vista redevelopment project, and asserted that the government has always been sensitive to environmental concerns.The Union Housing and Urban Affairs minister, whose ministry is executing the ambitious project, said the government would continue to adhere to the highest standards during the period of construction."Delhi is on course to becoming a World Class capital city and in the first step by the time nation completes 75 years of its Independence in 2022 a new Parliament building will be ready reflecting the aspirations of new India," Puri tweeted.We welcome the Judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court giving the go ahead for the ambitious Central Vista Project.Central Govt has always been sensitive to environmental concerns & will continue to adhere to the highest standards during the period of construction.  In a majority verdict, the Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the environmental clearance and notification for change in land use for the Central Vista project."We welcome the Judgement of the Hon'ble Supreme Court giving the go ahead for the ambitious Central Vista Project. Central Govt has always been sensitive to environmental concerns & will continue to adhere to the highest standards during the period of construction," Puri said in a tweet.The redevelopment project of the Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.According to the government's latest proposal for the redevelopment of the Central Vista, the prime minister's new residential complex will have 10 four-storey buildings with a maximum height of 12 metres.The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is executing the project, has revised the estimated cost from Rs 11,794 crore to Rs 13,450 crore.

05-01-2021||Beijing||Pandemic propels India to strengthen itself and step up on global stage: Indian envoy to China||The coronavirus pandemic has spurred India to strengthen itself to demonstrate that with greater capabilities it would help not just itself but also be a force for good on the global stage, India's ambassador to China Vikram Misri has said.In an opinion piece published in the Hong-Kong based South China Morning Post, Misri said that the "devastating impact" of the pandemic was hard to quantify and its implications have been profound."But one of the biggest takeaways has to be more international cooperation, particularly as we get increasingly interconnected. Accordingly, while engaging with an emerging multipolar global order, India will continue to give the utmost attention to its immediate neighbourhood, where its Neighbourhood First policy, based on non-reciprocity, is creating the basis for shared activities," he said."At the same time, our extended neighbourhood has been an integral part of our history and heritage and our engagement has unfolded through an Act East policy and Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi's Sagar (Security and Growth for All In the Region) vision for the Indo-Pacific, which provides a template to engage with our maritime neighbours," Misri wrote in the article on Monday.He said the world needed more trusted and capable players and India believes it can play the role."The pandemic demonstrated that India with greater capabilities would help not just itself but also be a force for good on the global stage. Atmanirbhar Bharat is thus a self-reliant India but not a self-centred one," he said.Highlighting India's commencing of its two-year term from January 1 in the UN Security Council for the eighth time as a non-permanent member, Misri said, "convinced that the multipolar world today needs more multilateralism, we will focus on efforts to make the UN and other international bodies more representative and in sync with contemporary realities.""The challenges of 2020 are by no means over. Much remains to be done. India believes this is a collective enterprise and stands ready to engage with all and work for peace, development and cooperation," he said.The year 2020 is one that all would like to forget in a hurry. The coronavirus pandemic created a global crisis with no parallels in living memory. The governments around the world were forced to deal simultaneously with a catastrophic health emergency, massive economic shocks and serious social disruption, he wrote."Despite this, 2020 will be remembered in India as a year of reckoning when government and citizenry came together in a whole-of-society response marked by determination and discipline," he said."From an economy that previously did not make ventilators, testing kits, personal protective equipment (PPE) and N95 masks, India was soon manufacturing enough of them to cater not only to its own needs but also for export," he said.India also emphasised the need for global cooperation. Guided by its civilisational ethos, which places humanity at the centre of global prosperity and cooperation, India assisted others even while tending to problems at home, Misri said."When COVID-19 created a spike in pharmaceutical demand, we responded by ramping up our production, exporting medicines and other medical assistance to over 150 countries," he said."With the focus shifting to vaccines, India is involved in many international collaborations that give the world hope for normalcy. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has committed that India will leverage its vaccine manufacturing capacities to help make vaccines accessible and affordable to all," he said.As the pandemic dealt a blow to global mobility on account of severe travel restrictions, India mounted a massive operation, bringing more than three million citizens home from around the world and supported the movement of more than 110,000 foreigners out of India to 120 countries."The pandemic's health shock was matched perhaps only by its economic shock as trade and investment were disrupted and supply chains were unhinged. India's response was articulated in the vision of an 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' (self-reliant India). It would be a mistake to interpret this as India turning inward," Misri said."In the words of Modi, Atmanirbhar Bharat 'is not just about competition, but also about competence; it is not about dominance, but about dependability; it is not about looking within, but about looking out for the world'," he said."In a time of global crisis, it would have been easy for India to focus just on recovery. Instead, the government seized the opportunity for a spate of major reforms in domains ranging from manufacturing to agriculture and education," he said.He said the government has introduced "landmark" agricultural reforms to end the monopoly of trading cliques.'The proposed laws allow farmers to sell their produce at a price of their own choosing and even outside their respective states, thereby leading to better rural incomes. They also encourage private-sector investment and leverage technology to enhance our farm productivity to near-global standards," he said, defending the three agriculture reform laws enacted by the government.

05-01-2021||New York||Global leaders hail India's scientific innovation, decisive action to combat COVID-19||Global leaders have lauded India's leadership in scientific innovation and decisive action to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, as the country gets set to begin the world's largest vaccination drive against the novel coronavirus.The Drug Controller General of India on Sunday approved the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute and indigenously developed Covaxin of Bharat Biotech, for restricted emergency use in the country, paving the way for a massive inoculation drive."It's great to see India's leadership in scientific innovation and vaccine manufacturing capability as the world works to end the COVID-19 pandemic," Bill Gates, co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said in a tweet on Monday, tagging the Prime Minister's Office.Director-General of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus tweeted that India "continues to take decisive action & demonstrate its resolve to end #COVID19 pandemic"."As the world's largest vaccine producer, it's well placed to do so. If we #ACTogether, we can ensure effective & safe vaccines are used to protect the most vulnerable everywhere," Ghebreyesus said and tagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his tweet.A day after India's drug regulator approved two vaccines for restricted emergency use, Prime Minister Modi said the world's biggest inoculation drive against coronavirus was set to begin in the country.Praising the scientists and technicians for the 'Made in India' vaccines, he said the country was proud of them."World's biggest COVID-19 vaccination programme set to begin in India. For this, the country is proud of the contributions of its scientists and technicians," Modi said.Addressing scientists at the National Metrology Conclave, Modi had said it must be ensured that 'Made in India' products not only have global demand but also global acceptance.Modi has assured the global community that India's vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic."Even during these very difficult times of the raging pandemic, the pharmaceutical industry of India has sent essential medicines to more than 150 countries," Modi had said in his pre-recorded video statement to the General Debate of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly in September last year.In a strong assurance to the international community, that is battling the devastating coronavirus pandemic, Modi said, "As the largest vaccine producing country in the world, I want to give one more assurance to the global community today. India's vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting this crisis." —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/global-leaders-hail-indias-scientific-innovation-decisive-action-to-combat-covid-19-194031

So we aim to conclude in half the time the work that was done in 27 years,” he said.He said the first CNG station in India started around 1992 and in 22 years till 2014, only 900 stations were set up.“In the last six years over 1,500 stations have started and the aim is to raise the number to 10,000,” Modi said.He said the gas pipeline commissioned today would help set up 700 CNG stations in Kerala and Karnataka.On piped natural gas, the PM said till 2014, 25 lakh connections had been given while today 72 lakh houses had piped gas.The Kochi-Mangaluru pipeline will benefit 21 lakh additional people with PNG.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-inaugurates-450-km-kochi-mangaluru-natural-gas-pipeline-194029
05-01-2021||New Delhi||Localised herd immunity, young population behind dip in India's COVID count?||The absolute number of people infected with COVID-19 in India may never be known but much of the scientific community agrees the downward trajectory of the disease is real and can likely be attributed to ‘localised' herd immunity and a younger population.As scientists attempt to understand India's sliding COVID count, the country on Tuesday recorded 16,375 new COVID-19 cases, more than six times lower than the highest daily spike of 97,894 on September 16 and the lowest in six months.  While there is a glimmer of hope and India's COVID-19 numbers are on a definite decline for a combination of reasons, a vaccination programme continues to be important, particularly given the presence of a mutant, more transmissible strain, several experts said while cautioning against infection upticks ahead.“It's not the absolute numbers, but the trajectory that is important,” said Shahid Jameel, director, Trivedi School of Biosciences, Ashoka University, looking at India's COVID graph.Noting that it is impossible and impractical to have true numbers during a pandemic, or even after that, unless everyone is tested, the virologist said COVID-19 cases in the country have gone down steadily since the peak in mid-September.Reflecting the national trend, Delhi's graph has also been on a downward slide with 384 fresh COVID-19 cases recorded on Monday, the lowest in over seven months, raising hopes that herd immunity may have set in.Herd immunity is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that sets in when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection.  “Nothing has changed drastically in testing or behaviour since mid-September. So relatively speaking, it's a downward trajectory,” Jameel told PTI. The country's average, he said, hides many localised spikes and that would continue.While the actual numbers may well be underestimated, the trend of lower numbers appears to be real and the rate of spread of the infection is likely to have reduced, said immunologist Satyajit Rath.“A possible explanation for this may be that crowded urban localities and neighbourhoods where spread was very rapid earlier might be largely saturated, a form of hyperlocal 'herd immunity',” Rath, from New Delhi's National Institute of Immunology (NII), told PTI.The lack of more travel and the distancing measures -- however poorly implemented -- may be keeping rates of spread somewhat lower in other less crowded neighbourhoods, he said.Given the large number of infections in the first wave, it is certainly conceivable that some population immunity has set in and it is difficult for the virus to transmit as easily as it had in the first round, said epidemiologist and economist Ramanan Laxminarayan.For that reason, it is doubtful India will have a second wave as big as the first one, he explained.   “India has been protected by its relatively young population -- 65 per cent of the country is under the age of 35 and infections in those age groups have likely slowed down overall transmission,” Laxminarayan, founder and director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy in Washington, told PTI.Jameel added that while it is unclear what per cent infection or exposure is needed for herd immunity for COVID-19, most epidemiologists believe it would be 60 per cent or above.“If that be the case, we may be closer to it in some but not all locations,” Jameel said.He noted that it is hard to say if the first wave is ending and if there will be a second wave.“That depends on how many people have been infected. Considering that we went through two important periods without any significant upturn – Dussehra to Diwali festive season and Bihar elections – I think that there would be enough infected people and we will not see a second wave,” said the virologist.Referring to the second ICMR survey which showed an average 6.6 per cent positivity across 70 districts three months ago, Jameel said it translates to 90 to 100 million infected people.“Other surveys, e.g. urban centres, data from diagnostic company Thyrocare etc. put the number much higher -- 300 to 400 million,” he said.Positivity is the percentage of all coronavirus tests performed that are actually positive.Outbreak modelling for India, said Jameel, suggests about 30 per cent overall infection, with 50 per cent in large and densely populated cities.“What we are seeing is a complex mixture of high exposure in densely populated areas (cities) where the outbreak also moves faster, and low exposure in villages and rural districts where the outbreak may still be expanding, but doing so slowly,” said Jameel, adding this will create a situation where the return to baseline will be prolonged.Advising caution, Laxminarayan said there certainly seems to be a natural decline in the numbers of infections overall across most states, but that has been seen before in many other countries where there is now a rise in cases. Rath agreed with Laxminaryanan, saying the virus spread is not in the form of a uniform 'wave' but the result of very many variable local 'waves'.“It is quite likely the spread of infection will 'plateau', so to say, and will be sustained at a relatively lower level,” he said.Discussing a vaccine, Laxminarayan said everyone should get a shot, regardless of whether or not people have had a COVID infection.“Immunity through direct exposure can be variable and not as reliable as immunity acquired through vaccination,” he said.“Infection upticks are quite possible, so vaccinations are going to be very useful. And testing for pre-existing immunity before vaccination is not easy or cheap to implement,” Rath added. The vaccination will in all likelihood be done without any consideration of excluding previously exposed people, he said.Jameel agreed.“You can always test before giving a vaccine, but that would double cost and logistics. It's easier to vaccinate everyone at risk, who is willing to be vaccinated,” he added.With a more contagious variant now in India and detected so far in 33 countries, it is not known yet how the transmission will play out, the scientists said. Now that vaccines are becoming available, they should be deployed.The experts also debunked the “myth” that the Indian population is genetically advantaged in tackling this virus better. Similar mortality rates, they said, are seen across all of South and Southeast Asia.“Once we account for differences in age structure of population, there is not much difference in case fatality rates across countries, if measured correctly,” Laxminarayan said. Rath concurred with Laxminarayan, saying there is no strong clear evidence that the illness is less severe in India compared to elsewhere.“I see no reason so far to invoke speculation about 'better immunity' or any genetic resistance in India. I have seen no evidence for either of those possibilities,” he added.The road ahead is still tricky.Now that the vaccines are rolling out and will cover large parts of the world over the next six-12 months, one other thing to watch out for are vaccine-escape mutants, said Jameel.“These would be viral variants that can escape vaccine generated immunity. This would only be possible by means of dense genomic sequencing, especially those who get infected even after getting vaccines,” he added.

05-01-2021||New Delhi||Firm on their demands, farmers brave cold, rain as talks with govt remain deadlocked||Camping at Delhi borders for over a month now, protesting farmers seem undeterred in the face of severe cold, rain and waterlogging, and firm on their demands for repeal of farm laws and legal backing for MSP even as talks with the government remained inconclusive.On Monday, the seventh round of talks was held to resolve the deadlock. The unions stuck to their demand for a complete repeal of the new farm laws they find pro-corporate, while the government wanted to discuss only “problematic” clauses or other alternatives. The two sides will meet again on January 8.Speaking to reporters after the meet, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said he expected positive talks and a possible resolution in the next meeting but asserted that “efforts need to be made from both sides for a solution”.The protesting farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been at the border points of the national capital for almost 40 days now, braving the bone-chilling cold.Sporadic rain has also lashed the city in the last couple of days, following which the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) arranged makeshift elevated beds in a tent provided by the organisation at the demonstration site near Singhu border.The tent, located right beyond the main stage at the site, is pitched on the lower end of the highway, making it susceptible to waterlogging.Since the farmers arrived at the national capital’s borders in late November, the Delhi Traffic Police has been posting alerts on its official Twitter handle to inform commuters about road closures across the city.In a series of tweets on Tuesday, the traffic police said Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Saboli and Mangesh borders are closed for traffic movement.“Please take alternative route via Lampur Safiabad, Palla & Singhu school toll tax borders. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba & GTK road. Please avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK Road & NH-44,” it said.“The Chilla and Ghazipur borders are closed for traffic coming from Noida and Ghaziabad to Delhi because of farmer protests. Please take alternative route for coming to Delhi via Anand Vihar, DND, Bhopra & Loni Borders,” it added.The traffic police said Tikri and Dhansa borders are also closed for traffic movement.“Jhatikara Border is open only for LMV (cars/light motor vehicles), two-wheelers and pedestrian movement,” it said in another tweet.According to the traffic police, people travelling to Haryana can take the routes via Jharoda (only single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders.

05-01-2021||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court approves Central Vista project||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 5The Supreme Court on Tuesday cleared the Central Vista Redevelopment Project that included construction of a new Parliament Building and a common Central Secretariat, with certain conditions.By a 2:1 majority, a three-judge Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar held that there were no infirmities in the clearances given for the project, including those with regard to change in the land use, environmental clearances and selection of consultant.“We cannot be called upon to govern. For, we have no wherewithal or prowess and expertise in that regard,” the majority verdict by Justice Khanwilkar and Justice Dinesh Maheshwari said.However, it asked the Centre to get necessary prior permission of the Heritage Conservation Committee “before actually starting any development/redevelopment work on the stated plots/structures/precincts governed by the heritage laws, including on plot No. 118, if already not obtained”.The top court directed the project proponent to set up smog towers of adequate capacity as an integral part of the new Parliament Building Project and use smog guns at the construction site throughout the construction phase.It also asked the Ministry of Environment and Forests to install smog towers in future projects, particularly in those cities where pollution was an issue.Justice Sanjiv Khanna – who delivered a dissenting verdict – held the change in land use and environmental clearances given to the project were bad in law, even as he said, “Our interference does not reflect on merits of the stands, but is on account of procedural illegalities and failure to abide the statutory provisions and mandate.”Last month, the Bench had expressed displeasure over the Centre going ahead with the project without waiting for its verdict. However, it had allowed the foundation laying for the project by PM Modi on December 10.The top court – which had on November 5 reserved its verdict on PILs challenging various permissions given by authorities for redevelopment of Central Vista in Lutyens’ Delhi – noted that, “The petitioners have not pointed out a single document which formed a part of the process and was not placed in public domain.”The Central Vista redevelopment plan – which aims to free up 75 acre land in the heart of the capital – involves demolition of around 10 buildings, including Shastri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan, Krishi Bhawan, Vigyan Bhawan, Vice-President’s House and Lok Nayak Bhawan.Announced in September last year, it envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with seating capacity for more than 1,200 MPs, expected to be constructed by August 2022 when the country will be celebrating its 75th Independence Day.

05-01-2021||Thane||Woman, paramour get life sentence for killing husband||A Thane court has awarded life imprisonment to a 29-year-old woman who worked at a bar and her paramour for killing her husband in 2017.In his order issued on Monday, Additional Sessions Judge R R Vaishnav relied on the statement of the deceased's six-year-old daughter, who had seen her mother and the latter's paramour commit the crime and medical report in the case.The judge pronounced the woman and her 35-year-old paramour guilty under Indian Penal Code Sections 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of the offence, or giving false information to screen offender) and also imposed a fine of Rs 6,000 on each of them.Another accused in the case was given the benefit of doubt and acquitted by the court.Additional Public Prosecutor Ujjwala Moholkar told the court that on the intervening night of October 13-14, 2017, the 30-year-old victim was found hanging from the ceiling of his house in Kalwa town of Maharashtra's Thane district.A probe into the case revealed the victim did not like his wife working in a bar and they used to have frequent fights over the issue.Hence, the woman along with her paramour and his friend hatched a conspiracy and killed her husband. They then hung the body from the ceiling. The woman stayed at home while her paramour and his friend fled.Later, the woman informed police that her husband had committed suicide, the prosecution told the court.The couple's minor daughter had witnessed the crime and she gave her statement to police about the murder and hanging. She also maintained her statement in court.The defence counsel argued that though the incident spot is located in a crowded area, the prosecution did not examine any independent witness, neighbour or landlord of the deceased, and the evidence of the child witness cannot be relied upon.But, the judge referred to provisions of the Indian Evidence Act and said no particular number of witnesses shall, in any case, be required for the proof of any fact. "The evidence is to be weighed and not counted," he observed."The testimony of a single witness is sufficient to establish any fact if it inspires confidence," he said.So far as non-examination of independent witness is concerned, one has to consider the mentality of society.Generally, no one wants to get involved in a matter pertaining to others, the judge noted.The accused cannot take advantage of non-examination of such independent witness, he said in the order.

It said India was well entrenched to counter any misadventure by the Chinese forces. “The Indian Army is prepared for any eventuality and talks are also progressing to resolve the issue in an amicable manner,” says the year-end review of the MoD on the working of the forces and the ministry.Apportioning blame to the PLA, the MoD says, “The Indian Army has maintained all protocols and agreements between the two countries, while the PLA escalated the situation by the utilisation of unorthodox weapons and amassing a large number of troops.” “There were unilateral and provocative actions by the Chinese to change the status quo by force, in more than one area on the LAC. These were responded to in a firm and non-escalatory way, ensuring the sanctity of our claims in Eastern Ladakh,” said the MoD.Probably for the first time bringing on record on what kind of weapons have been deployed, the MoD said, “The Indian Army, with assistance from the IAF, mobilised troops, including accretionary forces, heavy equipment like guns, tanks as also ammunition, ration and clothing, in a very short duration.”‘Terrorist strength in valley below 200’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/defence-ministry-china-behind-lac-skirmish-193759

In general, India has relatively high average tariff rates, especially in agriculture. It can raise its applied rates to bound rates without violating its commitments under the WTO (World Trade Organisation), causing uncertainty for US exporters,” said the CRS report, which is prepared for the members of Congress ahead of trade decisions.The United States and several other countries have requested to join various WTO dispute consultations against India, related to its technology tariffs, also questioning its compliance with the WTO Information Technology Agreement (ITA).“India opposes the 25 per cent steel and 10 per cent aluminum national security-based ‘Section 232’ tariffs that the Trump administration imposed in 2018. India repeatedly delayed applying planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States in hopes of resolving the issues bilaterally,” it said.After India lost its eligibility for the US Trade Preference Programme, it imposed higher tariffs of 10 per cent to 25 per cent, affecting about $1.32 billion of US exports, such as nuts, apples, chemicals, and steel, the report stated, adding that the two sides are challenging each other’s tariffs in the WTO. — PTI‘Tension flared’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-us-trade-ties-hit-under-trump-congressional-report-193762

Also, there is no move by Colombo to green-light an Indo-Japanese port project that New Delhi wants to project as a modest Indian answer to the Chinese-built Hamabantota port.A December 30 virtual meeting of the joint working group on fisheries did not lead to a breakthrough in the release of 36 Tamil fishermen held by Sri Lanka.Jaishankar is scheduled to hold discussions with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena.Sri Lanka, like many of India’s SAARC colleagues, has avoided getting caught in making a binary choice between New Delhi and Beijing. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s visit to Colombo failed to get Sri Lanka interested in the Quad’s concept of the Indo-Pacific. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had told Pompeo publicly that his country “will maintain a neutral stand in foreign policy and will not get entangled in struggles between power blocs”.As an alternative, India is pursuing a trilateral neighbourhood maritime domain awareness project with Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India revived this UPA-era format with NSA Ajit Doval traveling to Sri Lanka in November last year for a trilateral meeting on maritime security and exchange of information.Besides taking up the release of Tamil fishermen, Jaishankar, would be exploring the prospects of the $ 500 million India-Japan East Container Terminal development project at Colombo Port.Colombo port project stalled||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankars-lanka-visit-to-bolster-ties-193764

The ministers said they would hold consultations and get back. The next meeting is on January 8. The pressure is on the government as the agitation is now a people’s movement.”With the government also remaining firm on its stance, the farm unions will meet on Tuesday to discuss the next course of action.Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government, which was aware of the farmers’ concerns, had offered clause-wise discussion on the Acts. “The meeting was held in good atmosphere, but since the farmers remained adamant on their demands, we could not arrive at any conclusion,” he said, hoping that the “issue will be resolved soon”.“The date of the next meeting was decided unanimously,” Tomar said in response to accusations of farmers’ “lack of trust” in the government and its own “lack of interest” in resolving the issue. “It is an important issue involving the entire country. The laws have been made keeping in mind the best interests of the farmers,” he said.BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said: “They (Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Prakash) kept listing out benefits of the new Acts. But we are not going home till the laws are repealed.”During the break, the union leaders had their own food, arranged from langar, as they have been doing for the last few times. And unlike the last round of talks, the ministers did not join them and were seen having their own discussion separately. Sources say the government has already relented on the proposed Electricity Amendment Bill and ordinance on stubble burning and this is all it is willing to do.“Given the kind of support the agitation has received, the matter seems to have moved out of the government’s hands for a resolution on a middle path,” says an analyst. As they have drawn elaborate plans for Lohri and Republic Day, it is clear that the farmers are in no hurry to move from the Delhi borders despite adverse weather.SC to treat letter by PU pupils as PILThe Supreme Court has converted into a PIL a letter written by 35 students of Panjab University’s Centre for Human Rights and Duties to Chief Justice of India, highlighting the alleged violation of human rights of farmers.Two more Punjab farmers deadFarmer Gurcharn Singh from Bakhopir in Sangrur died at his house on his return from Delhi.

We are not talking about pet dogs and cats. People live on the basis of their animals. You can’t confiscate them and keep them before the man is convicted. You either withdraw it or we will stay it,” a Bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, told Additional Solicitor General Jayant K Sud who represented the Centre.The Bench was hearing a petition filed by the Buffalo Traders Welfare Association challenging the validity of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Care and Maintenance of Case Property Animals) Rules, 2017, framed under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The rules allowed the authorities to seize vehicles used in cattle transportation and send the animals to gaushalas or cow shelters. “We are trying to tell you that the Section is very clear that only the person who is convicted can lose the animal. You either amend the rule or we will stay it. We cannot have a situation where the rule is running contrary to the express provision of the Act”, the Bench said as Sud sought to defend the rules, saying they were notified in view of atrocities being committed on animals. The Bench — has already issued notice to the Centre — posted the matter for further hearing on January 11 after Sud sought time to seek instructions.The petitioners contended they were being forcibly deprived of their cattle which was sent to ‘Gaushalas’ under the impugned rules.What the rules sayThe Bench was hearing a plea challenging the validity of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Care and Maintenance of Case Property Animals) Rules, 2017.The rules allowed the authorities to seize vehicles used in cattle transportation and send the animals to gaushalas or cow shelters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/withdraw-or-amend-rules-on-confiscation-of-animals-sc-193784

We were the first to file a global patent for Zika and Chikungunya vaccines. It is not right to say we are not transparent with data. We do not deserve this backlash,” Bharat Biotech Chairman Krishna Ella said in a virtual press conference held today. Ella said Biotech was a global company and had made 16 vaccines.“Do not accuse us of inexperience. We have published in a lot of journals and have the only bio-safety level 3 facility in the world which even the US does not have. We have published five research articles on Covaxin trials and not inferior to Pfizer when it comes to publications,” Ella said, adding that the efficacy data from phase 3 trials of Covaxin would be available by March.Biotech, he said, was running trials in 12 countries, besides India.“Ours is the only vaccine for 12 years and above. We plan to do clinical trials in children as well,” said Ella. Ella added Biotech had 20 million doses ready and through 2021 was aiming to achieve greater capacity. He said people were targeting “Indian companies”. “This is not right,” he said, a day after Serum Institute of India’s CEO Adar Poonawala claimed that only Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines had shown efficacy and the rest were “safe like water”.

05-01-2021||New Delhi||Covid vaccine to cost Rs 219-292 per shot to govt; at double that rate in pvt market: Serum||Coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford will cost USD 3-4 per shot (Rs 219-292) to the government and will be priced at double that rate in private market ones such sales open up, said the CEO of its Indian manufacturer on Monday.Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, has a licence to produce the shot and has already manufactured close to 50 million doses.Its CEO Adar Poonawalla told PTI that the company will start selling the Covishield to the Indian government and GAVI countries in the first stage, followed by the private market.Indian drug regulator on Sunday approved Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin for restricted emergency use in the country.“We want the vaccine to be affordable and accessible to all. The government of India will receive it at a far more affordable price of USD 3-4, since they will be buying in a larger volume,” he said.Poonawalla, who had taken a huge gamble once the pandemic began to unfold by overhauling Serum’s assembly line and “sacrificing” products that were to be destined for Europe and America in anticipation of a COVID-19 vaccine, said the priority supplies will go to India and the GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization) nations.Only after meeting their requirements, “the private market will open up where the pricing would be USD 6-8 per done,” he said.Serum will have 100 million doses in a month, and will possibly double it by April.The government has indicated that it may need 300 million doses before July 2021, with frontline health workers and the elderly given priority.Poonawalla said Serum was in touch with the government for the vaccine’s procurement.“Initially, we will supply 50 million doses and we will get more confirmations over the course of the next few days,” he added.After the regulator’s nod, Serum expects formalities to be completed in the next 7 to 10 days for the rollout to begin.When asked if the SII has been barred by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) not to export the vaccine till vulnerable populations in India are protected, Poonawalla said: “We will start exporting the vaccine post the government’s approval and talks are going on”.“Our priority list will see us cater to the Indian market first, then the COVAX countries. Optimistically, by March-April we should have permissions in place,” he added.When asked if the company was negotiating bilateral agreements with other countries too for the vaccine, Poonawalla said: “We have bilateral partnerships with nations like Bangladesh, Myanmar, Morocco, etc”.On the efficacy of Covishield, he noted that the company has proven in its trials that it has a 100 per cent efficacy on hospitalisation, implying that there were zero hospitalisations found in the people who took the vaccine globally.“The efficacy results of the vaccine are quite high if it is administered in 2-doses within a gap of 2 – 3months,” Poonawalla said.

05-01-2021||New Delhi||I-T dept questions Robert Vadra in benami assets case probe||The Income Tax department on Monday questioned Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, in connection with its probe against him under the benami assets law, official sources said.Vadra, 52, said the action was aimed to “digress” from the “real issues” concerning the country like the farmers’ agitation.Sources said Vadra was asked to join the investigation at the tax authority’s office in the national capital but as he cited COVID-19 restrictions, a team of officials visited his official premises in Delhi’s Sukhdev Vihar area.He was questioned for about eight hours and his statement was recorded as part of the proceedings related to the Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, they said.Sources added that the questioning was linked to the purchase of some land parcels by a firm linked to Vadra in Rajasthan’s border town of Bikaner in which another central probe agency, the Enforcement Directorate, had filed a money laundering case in 2015.The ED has questioned Vadra in this case in the past and had attached assets worth Rs 4.62 crore of his firm Ms Sky Light Hospitality (P) Ltd (now LLP) in 2019. Sources said the ED shared case documents of this probe along with that of possession of some alleged undisclosed assets abroad with the tax department for action under the anti-benami law that is enforced in the country by the latter.“Everyone knows it is (political vendetta). Whenever Priyanka (his wife Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra) moves out for helping farmers...and other issues then whom will they (probe agencies) come to?” Vadra said to reporters after the tax department team left.“They will come to Robert Vadra. I don’t want to go into political issues but they (government) are digressing from real issues...like the farmers issue,” he said.Vadra said he had “nothing to hide and worry about” and that the truth will prevail.“Whatever questions or notices they have sent, we have answered those. They (probe agencies) are most welcome and I am ready to answer,” he said.When reporters asked him if the latest questioning pertains to proceedings under the anti-benami law, he said “it was general and nothing related to that (benami).”Vadra also told reporters that the latest queries of tax officials revolved around his activities over the last 5-7 years.The I-T department has also been probing Vadra on charges of alleged possession of some undisclosed assets in the UK.The ED too is investigating these charges, under the anti-money laundering law, against the businessman.The ED has accused Vadra of money laundering in the purchase of a London-based property at 12, Bryanston Square worth 1.9 million GBP (British pounds), which is allegedly owned by him and this transaction involves the role of absconding defence consultant Sanjay Bhandari.             Bhandari has never joined the I-T or ED probe in this case and is stated to be based abroad. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/i-t-dept-questions-robert-vadra-in%C2%A0benami-assets-case-probe-193567

Its retail unit which sells food grains and staples, fruits and vegetables and items of daily use through its stores, "does not purchase any food grains directly from farmers," the statement said."It has never entered into long-term procurement contracts to gain an unfair advantage over farmers or sought that its suppliers buy from farmers at less than remunerative prices, nor will it ever do so," it added.

05-01-2021||New Delhi||Delhi Police ask people to take alternative routes in view of farmers' protest||Routes connecting Delhi to Ghaziabad and Noida via Ghazipur and Chilla borders remained partially closed on Monday due to the farmers' protest against the Centre's agricultural reforms, the traffic police said.They advised commuters to take alternative routes for coming to Delhi via Anand Vihar, DND, Bhopra and Loni borders.Farmers from different states have been camping at various border points of Delhi for 40 days now to demand the repeal of the three farm laws enacted in September and a legal backing for the minimum support price (MSP).The farmers had a difficult morning on Sunday as overnight rains left their tents waterlogged, firewood and blankets soaked, and intensified the cold. However, the farmers have said the weather will not dampen their spirit and they will continue the protest till their demands are met.Since the farmers arrived at the national capital's borders in late November, the Delhi Traffic Police has been posting alerts on its official Twitter handle to inform commuters about road closures across the city.In a series of tweets on Monday, the traffic police said Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Saboli and Mangesh borders are closed for traffic movement."Please take alternate route via Lampur Safiabad, Palla & Singhu school toll tax borders. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba & GTK road. Please avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK Road & NH-44," it said."The Chilla and Ghazipur borders are closed for traffic coming from Noida & Ghaziabad to Delhi because of farmer protests. Please take alternate route for coming to Delhi via Anand Vihar, DND,  Bhopra & Loni Borders," it said.The traffic police said Tikri and Dhansa borders are also closed for traffic movement."Jhatikara Border is open only for LMV (Cars/Light Motor Vehicles), two wheelers and pedestrian movement," it said in another tweet.According to the traffic police, people travelling to Haryana can take the routes via Jharoda (only single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders.After five rounds of inconclusive talks, the government and 40 farmer unions reached some common ground during the sixth round of negotiations on December 30 to resolve protesting farmers' concerns over rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning.However, the two sides remained deadlocked over the main contentious issues of the repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP.The seventh round of talks between the government and farmer unions is scheduled to be held later on Monday.

05-01-2021||Vibha Sharma||Govt's meeting with farmer groups inconclusive; next round on Jan 8||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 4The first meeting of 2021 (otherwise the seventh round) between 40 unions and Central ministers ended without any outcome on the key issues — repealing of the three Farm Acts and a law on the MSP.Farmers spoke only about repealing the three Acts. “We told the government there is no other alternative. The Government said they will consult further and get back. The next meeting is on January 8. The pressure is on the government. It (farmers’ agitation) is now a peoples’ movement,” said Jagmohan Singh Patiala, general secretary of BKU (Dhakaunda), after the meeting. With the government also firm on its stance regarding the three laws, unions will now meet tomorrow to decide the next steps. “They (Union ministers Narendra Singh Tomar, Piyush Goyal and Som Prakash) kept saying the same thing over and over again — how good the laws are, how they will benefit farmers, etc. One thing is certain, we are not going home till the time the laws are repealed,” BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said. The meeting started with paying ‘shradhanjali’ to farmers who lost lives during the agitation.Tomar said the government is sensitive about farmers’ issues and offered clause-wise discussion on the three Acts. “The meeting was held in good atmosphere but farmers remained adamant on their demands and we could not arrive at any conclusion,” he said, though adding that the “issue will be resolved soon”. Also read: SC treats Panjab University students' letter on 'excesses against farmers' as PILBKU trains women in driving tractors to lead January 26 farmers' processionDharmendra hopes farmers get justice today“The date of the next meeting was decided with consensus,” Tomar said in response to accusations about farmers’ “lack of trust” in the government and its own “lack of interest” in resolving the issue. “It is an important issue involving the entire country, the government has to decide keeping in mind farmers across. The laws have been made keeping in mind their best interests,” he said.Also read: Ahead of meet, Sonia seeks repeal of lawsReliance says it has nothing to do with farm lawsDelhi Police ask people to take alternative routes in view of farmers' protestEven while the government is keeping alive the communication channels with farmers, after today’s meeting it is more or less clear that it has ceded all it intends to make them end the agitation. So far, the government has relented on the proposed Power Act and the Ordinance on stubble pollution, say sources, adding that “this is about all it is willing to backtrack”. With farmers threatening to escalate agitation, making it more intense and battle lines drawn so tightly, it seems both sides are depending upon the Supreme Court to provide them some elbow room to come out of the situation. “Given the kind of support the agitation has received from common people, the matter has moved out of the hands of union leaders for a resolution on a middle path now,” say observers.The government has also shown “visible toning down on agitators and the agitation” and also offered a “joint committee on MSP”, which unions rejected, sticking to their demand for a legal framework to ensure minimum support price.Today the talks were held up for quite some time during which Tomar and Goyal held a separate meeting while Som Prakash tried to “reason out” with group of union’ leaders. It is not just the three laws, farmers have also junked Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s claim of implementing recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission and are demanding a guaranteed MSP on 23 crops so that they can “diversify” from paddy and wheat.  As they draw elaborate plans for the month on Lohri, January 23—Netaji Subhas Chander Bose’s birth anniversary—and January 26, it is clear farmers are in no hurry to move from the Delhi borders despite prevailing adverse weather conditions.Also read: Withdraw dung dump FIR or will block roads: BKU (Rajewal) Farmers, cops clash near BJP event||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govts-meeting-with-farmer-groups-inconclusive-next-round-on-jan-8-193493
