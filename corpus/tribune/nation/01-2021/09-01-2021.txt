The protesters were violating the court’s verdict, he submitted.Sharma pointed out that the agitating farmers have blocked Noida Chilla Border, Tikri Border, Singhu Border, Gazipur Border, Delhi-Rohtak National Highway, causing hardships to those entering Delhi from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.He contended that “the continuous blockage of public roads by the farmers union at various places is only causing undue hardship to the common citizens of this country which is again violating their constitutional rights of free movements…causing unnecessary hardships to the common citizen due to huge traffic jams…”The affidavit stated that “if such kind of blockage in public roads is allowed to be continued it will only deny few of the citizens from earning their livelihood since their free movement is either curtailed or obstructed due to the blockage of public roads.”Sharma alleged that the farmers’ union destroyed mobile towers in Punjab and threatened to take out a tractor rally on the Republic Day.Noting that there was no improvement in talks between agitating farmers and the government, the top court had on Wednesday said it would take up petitions against farm laws and those against farmers’ protests on January 11.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde – which is scheduled to take up petitions against farm laws and those seeking removal of farmers from Delhi roads on Monday—had on January 7 expressed concern over the possible spread of COVID-19 among the agitators and asked the Centre if they were taking precautionary measures against the pandemic.“We are trying to ensure that COVID-19 doesn’t spread. Ensure guidelines issued are followed,” the CJI had said.The CJI -- who had on December 17 indicated constituting a committee of independent and impartial persons, including agriculture experts, to end the stalemate between protesting farmers and the Centre - had said, “We understand the situation. We want to encourage the talks. We will keep the matter on Monday and will adjourn if you say so.”There are several petitions on the issue, including that of Sharma who contended that “since the virus is spreading rapidly and the cases of COVID19 are increasing day-by-day in Delhi, it is paramount that this protest be stopped on immediate basis.”He demanded that Delhi borders should be opened and protesters should be shifted to a designated place where they should follow norms, including physical distancing, to check the spread of COVID19 pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protest-ahead-of-sc-hearing-petitioner-highlights-delhi-commuters-plight-196136
09-01-2021||New Delhi||Farmers’ body moves SC seeking impleadment, says reforms are beneficial||A farmers’ body on Saturday moved the Supreme Court seeking impleadment in the pending matters pertaining to new farm laws, against which several farmer unions are staging protests at Delhi borders, saying these reforms are “beneficial” to enable increased income and growth of agriculture.In a letter petition sent to the apex court, Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA) has urged the top court to also give opportunity to other farmer associations representing various crops to present their views in the matter.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde is scheduled to hear on January 11 a batch of pleas challenging the new farm laws as also the ones raising issues related to the ongoing farmers’ protest at Delhi borders.CIFA, in its plea filed by its chief adviser P Chengal Reddy, has said the Centre should be directed to also hold consultation with other farmer associations of the country before changing any provisions of these laws.“We wish (to) submit that farm reforms are beneficial to enable increased income to farmers and growth of agriculture,” the plea said while referring to the benefits of these farm reforms.The Centre on January 6 had informed the top court that “healthy discussions” were going on between the government and farmers over these issues.The apex court had earlier issued notice and sought the Centre’s response on a batch of pleas against the three contentious farm laws—Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.While hearing the pleas on the issue of farmers’ protest, the top court on December 17 last year had said the agitation should be allowed to continue “without impediment” and this court would not “interfere” with it as the right to protest is a fundamental right.While acknowledging the right to non-violent protest of farmers, the apex court was also of the view that their right to protest should not infringe the fundamental rights of others to move freely and in getting essential food and other supplies as right to protest cannot mean blockade of the entire city.

09-01-2021||New Delhi||Trump’s Twitter account suspension dangerous precedent: BJP leaders||BJP leaders expressed concern on Saturday over the permanent suspension of US President Donald Trump’s Twitter account by the social media giant, saying it sets a dangerous precedent and is a wake-up call for democracies about the threat from unregulated big tech companies.Days after Trump’s supporters stormed the US Capitol and caused the deaths of four civilians and a police officer, Twitter suspended his account permanently on its platform due to the “risk of further incitement of violence”.“If they can do this to the President of the US (POTUS), they can do this to anyone. Sooner India reviews intermediaries’ regulations, better for our democracy,” BJP’s youth wing president Tejaswi Surya said in a tweet.He said the suspension of Trump’s account is a wake-up call for those who do not yet understand the threat to democracies from unregulated big tech companies.Echoing similar sentiments, BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya said “deplatforming Donald Trump, a sitting US president, sets a dangerous precedent. It has less to do with his views and more to do with intolerance for a differing point.” He said those who claim to champion free speech are celebrating and dubbed big tech firms as “new oligarchs”.Pitching for regulating such firms, Surya said dissent is fundamental to democracy and the government welcomes it, but only constitutional authorities can decide on its reasonability. Lately, big tech companies have themselves assumed this role, he said, adding, “Time for us to regulate big tech companies.”Surya, who is also a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology, said Facebook and Twitter serve as platforms for expression and they should not curtail people’s will.In a statement on Friday, Twitter said after a close review of recent tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account and the context around those—specifically how those are being received and interpreted on and off the social media platform—the account has been permanently suspended due to the risk of further incitement of violence.At the time of the permanent suspension, Trump had 88.7 million followers and followed 51 people.

After joining the agitation, he has been to his hometown only twice -- once to attend to his ailing mother and second to bring some essentials items for his stay at the Singhu border.Recalling the journey from his native village in Jalandhar to the border, Singh said he started for Delhi with a group of ten people on November 25 in two cars. Along with him, he carried his wheelchair and other essentials.Back home, he was the one who look after his mother. But now she is being looked after by his neighbours and relatives.Just 15 days after he reached Singhu, his 85-year-old ailing mother, Amar Kaur, sustained a severe nose injury but despite that she told his son to stay back at Singhu and asked him to fight his battle."Later, I went to my village to check on my mother. She is 85 but despite getting injured, she told me to not return and fight my battle," said Singh, who engages in wheat and rice farming at his hometown.His nephew, Sukjinder, who accompanied Singh, said his uncle's mother has been a great source of support to them."When she got injured, she did call to inform us and said she will be fine and that we need not rush back home immediately. She stressed that just like how it was the doctor's duty to treat her, it was their duty to fight for their rights," he added.However, braving the severe cold and heavy downpour, nothing stopped Singh from returning home.Now he is firm on staying at the border till the government accepts their demands and takes back the three new agri laws."I may face difficulties but with everyone's cooperation, we are surviving all challenges and will continue to protest until our demands our met," he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wheelchair-bound-punjab-farmer-defies-odds-joins-protest-at-singhu-border-196115
09-01-2021||Allahabad||Arrest should be the last option for police: HC||The Allahabad High Court has observed that the arrest of a person against whom an FIR has been lodged “should be the last option” and restricted to cases where such an action is “imperative” or custodial interrogation is required.“Irrational and indiscriminate arrests are a gross violation of human rights,” Justice Siddharth said while granting anticipatory bail to one Sachin Saini of Bulandshahr against whom an FIR was registered for voluntary causing hurt and threat to cause death apart from other sections of the IPC.After the lodging of an FIR, the arrest can be made by the police at will, the court said, adding there is no definite period fixed for the police to arrest an accused against whom an FIR has been lodged.“The courts have repeatedly held that arrest should be the last option for the police and it should be restricted to those exceptional cases where arresting the accused is imperative or his custodial interrogation is required. Irrational and indiscriminate arrests are a gross violation of human rights,” the court held.In its order, the court has also referred to the case of one Joginder Kumar in which the apex court has referred to the third report of the National Police Commission, which mentioned that making arrests in India is “one of the chief sources” of corruption in the police.The report suggested that, by and large, nearly 60 per cent of the arrests were either unnecessary or unjustified and that such unjustified police action accounted for 43.2 per cent of the expenditure of the jails.Personal liberty is a very precious fundamental right and it should be curtailed only when it becomes imperative, it said.“According to the peculiar facts and circumstances of a case, the arrest of an accused should be made,” the court added.Hence, “without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case and considering the nature of accusations and antecedents of the applicant”,  the court directed that the applicant be granted an anticipatory bail on furnishing a personal bond with two sureties each of like amount to the trial court concerned.The court directed that the applicant shall not leave the country during the trial without prior permission from the trial court.“The applicant shall surrender his passport, if any, to the court concerned forthwith.“His passport will remain in the custody of the court concerned and further that the applicant shall file an undertaking to the effect that he shall not seek any adjournment on the dates fixed for evidence and the witnesses are present in court,” the high court said.

09-01-2021||Chennai||AIADMK endorses Palaniswami as CM candidate for Assembly polls||The ruling AIADMK in Tamil Nadu on Saturday endorsed Chief Minister K Palaniswami as its CM candidate for this year’s high-stakes Assembly polls, where the party will take on arch rival DMK in a tough electoral battle.AIADMK’s top decision-making body General Council also authorised O Panneerselvam and Palaniswami—the top leaders—to devise the party’s strategy for the polls and endorsed the appointment of a steering committee, which is likely to play a key role in important matters.Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu are likely to be held in April-May.The party’s general council, besides the Executive, met at a marriage hall here under the leadership of AIADMK Coordinator Panneerselvam and joint coordinator Palaniswami.Palaniswami is the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu while Panneerselvam is his deputy.In one of the 16 resolutions adopted at the meeting, the party members authorised the two leaders to devise AIADMK’s electoral strategy, even as it eyes a hat trick of victories, after securing back to back wins in 2011 and 2016 under the late J Jayalalithaa.“This general council authorises O Panneerselvam and Edapadi K Palaniswami to devise winning strategies to ensure a grand win in the 2021 polls, create an AIADMK-led victory alliance and decide seat-sharing with alliance parties,” the members resolved.The party has earned the public’s praise for “good governance,” it added.The AIADMK had earlier led the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), its constituents being the BJP, DMDK and PMK among others, in the state for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and its two top leaders have already confirmed the party’s alliance with the BJP.The general council also endorsed Panneerselvam’s October 2020 announcement that Palaniswami will be the AIADMK’s chief ministerial candidate for the polls.The members said they “unanimously accept the announcement and will work hard to ensure victory” and bring Palaniswami back to the post after the elections.Further, it approved the appointment of a steering committee, which was announced in October last year.The six Ministers and five other office-bearers in the committee are seen as loyalists of Palaniswami and Panneerselvam, respectively.The setting up of such a committee was Panneerselvam’s long pending demand then.Targeting DMK president M K Stalin, the party alleged that he was unable to bear the growing public support for its government, as well as Palaniswami’s administrative acumen and was therefore indulging in “uncultured” criticism of the CM.It condemned Stalin and his DMK supporters for “personal attacks.”In an apparent reference to its arch rival, the party, in another resolution, said it would strive hard to “put an end to the dynasty politics of one family” and ensure that a “true democratic government” under AIADMK was installed post-polls.It also lauded the government on different matters such as the 7.5 per cent quota in medical education for government school students who clear the National Entrance cum Eligibility Test (NEET) and attracting investments to the state.Further, it opposed the Sri Lankan government’s move to scrap the provincial councils, saying it would impact the Tamils there and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene in the matter.In his address, Panneerselvam said the party was above individuals and urged for a united fight to secure a “grand, unprecedented victory” in the coming elections.He urged party workers to go to the people with DMK’s “scams and betrayals” such as ceding of Katchatheevu islet in the 1970s and not taking steps for notifying the final award of the Cauvery disputes tribunal in a gazette.He said there was no factionalism in the party and that no leader, including himself or Palaniswami, have said “be loyal to me”, but only insisted for unity among the ranks.“Ours is the only democratic organisation where workers can become even chief minister and deputy CM, which is not the case with others....setting aside differences, work with the sole aim of party’s victory (in the polls),” he said.Palaniswami, targeting DMK over “dynasty politics”, said that while earlier it was the late M Karunanidhi at the helm of affairs, “it was then (MK) Stalin and now Udhayanidhi (Stalin’s son).”“In this election, end this dynasty politics,” he said.For AIADMK stalwarts, the late chief ministers M G Ramachandran (party founder) and Jayalalithaa people were their heirs, he said.He reiterated that the CM’s post is a “responsibility” and said “I see everyone here as a CM.”Palaniswami thanked “elder brother” Panneerselvam for earlier announcing him as the party’s CM face in the coming polls and the general council and the executive for endorsing the same today.

We all have to get it someday."I have always been sure that I would get vaccinated once there would be clarity on it. I trust the system and I trust science," Shirodkar said.But despite getting the vaccine, the actor said she will still not let her guard down against COVID-19, which has claimed the lives of over 19 lakh people globally since it emerged in China in late 2019.She urged others to continue to follow the rules and regulations from the authorities."I believe the masks are not going anywhere for a while. We have to be extremely mindful and protect ourselves from the virus," she added.Shirodkar said the vaccine rollout process in UAE is simple and well-organised as a person can just walk in and get the vaccination at the centre.She revealed that her husband and daughter will receive their first dose of the vaccine next week."I'm just another simple human, like any other who faced troubles during the pandemic. Everyone must be a responsible citizen of the world. When the vaccine is made available they should go take it. Let's all fight this virus together," she said.Shirodkar also thanked the frontline health workers for keeping everyone safe and alive during the pandemic, and hopes that the year 2021 will bring everyone closer.In India, the drug regulator has approved Oxford vaccine Covishield, being manufactured by the Serum Institute, and indigenously developed Covaxin of Bharat Biotech for restricted emergency use in the country.The country is preparing for the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and the second nationwide mock drill was conducted on Friday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-still-need-to-be-extremely-mindful-of-virus-shilpa-shirodkar-after-receiving-covid-19-vaccine-196083

Geeta had got to see the infant at 4 pm yesterday and today we get the news of the fire. It has destroyed us," he said."We had not even named our daughter, and now we have got her burnt dead body," Vishwanath, who is a labourer, said amid the wails and sobs from those present, including his homemaker wife.The girl was cremated after the couple left the hospital, he said, adding that no one had communicated anything so far about compensation for their devastating loss.Geeta, meanwhile, was too traumatised to speak, with kin and neighbours assembled around her to offer comfort. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hospital-fire-2-month-old-girl-victim-was-set-for-discharge-196079

We will be travelling from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and collect soil from across the country, especially from villages and hometown of the 60 farmers who have lost their lives during the ongoing agitation," said Krishna Allavaru, national in-charge of IYC."With that soil, we will create a map of India, the one built on the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi and sacrifices made by martyrs who laid their lives during the freedom struggle of India," said Allavaru.According to the IYC, the campaign is inspired from the historic 'Dandi March' where Mahatma Gandhi picked up a fistful of salt from the shore of the Arabian Sea on March 12, 1930 and challenged the British Raj.The IYC, during the press conference, also launched a song and poster for the campaign.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are staying put at various border points of Delhi since late November last year to protest against recent farm laws of the Centre. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protest-iyc-to-collect-soil-from-villages-of-those-who-died-create-map-of-india-196069
09-01-2021||New Delhi||Counselling sessions for farmers at Singhu Border to prevent burnout, suicide bids||Despite their rock-hard determination to sustain the over 40-day-old agitation against the new farm laws, many protesting farmers at Delhi borders are falling prey to anxiety and depression, with a few having allegedly claimed their lives fighting this prolonged battle in biting cold.Braving the elements and the odds stacked up against them, an overwhelming number of farmers have been protesting at Singhu Border and two other sites since November 26 but their “sedentary lifestyle” at present and “psychological sedimentation” is taking a toll on their physical and mental well-being.According to NGOs running medical camps at the Singhu Border, the nerve centre of the massive agitation, these farmers are brave in their spirit but some have become vulnerable, facing extreme weather and may be a “sense of waning hope” that have translated into suicides at times.However, to ease their psychological burden, US-based NGO United Sikhs has started carrying out counselling sessions for farmers at their camp set up on the Haryana side of the protest site at Singhu Border.“So many farmers have died during this agitation, some of them claimed their own lives. While they may have a strong determination but the extreme cold and pent-up emotions, coupled with sedentary lifestyle at present as they are not going to fields, is making them psychologically vulnerable,” said Sanya Kataria, a clinical psychologist and a volunteer at the camp.A student of Doctorate in Psychology at a private university in Noida, she has been offering services via the United Sikhs camp in the last few days.“These farmers have been sitting for over 40 days on a national highway as part of this agitation. While most can withstand the physical rigour and biting cold as they are used to working hard, some of them have fallen prey to anxiety, depression and also hopelessness coupled with lack of self-esteem and feeling of frustration. It is a dangerous combination,” she told PTI.So problems such as attention deficiency, restlessness, headaches were common symptoms being seen in those who have chosen to visit the camp for counselling, Kataria said.In some cases, there is an emotional burnout from extreme stress and that is what “we attempt to detect early” through sessions, so that they won’t attempt or even contemplate taking any extreme step, she said.Asked what kind of activities are done during a counselling session, the medical volunteer said the idea basically was to make them stop thinking about one “negative thought continuously”.“So we engage them in activities to distract their minds, and create greater mindful awareness, or what we call ‘grounding’. We ask them to name five things they can see around, four things they can touch, three things they can hear, two things they can smell and one thing they can taste,” Kataria said.Besides, the techniques of diaphragmatic breathing or drawing breath from the nose and exhaling from nose itself, also proved useful, she said.Gurdeep Kaur, assistant coordinator at the United Sikhs India office in Delhi, says the news of many farmers committing suicide at Singhu Border have “caused great distress to us”.“We don’t want any farmer to die. We want to prevent any further suicide bids. So our counselling calms their minds. We also ask farmers to come for follow-up sessions,” she said.Besides, there was a facility for physiotherapy at the camp, and general physicians and other doctors come too, “some as volunteers, other on a payment basis, by rotation”, Kaur added.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesman Rakesh Tikait had recently claimed that 47 farmers have sacrificed their lives during the protests.A 75-year-old farmer protesting against the Centre’s new farm laws had allegedly hanged himself at the Uttar Pradesh-Delhi border in Ghazipur, earlier this month.Medical Services Centre (MSC), a volunteer organisation based in Kolkata, has also been running a camp since the start of the protest late November.Dr Nikhita Murali, a physician, who has been offering services for the past few days at the Singhu Border, said: “Many women who have joined the protest are having health issues too.”“Sitting continuously or cooking for a long time in the kitchen is causing joint aches but many farmers are coming to us with problems of improper blood sugar level or blood pressure. Headache and body ache are also common ailments among them,” she said.Asked what kind of problems women protesters are facing, Murali, a native of Kochi, said some were exhibiting gynaecological infections such as in the reproductive tract.“These women belong to conservative families, so they don’t talk about their medical problems and feel uncomfortable talking to a male doctor about any gynaecological issues. After talking to me during consultation, they revealed that they have such problems,” the doctor said.But none of them wanted to go back from the protest site, they wished to soldier on. Their will power was very strong, she added.On Saturday, it was yet another day of protest for the farmers in the ritual January winter, even as the eighth round of talks between the farmer leaders and the Centre remained inconclusive on Friday.Cries of ‘Saada Haq, Aithe Rakh’, ‘Jo Bole So Nihal’ and ‘Kisan Union Ekta Zindabad’ rent the air throughout the day.Besides, many good Samaritans have also put up roadside stalls to offer free medicines and dental care services for the farmers, who are in no mood to relent or retreat.

It is natural that we seek to involve our diaspora in that process, as they have a well-earned reputation as high achievers," he said."Their emotional attachment to India surely encourages their desire to contribute to the nation's rejuvenation," he added.The minister also mentioned various efforts by India to reach out to those who needed help in the wake of the pandemic.Also read: World waiting for India's vaccines, watching how it runs world's biggest vaccination drive: Modi"This gathering takes place, as all events currently do, against the backdrop of the devastating Covid pandemic.

Agriculture Minister NS Tomar said after the meeting that no consensus could be reached today as farm unions did not offer any alternatives barring repeal of farm laws. The government categorically ruled out rescinding the legislations with Tomar noting that “many other farm groups nationally are in support of the laws”. The minister said the Centre was committed to the directions of Supreme Court, whatever these might be. He, however, said no proposal was made to farmers to implead in the ongoing SC case.Farmer leaders on their part maintained that Tomar had suggested in the meeting that the union leaders could petition the apex court, if they found the farm laws unconstitutional.“We will not be party to the case as that will delay the matter,” said farmer leader BS Rajewal, who opened the dialogue on the behalf of the farmers today saying the Centre did not have the right to legislate on agriculture, since it is a state subject.BKU’s Rakesh Tikait said farmers were ready to protest till 2024 and hold as many rounds of talks as the Centre had to offer. “If we can go to jail 350 times, why can’t we talk to the Centre 350 times?” he said.Canadian MP’s presence under lensThe MEA on Friday said it had noted reports about the presence of Indo-Canadian MP Ramandeep Brar at the farmers’ protests at Kundli on January 2.

It has become routine for Pakistan to come up with such farcical actions prior to important meetings,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava at a media briefing here on Friday.The 61-year-old UN proscribed terrorist, on bail since 2015 in the Mumbai case, was arrested by the Counter-Terrorism Department of Punjab province on Saturday.“The Anti-Terrorism Court, Lahore, convicted Lakhvi for commission of offences of terrorism financing in a case registered by the CTD for 15 years under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997,” a court official said after the hearing. — PTI/TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/26-11-mastermind-gets-15-yr-jail-in-terror-case-india-calls-it-farce-195707

The former Chief Minister and 16 others were killed in an explosion outside the Civil Secretariat in Chandigarh in 1995.In jail for last 25 years, Rajoana was sentenced to death in 2007. His mercy petition under Article 72 of the Constitution has been hanging fire for eight years.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said the decision had to be taken before Republic Day. “We will give two-three weeks. You should complete the process before January 26. January 26 is a good day,” the CJI said.Maintaining that pendency of appeals by co-accused has no bearing on Presidential pardon granted to a death-row convict, the Supreme Court had on December 4 questioned the Centre over delay in sending proposal to the President for commuting Rajoana’s death penalty. “The appeal of other co-accused has no relevance to the decision to commute the death sentence of some convicts, taken to commemorate the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev,” it had noted. Citing Devender Pal Singh Bhullar’s case, the petitioner has claimed the “delay caused by circumstances beyond prisoners’ control mandates commutation of death sentence”. The inordinate delay caused agony and adversely affected his physical and mental health, Rajaona contended.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-decide-rajoana-mercy-plea-by-january-26-195708

It should have a separate wildlife wing. These are all proceeds of crime,” a Bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, said while hearing certain applications filed in a 25-year-old PIL on environment and forests related issues.Referring to attacks on forest rangers in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, senior advocate Shyam Divan said, “Brutal attacks are made on forest rangers. Even counter cases are lodged against them… India accounts for 38 per cent of attacks on forest officials.”The BenchThere should be a separate wildlife wingThe forest officials are up against a bigger force and millions of dollars are being siphoned by smugglers…ED (Enforcement Directorate) should be roped in. It should have a separate wildlife wing. These are all proceeds of crime. “It is difficult to comprehend how forest officials are to be protected in vast tracts of land where poachers take advantage to carry out the nefarious activities. It is difficult to manage how any law can be enforced by the forest officials who are unarmed in comparison to poachers who are heavily armed,” the Bench said, adding such crimes needed to be checked. Agreeing with Divan, the CJI said, “When we go to Assam, (we see) they are given arms while in Maharashtra they are given only ‘’lathi.”“In Karnataka, forest officials are seen roaming in “chappals” and are being slapped by poachers. We want the Solicitor General to make a statement on the next date of hearing that arms will be given to personnel...,” it said, posting the matter for hearing after four weeks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-concerned-over-attacks-on-forest-rangers-may-arm-them-195739

Fall in October was 55.6 per cent. A further improvement is expected in the near term as more schools and businesses reopen.” The IATA, which represents around 290 airlines comprising 82 per cent of global air traffic, measures passenger growth in RPKs terms, which is calculated by multiplying the number of passengers to the distance travelled by them.Kharola on his part, while addressing a webinar organised by the FICCI, said in the next two to three months, the domestic civil aviation sector is expected to return to normal.“The sector remained resilient during the pandemic, but I don’t think that the bad period is over. It will take the next two to three months for the country’s domestic civil aviation sector to return to normal.

The disinfection process is underway," according to an official statement.States that are still unaffected by Avian Influenza (AI) have been requested to keep a vigil on any unusual mortality among birds and to report immediately so that necessary measures are taken in the fastest possible time, it added.Central teams have been deployed to visit the affected states of Kerala, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh for monitoring and for epidemiological investigation.The government said that in Haryana, there has been confirmation of Avian Influenza positive samples from ICAR-NIHSAD in poultry (two poultry farms) of the Panchkula district.

09-01-2021||New Delhi||Centre-farmers talks remain inconclusive; govt says it cannot and will not repeal farm laws||The eighth round of talks between protesting farmers and the Centre ended inconclusively yet again with Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar making it clear that the government will not repeal the Acts and ‘jathebandis’ stating that they are willing to settle for nothing less.The next round has been proposed on January 15 with the government hoping for some resolution at the January 11 Supreme Court hearing on a batch of pleas challenging the constitutional validity of the three agricultural laws.This also means the farmers will be celebrating the festival of Lohri at borders of Delhi. Hardening their stance, unions have also made it clear that “whatever the courts might order they are not going to budge until they secure repeal of the laws and discussion on MSP moves further”.They have already given a deadline of January 26, the day when they “march into Delhi”. “It is best to leave this to the Supreme Court to decide,” Kavitha Kuruganti of the Mahila Kisan Adikar Manch said quoting Tomar at the meeting, terming today’s proceedings as a “complete breakdown of talks”. “It is a very sad day for Indian democracy that in middle of talks an elected government, which has constantly been cheating the farmers, now says let us get this resolved through the Supreme Court. The court has already looked at the eviction-related issue and said that it is the democratic right of farmers to protest and passed orders on that,” she said. Leaders said only “one point was taken up” at the meeting today. While Tomar kept saying they should discuss the three Acts, unions kept insisting the Bills be taken back.There was no discussion on MSP as leaders made their intentions clear with slogans like ‘ya jitenge ya marenga’ (either we will die or win) and ‘Bill wapsi ghar wapsi’.They also slammed Punjab BJP leaders for giving ‘gaalis’ (abusing) to farmers and maligning the agitation. “We are not a political party. Only if you return the Bills will we go back,” they said. नीयत साफ़ नहीं है जिनकी,तारीख़ पे तारीख़ देना स्ट्रैटेजी है उनकी!  After Tomar insisted that several unions were agreeable to the laws, BKU leader Balbir Singh Rajewal told him “agriculture was a state subject, still the Centre made laws on it”. “It is an established fact that you cannot interfere on the subject of agriculture. But you get your secretary and your joint secretary to work on it, and they keep coming up with excuses (to interfere). I have a list of cases in which the Supreme Court’s full Bench has ruled that the Central government cannot interfere on the subject,” Rajewal said.  Also read: Ahead of talks, govt says hopeful of resolving farmers' issuesApart from Tomar, Union ministers Piyush Goyal and Som Parkash, who is from Punjab, were also present at the talks with the unions. Meanwhile, Tomar played down his meeting with religious leader Baba Lakha Singh, a head of the Nanaksar Sikh sect, saying that the government did not approach him for mediation with farmers.Also read: Will not withdraw from fight against farm laws, Priyanka Vadra tells Punjab Congress MPs “We have not approached anyone for mediation. There are those who oppose the laws and those who support them, the government gives time to everyone to hear their views. “Being a religious leader and someone with farmers’ best interests in his heart and pained at their plight in this cold, Baba Lakha Singh wanted to discuss the issue. He spoke of farmers’ perspective while I told him about the government’s point of view. I hope he talked to unions about our discussion. We did not approach him for mediation,” Tomar said. Ahead of the eighth round of talks with the Union Ministers, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait has already said the government can try as much as it wants, farmers will not go back home till the three Acts were repealed.Also read: Ahead of talks, BJP leaders meet Shah“The government still has time till tomorrow.
