It received funds under the government’s livelihood mission and the group members also borrowed money from relatives, she said.Last year, the group earned a profit of Rs 3 lakh and a portion of it was spent on repaying the loan, Rahangdale said.She said one of the members of the SHG belongs to the tribal community.The rice mill can handle up to 40 quintals of paddy per day and operates all the year round, Rahangdale said.Talking about their future plans, she said the group is planning to manufacture spices.Balaghat District Collector Deepak Arya said these women group members have done an extraordinary work.“They are an inspiration to other women who want to become self-reliant,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-women-self-help-group-wins-pms-praise-in-mann-ki-baat-206025

See photos before making any comments from now onwards.This boy has made a fun of himself,” Manjhi said in his tweet.JD(U) spokesman and MLC Neeraj Kumar questioned Tejashwis knowledge asking, “whether it reflects his hate for knowledge or societal hate as he has posted picture of late Anugrah Babu on the death anniversary of Dr Sri Krishna Singh.”“How political tourists will know the great leaders of Bihar. You are corrupt and only know the criminals lodged in jail,” JD(U) leader wryly said.BJP too derided Tejashwi, the leader of opposition in Bihar assembly, for his goof-up.“The leader of opposition should exhibit his political- social hatred after first getting himself acquainted with the pictures of Bihar Kesri late Sri Krishna Singh and Bihar Vibhuti late Anugrah Narayan Singh,” state BJP spokesman Arvind Kumar Singh said.Downplaying the issue, RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwary told PTI that “Tejashwi Yadav jee does not himself put up tweets. It’s a technical error. Our opponents should not make it an issue. They should try to understand the spirit behind the tweet instead.” --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tejashwi-goofs-up-by-putting-wrong-picture-while-paying-tribute-to-shri-babu-206024

The country, however, continues to remain vigilant to prevent re-entry of poliovirus into the country from neighbouring countries of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where wild poliovirus continues to cause diseases, the ministry said in its statement.India conducts one nationwide National Immunisation Day (NID) and two Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs) for polio every year to maintain population immunity against wild poliovirus and to sustain its polio-free status. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/89-lakh-kids-below-5-yrs-given-polio-drops-across-india-on-polio-ravivar-health-ministry-206016

The passengers were admitted to the Stanley Government Hospital in the city to recover the capsules under expert medical supervision.“The process of recovery was cumbersome as the passengers were fed with a heavy diet to facilitate ejection of the capsules of gold in a natural way,” Commissioner of Customs Rajan Choudhry said in a press release.To complete the entire process, it took eight days, he said, adding that the earlier modus operandi of smuggling of gold was by concealing the metal in paste form in the rectum.Gold concealed in hand-bags and pant pockets of the passengers was also recovered, he said.One of the eight passengers was not arrested as the value of gold seized was lesser than Rs 20 lakh which is the maximum amount that attracts detention of the smuggler, the officer told PTI.In total, 4.15 kgs of gold worth Rs 2.17 crore were seized and the seven were arrested.Further investigation was on. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/capsules-of-gold-swallowed-by-8-plane-passengers-recovered-206013

One of the arms of the statue was damaged and to this day it stands with a broken arm.The viceroy’s statue was dumped at the Patna Museum in the late 1960s. It was installed again in the 1990s on a platform in a corner of the museum’s lawns.Subsequent to the removal of the statue, the name of the park was rechristened to ‘Shaheed Veer Kunwar Singh Azadi Park’ but it is still referred to as ‘Hardinge Park’ by old-timers and local people.                   Rare archival documents and old newspaper reports tell that besides the viceroy’s statue, a life-size statue of Lady Hardinge, known for her benevolent public work, was also to be erected in the garden that has witnessed vicissitudes of fortune in its journey of over 100 years. But, eventually only the statue of the viceroy was built.However, a rare black and white photograph of the park, showing the statue, in its early years, and old news reports and archives clearly tell that a bronze medallion of the vicerine was later mounted in the front portion of the imposing pedestal of the statue.Lady Winifred Hardinge, known for her contribution in starting the first medical college for women in Delhi, died in 1914 while it was being built and was later named in her honour.Aditya Jalan, member of the legendary Quila House family of Patna City, said, her death mid-way may have caused a change in the original plan of the park.“An endowment had been made for the maintenance of the park. As per archival documents in our collection, a significant portion of it was taken out and sent to Delhi for the establishment of the medical college,” he said.In the monochrome photograph, a medallion of Lady Hardinge with an ornamental wreath around it, can be seen mounted on the front face of the pedestal, and an inscription below, which is not legible.While it is not known in which year was the medallion installed, a 1921 edition of the ‘The Pioneer Mail’ reported that a meeting of the members of the Hardinge Memorial Executive Committee was held in April that year at the Patna Commissioner’s House, and the “question of meeting the cost of the new medallion of Lady Hardinge for the Hardinge Park was considered”.“The medallion will cost 250 pounds plus Rs 450 import duty,” it said.Lady Hardinge had endeared herself to the people of India through her public works, and the main inscription on the pedestal extolled her virtues too.“Lord Hardinge of Penshurst. Viceroy of India November 23rd, 1910. Founder of the province of Behar and Orissa April 1st 1912. Friend and upholder of the Indian people at home and abroad. Also, Lady Hardinge, sharer in his work and suffering in his faith and love. Erected as a tribute of grateful affection by the people of the province,” reads the main inscription of the statue, which was the centerpiece of the entire layout.A week after the opening of the Hardinge Park in Patna, the Lady Hardinge Medical College in Delhi was inaugurated on February 7, 1916 by Viceroy Lord Hardinge.A magnificent statue of Lady Hardinge in a sitting posture underneath a canopy is located in the premises of the first medical college for women in Delhi.According to Bihar District Gazetteers of Patna, published in 1970, a few years after the statue of the viceroy was moved to the Patna Museum, “The five-tonne bronze statue, 18 feet high including the pedestal, cost 4,000 pounds in 1915 and was installed in the park subsequently at a ceremony. The column had also a bust-size relief bronze figure of Lady Hardinge and two plates, one symbolising ‘Justice’ and the other ‘Human Sympathy’”.In its centenary year, the park, located midway between Patna railway station and the Patna Secretariat, was redeveloped and its century-old fountains were dismantled to make way for new ones. And, in late 2017, one of the last remnants of the Raj-era landmark—the pedestal on which the Hardinge’s iconic statue once stood, was also demolished.The pedestal until it stood forelorn in the park, had a circular indentation in the front face where the medallion was installed. The wreath around it, however, was there till the pedestal was dismantled, further “denuding” the place of its history, heritage lovers alleged.In early 2018, a new fountain was built at the site of the pedestal, and the statue Veer Kunwar Singh was installed in the park.Lying forelorn in a corner of the British-era museum, the Viceroy’s statue, made by noted British sculptor Herbert Hampton, has three of its original bronze plates intact.However, it is not yet known as to whereabouts of the bronze medallion of Lady Hardinge, which earlier adorned the pedestal. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/patnas-hardinge-park-turns-105-statue-pedestal-had-lady-hardinges-medallion-too-206008
31-01-2021||Jaipur||Centre should immediately repeal stubbornly, forcibly passed farm laws: Sachin Pilot||Congress leader and former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Sunday reiterated his demand that the Central government should immediately withdraw the “stubbornly and forcibly passed” farm laws.He pointed out that the honour of the farmer is paramount.Pilot also demanded a thorough investigation into the violence during the farmers’ tractor parade in New Delhi on January 26 to find out the real culprits.The Congress leader said questions have arisen about the pressure under which the Centre brought in the laws and under what compulsion it is not withdrawing the controversial legislations.“The Central government enacted these laws with stubbornness. The farmers, for whom these laws were enacted, are agitating against it but the government is not withdrawing it. The government should do so immediately,” he told PTI.He said that despite such a big agitation, the Central government has not withdrawn the laws that raises a question mark over its intention.“My party and I are all with the farmers. If the farmers themselves are against these laws, then there is no point in keeping them,” he added.Pilot said the farmers have been sitting on the streets for almost two months.“Their (farmers) honour is paramount and if they believe that these laws are not in their interest, then the government should withdraw them by abandoning its stubbornness,” he said.Pilot said that words like “separatists” and “Naxals” were used against them which are condemnable.He said the farmers’ movement will have a long-term impact on the country’s political and social landscape. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-should-immediately-repeal-stubbornly-forcibly-passed-farm-laws-sachin-pilot-206004
31-01-2021||New Delhi||Journalist arrest: Media bodies condemn police action||Media bodies on Sunday condemned the police action against two journalists who were picked up during the farmers’ protests at Delhi’s Singhu border for allegedly misbehaving with police personnel.      They said such crackdowns impinge on the media’s right to report freely and interferes with its right to freedom of expression.                        Freelance journalist Mandeep Punia and Dharmender Singh (with Online News India) were detained by Delhi Police last evening for allegedly misbehaving with personnel on duty.While Singh was later released, police arrested Punia on Sunday.  The Indian Women’s Press Corps, Press Club of India and the Press Association demanded Punia’s immediate release and said no journalist should be disturbed while carrying out their duties at any place.  “Such crackdowns impinge on the media’s right to report freely and interferes with our right to freedom of expression, and freedom of the press as guaranteed by the Constitution of India,” the bodies said in a joint statement.They said Punia has been reporting on the present farmers’ agitation right from the beginning and his arrest “is part of the government crackdown on journalists to prevent them from doing their job independently and freely”. “Punia is a young freelance journalist who contributes to The Caravan and Junputh. The Delhi Police used brutal force while picking him up (on Saturday) and did not share his whereabouts to other media colleague entire night,” the media bodies said.They said the copy of the FIR against Punia was issued only this morning.        Four IPC sections---186 (voluntarily obstructing public servant in discharge of his duties), 353 (assaulting or using criminal force on a public servant in execution of his duty), 332 (voluntarily causing hurt to a public servant in the discharge of his duty) and 34 (acts done in furtherance to common intention) have been pressed against him, they said.Police had earlier said they placed barricades at the border following the violence on Friday to ensure that no one could get through.However, some people including the journalist were trying to remove the barricades, the police had alleged, adding the scribe also misbehaved with the police personnel there.On Friday, clashes broke out at Singhu border between farmers and a large group of men claiming to be local residents who hurled stones at each other. The Singhu border is one of the main protest sites gainst the new farm laws.Delhi Police SHO (Alipur) was injured in the violence.At least 44 people, including the man who attacked the SHO, have been arrested in connection with the incident. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/journalist-arrest-media-bodies-condemn-police-action-206003
31-01-2021||Naveen S Garewal ||Telangana elated after pat for innovation from PM||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, January 31 The Bowenpally vegetable market is elated after Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave it a pat for innovation in his “Mann Ki Baat” talk on Sunday.The market has employed techniques to convert vegetable waste into 500 units of electricity and 30 kg of biofuel daily. Bowenpally Agriculture Market secretary Lokineni Srinivas said, “We are elated and very happy that the effort has been recognised nationally. It is a great encouragement for us and all those who have contributed to making their surroundings better. We are so happy that our market found mention in the speech by honourable Prime Minister.”The plant was started about six months ago and is fully operational now. All the stale and left-over vegetables from the market are processed to produce electricity and biofuel that the PM called “turning garbage into gold”. About 10 tonnes of waste generated at the market every day is collected in the plant out of which 500 units of electricity are produced and this then takes care of the electricity needs of the vegetable market. The electricity is illuminating the mandi and the biofuel is used in the mandi’s canteen for cooking. The electricity lights up over 100 streetlights, 170 stalls, an administrative building and the water supply network. Meanwhile, the 30 kilos biofuel is pumped into the canteen kitchen of the market. Explaining the project, Srinivas said for getting bio methanation, vegetable waste is first put on conveyor belts that carry the waste to shredders, which is then converted into a slurry and is put into large containers or pits to start the process of anaerobic digestion. Organic waste is eventually converted into biofuel, which has two major components, methane and carbon dioxide. This generated fuel is put into “100 per cent biogas generators” that converts the fuel into electricity and reaches the market’s electricity bulbs.  The market requires about 800 to 900 units of electricity, with 500 units being produced here the power bill for the market has come down to Rs 1.5 lakh from Rs 3.5 lakh earlier. Bowenpally market in Secundrabad Cantonment is one of the biggest markets in the state and is the first agriculture market in Telangana to launch the innovative project. It was put up at a cost of Rs 2 crore. Now it is not just left-over vegetables from this market, but about 400-500 trucks arrive at the market from various parts of Telangana and neighbouring states for turning garbage into biofuel and power.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-elated-after-pat-for-innovation-from-pm-206000

31-01-2021||Baghpat (UP)||Farmers’ stir: Thousands converge for third ‘mahapanchayat’ in western UP in as many days||The ripples of farmers’ protest against the new agri laws on Delhi’s borders spread further in western Uttar Pradesh with thousands of people converging for a ‘mahapanchayat’ on Sunday in Baghpat, the third such congregation in the region in as many days.The ‘sarv khap mahapanchayat’  took place at the Tehsil ground here with farmers pouring in from nearby districts as well in tractor-trollies, many of which are decked up with music systems, the tricolour and farmer unions’ flags.This is the third ‘mahapanchayat’ of farmers in the region after a massive congregation in Muzaffarnagar on Friday and in Mathura on Saturday, both resolving to support the ongoing BKU-led protest at the Ghazipur border against the three new farm laws.BKU leader Rajendra Chaudhary told the crowd, “The movement has to be continued with full strength.”  The ‘mahapanchayat’ is also deliberating on the January 26 police action against farmers protesting in Baghpat district against the new central farm laws, a local Baraut resident, who is attending the event, told PTI.Chaudhary Surendra Singh of the Desh Khap and Chaudhary Subhash Singh of the Chaubisi Khap are among key regional farmer leaders attending Sunday’s ‘sarv khap mahapanchayat’, where supporters of Ajit Singh-led Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) were also present.A khap is a traditional social council representing a community or a region in parts of north India with a Chaudhary as its titular head.“Beshak Dilli mein police walon ne kisano ko dande maare hon, par hum aaj bhi bolte hain ‘Jai Jawan Jai Kisan’ (No doubt policemen hit farmers with batons in Delhi, but we are nevertheless saying: hail soldiers, hail farmers),” a local leader told the crowd from the stage.“Whatever happens, we will respond with non-violence and not violence. Our leaders at protest sites and our panch (leaders of the panchayat) will make decisions and we all will follow them,” he added.The two-month-long protest against the farm laws appeared to be losing steam after widespread violence during a tractor parade by farmers on the Republic Day, but an emotional appeal by BKU leader Rakesh Tikait gave it a fresh lease of life with thousands of farmers gathering at the Gazipur protest site and the ‘mahapanchayats’ from western UP extending support to the stir.The farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and parts of UP, have been protesting at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.

31-01-2021||Shimla||Process on to get accused in fake degrees scam extradited from Australia: Himachal DGP||The process to ensure the extradition of three accused from Australia in a fake degrees scam at a Solan-based private university has been initiated, Himachal Pradesh Director General of Police (DGP) Sanjay Kundu said on Sunday.Karnal-based Raj Kumar Rana, the chairman of the Manav Bharti Charitable Trust that runs the Manav Bharti University (MBU), is the prime accused in the fake degrees scam, the officer said.Rana's wife, daughter, and son have also been named as accused in the case, he said, adding that since they are in Australia, the process to get them extradited to India has been initiated.Rana's passport was revoked on the recommendation of the state police after his arrest in the case, the DGP said.A total of 275 people have so far been questioned in detail in connection with the fake degrees scam, he added.Eight accused were arrested in the case after the registration of three FIRs in November 2019, the officer said, adding that two of them are still in judicial custody.During the examination of 14 of the 55 hard disks seized in the case so far, the police found the records of 41,000 degrees issued by the university, of which 36,000 turned out to be fake and were issued to people in 17 states across the country, the DGP said."This is only the tip of the iceberg as the investigation is still on and more startling revelations are expected," he added.The number of fake degrees issued by the university as well as that of the accused in the case are likely to increase further, Kundu said.The Himachal Pradesh government gave permission to the Manav Bharti Charitable Trust to run the university in 2009 after initially rejecting a proposal in this regard in 2008, he added.On Friday, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) attached assets worth Rs 194.16 crore belonging to the Manav Bharti University, its associated concerns and promoters in connection with a money-laundering probe against them linked to the alleged fake degrees scam.The provisionally attached properties are in the form of land, residential houses and commercial buildings in Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan worth Rs 186.44 crore and six fixed deposits of Rs 7.72 crore.The assets are in the name of the Solan-based Manav Bharti University, the Madhav University, the Manav Bharti Charitable Trust and its chairman Rana.The DGP said the ED attached the assets on the basis of information provided by the Himachal Pradesh police to it.

31-01-2021|| Hyderabad||Vaccinated anganwadi teacher dies in Telangana; unrelated to jab, say doctors||Telangana reported its third death among recipients of COVID-19 vaccine. An Anganwadi teacher in Mancherial District died at Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), Hyderabad from what doctors said was a lung ailment and high blood pressure. The 55-year-old Susheela had been vaccinated on January 19. Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) Dr M Neeraja said Susheela had been under their care since the past two days only as he was shifted to NIMS following a deterioration in her blood pressure.  Relatives of the patient said she had been given the vaccine at primary health centre in Kasipet, but ever since she was fine but on Saturday, she began complaining of shortness of breath and giddiness. She was under treatment at Medilife Hospital at Mancherial and was shifted to Hyderabad where she died around 11 pm on Saturday night. Doctors said, “the death occurred due to the cardio-respiratory arrest triggered by multiple morbidities such as kyphoscoliosis with restricted lung disease, respiratory infection with type 2 respiratory failure accelerated hypertension with left ventricular failure".  Earlier a 42-year-old doctor who was administered the vaccine on January 19 at Kuntala Primary Health Centre, Nirmal had developed chest pain and was brought dead to District Hospital at Nirmal in the early hours of January 20. The second case was of a 45-year-old female healthcare worker vaccinated on January 19 at a primary health centre in Warangal Urban district, who died on January 24.  Meanwhile, the Telangana Health Minister E Rajender said at a function that these deaths were not because of the vaccine, but due to comorbidities. He said an educational programme would be launched to dispel all fear from the minds of the people and to educate them.   "Today people need more confidence and courage. To dispel these alleged fears, I volunteered to take the vaccine. Today 25 to 30 per cent health workers still have not taken the vaccine," he said. Telangana so far has received eight lakh doses and vaccinated 1,68,589 healthcare workers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccinated-anganwadi-teacher-dies-in-telangana-unrelated-to-jab-say-doctors-205967
31-01-2021||New Delhi||Tejas Mark II to roll out next year; high-speed trials in 2023: HAL Chief Madhavan||A more potent version of the indigenous Tejas multi-role combat jet featuring a much powerful engine, greater load-carrying capability and next-generation electronic warfare system is expected to be rolled out next year and its first high-speed trials will start in 2023, according to Chairman and Managing Director of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd R Madhavan.He said the structural package and related work on the Tejas Mark II, which will have an array of superior avionics, was progressing well, and the production of the high-performance jet is likely to start around 2025.Madhavan said the upgraded version will have a bigger fuselage, longer range, better maintainability, greater load-carrying capability, much stronger engine power and superior net-centric warfare systems.With an increase in range and payload capability, Madhavan said the new variant will be much superior to the Tejas Mark-IA, 73 of which are being procured by the Indian Air Force from the HAL under a Rs 48,000-crore deal that was approved by the government on January 13.“Tejas Mark II is likely to roll out by August-September of 2022. After that, the first flight will take some time. The first high-speed trial of the jet will start in 2023 and we expect the production to start somewhere around 2025,” Madhavan told PTI. Asked about the weapon package for Tejas Mark II, the chief of the state-run aerospace giant did not give a direct reply and said it will be decided at a later stage depending on the requirement and changing dynamics.Tejas is a single-engine and highly agile multi-role supersonic fighter capable of operating in high-threat air environments. The aircraft, manufactured by the HAL, is a potent platform for air combat and offensive air support with reconnaissance and anti-ship operations as its secondary roles.The Tejas Mk-IA will be equipped with an active electronically scanned array radar, beyond visual range missile, electronic warfare suite and air-to-air refuelling system.On the next generation advanced multi-role combat aircraft (AMCA) project, the HAL chairman said the aim is to implement the project under the framework of a special purpose vehicle (SPV), also involving private sector players.India is working on the fifth-generation medium weight deep penetration fighter jet and the project is estimated to cost around USD 5 billion.Madhavan said the aircraft prototype is likely to be ready by 2026 and its production could start by 2030. He added that the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is working on the project timeline.“It is still in the initial design stage. We are trying to get into an SPV route where HAL and DRDO will be partners and we will try to bring in some private players, at least two. We want them (private players) to have a slight majority (stake) so that it does not become a government entity,” he said.Madhavan said the thinking has been that the private players could hold 50.5 percent stakes in the venture so that it is deemed as private though there will be provisions for audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).“What we are planning to do is to get the prototypes made by the HAL without going into any SPV route. Once we do that, then we will ask them (private players) to join hands. They will have to put in at least Rs 2,500 crore. We will put in Rs 2,500 crore as initial investment,” he said.Madhavan suggested that the implementation of the project under the SPV route will cut procedural delays.The HAL chairman and managing director said the Rs 48,000-crore Tejas project will significantly boost the aerospace sector in India and it will have ripple effects on the implementation of various ambitious programmes.Madhavan said that Tejas Mark IA jet has superior performance levels compared to China’s JF-17 combat aircraft as it has better engine, radar system, electronic warfare suit besides having an edge in the overall technology.He said production of Tejas Mark IA will continue till 2028, while manufacturing of Tejas Mark II will continue for 6-8 years after its production starts in 2025. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tejas-mark-ii-to-roll-out-next-year-high-speed-trials-in-2023-hal-chief-madhavan-205966
31-01-2021||Kanpur||Police outpost temporarily closed after mob vandalised it in UP’s Kanpur||Apparently irked over the behaviour of local villagers, police in this Uttar Pradesh district on Sunday temporarily closed down the Kuria outpost that was vandalised by an angry mob, which also allegedly attempted to set it ablaze on Thursday following a road accident.The police outpost comes under the Bidhunoo police station and is located at a distance of around 15 kilometres from the district headquarters.“The decision to shut down the police outpost was taken by the deputy IG, who learnt that the locals have no need for a police outpost in their village. The order was issued on Sunday to temporarily close it down,” Superintendent of Police (Rural) Brajesh Srivastava said.He, however, added that strict instructions have been issued to enhance police patrolling in the vicinity and ensure alertness of the personnel to deal with any exigency.Policemen have also been asked to make deployment of pickets round the clock and ensure the presence of the force in the area.Besides, the police-patrolling cars and motorbikes attached to “Dial 112” would also be put on patrolling.Confirming the temporary closure of the Kuria police outpost, Kanpur’s Deputy Inspector General of Police Preetinder Singh told PTI, “The police outpost was set up in the village with an aim to redress people’s complaints and help them. But the act of vandalising it and (trying to) set it afire showed that they have no need for a police outpost there.” The DIG also informed that six people have been arrested and sent to jail so far for allegedly torching dumper trucks, two-wheelers and vandalising the police outpost.A total of 28 people were named in the FIR, which was registered in connection with the incident under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Angry over the death of a 44-year-old woman in a road accident, the locals torched three dumper trucks and vandalised the Kuria police outpost in Pipargawan village on Thursday.The agitated mob also torched three two-wheelers parked at the police outpost and made an abortive attempt to set the police outpost ablaze. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/police-outpost-temporarily-closed-after-mob-vandalised-it-in-ups-kanpur-205964

While the Modi government is working towards ‘jan kalyan’ (serving people), the Mamata Banerjee government is working towards ‘bhatija kalyan’ (serving her nephew) in Bengal,” Shah said addressing a rally through video-conferencing here.“Mamata Banerjee should think why so many TMC leaders are joining the BJP. It is because she has failed the people of the state. By the time elections arrive, she will be left alone,” he said, hinting at more exodus from the ruling party.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-working-towards-serving-her-nephew-in-west-bengal-shah-205958
31-01-2021||Bengaluru||Sasikala discharged from hospital, hints at political battle with AIADMK||Expelled AIADMK leader V K Sasikala was discharged from a hospital here on Sunday after recovering from COVID-19, days after she was set free by the prison officials on completion of her jail term in a corruption case, authorities said.Sending a strong signal, Sasikala, a close aide of late Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa, travelled in a car that sported the AIADMK flag from the hospital, with the ruling party questioning the propriety of her action when she had been ousted from the party.The AIADMK has time and again made it clear that the 66- year old Sasikala would not be taken back and her release would not have any impact on the party, which is keen to retain power in the assembly elections, expected in April-May.It has already declared incumbent K Palaniswami as the chief ministerial candidate for the polls.Sasikala was expelled from the party in September, 2017, along with her nephew TTV Dhinakaran and others by the general council of the combined AIADMK under the leadership of Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam after the two merged their respective factions.On Sunday, the AIADMK in its twitter handle said the use of its flag by Sasikala was against the law and quoted senior party leader D Jayakumar. “How Sasikala, who is not even a party member could use the party flag? This is against the law,” Jayakumar, who is also the Fisheries Minister, said.Defending Sasikala, Dhinakaran, who is the general secretary of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam floated by him in March, 2018, as an arrangement to retrieve the AIADMK, claimed “she (his aunt) is the general secretary of the AIADMK.”    Cases relating to her so-called ‘expulsion’ and connected matters were pending before the court in Tamil Nadu, he told reporters, adding “I have already told you that legal fight will continue (to retrieve the AIADMK).”The very purpose of floating the AMMK was to retrieve the AIADMK in a democratic way and ‘Thiyaga Thalaivi Chinnamma’ (leader of sacrifices, junior ‘Amma’) would continue legal efforts to win back the party, he said.Dhinakaran said as per doctors’ advice she would stay back here and take rest for a week before returning to Chennai.Political analyst Sumanth Raman tweeted “#Sasikala coming out of hospital in a car with an AIADMK flag on it seems to be a clear signal of her intentions. Game on.”     Soon after she was discharged, Sasikala reached a resort near the scenic Nandi Hill at Devanahalli in North Bengaluru.Sasikala was admitted to the Victoria Hospital after she tested positive for COVID-19 recently while under judicial custody.Prison authorities here had formally released her on January 27 after she completed the four-year jail term in Rs 66 crore disproportionate assets case.On the advice of doctors, she remained in the hospital and was discharged on Sunday after her latest test reports came negative for COVID-19, hospital officials said.A huge crowd of her supporters greeted Sasikala as she came out of the hospital.More than 300 police personnel were deployed in the area to ensure law and order, police said.Sambasivan, one of her supporters from Hosur in the border district of Krishnagiri in Tamil Nadu, told PTI that this was like a festival for him.Sasikala’s release comes ahead of the assembly elections in Tamil Nadu and the course of action taken by her would be keenly watched.The Supreme Court sentenced her to four year simple imprisonment on February 14, 2017 at a time when she was set to take over as the Chief Minister subsequent to her election as the AIADMK legislature party leader.After the sentence that also barred her from contesting elections for six years after completion of the term, she chose Palaniswami to be the chief minister.Before coming here to serve the sentence, Sasikala had made a dramatic vow at the ‘samadhi’ of Jayalalithaa, though she did not openly declare what it was all about. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sasikala-discharged-from-hospital-hints-at-political-battle-with-aiadmk-205955
31-01-2021||Puducherry||Nadda slams Congress govt in Puducherry over graft, says BJP will capture power in coming polls||BJP president JP Nadda on Sunday asserted that his party would sweep the coming Puducherry assembly elections and assured people of the Union Territory a corruption-free and development-oriented government.Alleging that corruption was rampant under the Congress government led by Chief Minister V Narayanasamy, he said the BJP would win 23 of the 30 seats in the Union Territory assembly in the polls, likely in the next few months.The BJP in the UT has received a shot in the arm with former minister A Namasivayam joining the party along with a former MLA recently.“...for the past 35 years under the Congress rule, 52 per cent of the population in the UT is below the poverty line,” Nadda claimed, adding corruption extended to admissions in colleges offering professional courses as well.Addressing a grand first election public meeting here, Nadda said the Congress government did not conduct local body elections for a long time and Central seats in colleges were not allotted to Puducherry students “due to corruption”.While 70 per cent was the grant in aid to Puducherry from the Centre during former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s tenure, it was cut to 30 per cent when Narayanasamy became a Minister at the Centre, he claimed.Puducherry went into a debt trap while 76 per cent of youth were unemployed and employees belonging to the cooperative sector like Khadi Cooperative Federation have not been paid salary for over four years, he claimed.Assembly elections are expected in April or early May in Puducherry.“When Narayanasamy was a Central minister, he waived Rs 5,000 crore loan of Jharkhand but did not waive the loan of Puducherry,” Nadda said adding this was the type of “justice” the present Chief Minister did met out to the UT.Senior leaders were leaving the Congress, he said and welcomed them into the Saffron party’s fold, expressing confidence that the “lotus” was set to bloom in Puducherry and capture power.Namasivayam, number 2 in the Narayanasamy cabinet, was among those who recently quit the Congress and joined the BJP.He has accused the Chief Minister of sidelining senior Congress leaders.“Kamalam is going to grow, Kamalam is going to blossom here in Puducherry...  we will win 23 plus seats and will form a government...,” the BJP national chief said.He assured the people of a government that would be free of corruption and focused on development of the Union Territory.The Puducherry assembly has a total of 33 seats, including three nominated seats. BJP holds all the three nominated seats at present.“When we are talking about one nation, one ration card, we find that the ration shops are closed in Puducherry,” he said.While the Centre was for opening more industries to nurture growth, textile mills and industrial units in Puducherry were being closed down in view of “mismanagement” and “corruption”.Once the BJP assumes power, salary arrears would be paid to employees, closed down textile mills shall be reopened, sugar factories would be modernised and re-constructed and good quality roads shall be in place, he assured.

31-01-2021||Chandigarh||Rain deficient in Punjab, Himachal during January; surplus in Haryana||Rainfall in the first month of this decade has been significantly below normal in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, though Haryana experienced surplus rain during this period.Punjab received 11 mm rain from January 1 to January 30 against the long period average of 19.8 mm, accounting for a deficiency of 45 per cent, according to data compiled by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Though the districts lying alongside the state’s western border received normal to excess rain, other parts of the state recieved below par rainfall. Tarn Taran was the wettest district during this period with an excess of 89 per cent while Faridkot was the worst hit with a deficiency of 92 per cent.In the hill state of Himachal Pradesh, the deficiency was 56 per cent, IMD data shows that the state received 37.6 mm rain against the long period average of 86.4 mm. The rain was below normal in all districts in the state during this month, with the deficiency being highest in Mandi.The rain was surplus by 59 per cent in Haryana during January. IMD recorded 21.3 mm rain against the long period average of 13.4 mm. Barring four districts, Fatehabad, Ambala, Yamunanagar and Panchkula, all other districts received normal to above normal rain.The weather department has predicted that under the influence of a fresh western disturbance, light isolated rain or snow is very likely over the Western Himalayan region during February 1-3.Subsequently, due to the absence of any active western disturbance, below-normal rain or snow is likely over northern parts of the country, including the Western Himalayan region, till February 10.According to IMD, minimum temperatures are prevailing in the range of two degrees Celsius to 10 degrees Celsius over most parts of northwest and adjoining areas, which are generally below normal.Considering the prevailing wind pattern at lower levels, no significant change in minimum temperatures is very likely these parts during the next 3-4 days but will rise by 2-3 degrees Celsius thereafter. Dense to very dense fog will also be experienced in several parts of Punjab and Haryana over the new few days and foggy conditions would reduce thereafter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rain-deficient-in-punjab-himachal-during-january-surplus-in-haryana-205952
31-01-2021||New Delhi||Sonu Sood moves SC against HC order on illegal construction notice||Actor Sonu Sood has moved the Supreme Court challenging the Bombay High Court order which dismissed his appeal against a BMC notice over alleged illegal construction at his residential building in Mumbai’s Juhu area.Sood’s petition stated that his application for conversion has been approved by the Municipal Commissioner subject to Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) permission.It said the high court order dated January 13, 2021 has been passed without considering the provisions of Section 43 (1) of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 and his application for conversion of residential premises into a residential hotel was submitted in 2018 before the department concerned.The plea contended that their application for conversion, which has been approved by the Municipal Commissioner subject to MCZMA, be directed to be decided by authorities concerned.         “The petitioners have already stopped the work of internal renovation which require no permission as per the provisions of Section 43 of Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966, therefore, the respondents may kindly be restrained from demolition of the renovation work already done in the building,” the plea filed by Sood and his wife said.Sood further stated that if the application of the petitioners for conversion is approved, the financial loss due to demolition will not be recovered in any manner and would cause miscarriage of justice to the petitioners.The HC, while dismissing the actor’s appeal and application, said, “Law helps only those who are diligent.”        Sood’s lawyer had sought a time of 10 weeks to comply with the notice issued by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in October last year, and requested the HC to direct the civic body to not initiate demolition action. The high court, however, refused and said the actor had ample opportunity in the past and if required, he could approach the civic body.Sood had approached the high court earlier this month challenging an order of a city civil court at Dindoshi that had dismissed his suit against the BMC’s notice issued over the alleged illegal construction carried out by him. The actor, in the interim application in HC, had sought an order from the high court restraining the BMC from taking any coercive action against his residential property in Juhu area.“The petitioner (Sood) has not made any changes in the building that warrants permission from the BMC. Only those changes that are allowed under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act have been done,” Sood’s advocate had argued in HC.As per the BMC, the Bollywood actor had carried out structural changes in the six-storey residential building “Shakti Sagar”, and allegedly converted it into a hotel without taking requisite permissions. The BMC earlier this month also filed a complaint at the Juhu police station, seeking an FIR to be lodged against Sood for allegedly converting the residential building into a hotel without permission.The complaint letter was sent to the police after the BMC inspected the building and found that Sood had allegedly not complied with the requisitions and was continuing unauthorised construction even after the notice was served to him in October last year. The police is yet to register FIR in the case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonu-sood-moves-sc-against-hc-order-on-illegal-construction-notice-205951

Hence, we prayed to God to forgive us for our mistakes,” Singh told reporters.On Friday, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan suspended an Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) official after videos of homeless people being driven out of the city and dropped near a village went viral on social media.The civic body has also removed two temporary employees from the job.The incident has taken place at a time when the administration of Indore, which has won the country’s ‘cleanest city’ tag four times in a row, is making all efforts to keep the city neat and tidy to win the ‘Sawchh Sarvekshan 2021’.In a Twitter post on Saturday, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said it was a “blot on humanity” and sought action against the officials who ordered such an action.Sood in a video message on Saturday appealed to residents of Indore to come forward and help the homeless people get a roof on their heads.When contacted, Additional Municipal Commissioner Abhay Rajangaonkar told PTI on Sunday that, “We are conducting a detailed investigation into the incident. All facts will come to light after the inquiry.”Around 2.30 pm on Friday, some municipal workers brought eight to 10 people, who were homeless and looking weak, in a truck and dropped them near Shipra village outside the city, said Rajesh Joshi, who runs a tea stall in the village and recorded the incident on his mobile phone.They were forcibly taking out these people, including two women, from the truck, Joshi said.“When I started recording it, some municipal workers said they were dropping these people here (in the village) following a government order, as they were dirtying the city,” he claimed.After villagers protested, the IMC staff took those people back to the city, he said.In the video, these elderly people, including some who were unable to walk properly, were seen sitting dejected along a roadside. Their belongings tied in rags were also seen scattered around.Meanwhile, local Congress MLA Sanjay Shukla claimed that municipal workers on Friday forcibly drove 15 elderly people out of the city.“After the villagers protested, they brought back only four of them and lodged them in a shelter home. Where are the other 11? They were possibly dropped between the village and the city during return,” Shukla said.The MLA said they have complained to police about this.However, IMC’s Additional Commissioner Rajangaonkar claimed that only six elderly people were taken out of the city and they were brought back.“Out of them, three were lodged in a shelter home, while three others, after alighting from the truck, left on their own will,” he said.As many as 10 shelter homes are being run in the city where homeless people are being sent to protect them from the biting cold, officials said.As of now, only 76 people are staying in these shelter homes, they said.Many homeless people do not stay in these shelter homes as these places do not have facilities for food, they added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dm-apologises-over-dumping-of-homeless-people-outside-indore-205950
31-01-2021||Ghaziabad||Number of protesters continues to swell; cops put up barbed wires, barricades at Ghazipur border||The number of protesting farmers continues to swell at the Ghazipur protest site as hundreds more reach the site on the Delhi-Meerut highway, the national capital’s border with Uttar Pradesh, on Sunday.Security measures were strengthened with multi-layer barricading and barbed wires coming up on both sides of the highway stretch that has become the Bharatiya Kisan Union’s (BKU) camping site since November 28 last year in a major farmers’ stir over three new farm laws of the Centre.Farmers reached the Ghazipur border from western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajastan, Uttarakhand as a turban-clad Rakesh Tikait led the charge for the BKU, the appeal of which coupled with a clarion call from a January 29 “mahapanchayat” of farmers in Muzaffarnagar has re-energised the stir, which was fast losing its sheen and momentum after the Republic Day violence in Delhi.According to the Ghaziabad administration, senior officials and police officers are regularly monitoring the situation at the Ghazipur border.Vehicles proceeding towards and coming from the protest site were being checked while drones had been deployed for aerial monitoring at the site, officials said.“The situation is under control and is being regularly monitored,” an officer of the district administration said.The groups of farmers camping at the site braving the cold nights were seen dancing to folk tunes and songs eulogising the nation and farmers as some young protesters carried music systems to Ghazipur on their tractor-trollies.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed the apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.

Sanitisation and all COVID-19 safety protocols must be followed,” the minister added.The development comes days after the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) allowed cinema halls and theatres to operate with more people as per fresh COVID-19 reopening guidelines, to be effective from February 1.Javadekar said he hoped people would “welcome” this move as the government was working towards relaxing several restrictions imposed due to the abnormal challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic.“Customers can also buy food and beverage from the stalls at the theatres and can carry it with them inside (the auditorium). These are all normal things but when the situation became abnormal due to COVID-19, we had to put these restrictions.

31-01-2021||New Delhi||26% women cite gender pay gap in new survey||In a recent international survey on gender equality opinions and experiences during the Covid-19 pandemic, most (87 per cent) female respondents from India have said they feel at risk, or know someone who feels at risk, of assault or harassment in some place or another. In the same survey, about 26 per cent of women say they are not paid as much as their male counterparts.According to India-based findings of the report by Women Deliver and Focus 2030, women in India cited public places to be the most common place where they felt at-risk. “Fifty-five percent of female respondents feel at risk, or know someone who feels at risk, “online”, and 40 per cent do “in the place where (they) work or study”.Twenty-six per cent of female respondents in India feel at risk, or know someone who feels at risk, of assault or harassment in their home,” said the report.Of the 1,003 respondents surveyed, 48 per cent of female respondents in India state that they have had their “freedom of movement restricted against their will by family members or (their) partner”.As per the report, 60 per cent of women finds it acceptable for women to refuse sexual intercourse with their partner; and 56 per cent find it unacceptable to whistle at a woman in the street, or touch her without her consent.35 per cent think it's acceptable to share a sexist joke about a woman with friends or on social media, while 51 per cent find this unacceptable.Sexual and reproductive health and rights, when it comes to bodily autonomy and sexual and reproductive health and rights, 1 in 10 want provision of access to contraception and family planning, good maternal health, and sex education in schools.Female respondents who migrated for a job or better economic opportunities are particularly keen on an increase in access to sexual health services compared to other females.Twenty-six per cent of female respondents in India stated that they have had difficulty accessing their chosen method of contraception and 20 per cent have had difficulty accessing abortion and post-abortion care, said the report.Economic justice and rightsSeventeen per cent of respondents ranks “implement access to well paid jobs, equal pay, financial independence, and property rights” as their number one priority.In order to improve women’s economic opportunities and decision-making powers, respondents cite measures like preventing violence and sexual harassment in the workplace, guaranteeing social protection and decent working conditions for women in low paying jobs and achieving equal access to education and professional training for women and men.Notably, according to the report, 26 per cent of female respondents in India said that they are “not paid as much as male counterparts where (they) work”.This figure rises to 32 per cent among female respondents aged 45 to 59.

Ten per cent have lost their job and 29 per cent could not do as many hours of paid work as they usually would.“We’ve made a lot of progress on gender equality over the last 25 years, but there’s so much work left to do. Now, with Covid-19, just as women are assuming an outsized role in responding to the pandemic in their communities and at home, they are also experiencing enormous added burden, and we could see the consequences of that strain playing out for years to come,” said Divya Mathew, Senior Manager, Policy and Advocacy at Women Deliver.“This survey shows us where the world has fallen short, but it also delivers the encouraging news that the vast majority of women and men around the world expect their leaders to take action to advance gender equality.” — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/26-women-cite-gender-pay-gap-in-new-survey-205933

31-01-2021||London||UK to join Asia-Pacific free trade pact CPTPP||The UK government has announced that it is applying to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), one of the world’s largest free-trade areas made up of 11 developed and emerging economies in the Pacific, under its post-Brexit plans.Joining the CPTPP reflects the UK’s post-Brexit Pacific tilt and is dubbed as a critical part of the Prime Minister Boris Johnson led government’s wider trade strategy, which aims to deepen links with faster-growing parts of the world and partnering with countries who believe in free and fair trade, including India.The decision to join the CPTPP, comprising Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam, marks one year since the UK left the European Union (EU) on January 31 last year and entered a Brexit transition period which concluded at the start of this year.“One year after our departure for the EU we are forging new partnerships that will bring enormous economic benefits for the people of Britain,” said UK Prime Minister Johnson.“Applying to be the first new country to join the CPTPP demonstrates our ambition to do business on the best terms with our friends and partners all over the world and be an enthusiastic champion of global free trade,” he said.UK International Trade Secretary Liz Truss will speak to Japanese Minister for CPTPP Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is the Chair of the 2021 CPTPP commission, and Damien O’Connor, Minister for Trade and Economic Growth in New Zealand, which stores official documentation for all CPTPP members, on Monday morning to make the official request to join, with formal negotiations for its first major post-Brexit multilateral trading move set to start this year.“Joining CPTPP will create enormous opportunities for UK businesses that simply weren’t there as part of the EU and deepen our ties with some of the fastest-growing markets in the world,” said Truss.“It will mean lower tariffs for car manufacturers and whisky producers, and better access for our brilliant services providers, delivering quality jobs and greater prosperity for people here at home. We’re at the front of the queue and look forward to starting formal negotiations in the coming months,” she said.The government says the CPTPP would deepen the UK’s access to fast-growing markets and major economies, including Mexico, Malaysia and Vietnam, for the benefit of British business.The Department for International Trade (DIT) hopes joining the 9 trillion-pound partnership will cut tariffs for UK industries, including food and drink and cars, while also creating new opportunities for modern industries like tech and services, ultimately supporting and creating high-value jobs across the UK.Unlike EU membership, joining does not require the UK to cede control over our laws, borders, or money, it highlights.“This ambition marks a new chapter for our independent trade policy. As one of the largest free trade agreements in the world, these 11 countries contribute over 100 billion pounds to our economy,” said Lord Karan Bilimoria, the President of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).“Membership of the bloc has the potential to deliver new opportunities for UK business across different sectors. The CBI will continue to work with the government to ensure that firms get the most out of an agreement that will create jobs and deliver wide-ranging benefits to communities across the country,” he said.According to official statistics, UK trade with the group was worth 111 billion pounds last year, growing by 8 per cent a year since 2016.The benefits of CPTPP membership highlighted by the DIT include: modern digital trade rules that allow data to flow freely between members, remove unnecessary barriers for businesses, and protect commercial source code and encryption.Also, eliminating tariffs quicker on UK exports including whisky (down from 165 per cent to 0 per cent in Malaysia) and cars (reducing to 0 per cent in Canada by 2022, two years earlier than through the UK-Canada trade deal);“Rules of Origin” that allow content from any country within CPTPP to count as “originating”, for example which would mean that cars made in the UK could use more Japanese-originating car parts, such as batteries; and also easier travel for businesspeople between CPTPP countries, such as the potential for faster and cheaper visas.“The UK has been a major beneficiary of the rise of digital trade with over 67 per cent of service exports worth 190.3 billion pounds being digitally delivered. CPTPP will open up new markets for innovative tech SMEs [small and medium enterprises] looking to grow and expand beyond our borders,” said Julian David, CEO of techUK.“Crucially, at the very heart of this agreement is an SME chapter, something that we have lobbied for the inclusion of in every FTA [free trade agreement], ensuring that no business is left behind.This is truly a world-leading agreement and one that will genuinely help small firms to thrive and succeed more than ever,” added Mike Cherry, Chair of the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB).The UK says its membership will complement the bilateral FTAs it has already concluded or is negotiating with nine of the CPTPP members, including Japan and Canada.

He was subsequently booked under the stringent National Security Act (NSA).On September 1, 2020, the Allahabad High Court had quashed Khan’s detention under the NSA and ordered his immediate release, saying his speech at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) didn’t promote hatred or violence.In his video message, Khan also said he had written to the state government requesting it to reinstate him at his post in Gorakhpur’s Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College.Khan hit the headlines after the 2017 tragedy at the BRD Medical College, in which several children died due to lack of oxygen cylinders. Initially, he was hailed as a saviour for the children for arranging emergency oxygen cylinders but later, faced action, along with nine other doctors and staff members of the hospital, all of whom were released on bail later. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kafeel-khan-80-others-included-in-list-of-history-sheeters-in-ups-gorakhpur-205894

However, it is understood that a two-month long bio-bubble even for a truncated two-phased Ranji Trophy in the times of the pandemic wasn't feasible.“I am extremely happy to inform you that we are going to conduct the Senior Women’s One Day tournament simultaneously with the Vijay Hazare Trophy and follow it up with Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-19. This has been decided after having received your feedback on the domestic season 2020-21,” Shah wrote to the state units.BCCI treasurer Arun Dhumal said the decision to cancel the Ranji Trophy was taken after taking every stakeholder into confidence.“We took feedback from the players, selection committee, state associations. It was felt that 2020 is already gone and rather than having two Ranji events in the same calendar year, it is better to go for white-ball cricket,” Dhumal said.“That way we could have something for junior cricket and women considering the importance of the women’s World Cup and U-19 World Cup next year,” he added.Dhumal added the players would be compensated financially for the cancellation of the Ranji Trophy. — TNS, agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-ranji-trophy-for-1st-time-in-86-yrs-205748

BJP chief JP Nadda made the announcement regarding formalisation of the alliance in Madurai today. “The BJP will enter the Tamil Nadu polls in alliance with the AIADMK and like-minded parties,” Nadda said, addressing a public meeting, his first in the run-up to the Assembly elections expected in April or early May. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi facilitated projects like the defence corridor for Tamil Nadu, while the state was “ignored” during the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance regime. Praising Tamil as the world’s oldest language, Nadda, who is here on a one day visit, said when the right person assumed the right place, it led to right decisions. After PM Modi assumed the top office, a “safe destiny” was assured for the nation and Tamil Nadu as well, he said. Nadda recalled that Modi had quoted a couplet from “Tirukkural” to soldiers at Ladakh and also cited the PM’s “Yaadum Oorey” reference of Tamil poet Kaniyan Poongundranar in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in 2019. Dwelling on Tamil, he said the Tamil people had a unique combination of entrepreneurship, economic and cultural ethos. The BJP top leader’s Tamil pitch assumes significance Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had some days back alleged that the saffron party had no respect for Tamil language and culture.

An NIA team that visited the blast site on Friday evening carried out complete mapping of the area.According to Delhi Police officials, initial investigations indicate that explosives and other materials used in the low-intensity improvised explosive device (IED) blast were locally sourced.

We had warned you then also. Now don’t make the second mistake of unfairly implicating farmer leaders. If you do so, this agitation will flare up. We all condemn the Republic Day violence, but the perpetrators were lumpen elements, not farmer leaders. Had the farm laws not been rushed, R-Day incidents would not have happened,” Azad told the PM.Other Opposition leaders—NCP’s Sharad Pawar, TMC’s Sudip Bandopadhyay, Shiv Sena’s Sanjay Raut, DMK’s TR Baalu and Tiruchi Siva and Left Front leaders—sought a discussion on farmers’ issues in the Budget session.The government is likely to take up this debate, once Parliament reconvenes after recess on March 8.The Opposition also sought a discussion on economy, LAC standoff, Arnab leaks and job losses. “It is easier to buy a car these days than to top it with fuel,” Azad said.Terming R-Day violence unfortunate, the PM said the law would take its course.He urged leaders to avoid disruptions noting that “it was for the bigger parties, including the BJP, to ensure that Parliament functioned smoothly, there were no disruptions and smaller parties were able to voice their views adequately”. The PM also urged leaders to give inputs to aid India’s global march.Delhi march on Feb 7In Hisar, 19 khap panchayats on Saturday announced a ‘padayatra’ from Jind to Delhi on Feb 7.

The implications are expected to be felt by the BJP governments in UP and Haryana where the CMs are non-Jats.BKU (Tikait) chief Naresh Tikait yesterday said supporting BJP’s Sanjiv Balyan (now Union Minister) in the Lok Sabha polls was “a mistake.” The BKU, after the demise of its founder Mahendra Singh Tikait, had lost its support base. Rakesh Tikait was routed in the elections. But things have changed now. After Naresh Tikait called off the stir following the January 26 Delhi violence, there were signs of the protest fading away in Ghazipur.But visuals of Rakesh Tikait breaking into tears stirred the emotions of members of his community, who felt collectively humiliated. Perhaps, the BJP has inadvertently increased his relevance and brought the Jat community together.Observers say the Modi government earlier underestimated not only Punjab farmers’ anger, but also their determination and resolve.Most Punjab BJP leaders, the observers claim, failed to give a correct feedback to the Centre regarding the ground situation in the state.Two more mahapanchayats are planned in UP’s Bijnor and Haryana’s Jind districts to mobilise support for the farmers’ agitation against the three contentious farm laws. While the Bijnor mahapanchayat has been scheduled for February 1, the one at Jind will be held on February 3, BKU spokesperson Dharmendra Malik said on Sunday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/next-mahapanchayat-at-baghpat-bjp-misread-farmers-agitation-205736

31-01-2021||Shubhadeep Choudhury||Timely closure of sick, loss-making central public sector units a must||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 30The Economic Survey tabled in the Lok Sabha on Friday by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stressed on the need for timely closure of sick and loss making Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) and disposal of their assets.According to the pre-budget document, as of January 15, 2021, 110 CPSEs in the country are in a defunct state. In addition, there are 77 CPSEs that have been identified as loss-making.As many as 256 CPSEs out of total 366 in the country are operational, the Economic Survey reported. 171 CPSEs booked profit during FY20. The total profit was Rs 1.38 lakh crore. On the other hand the consolidated loss of loss-making enterprises was Rs 44,816 crore.The overall net profit of the CPSEs thus declined by 34.6 per cent to reach Rs 93,295 crore in FY20 from Rs 1.43 lakh crore in FY19.Even the profit-making CPSEs may be up for sale as the Economic Survey pointed out that under the “Atmanirbhar Bharat Mission”, it had been decided to have CPSEs only in the “strategic sectors” and the number of CPSEs in the strategic sector should ideally be limited to four. The CPSEs in the non-strategic sectors would be privatised as to enable the government to focus on strategic sectors.To strengthen the CPSEs that would be retained by the government, steps are underway to completely revamp the boards of these to reorganise their structure, enhance the operational autonomy and introduce strong corporate governance norms, including listing on stock exchanges for greater transparency.The Department of Public Enterprises has also separately initiated revamping of Performance Monitoring System of the CPSEs to make it more objective and forward looking based on sectoral indices.According to the Economic Survey, the Mahalanobis Plan in 1956 envisaged CPSEs as a mean for import substitution and self-sufficiency. However, the inherent inefficiencies leading to low productivity in the PSEs, high-cost structure and strained public finances led the GoI to go for policy change after 1991 heralding an era of privatisation and disinvestment.Cheapest non-veg meals in Chandigarh, Haryana||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/timely-closure-of-sick-loss-making-central-public-sector-units-a-must-205747

During this period the cost of a non-veg thali was most expensive in rural Arunachal Pradesh (Rs 48.5).Another northern state, Haryana, figures lowest in the chart in terms of price of a non-veg meal in urban areas during June-December 2020 period.

It excludes PDS consumption and is wholly based on the transactional prices of componentsAccording to the Economic Survey, while thali cost increased between June 2020 and November 2020, the cost witnessed a sharp fall in the month of December reflecting the fall in the prices of many essential food commodities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cheapest-non-veg-thalis-in-chandigarh-haryana-economic-survey-205558

31-01-2021||Aditi Tandon||Govt made a mistake by pushing farm laws, shouldn’t make another by implicating farm leaders: Azad to Modi||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 30The Congress on Saturday warned the government against wrongfully implicating the agitating farmer leaders, saying the government had made one mistake of pushing the farm laws through Parliament but should avoid the second mistake of targeting genuine protesting leaders.Speaking at the all-party meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha and Congress veteran Ghulam Nabi Azad demanded a discussion on farmer issues on priority when the Budget Session resumes after recess.He said: “The government can stand on prestige with anyone but should not stand on prestige with our farmers, who produce food for the nation.”Azad said the Opposition had warned the Centre against pushing the laws without sending them to a standing or a select committee of Parliament.Condemning the Republic Day violence, Azad said the incidents involved lumpen elements who should be punished.“We condemn the Republic Day incidents. Never have we seen such a thing on January 26 or August 15. This would have never happened had the government needed the Opposition and allowed Parliamentary scrutiny of farm laws. That way, the government could have ensured that the concerns of farmers are addressed,” said Azad, warning the government of the agitation swelling up if the government continued to implicate farmer leaders.“When I was a chief minister, I saw that no one objected if a terrorist was killed but if an innocent person was killed in the name of terrorism, there was always a furore,” said Azad, asking the government to pause and rethink the rules of engagement with the farmers.Azad also demanded a discussion on economy and the the declining GDP and jobs noting, “Given the hike in petrol and diesel prices, I can say it is easier to buy a car these days but difficult to top it up with fuel.”Azad also asked the Centre to bring a bill urgently to grant full statehood to Jammu and Kashmir, saying a sensitive border state could not be left to officers and bureaucrats.“Now, the district development council and panchayat elections have been concluded in Jammu and Kashmir. Now there’s no excuse to not restore JK’s statehood,” said the former JK chief minister.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-made-a-mistake-by-pushing-farm-laws-shouldnt-make-another-by-implicating-farm-leaders-azad-to-modi-205519
31-01-2021||New Delhi||SC Collegium withdraws approval for appointment of Justice Pushpa Ganediwala of Bombay HC as permanent judge||The Supreme Court Collegium is understood to have withdrawn its approval to a proposal for the appointment of an additional judge of the Bombay High Court, Justice PV Ganediwala, as a permanent judge of the court following her two controversial verdicts in sexual assault cases.The decision was taken after the judge faced flak for her interpretation of sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, a source said.Justice Pushpa Ganediwala recently acquitted a man accused of groping a 12-year-old girl’s breast because he did not make skin-to-skin contact and days earlier, ruled that holding the hands of a five-year-old girl and unzipping the trousers do not amount to “sexual assault” under the POCSO Act.On January 27, the Supreme Court stayed the Bombay High Court order acquitting the man after Attorney General KK Venugopal said the order would set a dangerous precedent.The collegium headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde, at a meeting held on January 20, had okayed the proposal for making Justice Ganediwala a permanent judge.In two other judgments this month, Justice Ganediwala acquitted two men accused of raping minor girls after noting that the testimonies of the victims did not inspire confidence to fix criminal liability on the accused.“No doubt the testimony of the prosecutrix (victim) is sufficient for conviction of the accused. However, the same ought to inspire confidence of this court. It ought to be of sterling quality,” she said in one of the judgments.Justice Pushpa Virendra Ganediwala was born on March 3, 1969, at Paratwada in Maharashtra’s Amravati district.She was a panel advocate for various banks and insurance companies and was also an honorary lecturer in various colleges of Amravati and gave lectures to the MBA and LLM students of the Amravati University.She was directly appointed as a district judge in 2007 and was elevated as an additional judge of the Bombay High Court on February 13, 2019.Besides the CJI, justices NV Ramana and RF Nariman are part of the three-member collegium, which takes decisions with regard to high court judges. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-collegium-withdraws-approval-for-appointment-of-justice-pushpa-ganediwala-of-bombay-hc-as-permanent-judge-205498

Perhaps the BJP has inadvertently increased his relevance, bringing together the community, and giving purpose and strength to Tikait brothers and their organisations.“Jats stand by each other in ‘dukh’. It is a typical characteristic of the community which the BJP misunderstood and turned what could have been a possible resolution into a prestige issue for them. The basic feeling now is that ‘BJP ne dukhi kar diya kyoki wo ‘Jat’ hai’ (BJP created problems for him because Rakesh Tikait is a ‘Jat’)”, explains Prof Sudhir Panwar.After Naresh Tikait calling off the agitation two days back, there were visible signs of  thinning of protests at the Ghazipur protest site.Sources say even though an “agreement” was reached with the Tikait brothers that the protest site would be vacated, the increase in security forces and presence of Loni MLA Nand Kishore Gujjar and his supporters “vitiated the atmosphere”.Asserting that he would not surrender and would also call more people to join the protest if needed, Rakesh Tikait broke down saying “he would rather commit suicide than leave and end the protest against the farm laws”.Following that, Naresh Tikait quickly called an emergency meeting and appealed to supporters to reach Ghazipur and scheduled the Muzzafarnagar ‘mahapanchayat’.Coming to the first miscalculation, many observers say the Narendra Modi government not just “underestimated” the agitation but also the determination and resolve of the Punjab farmers who managed to reach and hold on at the Delhi borders despite so many hurdles.Had it taken care of the situation in Punjab, it would not have escalated to this level, they say.Quite clearly, Punjab BJP leaders did not give the correct feedback of the situation in the state to the Centre. Whether a similar situation is now being repeated in Uttar Pradesh remains to be seen.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/how-bjps-miscalculation-strengthened-farmer-agitation-jat-bonding-in-up-haryana-205493

Only peace can assure our victory,” he said.Rajewal said all the cases registered against farmer leaders or any other cases registered during farmers agitation would be discussed during negotiations with the government.“We have been holding a peaceful agitation at Delhi’s borders since January 26. Today also the agitation is peaceful,” Rajewal, the president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Rajewal), told reporters.“People in large numbers from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand are reaching the protest sites,” Rajewal said.“Possibly by February 2, there will again be a record gathering of people at the protest sites,” he said, adding that the agitation would remain peaceful.Rajewal also condemned the Haryana government for suspending internet services.The Haryana government on Friday decided to suspend mobile internet services in 14 more districts in the state until Saturday 5 pm “to prevent any disturbance of peace and public order”. Earlier it had suspended the services in three districts.Rajewal accused the Centre of instilling a sense of fear among people by showing pictures of the “unfortunate incidents”, apparently referring to the January 26 violence in the national capital during a tractor parade by farmers.“The government is trying to mislead people through false propaganda in order to defame the ongoing agitation,” he alleged.Rajewal appealed to those joining the agitation at Delhi’s borders to keep the protest peaceful.He asked them not to get provoked, which could affect the peaceful agitation.“It is our responsibility to keep the agitation peaceful,” he stressed.Rajewal accused the government of trying to trigger violence by provoking the farmers at the protest sites. “But we are alert. We will not indulge in any kind of violence,” he said.The farmer leader appealed to the Centre to shun its “stubborn attitude” and withdraw the three farm laws.On the next meeting between the protesting farmers and representatives of the government, he said “when they call us, we will certainly go”.To a question on joining the investigation following notices issued by the Delhi Police to farmer leaders in connection with the Republic Day violence, Rajewal said, “They issued the notices to us on January 27 but an FIR in connection with the matter was lodged on January 26. Since they have already taken action, what reply are they seeking?”Asked again, he said, “We will send them a reply.” The Delhi Police has issued the notices to around 20 farmer leaders, including Rajewal, over the violence during the farmers’ tractor parade, asking why legal action should not be taken against them. — with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-and-rss-behind-stone-pelting-on-farmers-at-singhu-rajewal-205478
31-01-2021||Mumbai||Anna Hazare calls off his proposed fast against farm laws||Social activist Anna Hazare on Friday said he would not proceed with the indefinite fast against the new farm laws and claimed that the Centre had agreed to some of his demands.Union Minister of State for Agriculture Kailash Choudhary and BJP leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadanvis met Hazare during the day.A high-level committee, with some members nominated by Hazare, would consider his demands and submit a report in six months, said Choudhary.In a statement earlier in the day, Hazare (84) had announced that he would be starting the hunger strike from his village Ralegan Siddhi in Maharashtra on Saturday.In that communication, Hazare had said he had written to the Prime Minister and Union Agriculture Minister five times on the plight of farmers but to no avail.“The Union Government has agreed to some of my demands and also announced  setting up a committee to improve the lives of farmers. I have decided to suspend my proposed indefinite fast starting from Saturday,” Hazare said on Friday.While announcing the hunger strike, he had said: “I have been demanding reforms in the agriculture sector but the Centre doesn’t seem to be taking the right decisions.”“The Centre has no sensitivity left for farmers, which is why I am starting my indefinite fast at my village from January 30,” he had added.Hazare, who was at the forefront of the anti-corruption movement in 2011, had also recalled that when he went on a hunger strike at Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan, the then UPA government had called a special session of Parliament.“Farmers are not getting adequate returns for their crops. I had told the government to implement the report of the Swaminathan Commission. It was delayed by the Union Government, so I decided to launch the protest from tomorrow,” Hazare told reporters at his village.“But the government has appointed a high-level committee and assured me that farmers will get adequate returns for crops. Therefore, I have decided not to launch the protest,” he said.Also read:Protesting farmers begin one-day hunger strikeBJP and RSS behind stone-pelting on farmers at Singhu: RajewalIf protesting farmers are abused, it will make movement stronger: British MP DhesiAsked if this U-turn will hurt his credibility, Hazare said the high-level committee would look into the implementation of the reforms, and he felt that he can trust the Union Government.Choudhary said the government had responded positively to Hazare’s demands.“He also told us that the agriculture budget should be increased. I can tell you that we have significantly increased the agriculture budget. We have appointed a high-level committee that will consist of members of Niti Ayog and persons nominated by Hazare.
