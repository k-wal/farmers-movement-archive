13-01-2021||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Three lions rescued near Rajkot city; transported to Gir||A pride of three Asiatic lions that had strayed out of its natural habitat at Gujarat’s Gir forest and reached near Rajkot city, was rescued and relocated on Wednesday, an official from the forest department said.The three lions had travelled more than 100 km from Gir forest to reach Rajkot taluka and had been camping in the surrounding areas over the last one month, said Dushyant Vasavada, chief conservator of forests (Wildlife), Junagadh.The animals were rescued by a forest team and shifted to Gir, where they will be released in the wild soon, the official said.During their stint in Rajkot for over a month, the lions were spotted in different villages close to human settlements, some not very far from the city, causing panic, he said.The pride reached very close to Rajkot city and was recently spotted near Aji Dam on the outskirts, he said.According to local forest officials, the lions were first spotted in villages of Jasdan taluka in the district and were also seen in villages of Rajkot taluka, where they preyed upon cattle.A rescue team with the experience of handling lions was called in from Gir and the lions were captured in separate cages on Wednesday morning and taken to the forest, Vasavada said.One of the lions had a radio collar on, which helped the forest department to keep an eye on the pride, he said.As per the latest census conducted last year, Gujarat has witnessed a 29 per cent rise in the population of Asiatic lions.The “Poonam Avlokan (full-moon night estimation exercise)” carried out in June last year showed that the Asiatic lion population reached 674. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-three-lions-rescued-near-rajkot-city-transported-to-gir-197954
13-01-2021||Kolkata||TMC advises Left, Congress to back Mamata; Congress says merge with us||The Trinamool Congress on Wednesday said the Congress and the Left Front should rally behind Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in her fight against the "communal and divisive" Bharatiya Janata Party, a suggestion the two parties rejected outright.The Congress proposed that the TMC should merge with it instead to put up a united fight against the BJP.The BJP, which has emerged as a potent force in the state, said the TMC's suggestion amounted to an admission that it was not in a position to take on the saffron party on its own in the assembly polls in West Bengal due in April-May."If the Left Front and the Congress are genuinely anti-BJP, they should rally behind Mamata Banerjee in her fight against the communal and divisive politics of the saffron party," senior TMC MP Sougata Roy told reporters.TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee is the "real face of secular politics against the BJP", he said.Reacting to the TMC's proposal, state Congress chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury blamed the West Bengal's ruling party for the growth of the BJP in the state."We are not interested in aligning with the TMC. Why is the TMC now interested in an alliance with us after poaching our MLAs over the last 10 years. If Mamata Banerjee is keen on fighting the BJP, then she should join the Congress as it is the only pan-India platform to fight against communalism," he said.Banerjee had floated the Trinamool Congress in 1998 after breaking away from the Congress.Senior CPI-M leader Sujan Chakraborty wondered why the TMC was trying to woo the Left parties and the Congress after branding them as "negligible" political force in the state. He also said the BJP was trying to woo Left voters."This only reflects that we are still a force to reckon with. The Left and Congress will defeat both the TMC and the BJP in the assembly elections," he said.Reacting to the development, state BJP president and Lok Sabha MP Dilip Ghosh said it reflected the TMC's "desperation"."They (the TMC) can't fight us alone, and so they are seeking the help of other parties. It also proves that the BJP is the only alternative to TMC," he said.The Left and the Congress have come together to contest the assembly polls after the drubbing they got in the last Lok Sabha elections. The CPI-M-led Left Front had drawn a blank in the LS polls, while the Congress managed to win just two of the state's 42 seats.The BJP, on the other hand, clinched 18 seats, just four less than TMC's 22.In the 2016 assembly polls, which the Left and Congress contested together, the combine had won 76 of the state's 294 seats, while the TMC bagged 211. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-advises-left-congress-to-back-mamata-congress-says-merge-with-us-197952

13-01-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||India, Taiwan to ink labour mobility pact||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 13India and Taiwan are negotiating a labour mobility pact that will institutionalise the movement of professionals from here to Taipei, said sources.With falling demographics like its East Asian peers Japan and South Korea – Taiwan last year recorded more deaths than births – India senses an opportunity to make the island nation a destination for its skilled workers.“We are looking at every sector,” said a source.Taiwan currently employs about 7 lakh foreign workers and feels the need for more. There are 10,000 Indians living in Taiwan, the biggest group being of students.There are also several rich Indians based in Taiwan with business in gems and jewellery but the labour mobility pact would ensure many more could become expatriates in a country that by law prohibits different wage scales for local and foreign workers.With a minimum pay of $ 24,000 annually, Taiwan is an attractive destination for Indian workers, said the sources.Currently, most of the foreign workers from Taiwan are from Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.Thailand, which began sending workers to Taiwan 20 years back, and Vietnam have an advantage because of their huge ethnic Chinese community. As a result there are no language barriers.As many as 2.5 lakh Vietnamese work in Taiwan. Thais numbers though are falling as Bangkok is experiencing labour shortage.The idea of a labour mobility pact began making the rounds of South Block three years back. But the Wuhan and Chennai informal summits between Chinese President Xi Jinping and PM Narendra Modi put it on the backburner. After the Galwan Valley clash, the die has been cast for a prolonged chill in Sino-Indian ties, giving the idea a second life.But the mobility of Indian workers to Taiwan could run aground on the language issue as there are few Mandarin speakers here. A labour mobility pact with Japan has had a sluggish start because of this issue.Sources said India would have to move fast on a labour mobility pact because Taiwan has already signed one with Malaysia but has not activated it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-taiwan-to-ink-labour-mobility-pact-197942

13-01-2021||New Delhi||SC order, farmers’ reaction exposes trust deficit, limitation of judiciary’s role: Agriculture expert||The Supreme Court’s order on the formation of a committee and farmers’ reaction to it has “not only exposed trust deficit between the government and farmers but also limitation of judiciary’s role in arbitration,” say some agriculture experts. The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the implementation of the three contentious farm laws and set up a four-member committee to hear various stakeholders’ views. While farmer’ unions and ‘jathebandis’ rejected the order, the ruling BJP said it will abide by the ruling.While BJP leaders say that people need to understand that “law making will be done by the Parliament and not the people on the street”, Prof Sudhir Panwar, an agriculture expert, says after months-long stand-off between the two sides the SC was expected to resolve the issue by deciding on the Constitutionality of the three laws.“The issue was whether the laws are Constitutional or not. After both sides exhausted all options and when the Government failed to resolve the crisis, the Supreme Court came forward in the role of arbitrator through formation of a committee.”“However, the decision of farmers to continue the agitation is indicative of deficit of trust between farmers and the Government on one side and farmers and the proposed committee on another side. Things are exactly where they were when the agitation started while farmers are still on Delhi’ borders,” says Panwar.While the popular perception is that the verdict has “given the Narendra Modi government elbow room out of a difficult situation”, apparently the government also believes “what it has not been able to convey to the people, the unyielding stance adopted by the unions will now do that”. So far as the BJP is concerned party spokesperson Sudesh Verma says the government did not want the laws to be put on the hold but the highest authority in the country, the Supreme Court, wanted time to decide and everyone needs to respect that. “The SC has taken a humanitarian point of view. The government did not want laws to be put on the hold, because many traders have signed contracts with farmers. We will abide by the SC’ order, however, the larger issue people need to understand is law making will be done by the Parliament and not the people on the street,” Verma added. Regarding objections on names in the committee, party leader RP Singh said they have not been recommended by the BJP or the government. “The names have been decided by the SC. It is clear those sitting on the agitation do not want to change the laws, they just want to show the government in poor light,” he says.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-order-farmers-reaction-exposes-trust-deficit-limitation-of-judiciarys-role-agriculture-expert-197939
13-01-2021||New Delhi||SC seeks Meghalaya’s reply on plea of journalist for quashing of FIR||The Supreme Court on Wednesday sought response from Meghalaya government on a plea of veteran journalist Patricia Mukhim against the High Court order refusing to quash an FIR for her Facebook post which allegedly incited communal tension between the tribal and the non-tribal communities in the state last year.A Bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, Indu Malhotra and Vineet Saran issued notice to the state government and sought its response by February 5.It also permitted advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for the scribe, to serve the copy of the petition to advocate on record for the state government. Mukhim in her plea said that she has been facing persecution for speaking the truth and seeking enforcement of rule of law against perpetrators of hate crime. She has said in her plea that a plain reading of her Facebook post would make the intent clear that the purpose of the post is to appeal for impartial enforcement of rule of law and equal treatment before the law of all citizens. On November 10, last year, the Meghalaya High Court had refused to quash a police complaint against Mukhim for her Facebook post. While disposing the plea of Mukhim, a Padma Shri awardee and the editor of The Shillong Times newspaper, the high court had said that the investigation agency should be given a free hand to probe into the matter. “In the event, the investigating agency is required to be given a free hand to investigate the matter and to come to its own conclusion in due process of law.“Consequently, I find no merit in the instant petition for exercising powers under Section 482 CrPC. This petition is accordingly hereby rejected,” the high court had said.Mukhim had hit out at the Lawsohtun village “dorbar” (council) on Facebook for failing to identify the “murderous elements” after five boys were attacked at a basketball court in July, last year. Eleven people were picked up and two were arrested in the case. “There is an attempt to make a comparison between tribals and non-tribals vis—vis their rights and security and the alleged tipping of the balance in favour of one community over the other.“This in the opinion of this Court would fall on the mischief of Section 153 A (a) IPC as it apparently seeks to promote disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between two communities,” the high court had said. The FIR was lodged on a complaint filed against Mukhim by the village council on July 6, last year, for her post on the social media, alleging that her statement incited communal tension and might instigate communal conflict. She was subsequently booked under Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc. and other provisions of the IPC). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-seeks-meghalayas-reply-on-plea-of-journalist-for-quashing-of-fir-197938

13-01-2021||London||Vijay Mallya denied permission to appeal in UK bankruptcy case||Liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya was on Wednesday denied permission to appeal against a UK High Court order refusing to dismiss bankruptcy proceedings brought by a consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI), in their pursuit of debt related to his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.The 65-year-old businessman, who remains on bail in the UK, had filed a renewed application to appeal against UK court orders in the case from last year, which had allowed for an adjournment of bankruptcy proceedings until the debt issue before the Supreme Court in India was decided upon.His counsel, Philip Marshall, argued that the banks’ bankruptcy petition should be dismissed rather than just adjourned as the debt in question was disputed and being deliberated upon in the Indian courts.“While this was a new point [before the appellate court], I do not accept it as a reasonable ground for appeal as the matter can be dealt with during proceedings that are still continuing,” said Justice Colin Birss, during a remote hearing of the Chancery Appeals Division of the High Court in London.Mallya’s barrister also raised the issue of “abuse of process” by the banks in their alleged non-disclosure of securities held in India and the existence of third-party security in the form of assets related to United Breweries Holdings.The judge reiterated that he had dismissed both these as sufficient grounds of appeal in a ruling he handed down “on paper” in December last year.“There is no prospect of success of an appeal based on this ground, although this does not preclude reliance on it [third-party security] later,” the judge ruled.The hearing forms part of a series being heard by the High Court since the SBI-led consortium of 13 Indian banks had initiated the proceedings against Mallya in December 2018 as part of their efforts to recoup around 1.145 billion pounds in unpaid loans.Both sides have deposed retired Indian Supreme Court justices as expert witnesses on Indian law in support of their arguments for and against a bankruptcy order against Mallya in the UK.While the banks argue a right to waive their security over the Indian assets involved in the case in order to recover their debt in the UK, lawyers for Mallya argue that the funds in question involved public money held by state-owned banks in India which precluded them from such a security waiver.The next hearing to conclude closing submissions in the case is scheduled to be heard at a yet-to-be-agreed date in the coming weeks.In parallel, Mallya’s lawyers have also been applying to the court in order for him to meet his considerable and mounting legal costs from monies held with the Court Funds Office (CFO) as part of the bankruptcy proceedings.In the last hearing related to costs on Monday, Judge Sebastian Prentis at the Insolvency and Companies Court (ICC) division of the High Court had agreed only to allow sufficient funds to cover the hearing on Wednesday.The issue of funds held by the court will now be fully dealt with at a hearing listed before the High Court on January 22, during which it will be decided whether to sanction sums towards living expenses and legal fees from the sale of a French luxury property Le Grand Jardin last year.Meanwhile, the separate proceedings related to the former Kingfisher Airlines chief being extradited to India to face charges of fraud and money laundering remain held up by a “confidential” legal matter.

The debate will happen just a day after the UK MPs discussed “Persecution of Muslims, Christians and Minority Groups in India.”The Indian High Commission in the UK also reacted to the scheduled debate on Wednesday saying, “High Commission of London learned of debates on India's domestic issues---that are already being discussed and addressed by India's pluralistic society through robust democratic institutions, proven procedures and transparent processes---scheduled for this week in the august Parliament of the UK.“The people of India have due respect and regard for parliaments of the world just as they regard their own as a most sacred institution of India's democracy. However, we believe that debates are purposeful when they are based on facts, authentic information, and a thorough and accurate perception of issues. We reiterate our invitation to the MPs of the UK to consult with the High Commission anytime on all India related issues of interest to them in order to have up-to-date authentic  and factual information about India including on issues that may be of concern to them and their constituents.”The Speaker also expressed condolences for the loss of lives in the European Union due to COVID 19 during his meeting with the European Parliament President.

13-01-2021||Shimla||If chill in plains runs down your spine, head for sunny hills||If the chill in the plains of northern India runs down your spine these days, travel to the hills in Himachal Pradesh where the sun is shining brightly. The reason is less humidity in the hills compared to the plains where the sun is largely fogged out.Manmohan Singh, the Director of the India Meteorological Department here, told IANS on Wednesday that the hill stations in the state currently have more pleasant weather owing to longer duration of sunshine compared to the plains."The maximum and minimum temperatures in most of the places in Himachal Pradesh are high due to prevailing dry weather and no foggy conditions," he explained.The humidity level of 70 per cent or more causes fog. In the plains, he said, it is close to 100 per cent. However, in the hills it's between 30 and 40 per cent.According to him, Shimla's humidity level was 32 per cent whereas it was 86 per cent in Chandigarh, which is located in the plains.He said the dry weather conditions in the hill state would continue at least for over a week.In Shimla, which is located around 7,000 feet above sea level, the minimum temperature on Wednesday was 5.7-degree Celsius, while in Chandigarh, which is located in the foothills of the lower Shivaliks, it was also 5.7-degree Celsius.The maximum temperature in Shimla and Chandigarh was 18.4-degree Celsius and 11.1-degree Celsius, respectively, meaning the plains were colder than the hills."What a pleasant sun in Shimla compared to the bone-chilling cold of Delhi where a dense layer of fog engulfs the city almost throughout the day," said Ankit Dubey, a tourist.His wife Silky added: "In Delhi, the sun is a luxury these days. So it is better to be in the hills where the weather is dry and you can enjoy long sunny days." The minimum temperature in another hill destination, Dharamsala, the seat of Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, was 3.6-degree Celsius, whereas the popular tourist spot of Manali, where nearby hills are wrapped up in a white blanket, saw a low of one degree Celsius.In Punjab's Amritsar and Ludhiana, the minimum temperature was 3.5 and 3.8-degree Celsius, respectively, while it was 1.4-degree Celsius in Haryana's Narnaul, the coldest in both the states.Delhi woke up to a bone-chilling cold of 3.2-degree Celsius on Wednesday as a dense layer of fog engulfed the national capital. Likewise, a thick blanket of fog enveloped many places of both Punjab and Haryana.Hill stations like Kasauli, Chail, Kufri, Narkanda, Palampur and Manali are bright, sunny and perfect for a break from the dismal winter weather of the plains.The weatherman attributed the rise in temperature in the hills to long, sunny days that kept the minimum and maximum temperatures up by several notches.However, unusually rising mercury owing to long dry spells is not going down well for Shimla residents as they say there has been a noticeable change in the climatic conditions of the town in the past 20-25 years."Now the snow is going missing from Shimla's landscape," remarked Subhash Gupta, a former government employee settled in the town since 1960."Earlier, most of our family members preferred to migrate to the lower hills from December onwards owing to extreme cold conditions. Now, the locals have almost stopped migration. In fact, a chunk of tourists have started coming here in the winter months," he said.Another resident, Prem Lal Negi, said that Shimla in recent years has hardly experienced heavy snow. "Earlier, you couldn't stay without a heating system in entire Shimla. Now, it is required only at the highest points of the town like Jakhu," he added.Environmentalists blame deforestation and rise in vehicular pollution for the change in Shimla's extreme climatic conditions.--- IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-chill-in-plains-runs-down-your-spine-head-for-sunny-hills-197927
13-01-2021||Kolkata||K D Singh arrest triggers war of words in poll-bound Bengal||The arrest of former TMC MP K D Singh in a money laundering case triggered a fresh verbal duel in the poll-bound West Bengal on Wednesday with the BJP demanding questioning of top brass of the Trinamool Congress in the case, while the ruling party denying any association with Singh for long.The Enforcement Directorate has arrested Singh in a money laundering case, official sources said on Wednesday.They said Singh has been placed under arrest under sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The opposition BJP in West Bengal demanded the top brass of the TMC leaders should be questioned in this connection.“Who is K D Singh? His identity is that he is a former MP from the TMC. So the best thing would be to question the TMC leaders to bring out the truth,” state BJP vice-president Jaiprakash Majumdar said.Speaking on the issue, his party colleague Suvendu Adhikari, who had recently switched over to the BJP, claimed Singh’s dealings with the TMC leaders should be probed.Senior CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty said the TMC can’t deny its involvement with Singh as their leaders had used his plane during election campaign.The TMC leadership, however, denied any association with Singh for the last few years.“He has not been associated with us for a long time. For the last few years, we have no relation with him. If he has committed any wrong then the law will take its course. We have nothing to say regarding it,” TMC MP Sougata Roy said.He, however, described the demand for questioning of the TMC leaders as “baseless and politically motivated”.The central probe agency had carried out searches at the premises K D Singh and those linked with him in September 2019 in connection with two PMLA cases.Singh has been the chairman of the Alchemist group and while he resigned from the post in 2012, he is stated to be the Chairman, Emeritus and founder of the business group.The ED is probing him as part of two money laundering cases.

The work is expected to be completed in the next 10 months and the 2022 Republic Day parade will be held on a redeveloped Rajpath.Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone of the new Parliament building, which is expected to be completed by the 75th anniversary of India's independence and is estimated to cost Rs 971 crore.The new building will come up in front of the existing Parliament House that was built nearly 94 years ago at a cost of Rs 83 lakh at that time and would eventually be turned into a museum.The new building will house larger Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Halls, with capacities of 888 seats and 384 seats respectively, to accommodate an expanded Parliament after the freeze on its expansion lifts in 2026. The Lok Sabha Hall will also have additional capacity, up to 1,272 seats, to host joint sessions.According to the plan, provisions in the furniture will be made for smart displays and biometrics for ease of voting with an intuitive and graphical interface, digital language interpretation and recording infrastructure to produce real-time metadata, programmable microphones that put the control of managing the house with the speaker. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/central-vista-construction-work-of-new-parliament-building-to-start-on-january-15-say-sources-197923

It has been alleged that she was gang-raped and then killed.The police have booked three people in the case and are trying to nab them.According to police sources, one of the accused was known to the girl and the other two were his friends.“We are probing all angles and have launched a hunt to nab all the culprits,” Singh said.According to the police, the girl student, aged 15-16 years, had gone missing from her house in a village under the Harduaganj police station area on Sunday morning.Shortly after her family received a message that she has been kidnapped and demanded Rs 5 lakh as ransom for her release, they added.The kidnappers warned that if the money was not paid, a video showing the girl in a compromising position would be posted on social media, the police said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-conclusive-proof-of-sexual-assault-in-autopsy-report-of-up-girl-dna-test-result-awaited-cops-197907
13-01-2021||---||SC verdict decriminalising adultery shouldn’t apply to armed forces: Centre to SC||New Delhi, January 13More than two years after the Supreme Court decriminalised adultery by declaring Section 497 of IPC as unconstitutional, the Centre has moved the Supreme Court with a plea that the historic verdict shouldn’t apply to the Armed Forces as it may cause instability among personnel who stay away from family.A three-judge Bench headed by Justice RF Nariman issued notice to the petitioner on whose plea section 497 IPC was declared unconstitutional and referred the matter to a Constitution Bench.Now, Chief Justice of India SA Bobde will constitute a five-judge Constitution Bench which will hear the Centre and the original petitioner and decide the issue.In a historic verdict, the Supreme Court had on September 27, 2018 declared unconstitutional Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code which punished only men for having sexual relationship with a married woman.In a unanimous verdict, a five-judge Constitution Bench headed by the then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra had said the 158-year-old Victorian era law was “manifestly arbitrary” and violated a woman’s right to equality and right to non-discrimination guaranteed under Article 14 and Article 15 of the Constitution as it treated them as chattels.The top court had, however, said adultery would be a ground for divorce in matrimonial proceedings and cautioned that the verdict should not be taken as a licence to indulge in such acts.Striking down the adultery law, the top court had said, “This (Section 497 IPC) treats the woman as a chattel. It treats her as the property of man and totally subservient to the will of the master. It is a reflection of the social dominance that was prevalent when the penal provision was drafted.”“The enforcement of forced female fidelity by curtailing sexual autonomy is an affront to the fundamental right to dignity and equality,” said the top court. It treated a married woman as a property of the husband, the Bench had said.It had said, “In treating a woman as chattel for the purposes of this provision, it is clear that such provision discriminates against women on grounds of sex only, and must be struck down on this ground as well.”“Adultery, in certain situations, may not be the cause of an unhappy marriage. It can be the result. It is difficult to conceive of such situations in absolute terms,” said verdict by CJI Misra and Justice AM Khanwilkar.The top court also declared Section 198 of the Criminal Procedure Code that deals with prosecution of offences against marriage as unconstitutional.According to Section 497 of IPC, whosoever has sexual intercourse with the wife of another man is guilty of adultery, which is punishable with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine, or with both. It says the woman in question can’t be punished as an abettor.An Italy-based NRI—Joseph Shine – had challenged the provision which prescribes a jail term of up to five years or fine or both, terming it “unjust, illegal and arbitrary and violative of citizens’ fundamental rights.” Shine had questioned the gender bias in the provision drafted by Lord Macaulay in 1860. He also challenged Section 198(2) the Criminal Procedure Code which allows a husband to bring charges against the man with whom his wife committed adultery.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-verdict-decriminalising-adultery-shouldnt-apply-to-armed-forces-centre-to-sc-197896

Later, he will also address the Thuglak magazine’s 51st anniversary function at Kalaivanar Arangam, according to the itinerary issued by party’s media in-charge Anil Baluni.Banking heavily on megastar Rajinikanth, the saffron party appears to have also changed tack regarding relations with regional ally AIADMK after his decision to stay away from politics.Saffron leaders, who had earlier been insisting that it is the NDA, which would take a call on the issue, now say their regional ally (that is the AIADMK) will decide the Chief Ministerial candidate for the Assembly elections due in April-May 2021. “In Tamil Nadu, AIADMK is the major partner. They will decide who their next Chief Ministerial candidate is,” BJP national general secretary and in-charge of Tamil Nadu CT Ravi was quoted as saying recently, signifying a major climb-down for the party trying hard to stake a major claim in the southern state. While the chief minister candidate will be from AIADMK, party leaders say a formal announcement regarding this will be made by the NDA coordination committee.Notably, the AIADMK has already passed a resolution (in its general council held on Saturday) that incumbent Edappadi K Palaniswami will be chief minister candidate.Earlier Ravi had said the NDA will decide on the chief minister candidate.“NDA partners will take a call on the CM candidate for the alliance. When the NDA gets the majority, the BJP’s Parliamentary Board and the alliance coordination committee will decide the CM, he had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-outreach-in-poll-bound-tamil-nadu-nadda-to-be-in%C2%A0chennai-tomorrow-on-pongal-197895

They are expected to study the CCTV footage of the previous day for identifying the attackers.Deputy SP (Sachivalaya) Rajesh Singh Prabhakar, who is part of the Special Investigating Team formed by the zonal IG for cracking the case, told reporters, "We have some vital clues which we would not like to divulge right now. But we are confident that the culprits would be caught soon." The post-mortem report of the deceased was awaited, he added.There was an outpouring of grief for Singh, survived by a wife and two children less than 10 years of age, who was known to be sociable and, by virtue of his job profile, close to many powerful politicians and bureaucrats in the state.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav tweeted, "If Nitish Kumar is not able to control law and order, he should resign." Congress national general secretary Tariq Anwar said that the incident is ample proof that Nitish Kumar has lost grip on law and order.Sunil Kumar Pintu, an MP from Kumar's own party JD(U), said, "Our leader's commitment to maintaining law and order will bear no fruits until and unless officials concerned pull up their socks."BJP Rajya Sabha MP Vivek Thakur said that the state government must hand over the case to the CBI if the police fails to solve it within five days.Controversial former MP and Jan Adhikar Party chief Pappu Yadav also pointed to Singh's "high profile connections" and stressed on the need for a thorough inquiry.BJP's Maharajganj MP Janardan Singh Sigriwal said, "I had pulled some strings for getting Rupesh, whose family has been known to me since long, transferred from Kolkata to Patna. I had never thought of such a tragic end to such a promising life.""It is time that laws are amended and provisions made for public execution of perpetrators of crime in order to strike terror in the hearts and minds of hardened criminals," he said.Meanwhile, at the paternal residence of the deceased in Saran district, the wails of the bereaved father rent the air."After my son came to Patna, I was feeling relieved that upon my death, he would be certainly here in time to lend his shoulder to the bier.

13-01-2021||New Delhi||Farmers’ stir gives vendors at Singhu border a chance to revive income||Before the coronavirus pandemic, Rakesh Arora used to be a vendor at the India Gate, but his business did not pick up after lockdown. Now, the farmers' stir at the Singhu border has given him a chance to improve livelihood, selling badges and stickers.With the protesting farmers staying put at the border point of the national capital for over six weeks now, a number of small businesses have sprung up at the site, the newest being sale of pro-protest badges and stickers.Shopkeepers with basketful of badges and stickers with 'I love Kheti (farming)', 'I love Kisan', and 'Kisan Ekta Zindabad' printed on them have seated themselves at every nook and corner of the highway. Almost every protester could be seen wearing a badge, while the tractors and trolleys flaunt the stickers.Arora and his nephew brought in inventory worth Rs 2,500 two days ago from Ambala and have managed to sell products worth Rs 700 so far."I used to be a vendor at India Gate. But after lockdown, business has been really poor. So we decided to set shop at the protest once we saw an opportunity," Arora said.Amaan, an electrician from Delhi's Okhla has also taken to selling these badges and stickers, owing to lack of work. Both badge and sticker are being sold at Rs 10."It doesn't yield much income, but something is better than nothing. Barely 15-20 people buy these each day," he said.Brothers Moin (17) and Nadeef (11), from Uttar Pradesh's Loni, have also ventured into this business. "We bring in 500 of these badges every day. We manage to sell some 300 of them," said Moin, who set up shop in Singhu a week back.Many shopkeepers at Singhu border are hoping to make most of the agitation, by earning whatever little they can. Many of these badges are sourced from Delhi's Sadar Bazaar market.Chandan Kumar, who has been running an electrical equipment shop at the Singhu border for over five years now, has pushed bulbs, switches and wires to the back and lined his shop with 'No Farmer, No Food' stickers and badges."The electrical business had completely taken a backseat. I realised that the farmers liked stickers about their agitation. So I started getting radium paper from Kashmere Gate market and printing the stickers myself," he said.Kumar said while it was not at all a close substitute for his earlier business, it did bring in some income.For over a month several farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are camping at the borders of Delhi to protest the three farms laws, which the NDA claims will reform the agri sector.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

What will a person like Pragya say? A terror accused will always eulogise terrorists. But then the Prime Minister will again say: Would not be able to forgive her.”Bora, the Assam Congress chief, said: “Godse was the first terrorist of independent India. Facts matter.”Thakur, a BJP MP from Bhopal, when questioned about Congress leader Digvijaya Singh’s remark that ‘Godse as the first terrorist of independent India’, said in Ujjain on Tuesday: “The Congress has always abused true patriots of the country. They have even coined the ‘saffron terror’ term. What more insensitivity does one need? I don’t have anything else to say.” However, she did not take the name of Godse.It is not the first time that Thakur has courted controversy. In the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, she had waded into controversy on a number of occasions.Prime Minister Narendra Modi was later quoted by the BJP on its Twitter handle on May 17, 2019: “Statements given by Pragya Thakur vis-a-vis Godse and Mahatma Gandhi are wrong.

13-01-2021||Washington||A strong India would act as 'counterbalance' to China, says declassified White House document||Asserting that India maintains the capacity to counter border provocations by China, the outgoing Trump administration in a declassified document has said that a strong India, in cooperation with like-minded countries, would act as a "counterbalance" to China in the strategic Indo-Pacific region.Running into 10 pages, the document was recently declassified in part by US National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien and now has been posted on the website of the White House.“India's preferred partner on security issues is the United States. The two cooperate to preserve maritime security and counter Chinese influence in South and Southeast Asia and other regions of mutual concern. India maintains the capacity to counter border provocations by China,” said the US Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific.India, it said, remains preeminent in South Asia and takes the leading role in maintaining Indian Ocean security, increases engagement with Southeast Asia, and expands its economic, defence and diplomatic cooperation with other US allies and partners in the region."A strong India, in cooperation with like-minded countries, would act as a counterbalance to China," the document said.The US and its partners on every continent are resistant to Chinese activities aimed at undermining their sovereignty, including through covert or coercive influence, it said.The policy framework said its objective is to accelerate India's rise and capacity to serve as a net provider of security and major defence partner; solidify an enduring strategic partnership with India underpinned by a strong Indian military able to effectively collaborate with the US and its partners in the region to address shared interests.The actions proposed by the framework include building a stronger foundation for defence cooperation and interoperability; expand defence trade and ability to transfer defence technology to enhance India's status as a major defence partner; increase cooperation on shared regional security concerns and encourage India's engagement beyond the Indian Ocean Region.It also seeks to support India's membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group and work with the country towards domestic economic reform and an increased leadership role in the East Asia Summit (EAS).The framework proposes to offer support to India - through diplomatic, military, and intelligence channels - to help address continental challenges such as the border dispute with China and access to water, including the Brahmaputra and other rivers facing diversion by China.Redacted in part, the Framework among the actions proposes to support India's ‘Act East Policy’ and its aspiration to be a leading global power, highlighting its compatibility with the US, Japanese, and Australian vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific; and build regional support for US-India Common Principles in the Indian Ocean, including unimpeded commerce, transparent infrastructure-debt practices, and peaceful resolution of territorial disputes.Beijing claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory. China has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. Beijing has impeded commercial activity like fishing or mineral exploration by countries like Vietnam and the Philippines, claiming that the ownership of territory belonged to China for hundreds of years.“Promote US-India energy cooperation across all sources and technologies to diversify India's energy sources and supplies. Partner with India on cyber and space security and maritime domain awareness. Expand US-India intelligence sharing and analytic exchanges...creating a more robust intelligence partnership,” said the document, classified by former Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger.Pottinger has recently resigned from his post over the Capitol Hill violence on January 6.The framework also seeks to work with India and Japan to help finance projects that enhance regional connectivity between India and countries of the region.The document said its objective is to prevent China's industrial policies and unfair trading practices from distorting global markets and harming US competitiveness. Actions recommended by it are to counter Chinese predatory economic practices that freeze out foreign competition, undermine US economic competitiveness, and abet the Chinese Communist Party's aspiration to dominate the 21st century economy.Another objective of the framework is to strengthen the capacity of emerging partners in South Asia, including the Maldives, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, to contribute to a free and open order.Actions recommended are to establish a new initiative with South Asian partners modelled on the Maritime Security Initiative in Southeast Asia to improve maritime domain awareness, interoperability, and data-sharing with the US.It supports creation of a maritime information "fusion centre” in the Indian Ocean; establish a regional forum to promote common principles and standards and establish and gain broad consensus on a statement of principles on acceptable maritime behaviour, to include a commitment to regional cooperation in line with shared security objectives.

13-01-2021||New Delhi||Telegram crosses 500 million subscriber mark led by user additions in Asia||Messaging service Telegram crossed 500-million subscriber mark globally and added 25 million new users in the last few days as it gained ground amid the controversy over WhatsApp's latest privacy policy update.While Telegram did not specify India-specific user numbers, it said 38 per cent of the new users are from Asia, followed by Europe (27 per cent), Latin America (21 per cent) and MENA (Middle East and North Africa at 8 per cent).In a statement, Telegram said it surpassed 500 million monthly active users in the first week of January, and "has continued to grow with 25 million new users joining Telegram in the last 72 hours alone".Reports citing Sensor Tower data indicated that Telegram had 1.5 million new downloads between January 6-10 in India.India is the world's second-largest telecom market and the biggest consumer of data. As on October 30, 2020, the total telephone connections stood at 117 crore, of which 115 crore were mobile connections.A report by Ericsson had stated that Indians used about 12 GB data per month on an average in 2019, the highest consumption globally, and this is expected to rise even further to about 25 GB (gigabytes) per month by 2025.In a recent blogpost, Telegram CEO and founder Pavel Durov said global user addition has seen a "significant increase" compared to last year when 1.5 million new users signed up every day, and that with its current growth rate, Telegram is on track to reach billions of users in the near future."We've had surges of downloads before, throughout our 7-year history of protecting user privacy. But this time is different. People no longer want to exchange their privacy for free services...With half a billion active users and accelerating growth, Telegram has become the largest refuge for those seeking a communication platform committed to privacy and security," he said.Durov added that the company takes this responsibility very seriously."Unlike other popular apps, Telegram doesn't have shareholders or advertisers to report to. We don't do deals with marketers, data miners or government agencies. Since the day we launched in August 2013 we haven't disclosed a single byte of our users' private data to third parties," he claimed.Apps like Telegram and Signal have seen massive surge in downloads and usage after WhatsApp updated its privacy policy that included a controversial change of linking data of WhatsApp users to Facebook's other products and services.WhatsApp had also stated that users will have to agree to the new terms and policy by February 8, 2021, in order to continue using the platform.This kickstarted a spate of conversations as well as memes on the internet over WhatsApp's alleged sharing of user information with Facebook.WhatsApp, on its part, has sought to assuage users' concerns, saying its latest policy update does not affect the privacy of messages on the platform.In a blogpost earlier this week, Facebook-owned WhatsApp emphasised that it does not share users' contact lists or data of groups with Facebook for advertisement purposes.The blogpost was followed by full-page ads in leading dailies in the country on Wednesday where it sought to clear the air over the changes that have been introduced as part of the latest update.WhatsApp, which has over 400 million users in India, counts the country among its biggest markets globally.Signal is also hoping to capitalise on the opportunities in India with its "simple and straightforward" terms of service and privacy policy. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telegram-crosses-500-million-subscriber-mark-led-by-user-additions-in-asia-197846

Therefore, the BMC once again took action of demolition on February 14, 2020," the affidavit said.It said Sood had no documents to even indicate that he or his wife Sonali Sood are the owners of the said building.The petition will be heard on Wednesday by Justice Prithviraj Chavan.The high court on Monday extended till Wednesday the civil court's order restraining the BMC from taking a coercive action against the alleged illegal construction.Sood in his plea had claimed that he had not carried out any illegal or unauthorised construction in the six-storey Shakti Sagar building."The petitioner (Sood) has not made any changes in the building that warrants permission from the BMC. Only those changes that are allowed under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act have been done," Sood's advocate Amogh Singh had argued.The petition had requested the court to quash and set aside the notice issued by the BMC in October, 2020, and also sought an interim relief to not take any coercive action against the actor.Sood, who is known for his roles in films like "Dabangg", "Jodha Akbar" and "Simmba", came into spotlight in 2020 for his philanthropy work in helping migrants reach their homes during the COVID-19 lockdown.

The two codes, which have been passed by Parliament, are on industrial relations, social security and occupational safety health & working conditions (OSH).While 10 unions, dominated by those leaning to the Left, boycotted the meeting in protest against the ministry’s alleged plan to hold it through video-conference, the BMS, TUCC and NFITU attended it.During discussions, the BMS opposed the proposal for lowering the cap on earned leave in the OSH draft rules.The rules proposed a cap of 240 days on earned leave, 90 days for journalists and 120 days for sales representatives. BMS leaders demanded raising the limit of earned leave to 300 days for all.“The proposal to lower the cap is a great loss for those who have sacrificed their right for leave and worked for their employers,” BMS national functionary Pawan Kumar said. The BMS’ other demands include increasing the eligibility criteria of EPF scheme from a monthly salary of Rs 15,000 to Rs 21,000 to make it on a par with the ESI scheme.“The rules should provide that ESI benefits continue to be provided to the employees even after crossing the Rs 21,000 salary cap,” the BMS said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trade-unions-divided-over-rules-framed-under-labour-codes-197515

If you want to agitate indefinitely, you can. Those genuinely interested in solving the problem... can go before committee. It will not punish... pass orders. SC BenchPANEL MEMBERSBhupinder Singh MannBKU national presidentAnil GhanwatShetkari Sanghatana presidentPramod Kumar JoshiDirector-South Asia, International Food Policy Research InstituteAshok GulatiAgricultural economistA Bench headed by CJI SA Bobde set up a four-member committee to hear various stakeholders on the three laws — Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance & Farm Services Act, Farmers’ Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act and Amendment to Essential Commodities Act — and report back to it.Those named committee members are Bhupinder Singh Mann, Bharatiya Kisan Union national president; Pramod Kumar Joshi, Director, South Asia International Food Policy; agricultural economist Ashok Gulati and Shetkari Sanghatana leader Anil Ghanwat.The panel will listen to the grievances of farmers on the laws and the views of the government and submit a report to the court containing its recommendations within two months from the date of its first sitting, which shall be held within 10 days. It posted the matter for hearing after eight weeks.“The constitution of a committee of experts… to negotiate between the farmers’ bodies and the government may create a congenial atmosphere... a stay on implementation of the three laws for the present may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith,” it said.While maintaining that it didn’t want to stifle a peaceful protest, the court said, “this extraordinary order of stay on implementation of the farm laws will be perceived as an achievement of the purpose of such protest at least for the present and will encourage the farmers bodies to convince their members to get back to their livelihood, both in order to protect their own lives and health and in order to protect the lives and properties of others.”To allay fear regarding minimum support price (MSP) being done away with and possibility of farmers losing their land, the court said, “The MSP system in existence before the enactment of the farm laws shall be maintained until further orders. In addition, the farmers’ land holdings shall be protected, i.e., no farmer shall be dispossessed or deprived of his title as a result of any action taken under the farm laws.”It said the representatives of all farmers’ bodies, whether they were holding a protest or not and whether they supported or opposed the laws shall participate in the deliberations of the committee and put forth their view.The Bench turned down farmers’ demand that the Prime Minister himself should approach them for negotiations, saying he was not a party to the proceedings.Earlier, Attorney General KK Venugopal opposed the stay, contending that “none of the petitioners who have attacked the farm laws have pointed out any single provision which is detrimental to the farmers and that the laws enacted by Parliament cannot be stayed by this court.” While appreciating Venugopal’s arguments, the Bench said, “This court cannot be said to be completely powerless to grant stay of any executive action under a statutory enactment” and went on to pass the stay order.Many senior lawyers, who appeared on behalf of the farmers on Monday, were conspicuous by the absence on Tuesday. Several lawyers, including senior counsel PS Narasimha, representing Hyderabad-based Consortium of Indian Farmers Association (CIFA), said their clients were in favour of the farm laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-puts-laws-on-hold-forms-4-member-panel-197499

Exhorting youngsters to join politics, the Prime Minister said till the time they came forward, the poison of dynasties would continue to weaken democracy.Narendra Modi, PMBe builders of India Political dynasties are raising the burden of non-performance on the country. Let your decisions be inspired by national good. Swami Vivekananda used to say the youth must become the builders of India. It’s your responsibility to lead the future and this responsibility stretches to the field of politics.  He was addressing the second National Youth Parliament virtually on the occasion of Swami Vivekenanda’s birth anniversary.Citing lessons from the life of Swami Vivekananda, the Prime Minister said dynastic politics was the source of social and political corruption, and the youth must lead the eradication of this “disease”.He said a new awakening in the country was witnessing people supporting honesty and performance with surnames no longer enough to win elections. “Days for those who won on surnames are over. You also need to show a strong CV now and public representatives have realised this,” the Prime Minister said, lamenting that there were still people whose goals were driven by the urge of preserving their family legacies for whom it’s “me and my family rather than nation first.”Hails Winners of ‘Vocal for Local’ debate “Political dynasties, like a new form of dictatorship, are raising the burden of non-performance on the country,” he said in the presence of Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla and ministers of education and youth Ramesh Pokhriyal and Kiren Rijiju.Noting that people who have a legacy of corruption now find corruption a burden, the Prime Minister said dynasts had a feeling that “if their past generations were not held accountable, they could also get away”.“They see such distorted examples in their own houses. That’s why such people have no respect for the law nor fear for it. The onus of changing this scenario is on the youth and the awakening of the country,” he said. The youth should participate in politics not with the intention to receive but with the intention to give. “Until youngsters enter politics, the poison of dynasties will continue to weaken our democracy. Youth participation in politics is critical to save democracy,” said. The PM said the youth have to make this century the century of India. “Let your decisions be inspired by national good.

The ninth round of talks was awaited and he hoped that an amicable solution through talks would be reached. “I am hopeful of a positive situation, but we are ready to meet any eventuality and all logistics like clothing and habitat (housing) have been taken care of. Our operational preparedness is of high order,” he added.His words come even as troops of India and China are locked in intense military standoff in Eastern Ladakh since April-May 2020.On being asked about mobilisation by China in the summer of 2020, he said it was nothing new, they came for usual training areas. “We were ready. They had the first mover advantage in May and we had the first mover advantage in August.” On Pakistan, he said it continued to embrace terrorism as a state policy. “We have zero tolerance to terror and reserve the right to respond at the place and time chosen by us.”The Army was in the middle of restructuring and transforming from manpower to technology intensive force. “We are looking at block chain, big data, artificial intelligence and quantum computing, and fully committed to various integrated commands. We will calibrate for smooth transition,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-pakistan-pose-potent-threat-says-army-chief-197513

13-01-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||‘US planned to assist India against China after Doklam’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 12In a classified document made public after just two years, the US said its Indo-Pacific strategy had a “particular focus” on India. The objective was to accelerate India’s rise by building stronger defence ties and also by offering diplomatic, military and intelligence support to help address continental challenges such as the border dispute with China.In other words, the US had taken a strategic decision to build an alliance with India against China in 2018, when the document was prepared. This happened a year after the India-China confrontation in Doklam and two years before both armies clashed violently in eastern Ladakh in mid-2020.The 10-page document, which explains the need to align US’ Indo-Pacific strategy with those of Australia, India and Japan, was released surprisingly early rather than after 30 years. Partly redacted, it sets out the Trump administration’s strategy for Indo-Pacific that was developed by the US National Security Council.The four members of the Quad – India, Australia, Japan and the US – had elevated their discussions to the level of Foreign Ministers in 2019, a year after the US had prepared the document followed by a second ministerial in Tokyo last year.The military part of the strategy sets out three aims – (i) deny China sustained air and sea dominance inside the first island chain in a conflict; (ii) defend the first-island-chain nations, including Taiwan; and (iii) dominate all domains outside the first-island-chain.The change of classification of the document in the last week of the Trump administration is a “gesture of reassurance to the United States alliance partners, including Australia, that we are not fading away but doubling down in the Indo-Pacific” and the language is likely to be seen to confirm to Beijing its claim that the US is seeking to contain China,” said reports quoting US sources.“It is highly classified, secret, not for release to foreign nationals, and I think it is a signal about the kind of continuity that the permanent government of America, if you like, the officials, want to see in America’s relations with the Indo-Pacific, including in managing Chinese power,” said Australian National University’s Rory Medcalf, a consistently strong proponent of the Quad since his days with the Lowey Institute.“This is very clear code for America holding its ground with Taiwan, with partners and allies in the South China Sea, with Japan, with Korea - really maintaining the integrity of those relationships and protecting them from Chinese assertiveness, from Chinese aggression,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-planned-to-assist-india-against-china-after-doklam-197463
13-01-2021||New Delhi||‘Khailstanis’ have infiltrated farmers' protest, Centre tells SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Centre to file an affidavit on its claim that some banned organisations including ‘Khalistanis’ have infiltrated the ongoing farmers protest against the new farm laws.Attorney General KK Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, said that ‘Khalistanis’ have infiltrated the protest and he will file an affidavit along with the necessary inputs of the Intelligence Bureau (IB).A Bench of Chief Justice Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, which was hearing a clutch of petitions against the farm laws and the ongoing farmers protest at borders of Delhi, asked Venugopal to file the affidavit by Wednesday.       The Bench, in its order, said, “Laudably, the farmers have so far carried on the agitation peacefully and without any untoward incident. But it was pointed out in the course of hearing that a few persons who are not farmers have also joined, with a view to show solidarity with the farmers”.It said that an apprehension was expressed that the possibility of some persons creating trouble cannot be entirely ruled out.“In fact, a specific averment is made in an intervention application filed by one Indian Kisan Union, in...that an organisation by name “Sikhs for Justice”, which is banned for anti-India secessionist movement is financing the agitation. This averment is supported by the learned Attorney General also,” it said.During the hearing, senior advocate P S Narasimha, appearing for intervenor ‘Indian Kisan Union’ supporting the new farm laws, alleged that some banned organisations have been fuelling the protests of farmers.These kinds of protests can be “dangerous” he said, adding that groups like “Sikhs for Justice” are involved in these agitations.The Bench told Venugopal that somebody has made an allegation here on record that there are some banned organisations which are helping the protest.“Will you confirm this or deny?” the Bench asked the AG.The Attorney General said, “We have said that ‘Khalistanis’ have infiltrated the farmers’ protest. We can file an affidavit by tomorrow, along with the report of the intelligence bureau.”      The top court stayed the implementation of controversial new farm laws till further orders and decided to set up a 4-member committee to resolve the impasse over them between the Centre and farmers’ unions protesting at Delhi borders.The top court stayed the implementation of the three laws—the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act—against which several petitions have been filed challenging their constitutional validity.The committee members named are: Bhupinder Singh Mann, President of Bhartiya Kisan Union; Anil Ghanwat, President of Shetkeri Sangthana, Maharashtra; Pramod Kumar Joshi, director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute, and agriculture economist Ashok Gulati.             On Monday, the apex court had pulled up the Centre for its handling of the farmers’ protest against the new farm laws saying it is “extremely disappointed” with the way negotiations between them were going and it will constitute a committee headed by a former Chief Justice of India to resolve the impasse.The eighth round of talks between the Centre and the farmer unions on January 7 headed nowhere as the Centre ruled out repealing the contentious laws, while the farmers’ leaders said they are ready to fight till death and their ‘ghar waapsi’ will happen only after ‘law waapsi’. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/khailstanis-have-infiltrated-farmers-protest-centre-tells-sc-197446
13-01-2021||---||Will not appear before SC-appointed panel; protest is for indefinite time: Farmer unions||New Delhi, January 12Stating that they will not appear before the Supreme Court-appointed committee, farmers’ unions have claimed that members of the said panel are pro-government.“Members of SC panel are not dependable as they have been writing on how agriculture laws are pro-farmer,” Farmer unions added.Supreme Court can repeal the farm laws suo motu, they told a press conference."We never demanded from SC to form a committee, the government is behind all this," said farmer leader Balbeer Singh Rajewal on the panel formed by court.“Our protest will continue and it is for indefinite time.” The tractor march in Delhi on January 26 will be peaceful, they added.“We will go in meeting with the Centre on January 15,” the unions said.Earlier, farmer leaders welcomed the Supreme Court's order to stay the implementation of three farm laws on Tuesday, but said they would not call off their protest until the legislations are repealed.The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of around 40 protesting farmer unions, has called a meeting later in the day to decide the next course of action.The farmer leaders said they are not willing to participate in any proceedings before a committee appointed by the Supreme Court, but a formal decision on this will be taken by the Morcha."We welcome the court's order to stay the implementation of the farm laws, but we want a complete repeal of these laws," Abhimanyu Kohar, a senior leader of the Morcha, told PTI.Also read: Supreme Court stays implementation of farm laws3 more protesting farmers die at Tikri borderFarmers' agitation has been fearless: Filmmaker Gurvinder SinghOpposition parties get behind farmers, want farm bills repealedAnother farmer leader, Harinder Lokhwal, said the protest would continue until the contentious farm laws are repealed.The Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the controversial farm laws till further orders on Tuesday and decided to set up a committee to resolve the impasse between the Centre and the farmers' unions protesting at Delhi's borders over the legislations.A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde said it would pass an order to this effect.The committee will look into the farmers' grievances against the three laws.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Haryana and Punjab, have been protesting at several border points of Delhi since November 28 last year, demanding a repeal of the three laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for their crops.In a statement, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee noted that the court was not inclined to pass any orders on the ongoing protests with regard to vacating farmers from the Delhi borders and welcomed the same.Suspending the implementation of the laws as an interim measure is welcome but is not a solution and the farmer unions have not been asking for this solution, given the fact that the implementation can be reinstated at any time. The government must withdraw. It must understand that farmers and people of India are opposed to the laws, it said in a statement.Farmer unions reiterate the fact that they will not participate in any court-ordered committee process further, one of their apprehensions about such a process got validated in the very constitution of the committee. It is clear that the court is being misguided by various forces even in its constitution of a committee. These are people who are known for their support to the three Acts and have actively advocated for the same. — With PTI inputs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-not-appear-before-sc-appointed-panel-protest-is-for-indefinite-time-farmer-unions-197417
13-01-2021||New Delhi||Policy update doesn’t affect privacy of messages: WhatsApp||WhatsApp on Tuesday has said its latest policy update does not affect the privacy of messages as the Facebook-owned company sought to address concerns around security of user data on the platform.In a blogpost, WhatsApp emphasised that it did not share the users’ contact lists or data of groups with Facebook for ads purposes, and that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook could read messages or hear calls between users on WhatsApp.Last week, WhatsApp had informed users of an update in its Terms of Service and privacy policy regarding how it processes user data and partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the social media giant’s products.It also stated that the users would have to agree to the new terms and policy by February 8, 2021, in order to continue using WhatsApp’s service.This kick-started a spate of conversations and memes on the internet over WhatsApp’s alleged sharing of user information with Facebook, and many users have started shifting to rival platforms such as Telegram and Signal.“We want to be clear that the policy update does not affect the privacy of your messages with friends or family in any way. Instead, this update includes changes related to messaging a business on WhatsApp, which is optional, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data,” WhatsApp said.It added: “WhatsApp accesses only the phone numbers from the address book (after getting user’s permission) to make messaging fast and reliable, and that it doesn’t share contact lists with the other apps Facebook offers.”“We use group membership to deliver messages, and to protect our service from spam and abuse. We don’t share this data with Facebook for ads purposes. Again, these private chats are end-to-end encrypted so we can’t see their content,” it noted.A report by internet security researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia had claimed that at least 1,700 private WhatsApp group links were visible on Google through a web search.WhatsApp noted that users could choose to set their messages to disappear from chats “for additional privacy”.The messaging giant, which has about 400 million users in India, said it would always be clear within the app when users are communicating with any business that uses its features designed for commercial entities.WhatsApp explained that some large businesses needed to use hosting services to manage their communication, and that it provided them the option to use secure hosting services from Facebook to manage WhatsApp chats with their customers, answer questions, and send information such as purchase receipts.“But whether you communicate with a business by phone, email, or WhatsApp, it (business) can see what you’re saying and may use that information for its own marketing purposes, which may include advertising on Facebook. To make sure you’re informed, we clearly label conversations with businesses that are choosing to use hosting services from Facebook,” WhatsApp added.WhatsApp said if users chose to interact with ‘Shops’ (Facebook branded commerce feature), their shopping activity could be used to personalise their ‘Shops’ experience and the ads the users saw on Facebook and Instagram.“Features like this are optional and when you use them, we will tell you in the app how your data is being shared with Facebook. If you have WhatsApp installed on your phone, you’ll have the option to message that business. Facebook may use the way you interact with these ads to personalise the ads you see on Facebook,” it added.Interestingly, a number of business leaders, including Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma and PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam, have spoken of moving to rival platforms.Mahindra said he had installed Signal while Nigam said he had moved 1,000-plus ‘PhonePe-rs’ to Signal, and recreated all his work groups and moved family groups.“...WhatsApp is by far and away the best product I’ve ever seen in the social/comm category. I trusted the WA founders. I loved the simplicity of their product. Never imagined switching to another chat app. C’est la vie,” Nigam tweeted.Sharma also advocated moving to Signal.“They say market has power. We are the largest market. Here in India WhatsApp/Facebook are abusing their monopoly & taking away millions of users’ privacy for granted. We should move on to @signalapp NOW. It is up to us to become victim or reject such moves,” he said in a tweet. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/policy-update-doesnt-affect-privacy-of-messages-whatsapp-197412

Days for those who used to win elections merely on surnames are over but this disease has not been completely eradicated. Even today, there are people whose thoughts and goals are driven by the urge to preserve their family legacies in politics,” said the Prime Minister in oblique references to political families in India.He said “dynastic politics, like a new form of dictatorship, was raising the burden of non performance on the country”.“Dynastic politics strengths the sense of ‘me and my family’, rather than putting the nation first. It is also a major source of social and political corruption in India. Political dynasts feel if their past generations were not held accountable for corruption, they, too, cannot be held accountable. They see such distorted examples in their own houses. The onus on changing this scenario is on the youth,” Modi reiterated.He said the youth should participate in politics not with the intention to receive but with the intention to do something.“Until the common Indian youth enter politics, the poison of dynasties will continue to weaken our democracy. Youth participation in politics is critical to save democracy,” the Prime Minster said, who hailed the finalists of the National Youth Parliament debate on “Vocal for Local”.The PM also said the youth had to make this century the century of India.“Let your decisions be inspired by national good. Swami Vivekananda used to say the youth must become the builders of India. It’s your responsibility to lead the future and this responsibility stretches to the field of politics because politics is a strong tool for transformation,” he said, adding that the old perception in which politics was synonymous with loot and corruption was changing.“Today, people have become so aware that they have thrown their weight behind honest people. They are giving opportunities to honest, dedicated and service-driven people. Honesty and performance has become the first mandatory condition for politics. The awareness in the country has created this pressure and corruption has become a burden on those whose legacy used to be corruption,” he stressed.The Prime Minister said public representatives had now realised that they would need a strong CV and an account of work accomplished to go into the next election.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dynastic-politics-biggest-enemy-of-democracy-modi-197402
13-01-2021||New Delhi||No reduction of troops on border with China, says Army chief||Hoping for an amicable solution from the military talks with China, Army chief Gen MM Naravane on Tuesday said the forces were alert and ready for any eventuality.Gen Naravane was addressing the annual press conference here ahead of the Army Day on January 15.The General said they are “ready to meet any challenge as the operational preparedness is of high order”, adding that “we will maintain our current positions and that were is no reduction of troops from either side along the Line of Actual Control (LAC)”.On the potential of the two-front war, the Army Chief said Pakistan and China form a potent collusive threat, and their alliance is part of our strategic calculus and planning.While making his opening remarks, the Army chief said the Army is alert all along the northern borders, not just in Ladakh.The ninth round of talks is awaited and he hoped to reach a solution.  “I am hopeful for a positive situation, but we are ready to meet any eventuality and all logistics like clothing and habitat (housing) have been taken care of. Our operational preparedness is of high order,” he added.His words come even as armies of India and China are locked in an intense military stand-off in eastern Ladakh since April-May, 2020.On being questioned about the mobilisation by China in summer of 2020, the Army chief said it was nothing new, they came for usual training in the areas, and that the Indian army is ready."They had the first mover advantage in May, and we had the first mover advantage in August," he added.On Pakistan, the Army chief said it continued to embrace terrorism as a state policy. "We have zero tolerance for terror, and we reserve the right to respond at the place and time of our choosing and with precision," he said."The Army is in the middle of restructuring and are transforming from manpower to technology-intensive force, and we are looking at blockchain, big data, artificial intelligence and quantum computing. We are fully committed to various integrated commands. We will calibrate for smooth transition,” he said.The Army chief said land surpluses like those from the soon-to-be closed military farms would be used to seek infrastructure of equal value.On a recent report on stress in the military, he said the report was not based on an adequate sample size.They had only 400 samples; to get 99 per cent accuracy, the sample size should have been 19,000. With small sample size, the report could not be seen an increased stress, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-reduction-of-troops-on-border-with-china-says-army-chief-197391
13-01-2021||Satya prakash||Supreme Court stays implementation of farm laws||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 12A day after pulling up the Centre for its poor handling of farmers’ agitation, the Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the implementation of the three farm laws being opposed by farmers who have blocked key entry points to Delhi since November 2020.A Bench headed by CJI SA Bobde set up a four-member committee to hear the various stakeholders’ views on the Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Act 2020, Farmers Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act & Amendment to Essential Commodities Act and report back to it.Those named as members of the committee are — National president of Bharatiya Kisan Union Bhupinder Singh Mann, Pramod Kumar Joshi (Director, South Asia international Food Policy), Agricultural Economist Ashok Gulati and Shetkari Sanghatana leader Anil Ghanwat.Also read: 3 more protesting farmers die at Tikri borderFarmer leaders welcome SC verdict, but say protest to continueFarmers' agitation has been fearless: Filmmaker Gurvinder SinghOpposition parties get behind farmers, want farm bills repealed"We are going to suspend the implementation of the three farm laws until further orders," the top court said while setting up the committee.The panel will listen to the grievances of farmers on the farm laws and the views of the Government and submit a report to the court containing its recommendations within two months from the date of its first sitting which shall be held within 10 days. It posted the matter for hearing after eight weeks.“We are of the view that the constitution of a committee of experts in the field of agriculture to negotiate between the farmers’ bodies and the Government of India may create a congenial atmosphere and improve the trust and confidence of the farmers. We are also of the view that a stay of implementation of all the three farm laws for the present, may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith,” it said.While maintaining that it didn’t want to stifle a peaceful protest, the court said, “…we think that this extraordinary order of stay of implementation of the farm laws will be perceived as an achievement of the purpose of such protest at least for the present and will encourage the farmers bodies to convince their members to get back to their livelihood, both in order to protect their own lives and health and in order to protect the lives and properties of others.”"We are looking to solve the problem. If you want to agitate indefinitely, you can. Every person who is genuinely interested in solving the problem is expected to go before the Committee. The Committee will not punish you or pass any orders. It will submit a report to us. We are going to take the opinion of the organisations. We are forming the Committee so that we have a clearer picture," the CJI said.To allay fear regarding Minimum Support Price (MSP) being done away with and possibility of farmers losing their land, the court said, “The Minimum Support Price System in existence before the enactment of the Farm Laws shall be maintained until further orders. In addition, the farmers’ land holdings shall be protected, i.e., no farmer shall be dispossessed or deprived of his title as a result of any action taken under the Farm Laws.”It said, “The representatives of all the farmers’ bodies, whether they are holding a protest or not and whether they support or oppose the laws shall participate in the deliberations of the Committee and put forth their view points,” the court said. “We are forming the Committee so that we have a clearer picture.”Many senior lawyers, who appeared on behalf of agitating farmers on Monday, were conspicuous by the absence on Tuesday."We cannot ask the Prime Minister... He is not a party here," the CJI said even as Government side told the court that the Agriculture Minister had been a part of the negotiations. “We are looking to solve the problem. If you want to agitate indefinitely, you can. Every person who is genuinely interested in solving the problem is expected to go before the Committee. The Committee will not punish you or pass any orders,” it clarified during the hearing.Several lawyers, including senior counsel PS Narasimha, representing Hyderabad-based Consortium of Indian Farmers Association (CIFA), said their clients were in favour of the farm laws.The Bench turned down farmers’ demand that the prime minister himself should approach them to hold negotiations, saying he was not a party to the proceedings.Earlier, Attorney General KK Venugopal opposed the stay, contending that “none of the petitioners who have attacked the farm laws have pointed out any single provision which is detrimental to the farmers and that the laws enacted by Parliament cannot be stayed by this Court, especially when there is a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of legislation.”While appreciating Venugopal’s arguments, the Bench said, “this Court cannot be said to be completely powerless to grant stay of any executive action under a statutory enactment” and went on to pass the stay order.Pulling up the government for poor handling of farmers’ agitation against farm laws, the Supreme Court had on Monday said it was “extremely disappointed” with the way the government is handling the issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-stays-implementation-of-farm-laws-197390
