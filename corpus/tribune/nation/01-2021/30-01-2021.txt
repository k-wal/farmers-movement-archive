30-01-2021||Kolkata/New Delhi||Rajib Banerjee, other former TMC leaders join BJP in Delhi||Former West Bengal minister Rajib Banerjee, who recently quit the Trinamool Congress, joined the BJP in the national capital on Saturday along with a few other leaders of the state’s ruling party after meeting senior BJP leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.Banerjee and MLAs Prabir Ghosal and Baishali Dalmiya, who was recently expelled from the TMC, and former Howrah Mayor Rathin Chakraborty, flew to the national capital on a special plane, and met central BJP leaders.“They have joined the BJP,” party general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya told PTI following the meeting.Former TMC MLA Parthasarathi Chattopadhyay and actor Rudranil Ghosh had also accompanied them on their visit to meet BJP leaders in the national capital.BJP national vice-president Mukul Roy and Vijayvargiya arrived in Delhi with them.The TMC, which has been facing dissent from a number of leaders ahead of the assembly election due in April-May, said that those who are leaving do not have long political history.Earlier in the day, Banerjee said he had a word with Union Home Minister Amit Shah who called him to the national capital.“After I resigned from the TMC, I received a call from the BJP leadership.... Amit Shah ji told me to come over to Delhi. He also requested me to pass on the information to five other important public figures who wanted to serve people in a better way to accompany me.“If I get an assurance on the state’s development, if I get an assurance that I can work for the betterment of people, I will join the BJP,” he told reporters at the Kolkata airport.When asked what role does he expect to play in the BJP, Banerjee said it is for the party to decide.“I want to work for the people. So whatever role is assigned to me, I will accept,” he said. Instead of mudslinging at each other, the Centre and the West Bengal government should work together for the people of the state.Actor Rudranil Ghosh, who has recently been voicing his discontent over the issue of governance in Bengal and alleged corruption in the distribution of monetary compensation to Cyclone Amphan-affected people last year, said he wants to work for people and play an important role in the state in future.Uttarpara MLA Prabir Ghosal, who recently alleged that repair of a road in his constituency was not being allowed by a faction of the party to harm his poll prospects, told reporters that he would join the BJP.According to BJP sources, these TMC leaders were supposed to join the saffron party during Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s rally at Dumurjula in Howrah on Sunday. However, Shah’s two-day visit to West Bengal was cancelled at the last minute.The ruling TMC in West Bengal was rocked by a fresh bout of desertions on Friday with Banerjee quitting the party and several other leaders rallying behind him.Reacting to the development, senior TMC MP and party spokesperson Sougata Ray said, “Those who left don’t have a long political history and most of them were inducted into the party by (Chief Minister and party supremo) Mamata Banerjee. In future, the TMC will be careful.”Another senior TMC leader and minister Subrata Mukherjee said, “What can we do if anyone wants to go? Ours is a big party. We cannot prevent dissenters by deploying military.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajib-banerjee-other-former-tmc-leaders-join-bjp-in-delhi-205577
30-01-2021||Madurai||BJP chief Nadda affirms party’s alliance with AIADMK for TN polls||Bharatiya Janata Party national president JP Nadda said on Saturday his party’s alliance with the AIADMK would continue for the assembly elections, due in Tamil Nadu in a few months.Both parties would face the polls together, he said, addressing a public meeting, his first in the run up to the Assembly elections expected in April or early May.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi facilitated projects like the defence corridor for Tamil Nadu while the state was ‘ignored’ during the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance regime.Praising Tamil as the world’s oldest language, Nadda, who is here on a one day visit, said when the right person assumed the right place, it led to right decisions.After Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed the top office, a ‘safe destiny’ was assured for the nation and Tamil Nadu as well, he said.Be it projects like the defence corridor or allocation of funds for Tamil Nadu, the situation changed only after the BJP came to power at the Centre, he said.Nadda recalled that Modi had quoted a couplet from ‘Tirukkural’ to soldiers at Ladakh and also cited the Prime Minister’s ‘Yaadum Oorey’ reference of Tamil poet Kaniyan Poongundranar in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly in 2019.Dwelling on Tamil, he said the Tamil people had a unique combination of entrepreneurship, economic and cultural ethos.The BJP top leader’s Tamil pitch assumes significance Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had some days back alleged that the saffron party had no respect for Tamil language and culture.Nadda praised Madurai as a ‘pious land,’ home of Goddess Meenakshi and recalled the link the temple city has with Mahatma Gandhi, who decided to use only dhoti during his visit here.BJP Tamil Nadu unit chief L Murugan said it was his party’s ‘Vetri Vel’ yatra that prompted DMK president M K Stalin to ‘hold a Vel’ days ago.‘Vel’ is the spear-like weapon of Lord Muruga and the saffron party had last year held a ‘Vel yatra’ in Tamil Nadu.Accusing the DMK of double standards, Murugan alleged that the then Chief Minister M Karunanidhi was a mute spectator when Tamils were killed in 2009 in the civil war in Sri Lanka.The party gave a standing ovation to Nadda for the AIIMS Hospital project for Madurai by the Centre.Earlier, when the BJP national chief arrived at the venue of the public meeting, he was greeted with slogans of ‘Vetri Vel, Veera Vel.”An ancient war cry, it denotes victory and valour with Lord Muruga’s ‘Vel.’Nadda, who arrived here last night, was accorded a warm welcome by party cadres.He visited the famous Meenakshi temple, garlanded a statue of freedom fighter Pasumpon Muthuramalinga Thevar and chaired a core committee meeting of the party.Tamil Nadu Ministers R B Udhayakumar and Sellur Raju called on Nadda, according to the party, which described it as a courtesy visit.The top leader in the core panel meet deliberated on constituencies in Tamil Nadu with winning chances and asked the state leadership to focus more on such segments.Nadda also addressed social media volunteers and interacted with noted personalities who joined the party recently.On Sunday, the BJP chief would visit Puducherry.Former public works minister and ex-Congress leader from the union territory, A Namasivayam joined the Saffron party days ago in Delhi. --- PTI  APRADMINISTRATOR01302110NNNN||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-chief-nadda-affirms-partys-alliance-with-aiadmk-for-tn-polls-205574
30-01-2021||---||Media bodies, Cong flay FIRs against journalists||New Delhi, January 30Media organisations on Saturday held a meeting to condemn the recent fling of FIRs under stringent sections including sedition against journalists and said even during the emergency Section 124 A was not invoked.The Editors Guild of India, the Press Club of India, the Indian Women’s Press Corps, the Delhi Union of Journalists and Indian Journalists Union attended the meeting and flayed the FIR against Rajdeep Sardesai, Mrinal Pande, Zafar Agha, Paresh Nath, Anant Nath, and Vinod K Jose at Noida’s Sector 20 police station.“Even during the Emergency, rules against journalists were not so harsh and I don’t recall anybody going in for sedition,” said PCI president Anand Sahay.Sahay also cited action against Siddique Kappan from Kerala, Kishore Chandra Wangkhem from Manipur, Dhaval Patel from Gujarat, Rahul Kulkarni from Maharashtra, and Vinod Dua.President of Editors Guild Seema Mustafa said the government’s action against journalists was an attempt to “intimidate and harass.”Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala in a statement said the Centre was hell-bent on brutally and blatantly silencing every contrarian or dissenting voice by hook or by crook. “The Centre seems to be exceeding the over reach of even the dacronian Press Act of 1910 and the Rowlatt Act of 1919. The FIR filed against senior Journalists and editors and a Congress MP is a clear cut instance of strangulating democracy by the BJP and its leaders.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/media-bodies-cong-flay-firs-against-journalists-205572
30-01-2021||New Delhi||ED arrests businessman in VVIP choppers money laundering case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has arrested businessman Anoop Kumar Gupta in connection with a money-laundering probe into the over Rs 3,600-crore VVIP choppers purchase scam case, official sources said on Saturday.They said Gupta, the joint managing director of KRBL Limited that sells India Gate basmati rice, has been sent to five-day custody of the central probe agency after he was produced before a special court for cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) here.ED sources said Gupta was arrested in the AgustaWestland VVIP choppers deal case and alleged he was not cooperating in the ongoing probe.His custodial interrogation was necessary in the light of some fresh evidence gathered by the Enforcement Directorate that pertains to "proceeds of crime" or alleged kickbacks of the deal being paid to a firm "controlled" by Gupta, they said.Gupta's lawyers told the court that his arrest was "not justified" and pleaded that he should not be sent to ED custody owing to his medical condition as he suffers from diabetes and other ailments.The agency, in its remand application, said two streams were used for channelling about Euro 70 million worth "proceeds of crime" or bribe money to various political persons, bureaucrats and Indian Air Force officials in return of swinging the 12 helicopters deal in favour of AgustaWestland."It is submitted that IDS Information Technology and Engineering Sarl,  Tunisia has received proceeds of crime to the tune of Euro 24.37 million from AgustaWestland and out of this about Euro 12.4 million were further transferred to Interstellar Technologies Limited, Mauritius." "The proceeds of crime were further transferred to various companies including Rawasi Al Khaleej General Trading (RAKGT) LLC Dubai which was incorporated in 2007 by KRBL DMCC, Dubai and accused Anoop Gupta was one of the director of this company," the ED alleged.  This company (KRBL DMCC) was a subsidiary of KRBL Limited (India), it said.The ED said that "in 2009, the entire stake (49 per cent shareholding) of KRBL DMCC held in RAKGT was transferred in the name of one Anurag Potdar but in fact, even after this, RAKGT is under the control of KRBL Limited through Gupta and part of the proceeds of crime received in RAKGT were transferred to KRBL Limited." It claimed that it obtained some documents in December last year pertaining to these purported links and they show that Gupta was "controlling" the financial transactions of this (RAKGT) company.  Gupta has been named by the ED in another alleged defence deal scam involving aircraft manufacturer Embraer.The businessman was named in a charge sheet by the agency in December in that case that pertains to payment of alleged commission by Embraer to clinch the USD 208-million deal with India, in which it is suspected and alleged that kickbacks were paid.The ED slapped money laundering charges to probe allegations of irregularities in the now-cancelled deal to purchase of 12 VVIP choppers from Italy-based Finmeccanica's British subsidiary AgustaWestland. The deal was scrapped by India in 2014. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-arrests-businessman-in-vvip-choppers-money-laundering-case-205571

30-01-2021||New Delhi||Delhi violence: Police receive 1,700 video clips, CCTV footage, examining dump data of phone calls||The Delhi Police have received 1,700 video clips and CCTV footage from public so far related to the violence during farmers’ Republic Day tractor rally and is taking help from forensic experts to analyse the material and identify the culprits, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) B K Singh said on Saturday.Singh said the Crime Branch, which is investigating the nine cases related to the violence, including at the Red Fort and ITO, is also examining dump data of mobile phone calls and registration numbers of tractors.He said a team from the National Forensic Sciences University has been called to analyse the video clips and CCTV footage related to the violence that left 394 police personnel injured and one protester dead.On Friday, the Delhi Police had issued an appeal in leading newspapers asking people to share any evidence or information about the violence.“After our appeal, Delhi Police has received 1,700 video clips and CCTV footage from public related to the violence that took place during the tractor parade on Republic Day. Through videos, we will identify culprits who indulged in the violence,” Singh told PTI.He said that investigators are also analysing footage and photos taken from drone-mounted cameras and carrying out 3D mapping of the area vandalised at the Red Fort.A team of forensic experts on Saturday visited the Red Fort to collect samples.Delhi witnessed violence during the January 26 tractor rally organised by protesting farmer unions to highlight their demand for repeal of the Centre’s three farm laws.Many of the protesters, driving tractors, reached the Red Fort while some of them hoisted religious flags on its domes and the flagstaff at the ramparts, where the national flag is unfurled by the prime minister on Independence Day.In its appeal, the Delhi Police said, “All members of the public, including mediapersons, who are witnesses to the incidents or have any information about the incident or have captured any activity on their mobile phones or camera, are hereby requested to come forward and give their statements/footage/picture in their possession at room number 215, second floor, Old Delhi Police Headquarters, ITO during office hours, on any working day or contact on 8750871237 or 011-23490094.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-violence-police-receive-1-700-video-clips-cctv-footage-examining-dump-data-of-phone-calls-205569
30-01-2021||New Delhi||Chirag gets invite for NDA meeting, he skips for ‘health reasons’ as JD(U) protests||The BJP had invited Lok Janshakti Party president Chirag Paswan to attend the NDA meeting on Saturday to discuss the ruling bloc’s agenda for the Budget session of Parliament, but the JD(U)’s protest to the move is likely to have prompted him to skip the event.LJP sources said Paswan did not attend the virtual meeting due to health reasons, and noted he had also skipped the all-party meet held earlier in the day.The invite to Paswan from Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi to the meeting of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies assumes significance as this made it clear that the LJP remains a member of the National Democratic Alliance despite walking out of the alliance in Bihar during the state assembly polls.JD(U) spokesperson K C Tyagi put on record his party’s stand against the LJP, telling PTI that it does not consider Paswan’s party a member of the NDA.“The LJP had worked against the NDA’s official candidates in the assembly elections. It did not work merely against the JD(U) but also against candidates of the BJP and two other allies—Vikassheel Insaan Party and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular). This caused a lot of harm to the NDA.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi had himself said (during the polls) the NDA in Bihar is working under Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s leadership and this includes VIP and HAM. Therefore, we do not consider the LJP a part of the NDA,” Tyagi said.Sources said the resentment within the NDA over the decision to invite Paswan to the meeting prompted its top leaders to dissuade him from attending the meeting.A JD(U) leader, who did not wish to be named, claimed that the invitation was “withdrawn” but there was no confirmation to this from the BJP, the principal NDA constituent.Former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM, which is close to the JD(U), condemned the decision to invite the LJP to the NDA meeting.“This is not appropriate at all. The LJP stabbed the NDA in the back during the polls. Manjhi Ji will now decide whether to continue to stay in the NDA,” party spokesperson Danish Rizwan said.The LJP had walked out of the NDA in Bihar last year due to its opposition to Nitish Kumar and contested the state assembly polls on its own. It put up candidates in all the seats where the JD(U) was in the fray while largely spared the BJP except for a few seats.Though the LJP could win only one seat in the Bihar polls, it inflicted serious damage on the JD(U), whose tally fell to 43 from 71, triggering a backlash from Kumar’s party, with some of its leaders questioning if Paswan could still be in the NDA at the Centre.A vocal supporter of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Paswan has maintained that he remains an ally of the BJP at the Centre.Senior leaders of the saffron party had also criticised him for fielding candidates against the JD(U) in the Bihar polls.The invite to Paswan for the NDA meeting indicates that the BJP, which has lost a few key allies, continues to see the LJP, which was founded by towering Dalit leader Ram Vilas Paswan, as a partner.

30-01-2021||New Delhi||Rakesh Tikait is the cynosure of many eyes – not just farmers||His tears exercised an emotive pull even he may not have envisaged, helping turn the tide for a movement that seemed to have lost both sheen and momentum after the violence on Republic Day. It was but a moment in time and Rakesh Tikait was the man in it.He was once a Delhi Police constable, tried his hand at electoral politics and been a farmer leader for years. But Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Tikait has broken out of the confines of western Uttar Pradesh to find a space in the national spotlight as arguably the most powerful farm leader of the day.The two-month farmer movement against the Centre’s three farm laws was till now dominated by protesters from the fields of Punjab and Haryana who set up camp at the Singhu and Tikri border points into the city. Now, the focus has shifted to Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border where farmers are gathering in thousands to boost the fight that seemed to have been weakening only two days ago.A day after the Republic Day violence in Delhi, when a section of farmers taking part in the tractor parade broke through barriers, clashed with police and stormed the Red Fort for a few hours, the farmer game it seemed to be over. Morale plummeted and many farmers returned home.On Wednesday night, the atmosphere was tense at Ghazipur. The Ghaziabad administration issued an “ultimatum” to the protesters occupying a stretch of the Delhi-Meerut expressway to vacate as the January 26 clashes painted a not-so-peaceful picture of the peasant community.And then came the Tikait moment. As security presence at the site escalated and fears grew that the protesters would be forcibly evicted, an emotional Tikait broke down while talking to reporters.“The protest won’t be called off. Farmers are being met with injustice,” he said and even threatened to end his life for the cause.The 51-year-old’s BKU leader’s call for continuing the protest against the government struck a deep emotional chord. Videos of his emotional outburst were circulated across multiple platforms.It led to his brother Naresh Tikait calling a ‘mahapanchayat’ at their home town in Muzaffarnagar on Friday where tens of thousands of farmers gathered to back the movement.The crowd at Ghazipur border that had reduced to 500 on Thursday night grew manifold over the next 12 hours, running into well over 5,000 in next 24 hours. The farmer movement was not just revived but further energised.Tikait, who has been part of a delegation talking with the Centre over the ongoing protest, is also one of the accused in the January 26 violence in Delhi that saw one farmer dying when his tractor overturned and hundreds of people, including police personnel, being injured.He has denied the allegations of conspiracy and demanded a judicial probe into the violence, blaming infiltrators in the tractors’ parade of the unrest.  To be named as an accused by the Delhi Police is perhaps strange for Tikait, who served as a head constable in the force but quit in 1992-93 when he had to deal with a farmers’ agitation led by his father, the legendary Mahendra Singh Tikait.Born on June 4, 1969, in Sisauli village of Muzaffarnagar district in western Uttar Pradesh, Rakesh Tikait joined BKU after quitting the Delhi Police and gained prominence as a farm leader after the death of his father to cancer in May 2011.Mahendra Tikait, who was hailed as “messiah” of farmers, had inherited the ‘Chaudhary’ title of the regional Baliyan khap (a social and administrative system in parts of north India) at the age of eight from his father. Going by the tradition of the khap, the title passed on to his elder son and Rakesh Tikait’s elder brother Naresh.But Rakesh Tikait, a BA graduate from the Meerut University, was designated national spokesperson of the BKU. He has two younger brothers—Surendra, who works as a manager in a sugar mill, and Narendra, engaged in agriculture.The father of three—two daughters and a son—has been at loggerheads with various governments on a range of farmers’ issues, including loan waivers, minimum support price (MSP), power tariff and land acquisition in states such as UP, Haryana Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh.He also tried his hand at elections but lost both times.In 2007, he contested the UP Assembly polls from Khatauli constituency in Muzaffarnagar as an independent candidate. In 2014, he fought the Lok Sabha election from Amroha district on a Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) ticket.It’s an affluent family.Ahead of the 2014 polls, Tikait had declared assets worth Rs 4.25 crore, including Rs 10 lakh cash, and liabilities of Rs 10.95 lakh with land worth over Rs 3 crore forming the biggest chunk of his assets.He also declared three criminal cases against him in the election affidavit. These cases were lodged in Meerut and Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, and Anuppur in Madhya Pradesh.The vocal farmer leader had to spend nights behind the bars for defying public servant’s orders during several of the protests that he has led in the past decade.Having dug in his heels along with his supporters at the Ghazipur border amid a deadlock with the Centre over the new farm laws, Tikait on Saturday was once again teary-eyed.But this time overwhelmed by emotion as villagers, including children, reached the protest site carrying water, homemade food and buttermilk, after he announced he would drink water only when farmers will bring it since the local administration had barred water tankers at the protest site.Rakesh Tikait is now the cynosure of many eyes—and it’s not just farmers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rakesh-tikait-is-the-cynosure-of-many-eyes-%E2%80%93-not-just-farmers-205562

30-01-2021||New Delhi||IIM-Lucknow to study CRPF jawans’ stress, find solutions for work-life balance||Experts from IIM Lucknow will undertake a study and find solutions to the occupational “stress and strain” suffered by CRPF personnel that leads to extreme instances like suicides and breakdown of family support system.CRPF Director General A P Maheshwari signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on the subject of “domestic empowerment” with Archana Shukla of the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Lucknow in the capital city of Uttar Pradesh on Saturday.Initially, a pilot project will be conducted by some chosen experts of the premiere management institute at Central Reserve Police Force locations in and around Lucknow and this is expected to be followed by a full-length research on the issue.“Consequent to the report on this pilot project, a strategy will be formulated for fine-tuning the broad framework, under which a full-fledged research will be conducted, to evaluate and assess the responses and, accordingly, propose, configure and facilitate the way forward,” a CRPF spokesperson said.The about 3.25 lakh personnel strong force is the mainstay for anti-Naxal, counter-insurgency and counter-terrorist operations apart from various law and order duties, and as per official estimates over 95 per cent of its strength remains on operational deployment at any given point of time.The force says these hard duties have led to consequent stress and strain among the personnel, which not only affects them but also their families.“It is the first-of-its-kind study by outside expert agency to study first-hand impact on soldiers and their families owing to prolonged deployment in high risk areas that are non-family stations and suggest further measures,” Maheshwari said on his official Twitter handle.The MoU underlines the necessity for having such an evidence-based study that, as per the DG, would lead to mental strengthening as well as domestic empowerment, besides other policy derivatives.“Ideally speaking, families of CRPF personnel should act as a safety valve, for release of pent-up emotions, and be a veritable pillar of support. Long separation from their respective families, due to families staying in their respective home towns further compounds the problem.“Even if some personnel are keeping their families at stations where they are posted, invariably separation still occurs due to the nature of duties, which involve frequent movements, deployment among others,” the statement in the MoU said.It adds that housing satisfaction in the force too is “not of the desired levels”.“The disappearance of the joint family system and nuclear families becoming the norm has further reduced the availability of alternate support systems.“Whereas, families of CRPF have similar lifestyle aspirations to those of civilians, the nature of unpredictable duties of CRPF and deployment are a stumbling block,” it said.This breakdown in the family support system, the MoU said, has got manifested, to an extent, in the rising number of suicides and fratricides.Shukla, as per the spokesperson, assured the force that the IIM team will strive to furnish meaningful recommendations after thorough research.

30-01-2021||New Delhi||Not surprised at ‘evil attack’ as we were on higher alert for few weeks: Israeli envoy||A day after a blast outside its Embassy here, Israel’s ambassador to India Ron Malka said there are enough reasons to believe it was a terrorist attack, but they are not surprised at the event as the alert level had been increased for the past few weeks following intelligence inputs.In an interview with PTI, he also said the investigations will look into all possible angles, including whether there are any links to the 2012 attack on Israeli diplomats here while events around the world are also being examined to find any related operations or activities at any destination.“These attacks by those seeking destablisation in the (West Asia) region cannot stop us or scare us. Our peace efforts will continue uninterrupted,” he said when asked whether the attack was aimed at derailing Israel’s peace efforts with various Arab countries.He said Israeli authorities and the embassy are providing all assistance and every information to Indian authorities probing the attack.A low-intensity improvised explosive device(IED) went off near the Israeli Embassy in the heart of Delhi on Friday evening but no one was injured.Some cars were damaged in the blast that occurred about 150 metres away from the Embassy in Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road in the very high-security Lutyens’ bungalow zone.An envelope addressed to the Israeli Embassy and containing a note, purportedly linking the blast to Iran, was also found at the site of the blast.Initial investigations revealed that the IED was planted in a flower pot on the median near Jindal House on A P J Abdul Kalam road outside the Israeli embassy.The blast took place when President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were present a few kilometres away at the Beating Retreat ceremony.Besides, it coincided with the day when India and Israel marked the completion of the 29th anniversary of the establishment of their diplomatic relations.Asked whether Israeli agencies will join the probe, Malka said a kind of cooperation and collaboration is taking place, but the probe is mostly being done by Indian authorities as it happened on Indian soil.“But of course, whatever assistance we can provide, whatever we can share, we will do that,” he said.On the envelope recovered from the site hinting at a possible Iranian link, Malka said, “You need to understand that the investigation is still in early stages, so it is not appropriate to talk about anything that might harm the investigation.”        He said it won’t be fair for him to talk about any specific detail regarding the investigation or other inputs relating to the probe.“But what I can tell you is that we are collecting all the information and putting all pieces of evidence together and building the puzzle. Eventually, I think we will understand it all and the picture will be clear, and we will get to know who is behind this evil attack,” the Israeli envoy said.On whether the embassy has provided its own CCTV footage to the probe team, Malka said, “We are collecting any evidence, any piece of information that can be useful. Whether there are eyewitnesses, CCTV as you mentioned, whatever we can gather, any piece of information, we are collecting everything that can shed more light on what happened. We are making all the efforts.”  Official police sources said investigators probing the blast have not come across “anything concrete” yet as most of the CCTV cameras near the site of the explosion were “non-functional” at the time of the incident.An investigation team of Delhi Police’s Special Cell had earlier in the day visited the site to collect more evidence, sources said, adding that it managed to get access to footage from some of the CCTV cameras in the area.One CCTV footage showed a vehicle moving suspiciously near the embassy just before the explosion.Asked about reports an entity called ‘Jaish ul Hind’ claiming responsibility and whether the attack was aimed at derailing Israel’s peace efforts with various Arab countries in recent months, Malka said, “Our assumption as of now is that we have enough reasons to believe that this was a terrorist attack targetted at Israeli Embassy in New Delhi.”         He said all possible angles on who could be behind the attack are open.“For example, you have to take into consideration that yesterday, exactly when this evil attack was conducted, we celebrated the 29th anniversary of the establishment of full diplomatic relations with India. It has been 29 fruitful and rewarding years of collaboration,” he said.The Israeli envoy said the attack happened on the day when they were celebrating the rapidly growing relations with India.“Is it a coincidence or is it not? Who knows that, but of course this is an option being probed. Also, we are examining events and incidents around the world at some destinations whether there was some kind of operations elsewhere also targetted at Israel. All of that is being looked into,” he said.Malka said that there was “a high alert for a few weeks” and therefore they are not surprised.Diplomats and Israeli representatives around the world are targets of our enemies. So we always have our precautions and take necessary steps based on our own guidelines and the security procedures that we follow. This time we had increased the level of alert, so we were very much prepared and secure and protected,” he added.On whether there could be any link to the 2012 attack on Israeli diplomats in Delhi, he said that the line of investigation is also being examined to ascertain whether there is any pattern, any connection or any dots are there to be connected.“Yes, I am sure this (angle) is also being investigated. But as I said this is still an early stage of investigation, and therefore we need to be careful, and we will keep all the options open until we know for sure that we can cancel any option, or we can focus more on one of them. But it is still too early for that,” he said.In February 2012, a motorcycle rider had attached an explosive device to the back door of the diplomat’s car from behind. One embassy staff member, a local employee and two passers-by had got injured in that attack.At almost the same time, a bomb was also found beneath an Israeli diplomat’s car in Georgia and was defused.Asked whether Israel will continue with its peace efforts with the Arab world despite such attacks, he said, “Surely, we will. The history shows that this kind of events not only fails to stop us, they strengthen us, and we will be growing more rapidly.”      “We will continue thriving and forging new ties and advancing peace and stability in the region. So of course, all our achievements are for more stability, more collaboration, more friendships. We are not afraid of those who want destabilisation.“We understand that our enemies want destabilisation but they are not going to stop us or scare us. We are going to continue, as we have done till now,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-surprised-at-evil-attack-as-we-were-on-higher-alert-for-few-weeks-israeli-envoy-205547
30-01-2021||New Delhi||AAP leader Sanjay Singh moves SC for quashing of FIRs lodged against him in UP||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh has moved the Supreme Court seeking quashing of multiple FIRs lodged against him in various districts of Uttar Pradesh after his press conference in August, last year saying they have been “maliciously instituted to unleash political vendetta”.In a separate petition, Singh has also challenged the Allahabad High Court order of January 21, by which it had refused to quash the FIR lodged in Lucknow after the August 12, 2020, press conference.                 Singh said he had conducted a press conference at Lucknow of Uttar Pradesh on August 12, last year wherein he had alleged that the state government was favouring one particular caste over the others.“In the said press conference, the petitioner had merely raised certain social issues, namely neglect and apathy of the government towards a certain class of society,” he said in his writ petition filed through advocate Sumeer Sodhi.Both the petitions will be taken up for hearing by a bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan on February 2.Senior advocate Vivek Tankha is likely to appear for Singh in the matter.The AAP leader said after the press conference, multiple FIRs were registered against him at the instance of the BJP’s members in various police stations in different districts of Uttar Pradesh.Singh said the writ petition has been filed by him for direction to quash the FIRs registered against him, as these FIRs are “manifestly attended with malafides and have been maliciously instituted to unleash political vendetta against the petitioner and to harass him”.                    “The said FIRs have been filed against the petitioner out of the malice and sheer political vendetta with intent to coerce, harass and intimidate the petitioner as a part of larger ploy to muzzle the opposition leaders, from speaking up against the government of Uttar Pradesh,” Singh’s application said.     The Rajya Sabha MP further claimed that the content of the said FIRs are verbatim similar and have been filed across several districts across a length of more than 700 kilometres of the state on the same day within a span of a few hours. He said he is aware of eight FIRs filed in eight districts including at Lucknow, Sant Kabir Nagar, Khiri, Bagpat, Muzaffarnagar, Basti and at Aligarh.“The petitioner submits that the identical FIRs have been filed across several districts across the entire length of the State of Uttar Pradesh pointing very clearly to the fact that FIRs are only aimed at harassing the petitioner and his political associates,” he said.Singh contended that the said FIRs are a threat to the petitioner’s exercise of the right to free speech, right to assemble peacefully; right to move freely throughout the territory of India which are guaranteed under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution.      “The press conference was an exercise through which the petitioner was raising pertinent social and political issues, and the said FIRs have been filed with the sole intention to stifle the voice of opposition which is fundamental to a functional democracy,” he added. He said the FIRs filed against him are “frivolous, baseless, vexatious and are figments of imagination of the complainant and the police department”.“It is pertinent to mention that there has not been even a single incident of violence or disharmony as a result of the statements made by the petitioner in the press conference” and the said multiple FIRs are in teeth of the settled law enunciated by the top court in various verdicts, where it has been held that there can be no second FIR with respect to same offence.                    Singh said free and fair elections are a part of the basic structure of the Constitution and any attempt to prevent the opposition from taking part in campaigning or raising pertinent political and social issues is an assault on the basic structure of the Constitution. He alleged that FIRs have been registered against him on the directions of the Officer of Additional Chief Secretary (Home) to the Station in-charge of the several police stations as per the information and genuine belief of the petitioner.“The state machinery in complete derogation of their duties and responsibilities conferred upon it by law have been involved in mounting undue pressure upon the petitioner by threatening to take coercive action against the petitioner in order to make him succumb to their unbridled envy,” Singh added.He said the sole aim of the state machinery is to prevent the petitioner from campaigning in Uttar Pradesh and from carrying out political activities there in the run up to the elections in 2022.“In light of the aforesaid, the petitioner prays that the aforesaid FIRs registered against him be quashed as they are nothing but an abuse of process aimed at stifling the voice of opposition in a democracy and the petitioner’s fundamental rights,” he said.Alternatively, he also sought transfer of the FIRs lodged in connection with the press conference of August 12, 2020, and related political activities of the petitioner outside of Uttar Pradesh. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aap-leader-sanjay-singh-moves-sc-for-quashing-of-firs-lodged-against-him-in-up-205546

Arif received it two days back.The order stated that Arif was a threat to the peace of the city and his presence posed a danger to its peace-loving residents.Arif has had more than half a dozen cases registered against him during the two months of anti-CAA protest on the campus in December 2019 and January 2020.After he was served the order, Arif told mediapersons that all the cases against him pertained to protests on the campus. He said all citizens whether farmers, trade union members or students have a right to peaceful protest.“The externment order was yet another attempt to muzzle freedom of expression,” he said, adding he would move court against the order.AMU spokesperson Kidwai said the student had been named by the police for the violent incidents which took place on the night of December 15, 2019. He said that the university had not separately filed any complaint against the student.Violent protests had broken out against the CAA on the campus on December 15 in which over 70 people, including students, AMU security staff and police personnel were injured. The university had to announce an extended winter break following the clashes.

We started shouting from behind our doors but failed to scare him away,” Urmila, a woman from Chaupata village, said.Some people, who were coming to Pithoragarh from Muwani on Friday night, also claimed that they saw the suspected killer leopard and made a short video clip of the animal.“We spotted the leopard in the Mela Pani area and made a one-minute video clip of the animal. It appeared to be heading towards Rin village, but disappeared from the scene after some time,” Bhupendra Singh said.When contacted, Sub-Divisional Forest Officer (SDFO) NC Pant said a hunter has already been deputed in the area to kill the leopard.

The atmosphere of fear is like poison for democracy,” Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi. “The BJP government has torn to shreds the dignity of democracy by FIRs against senior journalists and public representatives,” she said.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and six journalists have been booked by the Noida Police for sedition, among other charges, over the violence during the farmers’ tractor rally in Delhi, officials said on Thursday.The journalists named in the FIR are Mrinal Pande, Rajdeep Sardesai, Vinod Jose, Zafar Agha, Paresh Nath and Anant Nath.

30-01-2021||New Delhi||Violence on Republic Day scripted by BJP to discredit farmers’ movement: AAP||The AAP on Saturday claimed that the violence that took place during the tractor parade on January 26 was scripted by the BJP with the help of Delhi Police to “defame and discredit” the farmers’ movement.Addressing a press conference, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj called BJP leaders the “greatest anti-nationals” and demanded that cases of sedition must be filed against them and probed by the NIA.An immediate reaction was not available from the BJP.“Police and BJP together scripted the violence of January 26 and the days after. This script was prepared by the BJP with the help of Delhi Police to defame and discredit the farmers’ movement,” the AAP leader claimed.He said on January 26, BJP agent Deep Sidhu was allowed by the Delhi police to start his march to enter Delhi much before the farmers.“On BJP’s instructions, the Delhi police allowed this person to reach and vandalise the Red Fort. The BJP and the Delhi police also allowed this person to hoist a flag of Nishan Sahib at the Red Fort and to create a ruckus,” Bhardwaj claimed.Tens of thousands of farmers broke barriers to storm the national capital on Tuesday, their tractor parade to highlight their demands dissolving into unprecedented scenes of anarchy as they fought with police, overturned vehicles and delivered a national insult hoisting a religious flag from the ramparts of the Red Fort, a privilege reserved for India’s tricolour.The AAP leader claimed that “BJP goons” on Saturday attacked the farmers at Singhu and Tikri borders and were not local residents.“To push their divisive agenda, the BJP set up this script. Immediately after the event, if you see the chronology, you will understand how the events unfolded.          “Suddenly some people arrive and talk about some Panchayat where a decision was taken to push these protestors out of the borders. I am from Delhi, but I have not heard about any such panchayat from the local people who want the farmers to leave the borders,” he said.He said,”Yesterday these so-called local people reached the Singhu and Tikri border and assaulted the farmers. The police have barricaded these borders. Despite that how can these people reach the protest venue?” Bhardwaj added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/violence-on-republic-day-scripted-by-bjp-to-discredit-farmers-movement-aap-205539

30-01-2021||Patna||Grand Alliance in Bihar forms human chains against new farm laws||Supporters of the opposition Grand Alliance in Bihar on Saturday formed human chains across the state as an expression of solidarity with the farmers who have been agitating in the national capital seeking the repeal of the contentious farm laws.Leader of the opposition Tejashwi Yadav took part in the demonstration in front of the Buddha Smriti Park here, a stone’s throw from the Patna Junction, where he was joined by alliance partners, most notably party emblem waving workers from the Left who have been enthused since the CPI (ML), the CPI and the CPI (M) showed signs of recovery in the recently held assembly polls.The opposition leaders stood at their designated spots for close to 30 minutes, beginning half past noon. Many of them held hands, but many others chose to simply stand with a safe distance from each other in view of the physical distancing norms in force because of COVID-19.The RJD leader bristled when asked about Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s remark suggesting that the opposition seemed to have taken a leaf out of his book.When approached by journalists with questions about the “manav shrinkhla”, Kumar had replied with a broad grin “we had organised human chains in 2017 in support of prohibition and against dowry and child marriage the following year. Last year, a human chain held to spread awareness about climate change in addition to the issues we had previously raised broke all records”.“It is nice that others are also drawing inspiration.Everybody has the right to hold such programmes,” he had said with a smirk.Yadav responded with distaste “it is a petty remark.Is he the first person to have ever held a human chain? He should instead make his stand clear on the new farm laws”.RJD national spokesperson Manoj Jha, who stood nearby, said, “The human chains sponsored by the chief minister depended upon the bureaucracy for its success. Officials concerned were given targets of turnouts to achieve. What is happening here today is spontaneous.”Notably, the RJD had taken part in the 2017 human chain while it shared power with Kumar. Its jailed supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav, who was then out on bail, had famously stood at Gandhi Maidan to demonstrate his support for a liquor ban.Jha, who is a member of the Rajya Sabha, also described the Centre’s talks with agitating farmers as “a monologue, instead of a dialogue, a reason why Delhi’s borders at Singhu and Ghazipur have been on fire”.Prominent among those who took part in the human chain at the state capital were CPI(ML) secretary general Dipankar Bhattacharya and Congress legislature party leader Ajeet Sharma.The human chain was also formed in districts. In Nawada, local Congress MLA Neetu Singh was among those who participated in the demonstration. In Begusarai, Congress, RJD and Left workers stood in front of the district headquarters and other places.No untoward incident was reported from anywhere so far though the officials said the human chain was held without permission.Leaders of the ruling NDA in the state came out with statements claiming that the human chain was a “flop”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/grand-alliance-in-bihar-forms-human-chains-against-new-farm-laws-205530

30-01-2021||New Delhi||R-Day violence: Team of forensic experts visits Red Fort to collect evidence||A team of forensic experts on Saturday visited the Red Fort to collect evidence in connection with the violence that broke out at the iconic monument on Republic Day.Thousands of protesting farmers had breached the monument on January 26 after deviating from their tractor rally route triggering a conflict with the police.The Crime Branch of Delhi Police is investigating the matter and several teams have been formed to identify the culprits.The force has termed the vandalisation at the fort as an “anti-national act”.“A team of forensic experts visited Red Fort, and it is collecting evidence,” an official said.The protesting farmers had clashed with police during the tractor parade called by farmer unions to highlight their demand for repeal of the Centre’s three farm laws.Around 50 police personnel were injured.Many of the protesters, driving tractors, reached the Red Fort while some of them hoisted religious flags on its domes and the flagstaff at the ramparts, where the national flag is unfurled by the prime minister on Independence Day.On Friday, the Delhi Police had issued an appeal in leading newspapers asking people to share any evidence or information about the violence.“All members of the public, including media persons, who are witnesses to the incidents or have any information about the incident or have captured any activity on their mobile phones or camera, are hereby requested to come forward and give their statements/footage/picture in their possession at room number 215, second floor, Old Delhi Police Headquarters, ITO during office hours, on any working day or contact on 8750871237 or 011-23490094 or send e-mail on kisanandolanriots.26jain2021@gmmail.com,” the appeal stated. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/r-day-violence-team-of-forensic-experts-visits-red-fort-to-collect-evidence-205513

Anybody who shares the ideology of the BKU and Rakesh Tikait are welcome here. But it is our appeal to those who do not wish to support the movement till the end that please do not come only to leave in between,” he said.Asked about estimated crowd size at the site, the farmer leader from western Uttar Pradesh said: “Farmers are coming in to show solidarity and leaving. It is not a stagnant crowd.”On Saturday night, the BKU office-bearers had estimated a crowd of around 10,000 people at Ghazipur while the Ghaziabad police officials pegged it around 5,000 to 6,000.Heavy security deployment, including personnel of the Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC), the Rapid Action Force (RAF) in anti-riot gears and civil police, was made at the protest site.Meanwhile, the Delhi Traffic Police said to and fro movement on the National Highway 24 (Delhi-Meerut Expressway) has been closed.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, demanding a rollback of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price (MSP) system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring better opportunities to farmers and introduce new technologies in agriculture.

30-01-2021||New Delhi||Supervision of private healthcare sector to be considered: Eco Survey||The Economic Survey 2020-21 has called for enhancing government spending on health from the current 1 per cent to 2.5 to 3 percent of GDP saying the shift would decrease out of pocket expenditures from 65 percent to 30 percent of the overall healthcare spend.In another radical suggestion the Survey bats for the regulation of private healthcare sector noting that an unregulated market was leading to suboptimal outcomes for patients who often don’t know anything about the quality of the service they are buying.Citing a series of global examples from the UK, US, Australia where federal governments has passed legislations to create government or quasi government bodies to regulate the health sector, the Survey said: “A sectoral regulator to undertake regulation and supervision of the healthcare sector must be considered given the market failures stemming from information asymmetry; WHO also highlights the growing importance of the same. The mitigation of information asymmetry would also help lower insurance premiums, enable the offering of better products and help increase the insurance penetration in the country.”The Survey suggests the UK’s Quality and Outcomes Framework introduced by the National Health Service in 2004 as an example of quality assessment practices worth emulating.“In addition to providing healthcare services and financing healthcare, a key role for the government is to actively shape the structure of the healthcare market,” said the survey encouraging regulation of private general practitioners as in the UK which pays doctors to perform well.Private sector dominates in total healthcare provision in India.Around 74 per cent of outpatient care and 65 per cent of hospitalisations is provided through the private sector in urban India—an unregulated sector with no guarantee of standard quality care to patients.It also warns the government against overinvestment in communicable diseases with the mind on the pandemic advocating a balance between addressing communicable and non-communicable diseases burden.COVID-19 may not repeat in an identical fashion in the future, the survey suggests.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supervision-of-private-healthcare-sector-to-be-considered-eco-survey-205504

The response drew on epidemiological and economic research, especially those pertaining to the Spanish Flu, which highlighted that an early, intense lockdown provided a win-win strategy to save lives,” said the Survey.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-telangana-and-andhra-pradesh-saved-most-lives-in-covid-economic-survey-205502

In the CCTV footage, the accused is seen taking the girl with him. The family of the victim knew a relative of the accused, although indirectly,” she said.On December 3, a case had been registered at Tarapur police station under IPC section 363 (kidnapping) and sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act based on a complaint filed by the victim’s mother, police said.“As the accused did not use any kind of devices, like a mobile phone, only human intelligence was used and several police teams were formed and sent across parts of Gujarat to trace the girl,” she said.According to police, after rescuing the girl, it was found that the accused had beaten her up and shaved her head.“The accused was constantly on the move after kidnapping her, and finally ended up in Morbi where he handed her over to a woman living in a slum near a factory from where she was rescued,” the DySP said.Police said they are waiting for the medical reports to ascertain if the minor was also sexually assaulted.The girl was brought back to Anand, where she underwent a surgery for her head injuries and was admitted to a hospital for two days, Pandya said.“We got her medically examined for the second time post-counselling as she is in trauma,” she said.According to the official, the entire cost of her medical treatment was borne by the police as she belonged to a poor family of labourers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-6-year-old-girl-rescued-nearly-two-months-after-abduction-205497

Besides, the langar service by the farmers also resumed.Farmers had been staging dharna at the toll plaza to make it free for commuters since December 25, but after the tractor parade turned violent, the administration got the site vacated and appealed to the religious organisations not to continue the langar service, which was suspended on Wednesday.On Thursday, the farmers again started dharna at the toll plaza. On Friday, the deployment of heavy police personnel led to anger among farmers.After several rounds of meetings with farmers, the district administration allowed a small group of farmers to stage the dharna. “We have allowed the dharna by 25 farmers. The langar service will be only for the farmers who will sit on dharna,” said Deputy Commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav.SP Ganga Ram Punia said security forces had been deployed to ensure smooth flow of traffic.Meanwhile, Jagdeep Singh Aulakh, member, BKU (Charuni) core committee, said earlier also the dharna was peaceful and it would remain peaceful in future too.Abhay criticises BJP for playing ‘divisive’ politicsINLD leader Abhay Chautala reached the toll plaza on Saturday and addressed the farmers. He blamed the ruling BJP for “dividing society” by resorting to “cheap tactics”.“The BJP is trying to spoil the spirit of brotherhood, but now the people have understood the tactics of the ruling party and will not allow it to do this,” said Chautala. He asked the government not to create hurdles for the farmers and accept their demands. “I am going to Ghazipur and will assure the farmers that we are with them,” he added.While going to Ghazipur with a large number of party workers, he demanded that the government bring a law on MSP and repeal the three laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/smooth-traffic-movement-on-nh-44-farmers-stage-dharna-at-bastara-toll-plaza-205488

This is true more of the 32 Punjab unions which have been very rigid about political entries into farmers agitation.Also read: ‘Mahapanchayat’ at Baghpat: How BJP leadership miscalculation strengthened farmers’ agitation, Jat bonding in UP, HaryanaBKU digs its heels in at Ghazipur border, more supporters pouring inBajwa, however, told The Tribune today that he did not visit Ghazipur as a political leader.“When I saw tears in the eyes of Rakesh Tikait, I felt it was my duty as the son of the soil and as the son of a farmer to go and stand with Tikait. I also feel that now is the time for political parties and leaders to intervene, play a constructive role and help resolve the ongoing stalemate in national interest.”Bajwa was welcomed on the stage by BKU faction at Ghazipur but he chose not at address the crowd and just register his presence for moral reasons more than political.“We are with the farmers and we want the matter to end amicably so that the situation doesn’t further deteriorate. Disruptive forces are waiting in the wings to take mileage,” said Bajwa.Asked if he would visit other borders where farmers are agitating, Bajwa said he had received calls from some leaders and would go and meet them in the near future.“Farmer leaders have been asking me to visit for a ground assessment of the situation. I do plan to visit other borders as well,” said the former Punjab Congress chief and Rajya Sabha MP from Punjab.Bajwa was the first Congress leader to initiate the anti farm law debate in the Rajya Sabha last September and had said his party would not sign on the death warrants of farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/partap-bajwa-deepender-hooda-welcomed-on-tikaits-protest-site-stage-205484

30-01-2021||New Delhi||Vacancy, inadequate infrastructure in consumer fora deprive citizens of grievance redressal: SC||Consumer rights are “important rights” and non-manning of posts and inadequate infrastructure in district and state consumer commissions across the country would deprive the citizens of redressal of their grievances, the Supreme Court has said.The apex court said this while hearing a plea that has raised the issue of alleged inaction by governments in appointing the president, members and staff in the district and state consumer disputes redressal commissions and the lack of adequate infrastructure to run these fora.A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy said the issue raised in the plea is important but the petitioner, a law student, has filed a “very sketchy petition” and it does not show proper groundwork. “We have given a thought to the matter and consider it too important an issue to be thrown out because of the laxity in collection of material and placing the same before us and thus, consider it appropriate that the same should be converted into a suo motu proceeding to enquire into the issue placed before us,” the bench said.The top court appointed senior advocate Gopal Shankaranarayan and lawyer Aaditya Narain as amicus curiae to assist it in the matter. “We expect them to obtain the requisite material, analyse the same and facilitate the data to be placed before us and thus, consider it appropriate to issue notices to all the respondents before us, who would be able to show as to how many posts are occupied, how many are vacant and what is the nature of infrastructure which has been made available as consumer rights are important rights and non-manning of posts and inadequate infrastructure would deprive citizens of a redressal of the grievances,” the bench said in its order passed earlier this week.The apex court has posted the matter for hearing on February 22.The plea filed before the top court has sought directions to the Centre, states and Union territories to fill up the vacant posts of presidents and members in the consumer commissions, saying the “inaction” in making the appointments is causing pendency of cases and has led to violation of the right to a speedy disposal of cases.The petition, while alleging that directions passed by various high courts regarding filling up of vacancies in district and state consumer commissions have been “ignored” by the authorities concerned, has said there is a lack of proper infrastructure to run these commissions smoothly.It has also sought a direction to the authorities concerned to provide proper infrastructure and staff to the consumer commissions and file a detailed report regarding this before the top court. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vacancy-inadequate-infrastructure-in-consumer-fora-deprive-citizens-of-grievance-redressal-sc-205479
30-01-2021||New Delhi||India must ensure economic security for people with leprosy, says WHO goodwill ambassador||India needs to take special measures to ensure economic security for people with leprosy as situations like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic have jolted the ostracised community, making them rely merely on handouts to survive, WHO goodwill ambassador against the disease Yohei Sasakawa has said.Like always, people with leprosy had been ignored during these trying times and not many had come forward to check on their well-being, said Sasakawa, who was awarded the Gandhi Peace Prize in 2019 for his fight against leprosy, especially in India.“People affected by leprosy in India and many other countries are often economically vulnerable. Many are increasingly in need after having lost their source of income because of lockdowns or restrictions on movement associated with the spread of coronavirus. India needs to take special measures to deal with this,” Sasakawa told PTI.Stating that India may have intensified its vigil against leprosy but its efforts to trace cases in the hinterland, particularly people in the mountain areas, were not sufficient. Sasakawa has rhetorically stressed that the government should bring leprosy-affected people into the mainstream and get them treated.“It is important to do more to raise social awareness so that everyone, whether they live in hard-to-reach areas or are not part of mainstream society, have access to diagnosis and proper treatment,” he said.Saturday is World Leprosy Day.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), India has the highest number of new cases of leprosy in the world annually, followed by Brazil and Indonesia.India reported 1,35,485 new cases in 2016, which is 63 per cent of the 2,14,783 new cases reported globally.India officially eliminated leprosy, an infectious disease caused by mycobacterium leprae, in 2005 by bringing the prevalence rate below 1/10,000 at the national level.However, it has not been able to eradicate the disease despite having it as a national target.According to the WHO, eradication refers to complete and permanent world-wide reduction to zero new cases of the disease through deliberate efforts.Elimination requires continuous efforts to prevent re-establishment of disease transmission.New cases have been reported from several parts of India, especially the rural belts of Bihar, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar Haveli. All cases were attributed to late diagnosis.According to Sasakawa, leprosy was for a long time treated as a special disease, with diagnosis and treatment taking place at specialised hospitals and this contributed to discrimination.Discrimination was usual for them; situation got tough when they were not heeded during the problematic situations such as coronavirus pandemic, he said.“Lack of people’s willingness to give them employment during normal time gets worse when people from such community do not even receive any help from the government during pandemic type situation,” he added.His Nippon Foundation has been providing emergency assistance to organisations of persons affected by leprosy in 18 countries, including India, to improve their situation.“Our sister organisation in India, Sasakawa-India Leprosy Foundation (S-ILF), is actively raising funds to provide emergency assistance such as food and daily necessities to residents of leprosy colonies and ameliorate the impact of the coronavirus,” Sasakawa said.“S-ILF also recognises the importance of education to empowering persons affected by leprosy and is operating online classes to keep up the academic abilities of students whose schools have been closed because of lockdowns,” he said.The Nippon Foundation in collaboration with the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has also prepared a flip chart that will help ASHA workers in the country to navigate and help disseminate correct knowledge about leprosy to households.“By 2022, the flip chart will have been distributed to ASHA workers in six endemic states: Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand. Since the flip chart uses a lot of drawings and photos, and is designed in a way that anyone can understand, we hope it will prove effective and lead to early detection in as many cases as possible,” Sasakawa said.Sasakawa has helped establish the Association of People effected by Leprosy and led several advocacy programmes in India.His latest initiative is raising pension for those living with severe disabilities and working for improving their living environment.“Until 15 years ago, the major focus was eradication of leprosy. But now another problem has come up and it is the stigmatisation of leprosy patients even after they get cured. Many in the society are not ready to accept them,” Sasakawa said.The 82-year-old social entrepreneur said it was important for India to focus more on leprosy eradication programmes.The government initiated the leprosy control programme in 1955 which was revised as National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP) in 1983.

30-01-2021||United Nations||Terming children foreign terrorist fighters may lead to stigmatisation, dehumanisation: India at UN||India has said the use of the term foreign terrorist fighters for children may lead to stigmatisation and dehumanisation, underlining the need for nations to develop tailored and conflict-sensitive approaches to ensure repatriation, rehabilitation and reintegration of teenagers affected by armed conflicts.India's Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador K Nagaraj Naidu said at the UN Security Council Open Arria Formula meeting on 'Children and Armed Conflict' organised by Russia that the Resolution 2178 (2014) of the Council defines who foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) are."There is a general tendency to extend the term to their families. Using the term FTFs for children may lead to stigmatisation and dehumanisation," he said.The resolution condemns the violent extremism, which can be conducive to terrorism, sectarian violence, and the commission of terrorist acts by foreign terrorist fighters, and demands that all foreign terrorist fighters disarm and cease all terrorist acts and participation in armed conflict.Naidu underlined that the treatment of children affected by the FTF phenomenon should be based on respect, protection, and fulfillment of their rights as defined by the international human rights law, in particular the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the international humanitarian law, as applied locally by relevant national laws.He told the meeting that India recognises the "urgent need" for member states to develop tailored, context- and conflict-sensitive approaches to ensure prosecution, repatriation, rehabilitation, and reintegration of children of FTFs.Noting that there are multiple challenges, he said prosecution of FTFs introduces the challenge of collecting, handling, preservation and sharing of relevant information and evidence obtained from conflict zones, in accordance with domestic law and member states' obligations under international law."The situation is further complicated as many children do not have legal documentation. There may also be situations where a particular member state may not have a de-radicalisation or re-integration policy in place,” he said.Naidu added that while some member states have begun repatriating children of foreign terrorist fighters, the pace has been slow."It is thus evident that circumstances of the situation will determine whether the children of FTFs can be taken back or not, given national legislation and/or absence of clear evidence for their claim,” he said.Given the complexity of the situation, he said, India is supportive of any UN-led effort aimed at identifying solutions informed by an understanding of the rights and interests of the children of FTFs and implemented in a manner that is consistent with human rights, humanitarian law, and respective national laws.Naidu highlighted the recent trend in global terrorism wherein growing number of children are recruited and involved in terrorism-related activities.“For terror groups, children are most susceptible to manipulation, whether as active participants in terror or as human shields to protect the perpetrators of terror,” he said.“Used as guards, spies, cooks, suicide bombers or human shields, these terror groups understand that children cannot fully grasp the inherent danger of combat, have an underdeveloped sense of right and wrong, and less likely to have divided loyalties,” he said.

People climbed atop bridges, trucks, tractors, trolleys and trees to take in some of the action. The day witnessed thousands of tractors taking part in the march sheeted in Tri-colours in what has to be the biggest-ever show of farm diversity in the country’s history. It wasn’t until they came into an internet zone that they realised something had gone amiss in Delhi even as tractors marched peacefully in front of their eyes at Singhu and Tikri.Elderly men recalled protests during the British era saying they had never seen anything like this before in their lifetime. Women congregated by the roads cheering on the moving cavalcades. Meanwhile, huge clumps of police and paramilitary forces lined the borders to hold the march.Many considered the parade a wedding between Delhi and Punjab, of Indian national pride and tribute to freedom struggle martyrs, which were the reigning themes of decked up tractors. Elderly men dressed as grooms (with sehras tied on their heads as well as tractors), Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, Sukhdev and Udham Singh’s photos enveloped the vehicles. Some even spent lakhs on tractors and were rueful of the fact that their hard work never made it to TV due to the pictures of violence ruling the discourse for the day.— Aparna Banerji||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/the-glorious-side-of-tractor-marches-205322

But, it did not want the border issue to be linked with bilateral relations.‘Hope we properly manage differences’Jaishankar stressed the importance of India-China relations. It shows that the Indian side attaches importance to ties with China. We hope the Indian side will work with us to manage differences - Zhao Lijian, China’s Foreign Ministry SpokesmanJaishankar’s stress on the significance of China-India relations “showcases the importance the Indian side attaches to its ties with China,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said today.“This is also an important lesson learnt through the two countries’ efforts over the past decades to keep our ties moving forward. We hope the Indian side will work with us to properly manage differences, promote practical cooperation, and get the bilateral relations back on the right track,” he added.The question was put by China Radio International, a state-owned media outlet.The reply indicates a gulf in the approaches of the two sides. Most of Jaishankar’s eight propositions revolved around the border issue. India has accused China of violating several boundary agreements which maintained peace and tranquillity along the undefined Line of Actual Control for 27 years. China says India has linked the situation on the border with economic measures and banning investments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/appreciate-eams-suggestions-to-mend-sino-india-ties-china-205330

We are with you. If the PM thinks the farmers’ will go back, he is mistaken. He must resolve the matter and the only way to do so is to throw the farm laws in a waste paper basket, failing which this agitation will spread to cities, villages and across segments.”Rahul called the government’s attempt to get the protest sites vacated as “criminal.” Refusing to comment on the farmers’ role in the Republic Day violence, he asked, “Who allowed 50 protesters to storm the Red Fort?”Earlier in the day, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal arranged water supply to the Ghazipur protest site where BKU leader Rakesh Tikait is on a dharna.Akali Dal chief Sukhbir Badal too announced support for the agitating farmers as did former Uttar Pradesh Chief Ministers Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati of the BSP.Meanwhile, the BJP accused Rahul of “inciting violence” after he warned the Narendra Modi government that if farmers’ protest was not defused, the agitation would spread throughout the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-yield-were-with-you-rahul-to-farmers-205331

30-01-2021||Chandigarh||Farmers’ agitation: SAD asks party workers to rush to protest sites at Delhi borders||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Friday asked its party cadre to rush to the three farmers’ protest sites on Delhi borders in large numbers to give a further boost to the ongoing agitation.SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal also spoke to farmer leader Rakesh Tikait and discussed ways to shore up more strength and support for the farmers’ agitation in Delhi, especially in view of the “combined onslaught against farmers by the BJP and the Centre”, a party statement said.Consequent upon the telephonic conversation with Tikait, Badal instructed the Akali cadre to rush to Delhi borders in larger numbers than before and lend strength to the peaceful movement, it added.While many Akali contingents have already joined the farmers in the gathering, more are on the way in large numbers, Badal said.Senior SAD leader Bikram Singh Majithia also appealed to SAD and Youth Akali Dal (YAD) workers who had returned to Punjab during the past one week to go back to the protest sites at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur, the statement said.It said Badal on Friday sent an Akali delegation comprising senior leader Balwinder Singh Bhunder, SAD Delhi president Harmit Singh Kalka and the DSGMC chief Manjindner Singh Sirsa to the site of the farmers dharna led by Tikait.The leaders had extensive talks with Tikait and discussed ways to lend more strength to the agitation, it added.The delegation assured Tikait of “whole-hearted support in terms of men, material and morale” to the farmers’ cause, the statement said.Majitha said more partymen need to be at protest sites when the government wants to crush the agitation.“I know a large number of you have been camping on the Delhi borders since the last two months. However, the central government is making attempts to crush the ‘kisan andolan’ (agitation) in league with the BJP government in Haryana,” he said.“We must ensure this nefarious design to silence the voice of the ‘annadaata’ and disrespect the sacrifice of eighty martyrs (farmers) does not succeed at any cost. No sacrifice is too big to ensure a win for the peasantry as well as ensuring peace and communal harmony,” the statement quoted Majitha as saying.The SAD leader also condemned the “crude attempts” being made to suppress the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s new farm laws “by letting loose lumpen elements on peacefully agitating farmers at Ghazipur on Thursday during the course of which farmer leader Rakesh Takait was targeted”.“Similar attempts were made at Singhu border on Friday,” he alleged.Majithia said such scenes were “extremely unfortunate” in a democracy.“Coercive steps like cutting off water and power supply to the dharna sites and stopping food from reaching them would only strengthen the kisan andolan even further.”              He said it was also condemnable that the “central government was instigating communities to fight against each other and also fomenting fights between farmers as well as farmer organisations”.He appealed to farmers, farm labourers and people to maintain peace and communal harmony “despite grave provocations”.Majithia also denounced the manner in which the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) was being “misused” against farmer leaders and journalists.He said the UAPA had been framed against those challenging the unity and integrity of India and should not be used to persecute innocent people.“Doing so amounts to dictatorial conduct,” Majithia added.Farmers should not be singled out for fighting for the repeal of the three agricultural laws as well as the implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report in letter and spirit.Majithia, whose party had snapped ties with the NDA over farm laws issue, said the central government had not taken any action against those indulged in wrongful acts on Republic Day in Delhi “which has sent a clear message to the people that state agencies were behind them.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-agitation-sad-asks-party-workers-to-rush-to-protest-sites-at-delhi-borders-205133
