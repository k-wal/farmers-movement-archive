18-01-2021||Lucknow||Tandav controversy: Case registered in UP against director, Amazon India head of content||An FIR has been lodged here against the makers of web series ‘Tandav’ and Amazon’s India head of original content for allegedly depicting Hindu gods in a manner hurtful to religious sentiments of the people.The FIR against Aparna Purohit, the Amazon India’s head of original content, director of the series Ali Abbas, producer Himanshu Krishna Mehra, writer Gaurav Solanki, and an unknown person was lodged late on Sunday night by senior Sub Inspector Amar Nath Yadav at the Hazratganj Kotwali police station here.The film starring Saif Ali Khan, Dimple Kapadia, Sunil Grover, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Dino Morea, Kumud Mishra, Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub, Gauhar Khan and Kritika Kamra, premiered on the streaming platform on Friday.Taking to Twitter, BSP president Mayawati called for removing the objectionable content from the web series.“Protests are being registered against some scenes hurting the religious and ethnic sentiments in the Tandav web series, in respect of which it would be appropriate to remove whatever is objectionable so that the atmosphere of peace, harmony and mutual brotherhood in the country is not spoiled anywhere,” she said.According to the FIR, following public outrage expressed on social media platforms, the web series was viewed and it was found in the 17th minute of the first episode of the series that Hindu gods and goddesses have been allegedly presented in an “undignified manner” and shown using language which is hurtful to religious sentiments.      Dialogues in the web series can incite caste anger, the FIR stated.It also alleged that the person occupying the high post of Prime Minister of India has been portrayed in a very belittling manner besides there are scenes in which castes have been presented as low and high and women in an insulting manner.The FIR further alleged that intent of the web series is to incite religious sentiments of a particular community and create enmity among classes. This act of the producer-director has hurt and incited religious and caste sentiments of the people, the FIR added.The FIR has been lodged under Sections 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language), 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class), 505 (1) (B) (statements conducing to public mischief with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquility) and 469 (forgery for purpose of harming reputation) along with sections of the IT Act.Taking cognizance of complaints that Hindu gods and goddesses have been ridiculed in the web series, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting had on Sunday sought an explanation from streaming platform Amazon Prime Video on the issue, sources had said.The development came after BJP MP Manoj Kotak on Sunday said he has written to Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar seeking a ban on Amazon Prime Video’s series ‘Tandav’ for ridiculing Hindu deities.“The ministry has taken cognizance of the matter (complaints) and asked Amazon Prime Video to explain,” a source in the ministry had said.Kotak, the MP from Mumbai North-East, said different organisations and individuals have complained that Hindu gods and goddesses have been ridiculed in the ‘Tandav’ web series.When contacted about the complaints, Amazon Prime Video PR had said the platform “won’t be responding” on the matter.The government recently brought OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ Hotstar, besides other online news and current affairs content, under the ambit of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, giving it powers to regulate policies and rules for the digital space. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tandav-controversy-case-registered-in-up-against-director-amazon-india-head-of-content-200100

The new laws will increase their income multifold. The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of around 40 farm unions, made the announcement on the eve of a hearing in the Supreme Court on the Delhi Police’s petition to stop the tractor rally even as the government reiterated it was “ready for anything but repeal” of the laws.Addressing the media at Singhu border, union leaders, including Darshan Pal, Shiv Kumar Kakka, Hanan Mollah and Jagjeet Singh Dallewal, said their protest would be peaceful and all the farmers would carry on their tractors would be the Tricolour.Read also:“As farmers’ sons (soldiers) observe Republic Day in uniform on the border, the protesting peasants will hit the Outer Ring Road in Delhi on tractors. But there will be no disruption of the Republic Day parade,” said a leader. The tractor parade, they said, would cover a 50-km distance, touching Peeragarhi, Janakapuri, Dhaula Kuan, Munerka, IIT, Khelgaon, Chirag Delhi, Burari, Rohini, Majnu Ka Tilla.Darshan Pal alleged that the NIA was filing cases against those who were part of the agitation or supporting it. “All farm unions condemn this,” Pal said, referring to the NIA summons reportedly issued to a union leader in a case related to the banned Sikhs for Justice outfit.The government today reiterated its stand saying “anything but repeal” of the laws was acceptable and the unions should come forward for a clause-by-clause discussion on the legislations in the next round of talks on January 19.“Now that the Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of the laws and formed a four-member committee, there is no question of being stubborn,” said Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar.The committee, whose member Bhupinder Singh Mann (Bhartiya Kisan Union president) had backed out, is scheduled to hold its first meeting on January 19 at Pusa campus in Delhi, its member Anil Ghanwat said.The Supreme Court may take into account the matter of Mann’s recusal on Monday when it is scheduled to hear the pleas relating to the controversial laws and the farmers’ protests.Ghanwat said the committee had received the terms of reference and would begin its work from January 21.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-sc-hearing-farmer-unions-out-with-tractor-parade-plan-199929

In a July 2017 conversation, Arnab displays advance knowledge of Cabinet formation when he tells Dasgupta of the future developments at the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.“Venkaiah probable Vice-President,” Arnab says, with the then BARC boss asking who the next I&B Minister would be. Arnab discloses the name of Smriti Irani and says he’s happy at her elevation and that he was worried about “J” (Prakash Javadekar) coming in. The same day BJP parliamentary board picks Naidu as the party’s vice presidential candidate. Internal security matters were also reportedly known to Arnab in advance as is evident from an August 2019 chat where Dasgupta asks Arnab if Article 370 would be scrapped in J&K. Arnab answers in the affirmative.Arnab’s links with the top BJP brass are also reflected in another chat where he says the “PM is being handled differently” after Dasgupta asks him about progress in handling the TRP scam.The Congress, meanwhile, demanded a parliamentary probe saying: “The development impacted the national security.” Ex-Home Minister P Chidambaram asked: “Did a journalist (and his friend) know about the retaliatory strike in Balakot in advance? If yes, what is the guarantee that their ‘source’ did not share the information with spies working for Pakistan?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-ministers-with-us-arnab-goswami-flaunts-links-in-leaked-chats-199963

Three days later, IAF jets indeed struck at Balakot. A day later Dasgupta asked Arnab if this was the “big one he was referring to”.This chat and on many other matters of national security are part of the chargesheet filed by the Mumbai Police in the TRP scam case.Arnab’s alleged knowledge about the air strike indicates leakage of highly classified information, including military operations. And why did Arnab, who may have gotten a tip-off as a journalist, share this information with Dasgupta over WhatsApp?Dasgupta was not connected to news operations, but was heading the BARC, which was supposed to check which channel was getting more viewers.Similarly, just before the abrogation of Article 370 to strip Jammu and Kashmir of its special status, Arnab claimed on August 2, 2019 – again three days prior to the event — “have set platinum standards in breaking and this story is ours”. He was responding to Dasgupta who had sent him a newsflash on (Republic TV), saying: “Government of India to make Jammu separate state, Kashmir and Ladakh as Union Territories.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/had-prior-info-on-balakot-air-strike-199964

The project will cost Rs 45,696 crore.At present, only 50 per cent of the jet is made in India, while the engine and the latest radar — called AESA — come from the US and Israel, respectively.Currently, the aircraft has around 344 systems fitted in it and 210 systems are indigenous and 134 of them are imported, said a senior functionary.By the time, the first aircraft gets produced by HAL, it is targeted that the imported systems will be reduced to approximately 80. Tejas is expected to be the backbone of the IAF fighter fleet in years to come and is slated to be produced in high numbers.
