SKM is not associated with this activity in any way. Realising this, he assured the committee that in future, while the ongoing farmers’ agitation is underway, he will not attend any political party meeting,” it said, adding that the committee “welcomed his statement and decided to end the controversy here”.However, the SKM had said earlier in the day that it “has formed a committee that will inquire into the matter and give its report in three days’ time. SKM will take further steps thereafter”.          In the late-evening statement, the morcha said, “The juncture at which this current unprecedented farmers’ movement is, unity and discipline are of highest priority.... Any organisation and party is free to extend its support; however, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha and the movement will not have any direct engagement with any political party.”              On his meeting with opposition leaders, Chaduni told reporters near Delhi’s Singhu border on Monday that he wanted to let the country know where all these parties “stand on farm laws—whether they are against these or in favour”.At the same time, he added that he will abide by whatever the morcha decides.Replying to a question, he also said that his organisation had never invited any politician to share stage or address the people during the ongoing agitation against the Centre’s new farm laws.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at various border points of Delhi for over 50 days now demanding repeal of the three laws—the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act.Enacted in September 2020, the Central government has presented these laws as major farm reforms aimed at increasing farmers’ income, but the protesting farmers have raised concerns that these legislations would weaken the minimum support price (MSP) and “mandi” systems and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.The government has maintained that these apprehensions are misplaced and has ruled out a repeal of the laws.Multiple rounds of talks between the government and the protesting unions have failed to resolve the impasse on the matter. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-stir-joint-forum-distances-itself-from-its-leader-chadunis-meeting-with-oppn-parties-200240
18-01-2021||Noida (UP)||Farmers not against any party but Centre’s policy: Rakesh Tikait||The farmers’ fight is not with any political party but with the policy of the government, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Rakesh Tikait said here on Monday, warning the ongoing protest over the farm laws could prolong further.Tikait, who has participated in the multiple rounds of dialogues between farmers unions and the government representatives in Delhi over the past 54 days, was in Noida where he addressed protesters belonging to the BKU’s faction Lok Shakti.“Our fight is not with any party but the government. Here (in the protest) also we have people who support the BJP and will vote for them in the next election. But any party or ideology is not our concern. We are against the policy of the government,” he said, addressing hundreds, including women and youth, at the Dalit Prerna Sthal.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should also reach out to the farmers, but only after the government has accepted their demands on the three new farm laws and legalisation of the minimum support price (MSP) on crops.“The prime minister should come amidst farmers and the government the day our demands are met and the issue is resolved. We will thank him and treat him with respect that day. We also don’t want him to come between us until then,” Tikait said.He also stressed that the discussions between representatives of farmers and the government should be televised for greater transparency and wider reach among people.Tikait, who is leading his BKU supporters at the Ghazipur border in Ghaziabad, had reached the Dalit Prerna Sthal in Noida around 2 pm along with his union’s Uttar Pradesh unit spokesperson Pawan Khatana and other leaders.They met BKU (Lok Shakti) chief Sheoraj Singh and his supporters, who are camping at the Dalit Prerna Sthal since December 2, and participated in a human chain at the spot to symbolise the unity among various factions of protestors, BKU (Lok Shakti) spokesperson Shailesh Kumar Giri said.Exhorting the protestors to keep their spirits high, Tikait said, “They (the government) can accept our demands today, tomorrow or in six months or by 2024 because the farmers are not going back until then.”           “There are various banners and flags being raised at different protest sites. But banners and flags are not relevant anymore because this movement is driven by farmers belonging to villages,” he added.The influential peasants’ leader also called on the protestors to carry out the agitation responsibly and peacefully.“We must respect the land wherever we are whether our farms or a protest site. The protest should be peaceful and no property should be damaged,” he said.Thousands of protesting farmers are currently staying put at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh demanding rollback of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.The protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that these laws would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-not-against-any-party-but-centres-policy-rakesh-tikait-200233
18-01-2021||---||Tomar urges unions to reconsider the decision on tractor march||New Delhi, January 18Two days before his scheduled meeting with unions, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar again hailed various “pro-farmer/pro-agriculture” steps, including the three farm laws, taken by Narendra Modi government.He said the reforms will go a long way in improving living standard of farmers and the agriculture sector.The scheduled meeting between farmer leaders and union ministers has been postponed to January 20.Earlier the meeting was to be held on Tuesday, January 19.Urging unions to reconsider their decision to hold a tractor march on January 26, Tomar said farmers “should not do anything that may affect the ‘garima’ (dignity) of the country on the Republic Day”.Ahead of the tenth round of talks on January 20, he again urged protesting farm leaders to come for a clause by clause discussion in the laws.While farmers’ unions and the government continue to stand firm on respective stance regarding the three farm laws, in the last meeting they had reaffirmed commitment to continue with the direct dialogue process.The talks are expected to also touch the issue related to the minimum support price as was indicated by some union leaders after the last meeting. The unions are again expected to raise the issue related to the "Home Ministry and state police repression on people associated as well as not associated with the ongoing movement, including NIA raids”.Earlier, addressing a conference, Tomar said “the three laws enacted by the government will free farmers from all unnecessary legal bindings and help them get maximum value for their produce. Farmers will be attracted toward planting high value crops. Whenever any reform is introduced, impediments are bound to come in the way”. He also said the farm laws have been introduced after long deliberations with experts and stakeholders. “These reforms were long overdue. But previous government could not muster courage to introduce these laws. Our government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought revolution in agriculture sector,” he said.Dispelling rumours that MSP will be withdrawn, he said rather the BJP-led government has strengthened the system since it came to power in 2014. “MSP system will exist in future also. In fact we have included pulses and oilseeds under MSP purchase. We have increased the MSP on 23 crops by implementing the recommendations of Swaminathan Commission,” he said.Yesterday, Tomar said most farmers and experts are "in favour of farm laws”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tomar-urges-unions-to-reconsider-the-decision-on-tractor-march-200231

18-01-2021||New Delhi||Relatives of sitting judge involved in benami deals in Amaravati: Former HC judge in SC||Former Andhra Pradesh High Court judge Justice V Eswaraiah (retd) has alleged in the Supreme Court that relatives of a “senior sitting” apex court judge were involved in “benami transactions” in the Amaravati land scam and he was trying to collect more evidence in this regard.In an affidavit filed in the top court, Justice Eswaraiah (retd) said he had sought information from a suspended judicial officer regarding the benami transactions in a phone conversation, which purportedly pertained to corruption allegations related to land deals in the state’s new capital region.The former high court judge has filed a plea in the top court challenging the August 13 last year order of Andhra Pradesh High Court, which directed investigation into the alleged phone conversation between him and the suspended judicial officer saying that the recorded conversation placed before it contained information that purportedly disclosed a serious conspiracy against the judiciary.“I state that asking for material (if available) regarding the conduct of a sitting judge and which to my knowledge was the subject matter of investigation, cannot by any stretch of imagination be said to be a conspiracy. I state that I did seek information and material from Mr Ramakrishna (suspended district munsif) in that phone conversation with regard to benami transactions involving the CRDA in Andhra Pradesh and the involvement of the relatives of the said Supreme Court judge,” Justice (retd) Eswaraiah has said in his affidavit filed through advocate Prashant Bhushan.“That the relatives of a senior sitting Supreme Court judge were involved in these transactions was information that I had received and was trying to collect more evidence with regard to,” he said.The affidavit was filed in pursuance to the apex court’s January 11 direction asking Justice Eswaraiah (retd) to clarify his stand with regard to his conversation with the suspended district munsif.The matter came up for hearing on Monday before a bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan. The bench posted the matter for hearing in the first week of February.Justice Eswaraiah (retd) said his admission or denial of the private conversation with Ramakrishna is “immaterial” in deciding the plea as the high court order has been challenged on the ground that the “same is untenable in law apart from being violative of my right to privacy which is held to be a fundamental right protected under Article 21 and under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution of India”.“I have not committed any crime and there is no complaint by anybody with reference to the said private conversation,” he said.He said that English transcription of the audio conversation, as contained in the pen drive filed by Ramakrishna before the high court, is “incorrect” and it has been deliberately distorted to give a false and misleading impression with regard to the conversation.“I state that the conversation as I recall with the suspended district musnif, Mr Ramakrishna, was threefold. Firstly, I have sought information about his suspension. Secondly, I have consoled and cajoled him due to the harassment he had faced,” he said.“Lastly, I sought information from him about the benami transactions regarding the new capital region in the state of Andhra Pradesh, which according to my information had been the subject matter of a cabinet sub-committee which recommended the formation of an SIT and subsequently the government of Andhra Pradesh wrote to the Union Ministry of Personnel and Grievances to transfer this investigation to the CBI since it involved interstate investigation and several high ranking influential persons,” the affidavit said.He said he has come public in various press conferences to “expose the misconduct of the Supreme Court judge especially his proximity with the erstwhile government of Andhra Pradesh”.“I state that the allegations of ‘conspiracy’ and a ‘plot’ are totally false and far from the truth. I have always endeavoured and continue to endeavour to protect and preserve the independence of judiciary. The allegations of a ‘conspiracy’ and ‘plot’ have been loosely attributed to me which apart from being white lies are derogatory and defamatory,” he said, while seeking quashing of the high court order.The high court, in its order, had requested former Supreme Court judge Justice R V Raveendran to inquire into the matter.The phone conversation, according to the plea, purportedly pertained to the corruption allegations in the Amaravati land scam.The former judge has said the high court’s order was made on the basis of an application for “reopening and intervention filed by the suspended District Munsif Magistrate (S Ramakrishna) in an unrelated PIL” seeking implementation of COVID-19 guidelines in court building and premises.The plea has said the former high court judge, in the alleged phone conversation, had merely mentioned his knowledge about allegations of misconduct and terming such a conversation to be a kind of conspiracy, was unwarranted.The Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy government had constituted the 10-member SIT, headed by a Deputy Inspector General of Police- rank IPS officer, on February 21 last year, to conduct a comprehensive investigation into various alleged irregularities, particularly the land deals in the Amaravati Capital Region, during the previous Chandrababu Naidu regime.

"That will not work this time and her party will be democratically dumped into the Bay of Bengal."Adhikari claimed not more than 30,000 people, mostly brought from other places, attended Banerjee's meeting at Tekhali in Nandigram on Monday. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/adhikari-accepts-mamatas-dare-says-will-defeat-her-in-nandigram-or-quit-politics-200199
18-01-2021||New Delhi||Online gaming industry urges government to set up self-regulatory body for sector||The online gaming industry on Monday urged the government to set up a self-regulatory body to standardise regulations for the entire online skill gaming sector and not just the fantasy sports industry.The Online Rummy Federation (TORF) in a statement said like fantasy sports, India’s skill gaming industry suffers from the same byzantine set of state-by-state laws and regulations.“There is an equal, if not a larger need, to regulate the broader skill gaming industry,” it said.Niti Aayog has recently pitched for setting up a single self-regulatory organisation for the online fantasy sports industry to be governed by the independent oversight board and also had suggested restricting online fantasy games to users of 18 years and above.Commenting on the contribution of the skill gaming industry to the government’s pro-growth vision, Games24x7 co-founder and CEO Bhavin Pandya said the sector has tremendous potential to provide a healthy and responsible form of entertainment.“Given the significant overlap between fantasy sports and other games of skill (which today include games like pool, carrom, quiz games, etc., in addition to Rummy), we believe that Niti Aayog’s draft paper should include the broader skill gaming industry,” he said.In a draft report titled ‘Guiding Principles for the Uniform National-Level Regulation of Online Fantasy Sports Platforms in India’, the Aayog had said that there is a public interest in the fantasy sports industry receiving the government recognition as an industry and having its own identity.A single self-regulatory organisation for the fantasy sports industry should be recognised by the government, it had added.Deepak Gullapalli, CEO of Head Digital Works that operates online rummy brand A23 and fantasy sports platform Fanfight, said the gaming industry in India has attracted several marquee investors who have supported the development of the overall market.“A common self-regulatory body will result in the removal of a lot of uncertainty for foreign investors, spur foreign investment to the tune of a few billion dollars, drive innovation, employment and taxes,” he said.Online Fantasy Sports Platforms (OFSPs) offer fantasy sports contests.Fantasy sports are not like any other form of online gaming as it is dependent on actualities, seasonality and availability of real-time sports matches, which makes it a non-addictive form of play.This sets it distinctly apart from other forms that are perceived to be in the nature of gambling or betting.Commenting on the growth of an entrepreneurial culture driven by skill gaming in India, Junglee Games founder and CEO Ankush Gera said there has been a huge spurt in entrepreneurial activity recently, with over 275 game development startups active today.“This is more than a 10x increase in the number of industry players in the last ten years. The gaming industry employs over 50,000 highly qualified technologies, design, and product development resources,” he said.

18-01-2021||Vijay Mohan||DGCA issues fresh guidelines on cross-country training flights||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 18To address operational constraints and enhance the safety aspects, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued fresh guidelines on the conduct of cross-country flights by training institutes for the issue of private or commercial pilot license.The civil regulator has directed flying training organisations to incorporate the new guidelines in their training syllabus within three months and get the revised operating procedures approved from it.Under the Indian Aircraft Rules, it is mandatory for trainee pilots to undertake cross-country flights by day and night and pass the required tests. The minimum number of hours of cross-country flying and distance prescribed for obtaining a private pilot’s license, commercial pilot’s license or an airline transport pilot’s license are different.Flight planning, route assessment, in-flight procedures, communication, navigation, emergencies and contingencies and identification of a landing site by the training organisations and the role of flying instructors have been dealt with in the guidelines received by the flying training organisations this month.On the safety risk assessment for intended routes, it has been directed that the risk assessment methodology should aim at estimating for a specific route and the likelihood of having fatalities due to emergency landing caused by an engine failure.The feasibility of operation will be established while ensuring that the routes and cruising altitudes are selected so as to have a landing site within the aircraft’s gliding range.Whenever a landing site is not within gliding range, one or more ‘risk periods’ may be used for operations over water, hostile environment or congested areas.It also has to be ensured that except for the take-off and landing phase, a risk period is so planned that there is a possibility to glide to a non-congested area and the total duration of the risk period shall not exceed 15 minutes per flight.Risk assessment aims at estimating the likelihood of failing to achieve a safe landing in case of engine failure. This  consists  of  creating  a  risk  profile  for  a  specific  route,  including departure, en route and arrival airfield and runway.When assessing the risk for each segment, height of the aircraft at which engine failure occurs, the position relative to the departure or destination airfield or to an emergency landing site en route, and the likely ambient conditions such as cloud cover, visibility, wind and light would be taken into account along with other standard flight procedures.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dgca-issues-fresh-guidelines-on-cross-country-training-flights-200194

18-01-2021||---||Do these farmers look like secessionists, terrorists: Capt to Centre over NIA notices||Chandigarh, January 18Condemning the issuance of NIA notices to several farmers and their supporters in the midst of the anti-Farm Laws agitation, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday said such arm-twisting tactics would not weaken the resolve of the farmers to fight for their rights and their future.“Do these farmers look like secessionists and terrorists?,” asked the Chief Minister, slamming the BJP-led government at the Centre for resorting to such reprehensible and oppressive tactics in their desperation to undermine the peacefully protesting farmers’ fighting spirit. But these measures will not succeed in destroying the resolve of the farmers, rather the Centre will only end up provoking them into stronger reaction, he said, questioning the intent of the Government of India, which he said seemed bent on pushing the farmers over the edge through such intimidatory actions.Amarinder warned that BJP’s most powerful minds will not be able to control the situation if things get irretrievably out of hand.Instead of resolving the crisis triggered by the draconian legislations, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led central government was resorting to victimisation and harassment of the protesting farmers and their supporters, the Chief Minister pointed out, dubbing it a regressive step that would lead to further hardening of the farmers’ stance.It was obvious, said the Chief Minister that the BJP-led NDA government neither cared for the farmers and their concerns, nor understood their psyche. “Punjabis are fighters by nature, they are imbued with the fighting spirit which makes them among the best warriors in the world,” he said, adding that the Centre’s coercive actions will only provoke the farmers from Punjab to react negatively.Amarinder expressed shock over the Government of India’s unrelenting opposition to the farmers’ genuine and justified demands and its total failure to empathise with the cause and concerns of the farmers who have been braving the record cold of Delhi, with many of them succumbing to the harsh weather and prolonged exposure. Not only had the Centre been standing on ego in its adamant refusal to repeal the black Farm Laws, it was actively and shamelessly indulging in strong-arm tactics to suppress the voice of the farmers, he said, pointing to the IT notices issued to several big Arhtiyas of Punjab about a month ago and now the NIA notices that were clearly aimed at pressurising the farmers into withdrawing their stir.These low-level actions will not suppress the voice of the farmers, or those millions of Indians who are supporting the ‘annadaatas’ in their battle for survival, said the Chief Minister, adding that if the Centre had any shame left it should immediately withdraw the Farm Laws and sit down across the table with all the stakeholders, especially the farmers, to usher in an era of genuine agricultural reforms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/do-these-farmers-look-like-secessionists-terrorists-capt-to-centre-over-nia-notices-200182

18-01-2021|| New Delhi||CRPF gets 21 DRDO-developed bike ambulances for remote area operations||Twenty-one 'bike ambulances' developed by the DRDO were on Monday inducted into the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) for casualty evacuation tasks in remote Naxal violence and insurgency-affected areas.The customised 'Rakshita' ambulances have been created on 350cc Royal Enfield Classic bikes by the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS), a scientific research body under the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).CRPF chief A P Maheshwari said the bikes will be used in operational areas like the Left Wing Extremism-affected states and insurgency-hit areas for evacuating sick or injured troops of the paramilitary force.He added that these ambulances will be "gainfully utilised" to also help the locals of the area where the force is deployed.The bike's pillion has been customised as a casualty evacuation seat with recline and has a hand immobiliser and harness jacket, a CRPF spokesperson said.He added that a physiological parameter measuring equipment with monitoring capability and auto-warning system has been provided to the driver along with a dashboard-mounted LCD for measuring vital parameters of the casualty.The ambulance also has an air splint medical and oxygen kit, can provide saline and oxygen on the move, adjustable footrest, and hand and foot strap for safety among others, the spokesperson said.The force has sanctioned an initial fund of more than Rs 35.49 lakh for this project, he said.The CRPF, the lead force for anti-Naxal operations and internal security in the country, first toyed with the bike ambulance idea in February 2018 when the troops of its 85th battalion deployed in Chhattisgarh's Bijapur district used their patrolling bikes to evacuate casualties from remote areas under its jurisdiction.Following this, the force approached the INMAS to develop a fully capable and equipment-supported bike ambulance."The INMAS promptly put up a team of scientists and experts to make the idea a reality. The team developed a prototype and improved it with the feedback from CRPF personnel deployed in disturbed areas," the spokesperson said.Distinguished scientist and director general (life sciences) at the DRDO A K Singh was also present during the handing over of the bike ambulances event held at the CRPF headquarters on Lodhi Road here. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/crpf-gets-21-drdo-developed-bike-ambulances-for-remote-area-operations-200178

18-01-2021||New Delhi||Taking all efforts to extradite fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya: Centre to SC||The Centre on Monday told the Supreme Court that it was taking all efforts to extradite fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya, accused in bank loan default case of over Rs 9,000 crore involving his defunct Kingfisher Airlines from United Kingdom, but the process is being delayed to some legal issues involved in the matter.A bench of Justices UU Lalit and Ashok Bhushan posted the matter for further hearing on March 15, after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta sought some time to file report on the status of extradition of Mallya.At the outset, Mehta shared a letter of the Ministry of External Affairs’ official Devesh Uttam written to him on the status of extradition of Mallya from the United Kingdom.The solicitor general stated that Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had raised the issue of extradition with the UK government and the Centre was taking all serious efforts to extradite Mallya.He said government was trying its best but the status remained the same and from political executive level to administrative level the matter is being looked into repeatedly.The bench took the letter on record.Mallya, an accused in bank loan default case of over Rs 9,000 crore involving his defunct Kingfisher Airlines, is in the UK since March 2016. He is on bail on an extradition warrant executed three years ago by Scotland Yard on April 18, 2017.The letter submitted by the law officer stated that “the Ministry of External Affairs has been informed by the UK government that there is a further legal issue that needs resolving before Mallya can be extradited”.It said: “Under the United Kingdom law, extradition cannot take place until it is resolved. As it is judicial in nature, the issue is confidential and you will understand that Her Majesty’s government cannot provide any more details. We also cannot estimate how long this issue will take to resolve. Her Majesty’s government fully understands the importance of this case to the government of India. I can reassure that Her Majesty’s government is seeking to deal with the issue as quickly as possible.”The letter further stated: “The government of India has been making consistent efforts for early extradition of Vijay Mallya. In November 2020, Foreign Secretary Harshvardhan Shringla raised this issue with Priti Patel, UK Home Secretary, who informed that UK’s legal complexities were preventing the quick extradition of Vijay Mallya.”It further said: “In December 2020, External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar raised the issue with the UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab and most recently in January 2021, the Home Secretary of India raised it with the UK Permanent Under Secretary of Home. UK’s response remains the same.”On November 2, 2020, the top court had asked the Centre to file status report in six weeks on the confidential legal proceedings pending in the UK on extradition of Mallya to India.The Centre had on October 5 told the apex court that Mallya cannot be extradited to India until a separate “secret” legal process in the UK, which is “judicial and confidential in nature is resolved”.The top court had also refused to accept the plea of advocate EC Agarwala, appearing for Mallya in the Apex Court, seeking discharge from the case.The Centre had in October, last year said it was not aware of the secret on-going proceedings against Mallya in the UK as the government of India was not party to the process.On August 31, 2020, the top court had directed Mallya to appear before it on October 5, 2020, while dismissing his plea seeking review of the 2017 verdict which held him guilty of contempt for transferring $40 million to his children in violations of court orders.When the top court had asked Mehta about the time-frame for conclusion of proceeding pending in the UK, he had said they have no information about it from the London High Commission.The Ministry of Home Affairs, in its affidavit filed earlier in the contempt case in which Mallya has been held guilty, said that the pending legal issue in the UK is “outside and apart from the extradition process” and is “confidential and cannot be disclosed”.The top court had in October, 2020 asked Mallya’s lawyer to apprise the Apex Court by November 2, last year what kind of “secret” proceedings are going on to extradite him.The Centre had given details of the extradition proceedings against Mallya starting from February 9, 2017, till dismissal of his appeal against extradition in UK on May 14, 2020, and said that the fugitive businessman had thus exhausted all avenues of appeal in the United Kingdom.The Centre had said following the refusal of leave to appeal, Mallya’s surrender to India should, in principle, have been completed within 28 days but “the UK home office intimated that there is a further legal issue which needs to be resolved before Vijay Mallya’s extradition may take place”.

Harm is done by the man who instigates and ignites the flame first,” Luthra told the court.She said there was no public interest in Ramani’s allegation.“There is no public interest. There is no good faith. There is just some other motive. It is not for me to state it,” she said.She added that “it is vindictive and actuated out of malice. The fact is your can just spoil a person’s reputation”.The court will further hear the matter on January 23.     Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani in October 15, 2018.He resigned as Union minister on October 17, 2018.Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as ‘media’s biggest predator’ that harmed his reputation.He has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment against the women who came forward during #MeToo campaign against him.Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar while they were working as journalists under him.He termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/metoo-ramani-ignited-flame-to-harm-his-reputation-akbar-tells-court-200157

The Ministry of Home Affairs has to identify the source and immediately take action,” he said.Goswami has been at the forefront in maligning the image of the Mumbai police and also the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the state, Tapase claimed.“In his TV debates, he tried to give a communal angle to the Palghar incident. The Sushant Singh Rajput death case was blown out of proportion and a false narrative was set. All this was done with the sole intention to destabilise the MVA government,” Tapase said.The BJP should clarify its position on Arnab Goswami, he said.Dasgupta, who was arrested in the fake Television Rating Point (TRP) case, is now in the ICU of state-run JJ hospital in central Mumbai.A diabetic, he was rushed to the hospital from the Taloja Central Prison in Navi Mumbai on Saturday after his blood sugar levels went up on Friday midnight.The Mumbai police had earlier told the court that Goswami had allegedly bribed Dasgupta with lakhs of rupees to ramp up Republic TV’s viewership.

18-01-2021||New Delhi||Narinder Kapany: Unsung hero who coined term ‘fibre optics’ and touched billions of lives||Fibre optics – say the words and people think of high-speed internet cables. More knowledgeable ones might also know it is the science of transmitting light through flexible fibre. But very few would even have an inkling that the man who coined the term “fibre optics” was born and educated in India.Fewer still realise that the contributions of Narinder Singh Kapany find application in the lives of billions of people on this planet, in ways big and small.Kapany died in the US last month, a trailblazer in the field of fibre optics, a role model for optical engineers but an unsung hero, unknown to so many whose lives he touched with his innovations.   Kapany, 94, passed away peacefully in Redwood City, California, a world away from Moga in Punjab where he was born and the hill town of Dehradun where he grew up. He graduated in 1948 from Agra University, later receiving his doctorate from Imperial College, London, in 1955.The wide applications of the field that has gone on to revolutionise the internet age stand on the shoulders of Kapany who demonstrated that light transmission is possible with flexible fibre bundles.Credited with coining the term “fibre optics”, Kapany was a true visionary in his field who earned over 100 patents, say scientists. His seminal research in fibre optics, lasers and solar energy have found applications in bio-medical instruments, defence, communications and pollution-monitoring. Inspiration struck early."When I was a high school student at Dehradun in the beautiful foothills of the Himalayas, it occurred to me that light need not travel in a straight line, that it could be bent. I carried the idea to college," Indian physicist Shivanand Kanavi quoted Kapany as saying in his 2003 book ‘Sand to Silicon: The Amazing Story of Digital Technology’.Kanavi is among the several scientists who believe Kapany's contribution may have gone unnoticed by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences which grants the Nobel Prize.While Chinese scientist Charles K Kao was one of the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009 “for groundbreaking achievements concerning the transmission of light in fibres for optical communication”, it was Kapany who first demonstrated successfully that light can be transmitted through bent glass fibres, Kanavi said.In his illustrious career as scientist, engineer and entrepreneur, Kapany authored four books on fibre optics and entrepreneurship. In 1999, Fortune named him one of seven 'Unsung Heroes' in their 'Businessmen of the Century' issue.  The first breakthrough came in 1953 when Kapany, along with his PhD guide Harold Horace Hopkins at Imperial College London, became the first to successfully transmit high-quality images through fibre bundles. With Hopkins, Kapany carefully assembled 10,000 to 20,000 fibre bundles, each the diameter of 1/1000 of an inch, as fine as a single strand of the average human hair, and showed light guidance and imaging through a 75-centimetre-long fibre.The duo published their results in the journal Nature on January 2, 1954, and there was no looking back after that.Following this pioneering feat, he came up with the term “fibre optics” in a famous article for Scientific American in 1960. "If light is directed into one end of a glass fiber, it will emerge at the other end. Bundles of such fibers can be used to conduct images over a tortuous path and to transform them in various ways," Kapany wrote, describing the potential applications of the field.Kapany realised that bundles of thin glass fibres could bend more easily. "Initially, my primary interest was to use them in medical instruments for looking inside the human body. The broad potential of optic fibers did not dawn on me till 1955. It was then that I coined the term fibre optics," he told Kanavi, who is an adjunct faculty at the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bengaluru.  The principle behind fibre optic technology is the concept of total internal reflection in which light, when beamed through a glass slab at specific angles, reflects it back completely.Indian Institute of Technology professor Deepa Venkitesh explained that optical fibre is nothing but hair-thin silica glass drawn to kilometres of length.“Now if you launch light correctly into this fibre, the light bounces multiple times at the interface and is trapped in the fibre, propagating until it reaches the far end of the fiber," the fibre optics researcher told PTI.She said the importance of fibre optics had grown in this era of working from home.“The backbone that enables high-speed connectivity in front-end mobile devices is in fact the humongous fibre optic communication network that spans the globe," Venkitesh said."Kapany's key contributions are the demonstration of a system utilising optical fibres for the purpose of transmission of an image over a reasonable distance and the coining of the term fibre optics and sort of introducing the field to a wider audience through an article in the Scientific American," added VR Supradeepa, associate professor, Centre for Nano Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru.  He said it is hard to find areas which had not been affected by advances in fibre optic communication."Any application which involves the internet and similar computer networks is built upon fibre optic communication. The field has come a long way since the early demonstrations by Dr Kapany. From his demonstrations of the first static optical fiber link over a fiber bundle, we now have multi terabits (1 trillion bits) per second communications over a single fibre strand," the IISc scientist added.Science writer Jeff Hecht noted in his book, ‘City of Light: The Story of Fiber Optics’ that Kapany was the lead author on 46 scientific papers and co-author of 10 more in the years between 1955 and 1965. "That represented a staggering 30 per cent of all the papers published on fiber optics during those years, including reports on medical treatment," he said.After migrating to the US, Kapany first worked at Rochester University, then at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.In 1961, he founded Optics Technology Inc successfully taking it public in 1967 - the first Sikh Indian to take a company public in Silicon Valley. He created the Sikh Foundation in 1967 which pioneered the display of Sikh arts at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, DC, and at the Rubin Museum in New York.Kapany, who is survived by wife Satinder Kaur, two children and four grandchildren, was witness to the horrors of Partition during his years in Dehradun.Sharing his firsthand accounts with the 1947 Partition Archive, a non-profit organisation, he recalled a mob turning up at their home and demanding that he hand over a Muslim domestic help.“They were shouting and said, ‘You have a Muslim living here, give him to us',” he recalled in his interview with the organisation. But he was prepared to use his double-barrel gun to protect the house help."I think there were some wise people there who found that I meant it. I wasn't going to let anybody hurt him," he said.Kapany's last book, a memoir titled ‘The Man Who Bent Light’, is expected to be available in spring this year.

18-01-2021||Ahmedabad||Work under way on over 1,000 km of Metro network in 27 cities: Modi||Work is in progress on over 1,000 km long metro rail network in 27 cities in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday.He was speaking after performing the groundbreaking ceremony of the Ahmedabad Metro Rail Project Phase-II and Surat Metro Rail Project via video conferencing.“There was a time when there was no modern thinking and policy on metro in our country. The result was that there was a different (type of) metro in each city,” Modi said.There was no uniformity then on the metro trains which started in different cities. There was no integration of metro with other modes of transport back then,” he said.Now, an integrated approach has been brought in so that various modes of transport, such as bus and trains, complement each other rather than running independently, he added.Both the metro projects in Gujarat would come up at an estimated cost of around Rs 17,000 crore, Modi said.The metro network in Ahmedabad and Surat will further strengthen the connectivity in the two major business centres of the country, Modi said, adding the government is developing an integrated urban transport system.The difference between the approach of his government and the previous governments is the (pace of) expansion of the metro rail network across the country, he said.“Before 2014, only 225 km of metro line became operational in 10-12 yrs. In the last six years, over 450 km of metro network became operational,” Modi said.The Ahmedabad and Surat metro projects are expected to provide an environment-friendly Mass Rapid Transit System to these cities.Modi said the metro projects are designed keeping in mind both present as well as future needs.The Ahmedabad Metro Rail Project Phase-II is 28.25 km long with two corridors. While corridor-1 is 22.8 km long and is from Motera Stadium to Mahatma Mandir, corridor-2 is 5.4 km long and is from GNLU to GIFT-City. The total completion cost of the Phase-II project is Rs 5,384 crore, an official said.Modi inaugurated the 6.5 km stretch of Phase-1 in March 2019.The Surat Metro Rail Project is 40.35 km long and comprises two corridors. While corridor-1 is 21.61 km long and is from Sarthana to Dream City. Corridor-2 is 18.74 km long and is from Bhesan to Saroli. The completion cost of the project Rs 12,020 crore.Mentioning various “pro-people” schemes and projects his government has floated or supported, such as Nal Se Jal and Ayushman Bharat, Modi said India is now taking decisions with full confidence and also implementing it.As many as 21 lakh persons in Gujarat received free treatment under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, he said.In Gujarat alone, 2.5 lakh houses were built for the poor under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna-Gramin, he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/work-under-way-on-over-1-000-km-of-metro-network-in-27-cities-modi-200121

It is the last year of my school life and I haven't come to school even one day," said Pragati Diwan, an excited class 12 student.For another student at Geeta Bal Bharti School, the feeling was similar to that of attending first day at school."It does not feel like I am coming to school after ten months, it feels like I have come to school for the first time. I am looking forward to the preparations for board exams here," she said.The school put up posters of "welcome back" in corridors where teachers stood with sanitisers and checked the temperature of each student before letting them in.Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya in Mandawali decorated the premises with balloons and the teachers showered flower petals on students, welcoming them.Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia is also visiting a school in Chirag Enclave on Monday to assess the readiness of schools to welcome class 10 and 12 students.Calling students in different slots, shorter school hours, frequent sanitisation and staggered entry and exit are among the plans of various schools in the national capital as they gear to welcome class 10 and 12 students on Monday for the first time in the academic session.The schools are reopening in Delhi after 10 months, after being shut last year to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, and they have been instructed by the Directorate of Education (DoE) to follow all COVID-19 guidelines when classroom studies resume.The Delhi government has allowed all schools outside COVID-19 containment zones here to reopen for classes 10 and 12 from January 18 in view of board exams. However, it made clear that physical attendance is not compulsory and students will attend schools only with the consent of parents.Allowing 15 students at a time in a classroom, placing handwashing consoles and sanitisers in corridors, volunteers to ensure social distancing is maintained, temperature checks and medical facilities on standby if any student is not feeling well, are among various other initiatives planned by schools.Schools are also working out plans to ensure that students who choose not to come to campus, do not miss out anything.The Union Education Ministry has already announced that board exams for Classes 10 and 12 will be conducted from May 4 to June 10, even though the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is yet to release an examination date-sheet.Over 3 lakh students have registered from the Delhi region for the Class 10 CBSE board exam, while over 2.5 lakh candidates have registered for the Class 12 exam. The Delhi government has suggested that schools conduct pre-board exams for Class 12 from March 20 to April 15 and Class 10 pre-board exams from April 1 to April 15.

This act of the producer-director has hurt and incited religious and caste sentiments of the people, the FIR added.The FIR has been lodged under Sections 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language), 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class), 505 (1) (B) (statements conducing to public mischief with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquility) and 469 (forgery for purpose of harming reputation) along with sections of the IT Act.Taking cognizance of complaints that Hindu gods and goddesses have been ridiculed in the web series, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting had on Sunday sought an explanation from streaming platform Amazon Prime Video on the issue, sources had said.The development came after BJP MP Manoj Kotak on Sunday said he has written to Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar seeking a ban on Amazon Prime Video’s series ‘Tandav’ for ridiculing Hindu deities.“The ministry has taken cognizance of the matter (complaints) and asked Amazon Prime Video to explain,” a source in the ministry had said.Kotak, the MP from Mumbai North-East, said different organisations and individuals have complained that Hindu gods and goddesses have been ridiculed in the ‘Tandav’ web series.When contacted about the complaints, Amazon Prime Video PR had said the platform “won’t be responding” on the matter.The government recently brought OTT platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ Hotstar, besides other online news and current affairs content, under the ambit of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, giving it powers to regulate policies and rules for the digital space. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tandav-controversy-case-registered-in-up-against-director-amazon-india-head-of-content-200100

The new laws will increase their income multifold. The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of around 40 farm unions, made the announcement on the eve of a hearing in the Supreme Court on the Delhi Police’s petition to stop the tractor rally even as the government reiterated it was “ready for anything but repeal” of the laws.Addressing the media at Singhu border, union leaders, including Darshan Pal, Shiv Kumar Kakka, Hanan Mollah and Jagjeet Singh Dallewal, said their protest would be peaceful and all the farmers would carry on their tractors would be the Tricolour.Read also:“As farmers’ sons (soldiers) observe Republic Day in uniform on the border, the protesting peasants will hit the Outer Ring Road in Delhi on tractors. But there will be no disruption of the Republic Day parade,” said a leader. The tractor parade, they said, would cover a 50-km distance, touching Peeragarhi, Janakapuri, Dhaula Kuan, Munerka, IIT, Khelgaon, Chirag Delhi, Burari, Rohini, Majnu Ka Tilla.Darshan Pal alleged that the NIA was filing cases against those who were part of the agitation or supporting it. “All farm unions condemn this,” Pal said, referring to the NIA summons reportedly issued to a union leader in a case related to the banned Sikhs for Justice outfit.The government today reiterated its stand saying “anything but repeal” of the laws was acceptable and the unions should come forward for a clause-by-clause discussion on the legislations in the next round of talks on January 19.“Now that the Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of the laws and formed a four-member committee, there is no question of being stubborn,” said Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar.The committee, whose member Bhupinder Singh Mann (Bhartiya Kisan Union president) had backed out, is scheduled to hold its first meeting on January 19 at Pusa campus in Delhi, its member Anil Ghanwat said.The Supreme Court may take into account the matter of Mann’s recusal on Monday when it is scheduled to hear the pleas relating to the controversial laws and the farmers’ protests.Ghanwat said the committee had received the terms of reference and would begin its work from January 21.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-sc-hearing-farmer-unions-out-with-tractor-parade-plan-199929

In a July 2017 conversation, Arnab displays advance knowledge of Cabinet formation when he tells Dasgupta of the future developments at the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.“Venkaiah probable Vice-President,” Arnab says, with the then BARC boss asking who the next I&B Minister would be. Arnab discloses the name of Smriti Irani and says he’s happy at her elevation and that he was worried about “J” (Prakash Javadekar) coming in. The same day BJP parliamentary board picks Naidu as the party’s vice presidential candidate. Internal security matters were also reportedly known to Arnab in advance as is evident from an August 2019 chat where Dasgupta asks Arnab if Article 370 would be scrapped in J&K. Arnab answers in the affirmative.Arnab’s links with the top BJP brass are also reflected in another chat where he says the “PM is being handled differently” after Dasgupta asks him about progress in handling the TRP scam.The Congress, meanwhile, demanded a parliamentary probe saying: “The development impacted the national security.” Ex-Home Minister P Chidambaram asked: “Did a journalist (and his friend) know about the retaliatory strike in Balakot in advance? If yes, what is the guarantee that their ‘source’ did not share the information with spies working for Pakistan?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-ministers-with-us-arnab-goswami-flaunts-links-in-leaked-chats-199963

Three days later, IAF jets indeed struck at Balakot. A day later Dasgupta asked Arnab if this was the “big one he was referring to”.This chat and on many other matters of national security are part of the chargesheet filed by the Mumbai Police in the TRP scam case.Arnab’s alleged knowledge about the air strike indicates leakage of highly classified information, including military operations. And why did Arnab, who may have gotten a tip-off as a journalist, share this information with Dasgupta over WhatsApp?Dasgupta was not connected to news operations, but was heading the BARC, which was supposed to check which channel was getting more viewers.Similarly, just before the abrogation of Article 370 to strip Jammu and Kashmir of its special status, Arnab claimed on August 2, 2019 – again three days prior to the event — “have set platinum standards in breaking and this story is ours”. He was responding to Dasgupta who had sent him a newsflash on (Republic TV), saying: “Government of India to make Jammu separate state, Kashmir and Ladakh as Union Territories.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/had-prior-info-on-balakot-air-strike-199964

The project will cost Rs 45,696 crore.At present, only 50 per cent of the jet is made in India, while the engine and the latest radar — called AESA — come from the US and Israel, respectively.Currently, the aircraft has around 344 systems fitted in it and 210 systems are indigenous and 134 of them are imported, said a senior functionary.By the time, the first aircraft gets produced by HAL, it is targeted that the imported systems will be reduced to approximately 80. Tejas is expected to be the backbone of the IAF fighter fleet in years to come and is slated to be produced in high numbers. The production will be done at a new state-of-the-art facility in Bengaluru.The HAL has created the facilities to house the additional production line of LCA. Once ready, the facility would be spread across 35 acres and a built-up area of 34,893 sq m. The phase 1 of the facility is ready and is spread across 24,077 sq m.Specialised facilities and hangars for structural assembly of aircraft are being created and simulation software packages have been added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-sets-up-stiff-targets-for-home-production-of-tejas-199970

He was 89.Born on March 3, 1931, in Badaun of Uttar Pradesh, Khan was the eldest son in a family of four brothers and three sisters. His father, Ustad Waris Hussain Khan, was the son of celebrated musician Ustad Murred Baksh, while his mother, Sabri Begum, was the daughter of Ustad Inayat Husain Khan, credited as the founder of the Rampur-Sahaswan gharana of music.Khan received his basic classical music training from his father and later studied music under his cousin, Ustad Nissar Hussain Khan.He gave his first public performance at the age of eight.He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1991, followed by Padma Bhushan in 2006 and Padma Vibhushan in 2018.In 2003, he was honoured with the Sangeet Natak Akademi award, the highest Indian recognition given to practising artistes.Ustad Mustafa Khan has sung for Marathi, Gujarati and Hindi films and has given his voice to over 70 documentary films by Films Division, many of which received national and international awards.He taught music to AR Rahman, Shaan, Hariharan, Manna Dey, Asha Bhosle, Sonu Nigam, Alisha Chinoy and many others.

18-01-2021||New Delhi||Arnab leaks require serious inquiry: Shashi Tharoor||Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has said the leaked Arnab messages demand serious inquiry.“The leaked WhatsApp chats reveal three reprehensible things requiring serious inquiry: leaking of military secrets to a TV channel for its commercial purposes; a "nationalist" gloating over the death of 40 jawans as an "attack we have won like crazy”, and a fraudulent manipulation of TRPs. But if the Government won't conduct such an inquiry (& we all expect it won't, given the evidence of its complicity in the betrayals revealed), who will? Is this one more thing we will have to take a PIL to the Supreme Court for?” Tharoor asked.Meanwile, the Pakistan Foreign Office has sought to capitalise on the transcripts included in the Mumbai Police charge-sheet against Republic TV anchor Arnab Goswami by alleging they represent “irrefutable evidence of India’s state-sponsorship of terrorism”.In a statement, it claimed the latest revelations confirm Pakistan’s allegations that the BJP government stages “false flag” operations, maligns Pakistan with terrorism-related allegations and “manipulates national sentiment in its bid to win elections”.The transcripts, it said, also illustrate the nexus between the ‘Hindutva’ regime and a section of the media.“We hope that the international community would take full cognisance of the situation and hold India accountable for its actions vitiating the regional environment and endangering peace and security in South Asia,” said the statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arnab-leaks-require-serious-inquiry-shashi-tharoor-199839

However, some infected people may not develop antibodies,” Anurag Agrawal, IGIB director, and one of the co-authors of the paper said.“Use of private transport, lower-exposure occupations, smoking, vegetarianism and ‘A’ or ‘O’ blood groups appeared to be protective, using seropositivity as a surrogate for infection,” the paper added.Sengupta said this is for the first time that a study has been done in India wherein individuals have been monitored for three months (35 individuals) to six months (346 individuals) for antibodies including those with probable neutralising activity. This is the first such cohort survey, he said.“We conducted both the normal antibody test and neutralising anti-body test to understand the prevalence and duration of antibodies,” he said.The CSIR has some 40 institutes covering the length and the breadth of the country and each specialises in different fields. The IGIB and its sister institute Centre of Cellular and Molecular Biology have been at the forefront in conducting the genome sequencing of coronavirus.

Most of the AEFI reported so far are minor like fever, headache, nausea,” he said.He said a meeting was held with all states and union territories on Sunday to review the progress of the drive, identify bottlenecks and plan corrective actions.Prime Minister Narendra Modi rolled out the world’s largest inoculation drive against COVID-19 on Saturday and said the two vaccines being deployed will ensure a “decisive victory” for India against the pandemic.India has approved two vaccines—Covaxin developed by Bharat Biotech and Covishield from the Oxford/AstraZeneca stable being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India—for emergency use in the country.According to the government, the shots will be offered first to an estimated one crore healthcare workers and around two crore frontline workers, and then to persons above 50 years of age, followed by persons younger than 50 years of age with associated comorbidities.

Will the SC, ST, BC, OBC, BPL, APL, the poor and the underprivileged get the vaccine for free or not? If yes, what is the roll-out plan and by when will the government ensure free vaccination,” he asked.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP government need to answer...Who will get free corona vaccine? How many people will get the free corona vaccine? Where will you get free corona vaccine,” he said.Surjewala also raised questions over the pricing of the two vaccines—Covaxin developed by Bharat Biotech and Covishield from the Oxford/AstraZeneca stable manufactured by the SII—approved for emergency use in India and asked why the government has not put them in the National List of Essential Medicines.The Congress general secretary asked why the government should pay Rs 95 more to Bharat Biotech for a vaccine that has been developed with the expertise and experience of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) scientists.“Should the price of such a vaccine not be cheaper than the AstraZeneca-Serum Institute? Why is the price of corona vaccine Rs 1,000 per dose in the open market,” he asked.He said the government should demand transparency from companies on the cost of production and profits being made from the vaccine.“Vaccine development and mass immunisations were neither events nor publicity stunts, but important milestones in the service of the people.“While India stands united in providing immunisation against the coronavirus to our frontline corona warriors—doctors, health workers, police personnel and others—let’s remember that vaccinations are an important public service and not a political or business opportunity,” he told reporters at a press conference.The first COVID-19 vaccine shots in India were given on Saturday to nearly two lakh frontline healthcare and sanitation workers as Prime Minister Narendra Modi rolled out the world’s largest inoculation drive against the pandemic that has caused 1,52,093 deaths and upended millions of lives in the country.Modi asserted that the two vaccines being deployed will ensure a “decisive victory” for India against the coronavirus.According to the government, the shots will be offered first to an estimated one crore healthcare workers, and around two crore frontline workers, and then to persons above 50 years of age, followed by persons younger than 50 years of age with associated comorbidities.Cost of vaccination of healthcare and frontline workers will be borne by the central government.

The parade will be very peaceful. There will be no disruption of the Republic Day parade. The farmers will put up the national flag on their tractors."The authorities had moved the Supreme Court seeking an injunction against the proposed tractor march or any other kind of protest by farmers which seeks to disrupt the gathering and celebrations of Republic Day on January 26. The matter is pending in court.Another farmer union leader, Darshan Pal Singh, alleged that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) is filing cases against those who are part of the protest or supporting it."All farmer unions condemn this," Pal said, referring to the NIA summons reportedly issued to a farmer union leader in a case related to the banned Sikhs For Justice outfit.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a month now demanding repeal of the three laws -- the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act.Enacted in September 2020, the central government has presented these laws as major farm reforms aimed at increasing farmers' income, but the protesting farmers have raised concerns that these legislations would weaken the minimum support price (MSP) and "mandi" (wholesale market) systems and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.The government has maintained that these apprehensions are misplaced and has ruled out a repeal of the laws.

They were produced before a local court here on Saturday that sent them to 14 days custody, they said.The ED case against Peng stems from an Income Tax Department investigation of last year and an FIR filed by the Delhi Police special cell against him in 2018.Peng’s name had cropped up last year in connection with the detention of two persons in Himachal Pradesh who were allegedly tracking Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama’s movement on his direction.The Chinese national and some of his alleged associates, including bankers, were raided by the Income Tax Department in August.Peng, sources had alleged, had a fake Indian passport. Tax officials had claimed that he created a “web of sham companies to launder hawala funds to and from China” in the past two-three years.The sources had said his front or showcase business was import and export of medical and electronic goods and some other items.Peng, the sources said, was arrested by the Special Cell of the Delhi Police in September 2018 on charges of fraud and forgery and was allegedly running an illegal money changer.Both ED and I-T department, sources had said, are also probing allegations if Peng was “bribing” some Tibetans living in Delhi.In a statement in August last year, the CBDT had, without identifying the entities involved, stated that its searches were based on “credible inputs that a few Chinese individuals and their Indian associates were involved in money laundering and hawala transactions through a series of shell entities.”It had said the “subsidiary of Chinese company and its related concerns have taken over Rs 100 crore bogus advances from shell entities for opening businesses of retail showrooms in India”.“Search action revealed that at the behest of Chinese individuals, more than 40 bank accounts were created in various dummy entities, entering into credits of more than Rs 1,000 crore over the period,” the CBDT had said.“Incriminating documents of hawala transactions and money laundering with the active involvement of bank employees and Chartered Accountants have been found as a result of the search action,” it said.Evidence of foreign hawala transactions involving Hong Kong and US dollars have also been unearthed, the CBDT had said.Similar charges are being probed against Lee by the ED, they said.

18-01-2021||New Delhi||SC-appointed panel on farm laws to hold first meeting on January 19||The Supreme Court-appointed committee on the three new farm laws is scheduled to hold its first meeting on January 19 at Pusa campus here, one of its members Anil Ghanwat said on Sunday.The Supreme Court had on January 11 stayed the implementation of the three laws, against which farmers are protesting at Delhi borders for over 50 days now, till further orders and appointed a four-member panel to resolve the impasse.Bhartiya Kisan Union president Bhupinder Singh Mann, however, recused from the committee last week.Apart from Ghanwat, agri-economists Ashok Gulati and Pramod Kumar Joshi are the two other panel members.“We are meeting on January 19 at the Pusa campus. Only members will meet to decide the future course of action,” Ghanwat, President of Shetkari Sanghatana (Maharashtra), told PTI.One of the four members has backed out of the committee. If the apex court does not appoint a new member, the existing members will continue, he said.The committee has received the terms of reference and will begin the work from January 21 onwards, he added.Asked about the government holding parallel talks with protesting farmer unions after the setting up of the SC panel, he said, “We have no issue if a solution is found and the protests end from either (efforts of) our panel or from the government’s separate talks with the protesting farmer unions.”              “Let (Government) them continue the discussion, we have been given a duty and we will focus on that,” he added.The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Monday the pleas relating to the controversial farm laws and the ongoing farmers’ protest at Delhi borders.It may take into account the matter of recusal of the member from the panel.The top court would also hear the plea of the Central government, filed though the Delhi Police, seeking an injunction against a proposed tractor march or any other kind of protest by farmers that may disrupt the Republic Day celebrations on January 26.So far, the government has held nine rounds of formal talks with 41 farmer unions but has failed to break the logjam as the latter have stuck to their main demand of a complete repeal of the three Acts.In the last meeting, the Centre had suggested that the unions constitute their own informal group to prepare a concrete proposal on the three farm laws for further discussion at their next meeting on January 19 to end the long-running protest at various Delhi borders. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-appointed-panel-on-farm-laws-to-hold-first-meeting-on-january-19-199782

18-01-2021||New Delhi||UK's Boris Johnson invites PM Modi to attend G-7 summit||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to participate in the first in-person G7 summit in almost two years to be held in the Cornwall region from June 11 to 13.Johnson also plans to visit India before the summit after having to cancel his attendance at the Republic Day parade due to a surge of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK.This year the UK has also invited leaders from Australia and South Korea amidst talk of expanding the grouping to include the three countries as well. The issue of G-7 expansion has been expressed in various variants and India and Australia are among the two countries that have been mentioned in all of them.The attendance of India, Australia and South Korea will deepen the expertise and experience around the table and assist Johnson’s ambition to use the G-7 to intensify cooperation between the world’s democratic and technologically advanced nations. Between them, the ten leaders represent over 60 per cent of the people living in democracies around the world, noted a UK High Commission statement here.Billed as a conclave of world’s leading democracies, the invitation to India, Australia and South Korea is a “testament to the UK’s commitment to ensuring multilateral institutions better reflect today’s world.”The UK was the first P5 member to support a permanent UNSC seat for India and the first G7 member to invite India to a G7 Summit in 2005, said the statement.As ‘pharmacy of the world’, India already supplies more than 50 per cent of the world’s vaccines, and the UK and India have worked closely together throughout the pandemic. As current BRICS President and G20 President in 2023, India will play a key role in driving in multilateral cooperation helping to build back better around the world.The UK will also host a number of meetings throughout the year between Ministers from the G7, both virtually and in different locations across the country. These ministerial summits will cover economic, environmental, health, trade, technology, development and foreign policy issues.2021 marks a crucial year of international leadership for the UK. In addition to the G7 Summit, during February the UK will assume the Presidency of the UN Security Council, and later this year the UK will host COP26 in Glasgow and a global education conference aimed at getting children in the developing world into school.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uks-boris-johnson-invites-pm-modi-to-attend-g-7-summit-199738
