17-01-2021||Bhopal||Curfew in parts of Bhopal; Cong alleges aim was to help RSS||A curfew was imposed on Sunday in three police station limits in Bhopal and prohibitory orders were issued in some other areas in view of a construction work by a community trust in old city area, the measures which the Congress alleged were aimed at helping an organisation linked to the RSS to erect a boundary wall.Justifying the curfew and prohibition orders, the state BJP said the High Court had decided the land ownership in favour of a trust associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS).The order, issued by Bhopal District Magistrate Avinash Lavania, said a community is carrying out construction in the old city and there is a possibility of opposition by locals.The Madhya Pradesh capital is “sensitive from communal point of view”, hence the decision to impose curfew has been taken, the order said.The curfew has been clamped in Hanumanganj, Tila Jamalpura and Gautam Nagar police station areas of the Old City till further orders, Additional Collector Dilip Yadav said.Besides, prohibitory orders under Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) Section 144 have been imposed in 11 other police station areas-Shahjahanabad, Chhola Mandir, Nishatpura, Talaiya, Mangalwara, Ashoka Garden, Aishbagh, Jahangirabad, Station Bajaria, Berasia and Najirabad.The curfew and the prohibitory orders, which came into force early morning, will continue till further orders.Yadav said the construction of the boundary wall on the land in question continued till 7 pm and prohibitory orders remains in force.“Atmosphere of peace prevailed in the city,” he told reporters.Deputy Inspector General, Bhopal, Irshad Wali said that police have barricaded these areas and security personnel have been deployed there.He said a court had issued order in favour of a trust in this two-decade-old dispute.Meanwhile, a state Congress’ media coordinator Narendra Saluja said there was no need to impose curfew for the construction of a boundary wall.“A curfew has been imposed in three police station areas in the state capital to erect a boundary wall. What was the need to impose a curfew on such a small issue? This shows the failure of the government on the law and order front,” he said.He claimed the curfew was clamped for the construction of a boundary wall on 30,000 sq ft of land owned by an RSS-linked organisation.Madhya Pradesh BJP Secretary Rajneesh Agarwal said, “Should the administration have to ask the Congress for taking steps to maintain law and order or rely on an intelligence report? The administration has the right to maintain law and order and peace.“The state government’s aim is to maintain peace and goodwill in the state. I think the Congress should not comment unnecessarily in all these matters,” he said.Agrawal said the district administration only implemented the High Court’s order.He said the HC had decided the land ownership in favour of a trust associated with the RSS.There is also an office of Sangh nearby.On the other hand, Abdul Nafees, former secretary of Madhya Pradesh Congress, claimed that the land belongs to a Kabristan (cemetery) but the Waqf Board failed to present the papers in the court in this regard.

17-01-2021||Satara/Bhubaneswar||COVID-19 vaccination drive hits bump due to app glitch||India's COVID-19 vaccination drive was still facing some delays on Sunday after it hit a bump on the first day due to glitches in an app used to coordinate the campaign, according to officials in some states.Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched on Saturday what his government has described as the "world's largest vaccination programme". It aims to vaccinate around 300 million people to curb the pandemic in India, which has reported the second-highest number of coronavirus cases after the United States.India was aiming to vaccinate more than 300,000 people on Saturday, but only 191,181 people were inoculated on the first day, official data shows.Many health workers, who were due to receive a vaccine on Saturday, did not get the message via an app developed by the government called Co-Win, officials in at least four states said. Officials in at least one state said the issues had still not been resolved on Sunday.Co-Win is supposed to alert healthcare workers, who are first in line to get shots. It also allows officials to monitor and manage the entire programme."We were planning to vaccinate 28,500 people on Saturday but could do only 18,328 because of glitches in the Co-Win app," a senior official at the health department of the western state of Maharashtra told Reuters on condition on anonymity.Maharashtra, home to the financial hub of Mumbai, has been the Indian state hit hardest by COVID-19.In the eastern states of Odisha and West Bengal, officials said they were forced to use printouts on Saturday due to issues with the app."We also went with our plan B and contacted people to be vaccinated directly offline," Bijay Kumar Mohapatra, director, Health Services, Odisha, told Reuters in the state capital Bhubaneswar.The Indian government did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday."The system performance and speed was improved and is being further optimised," Manohar Agnani, a senior health ministry official, said on Saturday.The eastern state of West Bengal was still encountering glitches on Sunday."The problem is yet to be fixed and we are facing serious impediments," said Dr. Ajoy Chakraborty, director of West Bengal health services.Officials in other states could not be reached for comment on Sunday.India is currently using Britain's Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, which is also being produced in India, and a government-backed vaccine developed by India's Bharat Biotech.However, approval of Bharat Biotech's COVAXIN has been criticised by health experts and opposition lawmakers due to a lack of efficacy data, which the manufacturer is still conducting.--- Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-vaccination-drive-hits-bump-due-to-app-glitch-199827
17-01-2021||New Delhi||Record construction of 534 km of national highways in one week: Govt||The road ministry on Sunday said a record 534 km of national highways was constructed in one week, beginning January 8, 2020.In a statement, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said that it has “created a record by constructing 534 km of National Highways (NHs) in the last week commencing 8 January”.The ministry has constructed 8,169 km of NHs from April 2020 to January 15, 2021 in the current financial year 2020-21, i.e. with a speed of about 28.16 km per day.During the same period in the last fiscal, 7,573 km roads were constructed, with a speed of 26.11 km per day.The ministry is hopeful that with such pace it should be able to cross construction target of 11,000 km by March 31.The road ministry also awarded NH projects of 7,597 km during this period (April 2020 to January 15, 2021). In 2019-20, projects of 3,474 km were awarded during the same period. Thus, the pace of award has also more than doubled this fiscal.In total, projects of 8,948 km of roads were awarded in 2019-20 while 10,237 km of roads were constructed.The achievement assumes significance given the fact that the first two months of the current fiscal were lost due to nationwide lockdown in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic.The ministry has taken several initiatives to increase the pace of construction. The pace of construction is expected to increase further in the remaining months of the current financial year, which are conducive for construction activities.

17-01-2021||Vijay Mohan||IHBT study on developing heat-tolerant wheat varieties that will improve grain yield||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, January 17Research undertaken by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has laid the groundwork for developing a variety of wheat that does not lose its productivity under heat stress.Heat stress causes a dramatic reduction in yield as well as quality of wheat, which is the staple for more than one-third of the world’s population and also a critical crop in India where many regions are prone to heat waves.The Biotechnology Division of CSIR’s Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (IHBT) at Palampur is exploring the epigenetic route to modify gene expression in a manner that is stably transmitted, but do not involve differences in the underlying DNA sequence, so that the heritable genes do not buckle under heat stress and non-stress conditions during different grain filling stages.Dr Vijay Gahlaut, a faculty fellow of the department, will identify the role of DNA methylation, which is a biological process by which methyl groups are added to the DNA molecule, patterns of heat stress-tolerant and heat stress-sensitive wheat genotypes during different grain filling stages. This will be carried out through a process called ‘epigenomic mapping’, which will also help in the identification of natural epigenetic variation.His recent paper on the subject published in the journal ‘Genomics’ has shown differential expression patterns of specific genes (designated C5-MTase) under heat stress. This suggests their role in stress response in wheat could give a major clue to producing heat-tolerant productive wheat varieties.The utilisation of identical genes that differ in the extent of methylation identified through his research could be one of the most promising solutions to improving wheat productivity by engineering elite wheat varieties with enhanced heat stress tolerance and increase grain yield, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology today.Methylation is a conserved mechanism which regulates the gene expression and plays a vital role in various biological processes. It also plays a significant role in plant development as well as in abiotic stress tolerance.Wheat is affected severely by abiotic stresses that limit the achievement of yield potential and therefore it is urgently required to study its developmental characteristics and stress tolerance mechanisms, according to the study.Using the latest high-quality version of the wheat genome the study identified 52 C5-MTase elements in wheat and also analysed gene structures, conserved domains, phylogeny, chromosome localisation, regulating elements and sub-cellular localisations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ihbt-study-on-developing-heat-tolerant-wheat-varieties-that-will%C2%A0improve-grain-yield-199802

17-01-2021||New Delhi||Give up stubborn stand and come for clause by clause discussion on January 19: Tomar to protesting farmer unions||Ahead of the tenth round of talks scheduled on January 19, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Sunday again urged the protesting farm leaders to give up their “stubborn” stand on the new farm laws and come for a clause by clause discussion.“Now that the Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of these laws, then there is no question of being stubborn,” Tomar told reporters before leaving for his home constituency of Morena in Madhya Pradesh.The government wants farmer leaders to come for clause by clause discussion at the next meeting on January 19. Except for the demand of repealing the laws, the government is ready to consider “seriously and with an open heart” other alternatives, he said.Tomar, who left for his constituency by Hazur Sahib Nanded-Amritsar Superfast Express, was seen sharing langar from co-passengers of Sikh community—a  gesture which comes amid the ongoing protests by farmers from Punjab against the agri laws.The Supreme Court on January 11 had stayed the implementation of the three laws till further orders and appointed a four-member panel to resolve the impasse.Tomar said the government offered certain concessions, but the farmer leaders have not shown flexibility and were constantly demanding a repeal of the laws.He reiterated that the government makes laws for the entire country. Many farmers, experts and other stakeholders have supported the laws.So far, the nine rounds of formal talks between the Centre and 41 farmer unions have failed to yield any concrete results to end the long-running protest at Delhi’s borders as the latter have stuck to their main demand of a complete repeal of the three Acts. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/give-up-stubborn-stand-and-come-for-clause-by-clause-discussion-on-january-19-tomar-to-protesting-farmer-unions-199795
17-01-2021||---||Interfaith marriage triggers row in Rajasthan||Bikaner, January 17An interfaith marriage here has led the Hindu woman’s family to allege the alliance to be a case of “love jihad”, prompting a Union minister to demand a law in Rajasthan against the alleged practice of marriage for religious conversion.Union Minister of State for Agriculture Kailash Chaudhary demanded the law in the state despite the girl in a video statement on social media and to the police asserting that she married on her own accord and police too rejecting the allegation.The controversy erupted after Bikaner resident Manish Dudi, 18, married 22-year-old Mukhtiyar Khan last month after a brief love affair, prompting the woman’s family to issue a statement on social media, terming the alliance to be a case of “love jihad”.While the woman’s father, in his video statement, sought the community’s help in the matter, her grandfather threatened that he would commit suicide with the entire family members if no justice is done to them.The video statement by her family led the woman to issue a statement, asserting that she married the man on her own will on December 10 last year and instead of her converting to the Islam, the man himself has converted to Hinduism.She also reached the Naya Sahar police station on Saturday to give her statement to the police and sought protection from it.The Bikaner police said it was not a case of “love Jihad” and both the youths have married as per their own free will.“The rumours are baseless and the district police appeals to ignore such rumours,” Bikaner police tweeted along with the video message of the girl.On the other hand, MoS for agriculture Kailash Chaudhary, who is a member of Lok Sabha from Rajasthan, said the matter of “love jihad” should be investigated properly.“Such incidents are not good for social harmony. A law against love jihad should be enacted on the lines of Uttar Pradesh. The Bharatiya Janata Party stands with Bikaner’s family and assures them that the BJP will enact a strong law in Rajasthan to prevent such incidents on coming to power ib state in future,” he tweeted.Besides Uttar Pradesh, where a stringent anti-conversion ordinance was promulgated last year to tackle the alleged problem of “love jihad”, some other BJP-ruled states, including Madhya Pradesh, too have been mulling an anti-conversion law and are in various stages of enacting one. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/interfaith-marriage-triggers-row-in-rajasthan-199791

17-01-2021||Nagpur||Farmers prepared to protest till May 2024: BKU leader Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait on Sunday said farmers are prepared to protest against the Centre’s new farm laws “till May 2024”, and termed the ongoing agitation by peasants at Delhi borders as an “ideological revolution”.Addressing a press conference in Nagpur, Tikait said they want a legal guarantee on Minimum Support Price (MSP).Farmers have been protesting near Delhi since November 26, 2020, demanding scrapping of the three new farm laws, which have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the MSP and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Supreme Court last Tuesday stayed the implementation of the three new farm laws till further orders and decided to set up a four-member committee to resolve the impasse over them between the Centre and farmers’ unions protesting at Delhi borders.Asked how long will farmers will sit in protest, Tikait said, “We are prepared to sit in protest till May 2024...our demand is that the three laws be taken back and the government provide a legal guarantee on the MSP.”The next Lok Sabha elections in the country will be due around April-May 2024.Dismissed allegations that the protest was being fuelled by “rich farmers”, Tikait said people from villages and various outfits have joined the protest.“This is an ideological revolution of farmers started from Delhi and will not fail. Farmers from villages do not want us come back until the three farm bills are taken back,” he said.“The government is adamant on its stance of not withdrawing the bills and this agitation will continue for long,” Tikait added.He welcomed the SC’s decision on staying the implementation of the farm laws, but said the committee formed by the apex court has members who “supported” the farm bills.“We do not want to go before the committee formed by the court. The government has also said that the government and farmers will find solution on this issue,” he said.Tikait also said the opposition parties in the country were weak and that is why farmers had to start this agitation against the Centre’s new laws.On National Investigation Agency’s (NIA) notices to some people supporting the farmers’ protest, he said, “Those who want to be part of the agitation must be ready for court cases, imprisonment and sealing of property.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-prepared-to-protest-till-may-2024-bku-leader-tikait-199785
17-01-2021||Mumbai||Furious with division being created on the basis of religion: Naseeruddin Shah||Veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah has expressed concerns over the divide being created in the country between Hindus and Muslims in the name of love jihad.The 70-year-old actor made the comments in a video interview with Karwan-e-Mohabbat India, shared on its YouTube channel on Sunday.“I am really furious with the way divisions are being created, like the love jihad tamasha in UP. Firstly, the people who coined this phrase don’t know the meaning of the word jihad.“I don’t think that anyone would be so stupid to actually believe that Muslims will overtake the Hindu population, it is unimaginable. For that, Muslims will have to have so many babies. So, this whole notion is unreal,” Shah said in the interview.Last year in November, Uttar Pradesh became the first state in India to pass an ordinance against forcible or “dishonest” religious conversions.In the last few months, states like Haryana and Madhya Pradesh have also revealed plans to enact laws to counter alleged attempts to convert Hindu women to Islam in the guise of marriage, which political leaders often refer to as “love jihad”.The “Bandish Bandits” actor believes the term “love jihad” stems from the idea of stigmatising inter-faith marriages and stop social interactions between Hindus and Muslims.“They not only want to discourage inter-faith marriages but also curtail social interactions between Hindus and Muslims,” he added.Shah, who is married to theatre-film actor Ratna Pathak Shah, said he always believed that his marriage to a Hindu woman would set a “healthy precedent”.“We have taught our children about every religion. But we have never told them that they belong to any particular religion. I always believed that these differences would slowly fade away. I believed that my marriage to a Hindu woman would set a healthy precedent. I don’t think this is wrong,” he said.The actor said when he was about to tie the knot with the Ratna Pathak Shah, his mother had asked if he would want his would-be wife to convert to his religion and his answer was no.Shah said even though his mother was uneducated and was brought up in an orthodox household, she was completely against the idea of changing one’s religion.“My mother who was uneducated, brought up in an orthodox household, prayed five times a day, observed Roza all her life, went for the Haj pilgrimage, she said, ‘The things that have been taught to you in your childhood how can that change? It is not right to change one’s religion’,” he said.The critically-acclaimed performer said he feels saddened to see the harassment young couples are facing these days in the name of “love jihad”.“This is not the world I had dreamt of,” he added.In a 2018 interview with Karwan-e-Mohabbat, Shah had said that at many places the death of a cow is being given more importance than the killing of a policeman.The veteran actor had also expressed anxiety over the well-being of his children, who he said have not been brought up as followers of any particular religion.Soon after the interview was released online, the actor’s remark evoked outrage among some social media users.In the new interview, Shah said he failed to understand the reason behind such an adverse reaction to his statement. “All I had said was that the death of a cow had taken precedence over the death of a person and it makes me very angry. This was misinterpreted that I was expressing fear, when in fact I never used the word fear.“I have repeatedly said that I am not afraid. I am angry. Why should I be afraid? I am in my own country; I am at my own home. Five generations of my family are buried in this land. My ancestors have been living here for the last three hundred years. If this doesn’t make me a Hindustani, then what does?” he asked.The actor said it has become difficult for a person to share their views publicly due to fear of instant backlash.“The difficult part is there is no possibility of (freely) exchanging ideas anymore. If you say anything, even in support of the nation, you are accused instantly,” Shah added.

17-01-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra allies Shiv Sena, Cong spar over renaming Aurangabad city||The Shiv Sena and the Congress, which are ruling allies in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, on Sunday sparred over renaming Aurangabad city, with the Uddhav Thackeray-led party saying it is not "secular" behaviour if one finds "cruel and religiously blind" Mughal emperor Aurangzeb "dear".Hitting back, the Congress accused the Sena and the opposition BJP of playing politics over renaming and asked them why they did not they remember the issue while they were in power in Maharashtra for the past five years.Maharashtra Congress president Balasaheb Thorat, however, maintained that the MVA government of the Sena, NCP and Congress in the state is stable.Thorat, who holds Revenue portfolio, also said the government works as per the common minimum programme (CMP) and there is no scope for the "politics of sentiment".Erstwhile allies, the Sena and the BJP, have been pitching for renaming Aurangabad as 'Sambhajinagar' after Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, son of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.Writing for 'Rokhthok', the weekly column in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana', party MP Sanjay Raut said, "secular parties like the Congress are of the view that Aurangabad should not be renamed as Sambhajinagar".He said these parties feel that minority communities like Muslims will not be happy if Aurangabad is renamed and it will affect their vote banks, which will raise questions over their "secular image".Raut stressed that Aurangzeb was not secular but "a cruel" administrator."Aurangzeb was religiously blind and harboured hatred towards other religions," he wrote.Raut stated that the Mughal emperor considered Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as his enemy and killed Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj brutally."There should be no city named after such Aurangzeb at least in Maharashtra. This (demand) is not religious blindness. Call it 'Shivbhakti' (devotion to Shivaji Maharaj), Maharashtra's self-esteem or the sense of history. Prostrating before those who find Aurangzeb dear! This is not secular behaviour!" Raut said.Countering the Sena, Thorat said those who were in power at the Centre and in Maharashtra for the past five years are now playing renaming politics.He asked why did not the parties (read the Shiv Sena and the BJP) remember the renaming issue while they were in power.The Congress leader further said that the Sena and the BJP have let down the people of Aurangabad despite being in power in the municipal corporation."The renaming issue is being raked up now to mislead the local people. Our ally in the state, the Shiv Sena, is worried about its votes. Hence it has initiated this 'Saamana' (match) of renaming," Thorat said.He said pretentiousness is the core attitude of the BJP."The people look at it (BJP...how it behaves and speaks as entertainment," Thorat said.Without naming any party, Thorat further said those who play politics using names of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj need not teach him or his party about the duo."We are Marathi people and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj are our deities. We will not seek votes using our role models and we will strongly oppose if anyone does so," he added.Notwithstanding the differences in views between the two MVA allies on the issue, the revenue minister said that the state government is stable and strong."No one should feel over-joyous (over differences between the allies on the renaming issue)," Thorat added. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-allies-shiv-sena-cong-spar-over-renaming-aurangabad-city-199778
17-01-2021||New Delhi||Some didn’t turn up for COVID-19 vaccination at the last moment in Delhi: Jain||Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Sunday said some people did not turn up for coronavirus vaccination at the last moment, adding that the government cannot ask anyone to compulsorily take the jab.He also said that the number of vaccination centres in Delhi will be increased from 81 to 175 soon.In Delhi, a total of 4,319 healthcare workers - 53.3 per cent of those registered - got the vaccine shots on the first day of the COVID-19 vaccination drive on Saturday, the minister said.Jain noted that a similar trend was observed across the country, adding that around 50 per cent of those registered got the jabs on the first day.“Some people decided not to turn up at the last moment. The vaccination programme is completely voluntary. We cannot ask anyone to compulsorily take the shot even if the person has registered for it,” he said.One “severe” and 51 “minor” cases of AEFI (adverse events following immunisation) were reported among health workers who were administered the coronavirus vaccine in Delhi on Saturday, according to official figures.An AIIMS security guard had developed an allergic reaction after receiving the vaccine. He was kept under observation of doctors, an official had said on Saturday.“His current status is not known... 51 others were discharged after some time,” Jain said.The minister also said that the Delhi government decided to omit vaccination centres of municipal corporations due to the ongoing strike by the civic bodies.“The number of vaccination sites will be increased from 81 to 175 in some days. Thereafter, it will be increased to 1,000. It will also include the sites of municipal corporations,” he said.On some political parties questioning the efficacy of the vaccines, Jain said the Centre gave permission for emergency use of the vaccines after completing a rigorous process.“All protocols were followed. So, there should be no questions about it,” he said.The health minister added that the COVID-19 positivity rate has come down to 0.44 per cent.“The coronavirus positivity rate has remained below 0.5 per cent for the last few days. We can comfortably say that the third wave is on the wane. Cases have decreased. Still, I want to appeal to people to take precautions and use masks,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/some-didnt-turn-up-for-covid-19-vaccination-at-the-last-moment-in-delhi-jain-199777

This development proves that."I welcome the decision", Roy said on her appointment as the state unit vice-president in the reshuffle.Roy, an actor-turned-politician and a leading face in the Mamata Banerjee's cultural brigade, is the third consecutive term Lok Sabha member from Birbhum.She had snatched the Birbhum seat from CPI(M) heavyweight Ram Chandra Dome in 2009 on debut and managed to win it by an overwhelming margin in 2019, even as the BJP had routed the Trinamool Congress in the nearby constituencies.Roy was among the prominent leaders who had joined Banerjee's Singur and Nandigram movement in 2009 that ended the Left Front rule and catapulted the feisty Bengal leader to power in the state.The Birbhum MP had voiced dissent Friday over not being informed about the party events in her constituency which she said caused "mental pain".In a Facebook post she had said that she will inform the public Saturday if she takes any "decision", following which the jittered Trinamool Congress leaders had started reaching out to her.She changed her stance and expressed full confidence in the leadership of Mamata Banerjee and Abhishek Banerjee after meeting the Diamond Harbour MP Friday evening.TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh had also met Roy to dissuade her from leaving the party.After hammering a solution to her grievances, Roy had Saturday praised Abhishek Banerjee, who is nephew of the chief minister, for giving her a patient hearing and said she "is pleased with the way the young leader assured" her of resolving all the issues.Returning satisfied after a two-hour long meeting with Abhishek Banerjee she had made it clear that she will remain with the TMC.She also admonished party colleagues having problems like her to discuss the issues with the party instead of looking for other options.The actor-politician had said it would be "unethical to look for other options" when the party is facing a tough fight.Polls to 294-member Bengal assembly are due in April-May.Banerjee's party is witnessing exodus of its disgruntled leaders to a resurgent saffron party which is making all efforts to win the state after an impressive performance in the 2019 Parliamentary election winning 18 out of 42 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal, only four less than the TMC tally of 22.Last month, Suvendu Adhikari, along with 35 party leaders including five MLAs and an MP, joined the BJP, setting off a churning as several disgruntled leaders rallied behind him.In the rejig in the TMC, the party announced new names for the state committee which included Moazzem Hossain and Shankar Chakraborty in addition to Satabdi Roy.In another significant development, former administrator of Asansol Municipal Corporation and Trinamool leader Jitendra Tiwari, who had voiced discontent over running of the civic board and had even met Suvendu Adhikari and Sunil Mondal on the eve of their joining BJP on December 17, has been removed from the post of district president of Paschim Bardhaman.Tiwari, who had iterated to work for TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee after a meeting with the party leadership in the last week of December, has been replaced by Apurba Mukhopadhyay as the TMC district president."This decision has been taken as I did not take back my resignation letter as the administrator. As an MLA and an ordinary worker, I will continue to serve my organisation," Tiwari said.Asked about the appointment of Roy and other leaders in the state committee and new faces in the district committees, Trinamool Congress Secretary General Partha Chatterjee said "it is an organisational matter"."Why should we discuss this with the media," he said.  --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/miffed-tmc-mp-satabdi-roy-named-state-unit-vice-president-199769
17-01-2021||New Delhi||Government’s biggest priority is to double farmers’ income: Amit Shah||Launching a scathing attack on opposition Congress by accusing it of doing nothing for the welfare of those involved in the agriculture when in power, Union Home Minister and senior BJP leader Amit Shah on Sunday said doubling farmers income was the biggest priority of the Narendra Modi government and that the three central farm laws would ensure manifold hike in their earnings.Shah said, “When the Congress party was in power the agriculture budget of the country was only Rs 21,933 crore, which the Modi government has hiked to Rs 1,34,399 crore for the financial year 2020-21.”Even the Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for several of the farm produces have been hiked manifold, he added.“I want to say that if there is any big priority of the Narendra Modi government it is to double the farmers’ income,” he said.Speaking after laying the foundation stone and inauguration of farmer-friendly projects of the MRN group, headed by newly inducted Karnataka minister Murugesh R Nirani at Kerakalmatti village of Bagalkote in the state, Shah listed out various programmes and initiatives of the Centre for the welfare of the farmers.Noting that during the Congress regime there was only Rs 6 lakh crore available for farm credit, which has currently been increased to Rs 13.92 crore, Shah accused the opposition party for “instigating farmers” to agitate on a non-issue.He also asked the Congress why did it not give farmers Rs 6,000 per year.“The Narendra Modi government is a government dedicated to farmers. Three new laws that the Modi government has brought in will increase farmers’ income multifold,” the home minister said, adding that farmers would no more be compelled to sell their produce at one place and can get access to global and Indian markets of choice for their crops.His remarks came amid the continuing agitation by farmers, especially from Punjab and Haryana, on the borders of Delhi, demanding the repeal of the three laws.Meanwhile, commenting on the developments relating to Jammu & Kashmir, Shah asserted that none had the courage to abrogate provisions under Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution in the past 70 years.“You made Modi the prime minister and on August 5, 2019 he ended Article 370 and Article 35A from Kashmir and connected it with India permanently. Today elections have also happened there peacefully without shedding even a drop of blood and Kashmir has become ours permanently,” he said.Shah also asked people to continue their “support and blessing” for the BJP and Modi so as to continue with the agenda of making “Atmanirbhar Bharat”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/governments-biggest-priority-is-to-double-farmers-income-amit-shah-199765

We are united and committed towards it. Respects to the martyrs with this promise,” the CMO tweeted.Maharashtra claims certain areas, including Belgaum, Karwar and Nippani which are part of Karnataka, contending that the majority of population in these areas is Marathi- speaking.The dispute between the two states over Belgaum and other border areas is pending before the Supreme Court for many years.Thackeray last year appointed Maharashtra ministers Eknath Shinde and Chhagan Bhujbal as co-coordinators to oversee the state government’s efforts to expedite the case related to the boundary dispute.

We have formed a board of experts to take care of the treatment procedure. Let’s see how quickly we can analyse the reason behind her illness and come up with a solution. As of now, she is responding well to the treatment,” the official told PTI.The health department is also consulting vaccine expert Dr Shantunu Tripathy, who was earlier associated with School of Tropical Medicine, he said.Asked if there was any underlying cause, the official said, “No one can say anything for sure as of now. Experts are examining her condition. We have found out that the woman suffers from chronic Asthma and is hypersensitive to a number of drugs.”The nurse was on Saturday admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) of Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital here as she complained of uneasiness and fainted shortly after taking the shot, during the nationwide vaccination programme.“We checked on her this morning and found that all her vital health parameters are normal. Her blood pressure and oxygen saturation levels are also fine. Oxygen support has been removed for the time being. We will soon decide on the next course of action,” the senior official said.Thirteen other ‘Adverse Event Following Immunisation’ (AEFI) cases have also been reported from various parts of the state but “none of those were serious”, the state health department said.“All these vaccine recipients showed minor side effects like increased blood pressure and feverish feeling.They were discharged after preliminary treatment.

Even the pilgrims visiting a few centres located in the region will get the benefit of new trains to Kevadia, he added."Today, Kevadia is no longer a small block located in a remote area of Gujarat but is emerging as the world's biggest tourist destination. More people have started visiting the Statue of Unity compared to the Statue of Liberty. After its inauguration, nearly 50 lakh people have visited it."Despite everything remaining closed for months during coronavirus pandemic, the number of tourists visiting Kevadia is increasing fast," Modi said."It is estimated in a survey that as the connectivity increases, over one lakh people will visit Kevadia daily. A small, beautiful Kevadia is a good example of how economy and ecology can both be developed in a planned manner while saving the environment," Modi said."Tourists visiting the Statue of Unity will get the benefit of this rail connectivity, but this connectivity is going to change the lives of people of Kevadia. It will bring new opportunities of employment and self-employment," he said."This rail line will also connect important places of faith like Karnali, Poicha and Garudeshwar. And it is true that the entire region is filled with spiritual vibration. And with this facility, it is a big gift for those who generally visit here for spiritual reasons," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/statue-of-unity-gets-more-tourists-than-statue-of-liberty-pm-199755

He later informed the police control room.Two motorcycles were among the goods gutted, the sources said adding a staff of Kasaragod railway parcel office has been suspended pending inquiry into lapses if any in booking of the vehicles.According to preliminary assessment, it was suspected one of the bikes could have triggered the fire, the sources said without elaborating further.Later, the train left for its destination after officials, including the Senior Divisional Mechanical Engineer, inspected the luggage van and found it fit for the journey. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fire-in-luggage-van-of-running-train-doused-in-time-in-kerala-199754

Four years back, there was an outbreak of Ebola in Africa and its vaccine by a Canadian pharmaceutical firm which had only completed the phase 1 and undergoing the phase 2 trial, was approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). The risk paid off and the vaccine helped in controlling the Ebola there,” Jadhav added.“In 2009 when the H1N1 pandemic flu struck, we took 1.5 years to develop and receive the approval for the vaccine against it after completing all the stages of clinical trials but the drug manufacturers in the West marketed such products in less than seven months then. Nobody questioned them then. Then why this sudden hullabaloo now?” he queried. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/4-more-covid-19-vaccines-in-different-stages-of-trial-serum-institute-of-india-199752

I used to travel by this narrow gauge line. The funny thing in that journey was the train used to be so slow that you could alight and get in at any place, very comfortably," Modi said."In fact, for some moments, you could walk along with the train, and you felt your (walking) speed was more than the train. I also used to enjoy this sometimes," Modi said, adding the stretch is being converted into broad gauge.Modi said the eight new trains will help boost tourism in the tribal region and increase connectivity to the world's tallest statue, the Statue of Unity, which he inaugurated in October 2018 on the occasion of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's 143rd birth anniversary. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-recalls-slow-train-travel-on-narrow-gauge-line-199751

17-01-2021||Ahmedabad||PM flags off 8 trains to boost connectivity to Statue of Unity||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday flagged off eight trains connecting Gujarat’s Kevadia, where the Statue of Unity of Sardar Patel is located, to different regions of the country.Modi said more tourists flock to the Statue of Unity than the Statue of Liberty in the US, adding nearly 50 lakh tourists have visited the former since it opened in 2018.He referred to the Dedicated Freight Corridor project as “an example of the way things functioned in our country in the past.”“A few days ago, I inaugurated a large section (of the Dedicated Freight Corridor). On this very important project, in eight years work was done only on paper. From 2006 till 2014, not even one km track was laid. Now, in the next few months, 1,100-km work will be completed,” he said.Modi also inaugurated three railway stations and a broad gauge line connecting Dabhoi to Kevadia, via video link on Sunday.The prime minister said this is possibly the first time that so many trains were flagged off at the same time for one destination.With increased connectivity, over one lakh people will visit Kevadia daily in the near future, he said citing a survey.The amount of work done to modernise the country’s railway infrastructure in recent years is unprecedented, Modi said.Unlike in the past when less focus was given to new ways of thinking and technology, wide changes have been made in the railway system on many fronts, with the government’s focus on self-reliance in railway manufacturing and technology being a big reason behind the change, he said.A historic day! Inaugurating various projects relating to Railways in Gujarat. #StatueOfUnityByRail https://t.co/IxiVdLfFdQ  Besides tourists visiting the Statue of Unity, the local populace will be the biggest beneficiary of the new rail connectivity, he said.“Today, Kevadia is no longer a small place in a remote area of Gujarat. It is emerging as the world’s biggest tourist destination,” he said. Despite everything remaining closed for months during coronavirus pandemic, the number of tourists visiting Kevadia is increasing fast, he added.He said the new Kevadia railway station is an example of his government’s efforts to ensure that the Railways remain environment-friendly. “Kevadia station is the country’s first to get green building certification from the beginning,” he said.The Ahmedabad-Kevadia Jan Shatabdi Express, one of the eight trains, is equipped with the Vistadome coache which offers large viewing areas with rooftop glasses and seats for passengers.Modi said the Vistadome coaches on trains to Kevadia will make the travel attractive.The amount of work done to modernise the country’s railway infrastructure in the recent years is unprecedented, he said.Unlike in the past when less focus was given to new thinking and new technology, the approach has changed to make wide changes in the railway system, and changes have taken place at once on many fronts, he said.“With the modernisation of the rail network, parts of the country previously not connected by railway networks are getting connected now. The conversion into broad gauge of old rail routes and electrification is being done much faster than before.“Rail tracks are being made capable for (operating trains at) higher speed. This is the reason it is being made possible to run semi high-speed trains. We are fast moving towards high speed track and technology,” Modi said.“Had we not manufactured high horse-power locomotives in India in the past, then could India run the world’s first double-stack long-hold container train?” he said.“Today, many modern trains made in India are part of the Indian Railways. As we move towards transformation of the Indian Railways, highly-skilled specialised manpower and transformation skill is vital,” he said.The establishment of India’s first deemed railway university in Vadodara is a step in the same direction, he added.The eight trains Modi flagged off will connect Kevadia, which is around 200 km from the state capital Ahmedabad, to Varanasi, Dadar in Mumbai, Ahmedabad,Hazrat Nizamuddin in Delhi, Rewa in Madhya Pradesh, Chennai and Pratapnagar in Vadodara.Modi inaugurated new station buildings of Dabhoi, Chandod and Kevadia, Dabhoi-Chandod gauge converted broad gauge rail line of 18 km, Chandod-Kevadia broad gauge rail line of 32 km and the newly electrified Pratapnagar-Kevadia section of 80 km.

17-01-2021||Ahmedabad||Courts must be open to public scrutiny, criticism: Harish Salve||Senior Supreme Court lawyer Harish Salve has said courts must be open to public scrutiny and criticism as “institutions of governance”.Addressing a lecture organised in Ahmedabad through video conference on Saturday, Salve said criticism of judges, judicial overreach and the manner of functioning is not scandalising courts, and the language in which such criticism is addressed should be treated with a grin.“We today have accepted that judges, or rather courts, and especially constitutional courts, have become institutions of governance. As an institution of governance it must be open to public scrutiny and public criticism,” he said.“We have always accepted that the decisions of courts can be criticised, including in language which may be impolite. So the decisions can be criticised. Can we criticise the decision-making process? Why not?” Salve said.He was addressing the 16th Justice P D Desai Memorial Lecture on ‘Criticism of judiciary, contempt jurisdiction and its use in the age of social media’.“Governance has to be under the sharp blaze of sunlight...in fact, I think a time may come when the Supreme Court may seriously consider a very large number of provisions of the Official Secrets Act, how far do they square with democracy,” he said.Most of them have fallen into disuse, said Salve, who was last year appointed the Queen’s Counsel for the courts of England and Wales.To say an institution has lost its independence, to say that an institution is acting at the behest of someone, to allege corruption—that, if it is established to be untrue, is clearly undermining public faith, Salve added.“This residue of power to deal with those who are capable of influencing public opinion...you may be in public life, influencer.“Those are cases where courts must retain with itself this slender jurisdiction of addressing any rupture in public faith which may be caused,” he said.Salve further said “if we do need the principles of contempt, where do we draw the lines?”The lines must be drawn in a way that the overall system of governance—the institutions and the criticism of the institutions—helps everybody march forward in this march of democracy.“There is one area where I think judges need to be protected. And that area is casting aspersions on an institution in consistent with its character as an independent institution,” the former solicitor general of India said.He said courts need not pay heed to tweets by those who have nothing better to do but to sit with a mobile phone in their hands and pass judgments, specially on things which they do not understand.At the same time, criticism by a politician or those who can influence public opinion raises a different issue, he said.These are the cases “where the courts must retain with itself this slender jurisdiction of addressing any rupture in public faith which may be caused,” he said.He also said the Bar must act against judges and courts being criticised, and must deal with ill-informed criticism as a part of the system.

17-01-2021||New Delhi||‘Sun Dilliye Ni Sun Dilliye’, sung by Mohali sisters on farmers’ agitation, gets thousands hits online||Even as "Sun Dilliye Ni Sun Dilliye", a song written, composed and sung by the two young sisters on the ongoing farmers' agitation continues to grab thousands of hits on social media from people across the world, the duo maintains that while all the praise has been extremely encouraging, what matters most is that people across barriers have been able to relate to it."We never thought that the song (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kEkwK5zS5A) would become so popular. The feedback from everyone has been very kind. However, what is most heartening is the fact that even those involved in the agitation—from leaders to protesters have liked it immensely," says Simrita.While both Simrita and Ramneek have post-graduate degrees in Hindustani classical music, the duo admits that they are not essentially lyricists. "But these circumstances were different. We were deeply troubled by the fact that thousands of farmers were out in the open at a time when we were sitting comfortably in our quilts," says Ramneek.The duo, residents of Mohali, whose parents come from an agricultural background insist that they (parents) have been very quite encouraging. "They have been extremely supportive and happy that we have been singing in support of the protests. In fact, ever since childhood, they have pushed us to find our place in our chosen field," Simrita adds.They feel that the most striking aspect of the movement for them has been the fact that Punjabi mothers have been encouraging their children to go out in this cold and join the protests. "And that says so much -- about their spirit and heart," feels Ramneek. Feeling that social media has been instrumental in making youngsters' join the agitation, Simrita adds that considering its deep penetration among youngsters, it has been successful in presenting multiple facets of the agitation. "It has given so many new perspectives unlike the mainstream media which is struck on a single narrative. Most people of our generation are heavy social media users. It has definitely succeeded in bringing about a very different level of awareness and engagement," stresses Simrita For them, the agitation has 'grown' in different ways in a short while."While during the initial days, we mostly saw the elderly protesting, very soon, a large number of youngsters joined the protests. Interestingly, one sees a sizable number of women protesters," says Ramneek.Talking about the perfect coordination between them, Simrita smiles that it is not limited only to music. She loves to cook, and "I am a foodie," she says. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sun-dilliye-ni-sun-dilliye-sung-by-mohali-sisters-on-farmers-agitation-gets-thousands-hits-online-199734
17-01-2021||New Delhi||Woman DSP a role model for youngsters from Muslim families||Parents in middle-class Muslim families generally believe that their children would hardly get a government job, hence, they find it better to engage them in some work rather than letting them pursuing studies. But a young woman from a middle-class family has busted such myths by becoming the Deputy Superintendent of Police.Shabera Ansari, a resident of Indore, is posted as DSP (Women's Cell) at Dewas in Madhya Pradesh and her father is posted as a Sub-Inspector at a police station in Indore.Shabera said she had a normal childhood and there were never big dreams to pursue. When she went to college, at the age of 19, marriage proposals started coming in but fire in the belly to do something egged her on.Finally, she joined the police forces and became a DSP. Currently, she said, she is preparing for civil services exams.The young woman said that soon after passing her out of a government school in Indore, she enrolled in a college and started preparing for Union Public Service Commission examinations along with her regular studies. She was selected as Sub-Inspector in 2013, and in 2018 posted as Trainee DSP in Sidhi.Shabera's family originally hails from Ballia in Uttar Pradesh, but settled down in Indore about 30 years ago due to his father's job in state police."I was an average student in school and also failed in mathematics once," she told IANS with a chuckle. "A marriage proposal came when I was just 19. I was scared and decided to do something. I started my journey and never looked back. I started preparation for the state government services during college and tasted success in the first attempt... I have continued studying ever since," she said with confidence.   Shabera further added: "My mother always supported me. Initially, it was not clear if I will opt to join the police, though there was always an interest since my father is in police service."Surprisingly, Shabera is the first woman in her family to crack state civil service exam and has now become an inspiration for her community. Many times, she was honoured as chief guest in various functions, including school programmes where she interacted with children who are always curious to know about her journey. "I always try to encourage children and motivate them to do something in life," Shabera said. "Little children seem very fond of taking selfies with me," she smiled.  She said: "I often do counselling of children of Muslim families, especially boys. I tell everyone to trust themselves and study seriously; hardwork will definitely change things." Shabera said she also got to learn a lot from her father. It could be a coincidence that Shabera was incharge of a police station during lockdown where her father was posted. In fact, her father had gone for some work to Uttar Pradesh when the lockdown was imposed, and he got stuck. Shabera tried to somehow bring her father back but to no avail. Eventually, the police authorities issued direction that he could do duty from wherever he was stuck.She said that she had many times gone out on patrol duty at night with her father. However, once back home, she used to cook for him.She said that her father respects her as an officer but Shabera has to many times remind him that she is an officer at office not at home. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/woman-dsp-a-role-model-for-youngsters-from-muslim-families-199730
17-01-2021||New Delhi||Farmers' stir: Fuel pump stations suffer losses at Singhu border||The ongoing farmers' protest along the Delhi borders against the farm laws has started affecting the business operations of the fuel pump stations located in the areas.Petrol pumps located near the Singhu border have been closed since November 26 last year, the day the farmers' agitation began.The fuel stations are estimated to be losing lakhs of rupees everyday. The lack of business is now impacting the salaries of the employees working at the pump stations. As business is nil, the employees' are getting only half of their salaries. There are six petrol pumps on the Singhu border, which are completely closed. In at least 52 days, all the petrol pumps have lost crores of rupees.A staffer of a petrol pump said: "Currently, the pump station has been completely shut since November 26. The workers are waiting for the farmers' agitation to end soon." Even after nine rounds of talks between the government and the farmers, no positive conclusion has been achieved. The petrol pump staff believes that if no solution is attained soon, their problems would further rise.Rajendra Singh, the manager of Om Service Station petrol pump located at Singhu Border, told IANS: "There has been a loss of about 40 lakh rupees in 52 days so far. Unless the traffic is normalised on this route, we would be facing lots of challenges.""We have about 35 employees at this pump and the protest has started showing an impact on the salaries. We have paid the salaries for now, but in case the situation remains similar, we cannot say if we would be able to pay them or not."Supervisor of the Bharat Service Station, Ram Prasad told IANS: "Not a single litre of oil has been sold since November 26. How will the owners pay salaries to the employees if the oil is not sold?""A total of 44 workers are currently working at the pump station. All are hopeful that a solution is found soon and the pump starts again," says Prasad.The employees working at the pump station have now started fearing about the loss of jobs in case the agitation continues. The next round of talks between the farmers' leaders and the government will be held on January 19. And the employees are praying that the agitation comes to an end and their business starts again. Even as the businesses around the Delhi borders are feeling the impact of the agitation, the farmers seem to be unrelenting and steadfast on their demands.The Parliament passed the Farmer Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Price Assurance and Agricultural Services Agreement Act 2020 and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act last year.The farmers are demanding the repeal of the three Acts. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-stir-fuel-pump-stations-suffer-losses-at-singhu-border-199729
17-01-2021||Cuttack||Orissa HC asks woman to hand over baby to his father||The Orissa High Court has allowed a man to take custody of his 15-month-old son observing that continuance of the custody of the toddler with the mother, who is now staying separately, would be detrimental to the child’s mental and physical development and may also affect his psychology negatively.The court direction came after watching a video in which it is seen that the mother was repeatedly torturing and beating the child mercilessly.A Division Bench of Justices S K Mishra and Savitri Ratho on Friday while allowing a writ of Habeas Corpus filed by one Chakradhar Nayak of Puri district directed his wife to hand over the baby boy to his father within seven days.“In case of her failure to do so, the police shall take appropriate steps in taking the child from the physical custody of the mother and handover the child to the father”, the high court directed.“We found from the video that the mother was mercilessly beating the infant on several occasions. Finding the cruelty, torture and assault to the small boy, we directed the police to secure the attendance of the mother along with the child”, the high court said.Married for over five years now, Chakradhar and Rosalin of Paika Sahi under Gop police station have a disturbed marital life and on one previous occasion, the man was imprisoned briefly after his wife brought dowry charges and domestic violence allegations. The case was, however, closed and they were reunited following a court-initiated compromise.The marital discord once again surfaced after the child was born and the woman has since been staying with her parents along with the baby.Later when Chakradhar learnt that Rosalin is torturing the baby and beating the infant to settle scores with her estranged husband, he approached the high court with a habeas corpus writ petition seeking to take possession of his son. Having a retail shop at Bhubaneswar, Chakradhar is now staying with his sister and brother-in-law in the capital city. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/orissa-hc-asks-woman-to-hand-over-baby-to-his-father-199727

17-01-2021||New Delhi||Buddhist Kung Fu nuns kicking hard at centuries-old taboos||They are the Buddhist Kung Fu nuns of Drukpa lineage, known globally for trekking across the Himalayas to clean trash, paddling through mountain rivers to break centuries-old taboos to educate others on women’s health, and adopting martial arts as a way to champion gender equality.They use their skills to teach self-defence to young girls, educate others on human trafficking, and take environmental action never seen before in the region.These fiercely kind Drukpa nuns—aged 9 to 60 years—have been changing the lives of thousands of women in the Himalayas. Now, they are one of three finalists for the world-renowned Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize based in Europe, an honour for outstanding civil service in the defence of human rights.The maroon-robed nuns are from India and train at the Kathmandu-based Druk Amitabha Mountain Nunnery, established by His Holiness the 12th Gyalwang Drukpa, the spiritual head of the 1,000-year-old Drukpa Order based in the Himalayas, as warriors for peace. The Druk Amitabha Mountain Nunnery, located in the hills overlooking Kathmandu in Nepal and the largest in the Himalayas, is a unique instance of gender reversal where the nuns run the administration and perform nearly all the maintenance tasks, including construction work, a job historically reserved for the monks. The nuns, waking up at 3 a.m., except Sundays, practice intensive meditation, perform complex spiritual rituals with ceremonial instruments and dance, and train in martial arts to empower a new generation of young women, besides evolving a connect between climate-related disasters and climate mitigation.Elated over their selection as a finalist by a panel chaired by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe President Rik Daems, nun Jigme Konchok Lhamo told IANS over the phone from the Druk Amitabha Mountain Nunnery that this is a great feat for a group of nuns.“When I was just 12, I was deeply inspired by His Holiness the Gyalwang Drukpa who said that women can do anything by setting an example of empowerment for all,” said Jigme Konchok Lhamo, 25, who has been part of the nunnery for 13 years and rarely visits her family in the Buddhist-dominated Lahaul-Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh.Jigme is the first name of all the nuns of the Drukpa lineage, which means fearless.The Kung Fu nuns, who receive a modern education in addition to their traditional spiritual training, are now gaining worldwide recognition. In 2019, the Kung Fu nuns were awarded the prestigious Asia Society’s Game Changers Award in New York for inspiring and applying their unique talent to make the world a better place. They have also recently received the Atlantic Council’s Unsung Heroes honour in Washington D.C. for their courageous work in gender equality, environmentalism and humanitarian aid.The Kung Fu nuns have devoted their lives to helping their community—advocating for girls, protecting the environment, and serving as first responders during disasters like the 2015 Nepal earthquake by carrying vital aid on their backs. After surviving the deadly 7.9-magnitude earthquake, the nuns famously refused evacuation to help remote villagers who had no other access to help and aid.Another nun, Jigme Migyur Palmo, said they believe in awakening the power every woman has in her.“May more women and girls realize that power is ours and it’s not something given by others,” Palmo told IANS.Just 13 years old and extremely shy when she left her home in Ladakh, Jigme Migyur Palmo is now “fearless” with Jigme in front of her name, and is joined by other nuns in intensive athletic training to build confidence and strength, in learning about climate change, and even participating in events like United Nations climate change conferences.The Drukpa Order of Buddhism that originates from the Himalayas has built a strong history of community action and citizen empowerment for many years.The spiritual leader, His Holiness the Gyalwang Drukpa, has spent much of his life breaking down outdated patriarchal practices that exclude women. His Holiness was honoured by the United Nations with the Millennium Development Goals Award in September 2010 for promoting environmental education and gender equality. The Gyalwang Drukpa’s international foundation, ‘Live to Love’, has built numerous schools, medical clinics, heritage preservation projects, and earthquake-resistant homes in the Himalayas. As the on-ground partners of ‘Live to Love’, the Kung Fu Nuns spearhead many ongoing projects, including disaster relief and teaching young girls to defend themselves against violence. Most recently, they have helped mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in India and Nepal, providing neglected villages with critical food by harvesting their own vegetables, supplies, and also imparting hygiene education. They have also begun groundbreaking education on women’s menstruation and distributing sanitary products in regions where women are often punished for discussing health.

PTIManish Kumar, the first Indian to be inoculated (with Covaxin) at AIIMS, said there was nothing to be scared of.Three hours after he got the shot, he said he was feeling fine. “The vaccine delivery was painless and there were no side-effects or breathing troubles,” he said.Dr Reddy’s gets nod for Sputnik Ph-3 trialAIIMS Director Randeep Guleria and NITI Aayog Member (Health) VK Paul took the Covaxin shot after Manish and urged everyone to “embrace the vaccine.”Security guards to Serum Institute chief Adar Poonawala, several Indians took the Covid vaccine, boosting public confidence and saying the vaccine was the only hope against Covid and for economic recovery.30 crore at-risk people to be covered by July | Haryana reports 13 adverse events | Delhi 52, including one seriousIn an isolated case, resident doctors at RML, a central government hospital, voiced concerns about Covaxin saying they wanted Covishield.Eleven states (Assam, Bihar, Delhi, Haryana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and UP) received both Covaxin and Covishield stocks and had the freedom to allocate vaccines across sites.The rest of the states, including Punjab, HP, J&K, Ladakh, Uttarakhand and Chandigarh, received only Covishield. Earlier today, the PM was teary eyed remembering the previous year when mothers were separated from children and families could not perform last rites of the deceased as Covid played havoc with lives.“These vaccines will give us a decisive victory in our fight against Covid,” the PM said, hailing Indian scientists as “saints” and terming the Indian resolve against the virus as one of confidence and self-reliance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/64-health-workers-take-jab-poor-show-in-punjab-199544
17-01-2021||Chandigarh||Will challenge NIA notices, say farmers||In response to NIA summons to several activists associated with the farmers’ protest, union leaders today claimed the move was a government tactic to scuttle their agitation. They said they would move the court.Baldev Singh Sirsa, president, Lok Bhalai Insaf Welfare Society, said he would not appear before the NIA on Sunday due to a prior engagement. “Having failed to corner the farmers through other means, the government is now trying to intimidate us through the NIA,” he said.Replace agri panel members: plea in SCThe Bhartiya Kisan Union (Lokshakti) on Saturday requested the SC to remove the remaining three members of the committee set up to resolve the impasse over the 3 farm laws and select people who can do the job “on the basis of mutual harmony”. It pointed out that those on the panel had already backed the laws. PTIThe agency had yesterday sent notices to over 12 farm leaders, Sikh activists and journalists, asking them to appear before it as witnesses in a case against SFJ’s legal adviser Gurpatwant Singh Pannun and his aides.In fresh summons, actor Dave Sidhu has been asked to appear on January 17.In the same case, Amritsar-based Ranjit Singh, senior vice-president of Sikh Youth Federation Bhindranwale, and Paramjit Akali, a leader of Sikh Youth Power of Punjab and UK-based Jasveer Singh, a Punjabi TV journalist, have also been summoned.In a statement, the Sanyukta Kisan Morcha said, “The issue of NIA notices was raised with the government in the last meeting. The ministers had said they would look into the concerns. Despite that people have received NIA notices. This is shameful. We will take legal action in the matter in the coming days.”SGPC chief Bibi Jagir Kaur flayed the Union Government for “misusing” laws to suppress the peaceful struggle. Mehbooba Mufti, PDP chief, said, “The government’s pet agency (NIA) is now being unleashed on farmers. The rot that has set into India’s premier agency can be gauged from the manner in which they are fabricating charges on those who dare to dissent.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-challenge-nia-notices-say-farmers-199545

We are able to settle our own problems,” Gyawali said when asked about a Chinese delegation landing in Kathmandu recently to sort out differences between two factions of the Nepal Communist Party.“As a close neighbour, there may be some concerns or questions but we never accept interference,” he added, describing Nepal’s relations with both India and China as excellent.Though Gyawali could not meet PM Modi, who was stated to be busy with the all-India launch of the Covid vaccine, he called on Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.There was no firm commitment on the supply of vaccines despite hopes in Kathmandu when he began his three-day visit to India. The Foreign Minister said affordability, availability and promptness in supply as well as compatible infrastructure to store the vaccines in Nepal would determine their procurement.On the boundary issue, he said the sanctity and security of the border was extremely important for expanding the overall developmental cooperation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-not-accept-interference-in-internal-politics-nepal-fm-199548
17-01-2021||New Delhi||Traders’ body moves Supreme Court against privacy policy of WhatsApp||Amid demands for the rollback of WhatsApp’s new privacy policy, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court on Saturday seeking protection of citizens’ right to privacy.The petitioner, Confederation of All-India Traders (CAIT), sought a direction to the government to restrain WhatsApp and Facebook from storing and utilising the works transmitted through the messaging service for any purpose.Demands technical auditsIt also urged the top court to direct the two companies to allow the Centre to carry out technical audits of their centres where the data of Indian users are stored, so as to retrieve and delete it.The petitioner demanded that WhatsApp should be directed to withdraw its controversial privacy policy and frame guidelines to govern its data sharing with Facebook. Due to this updated policy, the users will now have to compulsorily share all information that WhatsApp collects, which includes information about the user’s activity on their services, like service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, it pointed out.WhatsApp has already announced delaying by three months the implementation of its new privacy policy that has caused concern among millions of users, many of whom started to move to its rivals, such as Signal and Telegram. It was originally scheduled to come into effect on February 8.The petitioner accused the Centre of failing to discharge its constitutional duty of protecting the privacy of citizens.“The Centre has failed to impose necessary and restrictive conditions in the case. On the proposed policy of WhatsApp, European Union’s Antitrust Authority had imposed serious restrictions and fines of 110 million euros in 2017,” read the CAIT petition.In 2016, Germany, England and the entire European Union had prohibited similar action of Facebook, which was also asked to delete all data relating to WhatsApp users, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/traders-body-moves-supreme-court-against-privacy-policy-of-whatsapp-199549

Both the purpose for which it has been created as well as the way it has been administered have left a number of questions unanswered," they said in the letter."It is essential that the position and stature of the Prime Minister is kept intact by ensuring total transparency in all dealings the Prime Minister is associated with," they said.The letter was signed by former IAS officers Anita Agnihotri, S P Ambrose, Sharad Behar, Sajjad Hassan, Harsh Mander, P Joy Oommen, Aruna Roy, former diplomats Madhu Bhaduri, K P Fabian, Deb Mukharji, Sujatha Singh and former IPS officers A S Dulat, P G J Nampoothiri and Julio Ribeiro among others.In March last year, the Centre set up the Prime Minister's Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM-CARES) Fund with the primary objective to deal with any kind of emergency situation like the one currently posed by the COVID-19 outbreak and provide relief to those affected. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/100-former-civil-servants-raise-questions-over-transparency-in-pm-cares-fund-199398
17-01-2021||New Delhi||Farmer union in SC: Remove remaining members of panel on agri laws, select new people||A farmer union requested the Supreme Court on Saturday to remove the remaining three members of the committee it had set up to resolve the impasse over the three contentious farm laws, and select people who can do the job “on the basis of mutual harmony”.The Bhartiya Kisan Union Lokshakti said the principle of natural justice is going to be violated as those appointed to the four-member committee “have already supported these laws”.In an affidavit, it also sought dismissal of a plea of the central government, filed though the Delhi Police, seeking an injunction against the proposed tractor march or any other kind of protest by farmers which seeks to disrupt the gathering and celebrations of Republic Day on January 26.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde had agreed to hear on January 18 the Centre’s application against the proposed tractor march.The Bhartiya Kisan Union Lokshakti is one of the 40-odd farmer unions spearheading the agitation on various border points of Delhi for about 50 days now, demanding repeal of the farm laws.In an “extraordinary” interim order, the top court had stayed the implementation of the new farm laws till further orders and had constituted the four-member committee to listen to the grievances and make recommendations to resolve the impasse.The committee comprised Bhupinder Singh Mann, national president of Bhartiya Kisan Union; Dr Parmod Kumar Joshi, Director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute; Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices; and Anil Ghanwat, president of Shetkari Sanghatana.However, on January 14, Mann recused himself from the committee.The Bhartiya Kisan Union Lokshakti, in its reply filed through lawyer A P Singh, urged the top court “to remove all these three members from the committee and appoint those persons who make the report on the basis of mutual harmony....”“It is important to mention here with great regret that the principle of natural justice is going to be violated by making these persons as members of the committee.... how they will hear all farmers on equal parameters when they have already supported these laws,” it said.On the issue of the Delhi Police seeking injunction against the tractor rally, it said prohibitory orders under CrPC Section 144 were already in place in the New Delhi area.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi for over a month now against the three laws—the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act.Enacted in September 2020, the government has presented these laws as major farm reforms aimed at increasing farmers’ income, but the protesting farmers have raised concerns that these legislations would weaken the minimum support price (MSP) and “mandi” (wholesale market) systems and leave them at the mercy of big corporations.The government has maintained that these apprehensions are misplaced and has ruled out a repeal of the laws.

However, the clinical efficacy of the vaccine was yet to be established and it was still being studied in phase 3 clinical trials, the vaccine maker said.“Hence it is important to appreciate that receiving the vaccine does not mean that other precautions related to COVID-19 need not be followed,” the consent form said.According to an industry expert, the company is liable to pay compensation to people in case of serious side effects as the vaccine is being administered while in the clinical trial mode.The central licensing authority has granted permission for the sale or distribution of Covaxin for restricted use in emergency situations in public interest as an abundant caution, in clinical trial mode.Meanwhile, Suchitra Ella, joint managing director, Bharat Biotech International Limited, on her Twitter account said: “Covaxin & Bharat Biotech is truly humbled & honoured to be of service to the nation & the fraternity of all first responders of covid who have served public health.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bharat-biotech-to-pay-compensation-if-covaxin-causes-side-effects-199362
17-01-2021||New Delhi||All you need to know about India's 2 Covid vaccines||Amid the rollout of the world's largest Covid-19 vaccination programme by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, here are a few things that you need to know about the two vaccines—'Covaxin' and 'Covishield'—selected by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).So far, the government has procured 1.1 crore Covishield and 55 lakh Covaxin vaccines at a cost of Rs 200 and Rs 206 per dose, respectively.Covaxin, developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech, is the country's first indigenous vaccine against the virus, and it has been developed with the help of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology.Covaxin uses an inactivated form of the coronavirus. It destroys the ability of the virus to multiply in the human body and increases the immunity system to fight the virus.The adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) of Covaxin include injection site pain, swelling, headache, fatigue, fever, body ache, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, among others.On the other hand, the Oxford University and AstraZeneca have developed Covishield, which has been manufactured by Serum Institute of India in Pune.Covishield is stored and transported at a refrigeration temperature of 2-8 degree Celsius. The vaccine has shown an average efficacy of 70.4 per cent in a pooled analysis of interim data from late-stage trials published in The Lancet.The vaccine is made by taking a common cold virus called an adenovirus from chimpanzees and deleting about 20 per cent of the virus's instructions. It also follows the genetic instructions programmed into it by its developers to successfully provoke a strong immune response.For Covishield, possible adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) are injection site tenderness, headache, fatigue, myalgia, malaise, pyrexia, chills and arthralgia, and nausea.Currently, India is banking on two vaccines and four more in the pipeline to be rolled out in the country, according to Prime Minister Modi. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-you-need-to-know-about-indias-2-covid-vaccines-199348

Indian vaccine scientists, our medical system and rigour has respect and credibility in the world. We have earned this credibility with our track record,” the Prime Minister said. “The country has awaited this day eagerly for months. Everyone wanted to know when the COVID vaccine will come. The vaccine is here and in a very short time,” he added.“Today, a grateful nation returns that favour and repays that loan by ensuring that health-care workers get the first shots,” Modi said while kicking off one-of-a-kind vaccine drive in human history.Detailing its scale, the Prime Minister while over a hundred countries had a population of less than three crore, India aimed to cover three crore people in the first phase of the inoculation.“Never has such a scale of vaccination been run ever in history. You can imagine the scale from the first phase. More than hundred nations have less than three crore population and india is vaccinating three crore in phase one,” Modi said.“Do not make the mistake of taking one shot and forgetting another. There will be a 28-day gap. You must remember that two weeks after the second dose, you will get the necessary protection from COVID. Don’t become casual affer the jab,” he reiterated.The Prime Minister also said only three nations — India, China and the US — have a population of more than 30 crore, a number India will target in the first two phases of the vaccination, which will cover one crore health workers and two crore frontline workers in the first phase, and 27 crore 50-plus people and under 50-years category with co-morbid conditions.The Prime Minister asked people to take the benefit of the vaccines saying the world trusted Indian scientific rigour.“Today the scientists, and those associated with the vaccine deserve our special gratitude as they were engaged in vaccine development day in and day not through festivals,” Modi said. “This trust will be strengthened further as we conduct the COVID-19 drive, a process that will take a long year, but we just show the same self-confidence and self-reliance through the inoculation drive as we showed during our fight against the pandemic last year,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, quoting national poet Ramdhari Singh Dinkar “maanavvl jan zor lagaata hai, pathar paani ban jaata hai”.To boost confidence among the countrymen about the vaccine, the Prime Minister also cited Telegu legend Apparao, who had said a nation was built on people and not bricks.“We must give back to society,” the PM said.After he launched the drive, New Delhi AIIMS kicked off the process by inoculating sanitation worker Manish, followed by Nursing Officer Dhawal Dwivedi, institute Director Randeep Guleria and NITI Aayog Member (Health)VK Paul.Simultaneously, the drive rolled out across the country at 3,006 chosen locations — where 100 beneficiaries each will be covered today — taking the total number of vaccinated to three lakh by this evening, if all the three lakh registered Heath workers turn up to take their shots.Modi said scientists and experts had given permission for emergency use of the made-in-India vaccines only after being absolutely sure of their safety and the people should be aware of any propaganda and rumours.The made-in-India vaccines would ensure a “decisive victory” for the country over the coronavirus pandemic, he asserted.The process is voluntary.The first shot to be administered today was the indigenously made Bharat Biotech-ICMR’s COVAXIN.Earlier, the Prime Minister recalled the dark days following the pandemic outbreak and said: “Today, I am remembering the days when everyone wanted to do something but did not have a way. Children had to live apart from mothers. Mothers cried and couldn’t do anything. Many elders were battling the disease all by themselves. We could not even see off the departed in traditional ritualistic ways.”“The more we think of those days the more anguished we feel. But friends, in that same atmosphere of crisis, someone was weaving webs of hope. Someone was putting their lives at risk for our safety — our doctors, nurses, parade coal staff, Asha workers, ambulance drivers and sarai Karamcharis.  They gave their role of service to society a priority — they stayed apart from families, did not go home for days. Several friends never came back home. This is why the society is repaying its loan and gratitude by giving the first doses to health workers today. COVID-19 vaccines are a tribute of a grateful nation to health workers,” the Prime Minister said teary eyed.While all 100 beneficiaries at New Delhi AIIMS are being given COVAXIN shots, the 100 beneficiaries being vaccinated at PGI, Chandigarh, are being adminstered Covishield.States have been given both vaccines and the choice of allocation to session sites has been left to the states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-launches-covid-vaccine-drive-aiims-sanitation-worker-first-to-get-indigenous-covaxin-shot-199312
17-01-2021||United Nations||At 18 million, India has largest diaspora in the world: UN||The Indian diaspora, one of the most “vibrant and dynamic”, is the largest in the world, with 18 million people from the country living outside their homeland in 2020, the UN has said.The United Arab Emirates, the US and Saudi Arabia host the largest numbers of migrants from India, it said.“India has the largest transnational population in the world. It has the most migrants abroad - 18 million, which is a significant number and another feature which is very interesting about the Indian migrant population is that they're really distributed all over the globe,” Population Affairs Officer in the Population Division at UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) Clare Menozzi told PTI in an interview on Friday.Menozzi said while some transnational populations are really clustered in one country or region, the Indian diaspora is present in all continents and regions - from the Gulf to Northern America to Australia, UK.“It's a very vibrant” and dynamic diaspora in the world, she said.The report, ‘International Migration 2020 Highlights’, by the Population Division of UN DESA, released on Friday said in 2020, 18 million people from India were living outside of their country of birth.Other countries with a large diaspora included Mexico and Russia (11 million each), China (10 million) and Syria (8 million).The report said India's large diaspora is distributed across a number of major countries of destination, with the UAE (3.5 million), the US (2.7 million) and Saudi Arabia (2.5 million) hosting the largest numbers of migrants from India.Other countries hosting large numbers of migrants from India included Australia, Canada, Kuwait, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar and the UK.Between 2000 and 2020, the size of the migrant population abroad grew for nearly all countries and areas of the world. India experienced the largest gain during that period at nearly 10 million, followed in order of magnitude by Syria, Venezuela, China and the Philippines.Migration from India is largely motivated by labour and family reasons, Director of Population Division at UN DESA John Wilmoth told reporters at the launch of the report here, adding that forced displacement is a much smaller category (about 10 per cent) in the total.Menozzi said the Indian diaspora is comprised predominantly of people who are working, but also students and people who moved for family reasons.She said there is a very large presence of migrants who are born in India, in the Gulf countries where they are playing a central role in the economic prosperity of the countries, working in construction, hospitality and care services. The diverse Indian diaspora also includes highly-skilled scientists, engineers and doctors.The US remained by far the largest country of destination of international migrants with 51 million migrants in 2020, equal to 18 per cent of the world's total. Germany hosted the second largest number of migrants worldwide at around 16 million, followed by Saudi Arabia (13 million), Russia (12 million) and the UK (9 million).The report said preliminary estimates suggested that COVID-19 pandemic might have slowed the growth in the stock of international migrants by around two million by mid-2020, 27 per cent less than the growth expected since mid-2019.The report said growth in the number of international migrants has been robust over the last two decades, reaching 281 million people living outside their country of origin in 2020, up from 173 million in 2000 and 221 million in 2010. Currently, international migrants represent about 3.6 per cent of the world's population.Between 2000 and 2020, the number of migrants grew in 179 countries or areas. Germany, Spain, Saudi Arabia, UAE and the US gained the largest number of migrants during that period. By contrast, in 53 countries or areas, the number of international migrants declined between 2000 and 2020. Armenia, India, Pakistan, Ukraine and Tanzania were among the countries that experienced the most pronounced declines.In many cases, the declines resulted from the old age of the migrant populations or the return of refugees and asylum seekers to their countries of origin.In terms of regional migration corridors, between 2000 and 2020, some regional migration corridors grew very rapidly. The corridor Central and Southern Asia to Northern Africa and Western Asia grew the most, with 13 million migrants added between 2000 and 2020; more than tripling in size."The majority of that increase resulted from labour migration from Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka to the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC),” the report said.It noted that while it is too soon to understand the full extent, the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 may have slowed the growth of this regional migration corridor. In many GCC countries, thousands of migrant workers in the construction, hospitality, retail and transportation sectors lost their jobs due to the pandemic and were required to return home.The report said according to World Bank projections, the COVID-19 pandemic may reduce the volume of remittances sent to low-and middle-income countries from USD 548 billion in 2019 to USD 470 billion in 2021, a decline of 14 per cent.Menozzi said India is the main country of recipient of remittances worldwide and in 2019 received USD 83 billion in remittances from its diaspora. The World Bank projects that in 2020, the amount will decline by around 9 per cent to about USD 76 billion.

17-01-2021||---||TRP scam: Damning Arnab, ex-BARC boss chats leaked||New Delhi, January 15A supplementary chargesheet filed by the Mumbai Police in the ongoing TRP scam alleges that the now arrested ex-chief executive officer of the Broadcast Audience Research Council, Partho Dasgupta, used his position to help Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami maintain TRP lead.The chargesheet has 500 pages of WhatsApp conversations between Arnab and Dasgupta. Parts of the chats, which created ripples on the social media today, reveal Dasgupta allegedly told Arnab that the new Telecom Regulatory Authority of India proposal to reform the TRP measurement mechanism could “harm both the Republic TV and BJP”.The conversation is dated March 25, 2019, with Dasgupta sending Arnab a confidential BARC letter on WhatsApp to say he had jammed the NBA, and asking for Arnab’s help through the PMO. In response, Arnab promises, “Noted and will happen.” The Republic TV chief then says he is meeting the PM coming Thursday.Sharing snapshots of the chats on the social media, advocate Prashant Bhushan tweeted: “The leaked WhatsApp chats of #ArnabGoswami are far more explosive than #RadiaTapes. They show the unholy nexus of media with those in power; It shows how TRP is manipulated; It shows how cynically fake news is propagated; Above all, it lays bare the prime Dalal of Dalali street!”Bhushan said the chats showed “unprecedented access to power in this government.” Several netizens questioned the chats which reveal the alleged role of Dasgupta in convincing Arnab to thwart the TRAI proposal of measuring TV viewership digitally through a specially installed software in a set-top box.The conversations reveal the proximity between Dasgupta and Arnab with the former writing to Arnab on May 5, 2017, “Best wishes boss from my heart and not from BARC. I really want you to succeed. “Arnab replies to the thread, saying, “Life is so strange Partho. Had you not met me in Delhi, I would have been languishing in NDTV.” Another chat dated July 18, 2017 has Dasgupta asking Arnab who the next Information and Broadcasting Minister would be and Arnab replying: “Smriti…Was worried about J.”Another chat reveals Dasgupta asking Arnab if he could get him a media adviser’s role in the PMO. Yet another conversation has Arnab telling the ex-BARC chief: “The PM is being dealt differently.” The chats became public on a day when the Mumbai Police told the Bombay HC it would not take coercive action against Goswami till January 29 in the TRP case.TRAI PROPOSAL THAT WAS NOT TO BEThe TRAI proposal (which Dasgupta allegedly asked Arnab to get nixed using his influence with the PMO) to digitally measure TRPs ultimately fell through after several TV channels resisted it, saying the installation of an automatic digital measurement software would cost a lot. TRPs continue to be measured manually through meters installed in households.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trp-scam-damning-arnab-ex-barc-boss-chats-leaked-198981
