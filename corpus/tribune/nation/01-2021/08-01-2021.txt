08-01-2021||New Delhi||Wise course is to keep unpopular farm laws in abeyance: Chidambaram||Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Friday said he was saddened that the government “refuses to relent” on the farmers’ demands and asked whether its meetings with the protesters are aimed at tiring them out.He also stressed that the farm laws be kept in abeyance and a fresh start be made by talking to all stakeholders.“Saddened that the government remains as adamant as ever and refuses to relent. The wise course is to keep the unpopular farm laws in abeyance and start talking to all stakeholders on a clean slate,” he said on Twitter.The former finance minister said any legal reform of agricultural produce marketing must be based on the widespread consultation and not through “midnight ordinances”.“If the government has nothing to offer, why has it asked for another meeting with the farmers’ organisations? Is it a tactic to tire the protesters by asking them to remain in the bitter cold for another week,” he asked.“Our thoughts and prayers are with the farmers protesting at Singhur on the border of Delhi,” he also said.Farmers are protesting at Delhi borders for over a month now, demanding a repeal of the farm laws and over 60 of them have died during the protest.The government’s negotiations with farm unions to end the agitation appeared heading nowhere at the eighth round of talks on Friday as the Centre ruled out repealing the three contentious laws claiming nationwide support for reforms while the farmer leaders said they are ready to fight till death and their ‘ghar waapsi’ will happen only after ‘law waapsi’.The next meeting has been fixed for January 15, amid indications that any headway will now depend on a Supreme Court hearing scheduled for January 11 on a batch of petitions related to the protest.

08-01-2021||Beijing||Indian students must continue online classes, as China denied permission for flights: Indian Embassy||China has denied permission for India to operate chartered flights citing reinforced strict COVID-19 measures, the Indian Embassy here said, advising Indian students studying in Chinese universities to continue their online classes.The Embassy continues to take up the matter with Chinese authorities about the Indian students but there has unfortunately been “no positive evolution of this situation”, an Embassy press release here said on Friday.“In fact, with reports of resurgence of COVID-19 cases in China, authorities have further reinforced epidemic controls and restrictions on travel and entry into China. The suspension of visas of Indian nationals issued before November 2, 2020 is an instance of these enhanced controls,” it said.“Chinese authorities have also denied permission for operation of any chartered flights between India and China, citing their strict control measures,” the Embassy said.Over 23,000 Indians study in Chinese universities, mostly the medical stream.Most of them are stuck in India as they await permission for their colleges to reopen. “While the Embassy continues to follow this issue keenly, it has been repeatedly advised by Chinese authorities that the restrictions in place are not likely to be relaxed in the coming months and that students studying in China should be advised accordingly with respect to their studies for the next semester, which are likely to continue only through online means,” the statement said.“While the Embassy is aware of the difficulty of undertaking courses in medicine in online format, Indian students enrolled in Chinese universities are advised to take note of the restrictions currently in place and make appropriate arrangements for continuing their education,” it said.“All Indian students are advised to continue to monitor the websites of Indian Embassy/Consulate(s) in China and also our social media channels to remain updated about the evolving situation with respect to the prospects of their return to China”, it said.“They should also remain in touch with their universities for any updates. They may also follow the websites of the Chinese Embassy in Delhi as well as those of Chinese Consulates in India on this issue,” the press release added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-students-must-continue-online-classes-as-china-denied-permission-for-flights-indian-embassy-195614
08-01-2021||London||Judgement day in Nirav Modi UK extradition case on February 25||The judgement day for whether wanted diamond merchant Nirav Modi can be extradited to India to face charges of fraud and money laundering in relation to the Punjab National Bank scam case has been set as February 25.District Judge Samuel Goozee confirmed the timeline on Friday, at the end of closing submissions in the case at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London.The wanted diamond merchant remains remanded in custody and will appear for a routine 28-day remand hearing via videolink in the interim on February 5.Earlier on Friday, the judge heard that Modi is responsible for overseeing a "ponzi-like scheme" that caused enormous fraud to PNB.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities, focussed on laying out the prima facie case of fraud, money laundering and perverting the course of justice against the 49-year-old jeweller, who followed the proceedings on the second day of a two-day hearing via videolink from a room at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London.The court was taken through evidence already presented before Westminster Magistrates' Court in London during the course of several hearings last year in order to wrap up the extradition hearing this week.“The simple and stark fact is that he (Nirav Modi) used his three partnership companies to acquire billions of dollars worth of credit which was entirely unsecured and LoUs [letters of undertaking] were issued for wholly bogus trade,” said CPS barrister Helen Malcolm, appearing via videolink for the part-remote court proceedings due to the coronavirus lockdown.“While the defence claims this is a mere commercial dispute, there is a plethora of evidence to point to a ponzi-like scheme where new LoUs were used to repay old ones,” she said.A ponzi scheme typically refers to an investment scam which generates funds for earlier investors with money taken from later investors and the CPS sought to establish that Modi used his firms – Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds – to make fraudulent use of PNB's LoUs in a conspiracy with banking officials.Malcolm's arguments also reiterated previous evidence of a video by a former employee claiming to have received death threats from Modi and dummy directors of shell companies being forced to leave India to evade the investigations launched by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED).“These directors were pressured to get them further out of the way from the Indian investigation,” noted Malcolm.Drawing Justice Goozee's attention to “genuine and bona fide charges” filed against Modi in India, she stressed that the judge need only to satisfy himself on whether there is a prima facie case against Modi to be extradited to stand trial on the charges.Modi's defence team, led by barrister Clare Montgomery, in her counter-arguments has challenged that premise because it would approach the case with an “extremely broad brush”.“It requires proper analysis as to why the offences cannot amount to an allegation of bank fraud, as there is no case of operative deception,” said Montgomery, referring to expert evidence on Indian law given by former Indian High Court Judge Abhay Thipsay last year.She also sought to establish that the entire process comprised of “authorised though ill-advised lending” that took place in “broad daylight” and none of her client's actions met the legal threshold of perverting the course of justice.On Thursday, the judge heard detailed arguments from both sides about why Modi's“deteriorating” mental health condition does or does not meet the Section 91 threshold of the Extradition Act 2003 – which has most recently been used in the UK to block the extradition of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on the grounds of it being “unjust and oppressive” as he is a high suicide risk.“As in the Assange case, the issues here evidentially are the same – the mental condition of Modi and the treatment he would receive given the prison conditions in India,” said Montgomery, pointing to her client's severe depression and risk of suicide due to his lengthy incarceration since March 2019 and called for his discharge.The CPS challenged the defence stance to say that the two cases were of a “completely different nature” and instead sought an adjournment in the event that Section 91 was to be engaged, to allow an independent evaluation of medical records by a consultant psychiatrist and appropriate assurances be acquired in terms of his care in India.Modi is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of LoUs or loan agreements, and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud. He also faces two additional charges of "causing the disappearance of evidence" and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death” added to the CBI case.The jeweller has been in prison since he was arrested on March 19, 2019, on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard and his attempts at seeking bail have been repeatedly turned down. ---  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/judgement-day-in-nirav-modi-uk-extradition-case-on-february-25-195608

08-01-2021||New Delhi||Second dry run of COVID inoculation conducted, Vardhan says vaccines to be made available in next few days||The second mock drill on COVID-19 vaccination was conducted on Friday in 736 districts across 33 states and union territories with Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, who oversaw the dry run in Tamil Nadu, saying inoculating the country's entire population would soon become a reality.He said vaccines would be made available in the next few days and those at risk such as healthcare professionals would be given priority.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), on the other hand, issued guidelines to all aircraft operators who plan to transport COVID-19 vaccines packed in dry ice to various parts of the country.If vaccines packed in dry ice is being transported in the passenger cabin of an aircraft, then the flight crew should be properly trained on the hazards and risks of its transportation, the aviation regulator noted.Dry ice transforms into carbon dioxide gas at temperatures higher than -78 degrees Celsius under normal atmospheric pressure and, therefore, it is classified as "dangerous goods" by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), it said.The health ministry said the objective of the mock drill was to simulate the actual vaccine administration event. The entire planning of the vaccination drive including beneficiary registration, microplanning and vaccination at the planned session sites was tested under the leadership of district collector or district magistrate.  The dry run also aimed to familiarise the state, district, block and hospital level officers on all aspects of COVID-19 roll-out.  After reviewing the dry run at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in Chennai, Vardhan said the Centre has started a new COVID platform to track particulars of potential vaccine beneficiaries and also issue electronic certificates to them.India, he said, has done extremely well in developing vaccines in the shortest possible time."We are in the process of ensuring that in the next few days, also in the near future, we should be able to give this vaccines to our countrymen, starting with of course prioritising those who are most at risk, our health professionals, healthcare workers in the public and private sector followed by frontline workers," he added.Vardhan also visited the Government Omandurar Hospital in Chennai and a few other centres.He said the Integrated Vaccine Complex of HLL Biotech Limited (HBL), which has remained non-functional for six months, would soon be optimally utilised to produce COVID-19 vaccines.The government has spent over Rs 600 crore to establish the state-of-the-art facility at Chengalpattu, he said.HBL is a 100 per cent subsidiary of HLL Lifecare Limited, a government of India Enterprise under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.Meanwhile, the Indian Medical Association has appealed to all its members to actively participate in the COVID-19 vaccination drive across the country."As you all are aware of the COVID-19 vaccine being made available in the immediate future, it becomes our natural responsibility to assist the vaccination drive in a professional way," the doctors' body said in a statement."With the vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 at our doorsteps, it is worth remembering that indigenous vaccines have been developed after the tireless efforts of Indian scientists in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Institute of Virology (NIV)," it said.The first nationwide mock drill was held on January 2 which, the health ministry said, helped to iron out any glitches in the final execution and further refinement of the operational procedures.India's drugs regulator has approved Oxford COVID-19 vaccine Covishield, being manufactured by the Serum Institute, and indigenously developed Covaxin of Bharat Biotech for restricted emergency use in the country.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with chief ministers of all states on Monday to discuss the COVID-19 situation and the vaccination roll-out in the country, the PMO said. On Thursday, Vardhan interacted with the health ministers and principal secretaries and additional chief secretaries of all states and union territories through video conference to review the preparedness for the mock drill. He The drill was held at three session sites of 736 districts across 33 states and union territories.In Maharashtra, where the drive was conducted in 32 of the 36 districts, Health Minister Rajesh Tope said there are still "some areas in the overall system where we need to improve efficiency in terms of data updating, delivery of SMS and training the local staff for inoculation".Karnataka Health Minister K Sudhakar said the state is expected to receive 13,90,000 vials of COVID-19 vaccine in a day or two, and it is likely to be administered from January 11."We have registered 6.30 lakh healthcare professionals in Karnataka till date. Those who are left out, may be in some medical or dental colleges, we have requested them to register," he told reporters after visiting a private hospital in Bengaluru where the dry run was conducted. --- PTINNNN||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/second-dry-run-of-covid-inoculation-conducted-vardhan-says-vaccines-to-be-made-available-in-next-few-days-195603
08-01-2021||---||SC puts off hearing on plea against “forced” sacramental confessions in Church||New Delhi, January 8 Five women have moved the Supreme Court against compulsory practice of sacramental confession in certain Churches in Kerala, contending that it violated their fundamental right to freedom of religion under Article 25 of the Constitution.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde on Friday put off hearing on the petition by three weeks after senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, representing the petitioners, sought time to bring on record certain additional material.Rohatgi said the issue raised important constitutional questions as to if such mandatory confession was an essential religious practice and if it violated the petitioners’ right to privacy.Earlier, the Supreme Court on December 14 issued notices to the Centre, Kerala Government and 11 Malankara Syrian Church bodies on a petition challenging the practice of mandatory confessions in the Church in the southern state. It issued the notices after senior advocate Sanjay Parikh submitted that the top court had earlier restrained Kerala High Court from passing orders on issues related to this church. Petitioner Mathew T Matgachan, Shaj PJ and Jose VJ—members of the Church – had alleged that the practice was leading to several problems including sexual exploitation of women and blackmailing of both men and women followers.Under the religious practice followed by Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, it’s members are required to undergo ‘Sacramental Confession’ before a priest to relieve themselves of sin. According to the practice, it’s a condition precedent for fulfilling the temporal and spiritual needs of being a Christian and one who doesn’t do that would be denied the benefit of such services from the Church.Under the garb of some rules and practice, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church was forcing its members to ‘mandatorily confess’ and ‘mandatorily make payment of monies/ dues’, failing which their names were being struck off from their parishes, they alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-puts-off-hearing-on-plea-against-forced-sacramental-confessions-in-church-195602

He also tried to slap my mother.”       “I asked my younger brother to make a video clip with my mobile phone and when he saw my brother doing so, police started chasing him. They also took away my father, though they set him free after some time,” she claimed.The district magistrate and the SDM could not be reached for comments despite repeated efforts but local MP Pankaj Chowdhary said the incident will be probed and strict action will be taken against the culprit. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-sdm-caught-on-tape-misbehaving-with-woman-during-public-meet-195601
08-01-2021||---||SC notice to Centre on PIL seeking appointment to NCSC, NCST||New Delhi, January 8 The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre to respond to a PIL seeking directions for appointment of full-term chairman and vice-chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde issued notices to the Centre, the state of Uttar Pradesh and others on a PIL filed by People’s Charioteer Organisation in October last year after the gang rape and subsequent death of a 19-year-old Dalit girl in Hathras.The posts of the chairperson and the vice-chairperson and members in both the NCSC and the NCST were vacant. In Uttar Pradesh the chairperson’s posts were vacant, the petitioner NGO alleged.According to the National Crime Records Bureau, there were nearly 45,935 crimes against SCs in 2019, an increase of 7.3% over 2018 (42,793 cases) Uttar Pradesh had recorded the highest number of crimes against SCs in 2019 i.e. 11,829 cases, the NGO submitted.Due to the vacancies and fact that the Commissions were being run by the bureaucracy, the two bodies had become toothless, ineffective and the victims of the atrocities rendered remediless, it alleged.“This shows the total lack of empathy and seriousness, as regards the rights of the SCs and STs and the redressal of the encroachment and transgressions of their rights. It has proved catastrophic to the whole community. They are now bearing the brunt of being targeted systematically by the anti-social elements,” the NGO contended.The petitioner pointed out that the annual report of NCSC had not been published since October 2016 and the NCST’s reports for 2018-19 and 2019-20 were yet to be published.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-centre-on-pil-seeking-appointment-to-ncsc-ncst-195600
08-01-2021||---||Supreme Court concerned over attacks on forest rangers||New Delhi, January 8 Expressing serious concern over attacks on forest rangers by armed poachers and smugglers, the Supreme Court on Friday indicated that it may pass orders providing firearms, bulletproof vests and helmets to them to ensure their safety.“The forest officials are up against a bigger force and millions of dollars are being siphoned off by smuggling…ED (Enforcement Directorate) should be roped in. It should have a separate wildlife wing. These are all proceeds of crime," a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said while hearing certain applications filed in a 25-year-old PIL on environment and forests related issues.Referring to attacks on forest rangers in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, senior advocate Shyam Divan said, "Brutal attacks are made on forest rangers. Even counter cases are lodged against them… India accounts for 38 percent of attacks on forest officials.”"It is difficult to comprehend how forest officials are to be protected in vast tracts of land where poachers take advantage to carry out the nefarious activities. It is difficult to manage how any law can be enforced by the forest officials who are unarmed in comparison to poachers who are heavily armed," the Bench said, adding such crimes needed to be checked.Agreeing with Divan, the CJI said, “When we go to Assam, (we see) they are given arms while in Maharashtra they are given only ''lathi.”"We will direct that the officials are given arms, bullet proof vests and helmets. In Karnataka, forest officials are seen roaming in ''chappals'' and are being slapped by poachers. We want the Solicitor General to make a statement on the next date of hearing that arms will be given to personnel...," it said, posting the matter for hearing after four weeks.The Bench indicated that it would pass order on the issue after hearing submissions from Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, Divan and advocate ADN Rao on measures to ensure safety of forest rangers.Noting that forest officials can’t even call for help in distress when attacked by poachers, the Bench said there should be some mechanisms for it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-concerned-over-attacks-on-forest-rangers-195599
08-01-2021||New Delhi||CBI files charge sheet against 4 Haryana cops in 2017 Gurugram school student murder case||It is almost after about three years of its probe that the CBI filed charge sheet in a special court in Panchkula against four personnel of the Haryana Police for their alleged role in framing a bus conductor in the killing of a 7-year-old boy in a private school in Gurugram in September 2017, said officials of the agency.Later it was found that the boy was murdered on September 8, 2017 allegedly by a senior student of the same schools.According to an official statement issued by the CBI today, the four police personnel have been charge sheeted under various sections of the IPC.A Class 2 student, whom the court named ‘Prince’ to protect his identity, was found near the toilet of the school with his throat slit on September 8 morning within an hour of his father leaving him at the school.The local police had arrested bus conductor Ashok Kumar of the school and shown recovery of a knife from him claiming it to be the murder weapon. The police had claimed solving the heinous crime quickly and put the blame on the conductor.In a twist to the case, the CBI, after taking up the case, debunked the claims of police and found the conductor to be innocent. The agency in its meticulous probe examined teachers, students, and scanned local markets which led them to a Class 11 student of the school, whom the court named ‘Master Bholu’ to hide his identity.The juvenile was apprehended in the case on November 7, 2017, CBI spokesperson RC Joshi said. “It was revealed during CBI investigation that the conductor earlier arrested by Gurugram Police was not involved in this murder case. Further investigation of the case was continued. During further investigation, the alleged role of said police officials came to light and a supplementary charge sheet was therefore led against them,” he said.According to the agency, the Class 11 student, believed to be weak in his studies, allegedly slit the victim’s throat to get the school to declare a holiday in order to defer a scheduled parent-teacher meeting (PTM) and an examination. The accused is facing murder trial as the CBI kept investigating the role of police personnel in framing Kumar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-files-charge-sheet-against-4-haryana-cops-in-2017-gurugram-school-student-murder-case-195596

"Calling him an outsider is again the media's ploy to twist the story,’’ he added.Brar had handily lost the South Brampton riding in the 2019 elections to Sonia Sidhu of Trudeau's Labour Party who got nearly half the polled votesIronically, Brar is not aligned with Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and his Punjab-origin party colleagues who have spoken against the tear-gassing of the farmers’ march to Delhi and,  as a result, were told off by the MEA. Sources said Brar is understood to be close to former PM Stephen Harper, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and Alberta premier Jason Kenney, all of whom New Delhi had tried to cultivate.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ascertaining-canadian-conservative-ramandeep-brars-presence-at-farmers-sit-in-mea-195595

They need to carry and store the vaccines in packets of dry ice, it said.The DGCA in its order said, “It is needless to say that amongst the various modes of transport, air transport is the most efficient option. Hence, it is imperative that air logistics provide a well-defined procedure that meets the global safety standards and requirements based on local conditions.”All scheduled operators who have been currently authorised to carry dangerous goods may carry COVID-19 vaccines packed in dry ice, meeting the regulatory requirements, it said.“Non-scheduled operators, including aircraft engaged in general aviation and are required to participate in the carriage of COVID-19 vaccines packed in dry ice, shall seek specific approval before commencing such operations. Compliance with ICAO Doc 9284 (Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air) is the responsibility of each operator,” the DGCA said.While explaining the need to pack the vaccines in packets with dry ice, the DGCA noted that the temperature maintenance requirement for COVID-19 vaccines is reported to be varying from -8° C to -70° C and hence, the use of refrigerant material during the transportation becomes essential.The aviation regulator said all operators during transportation of COVID-19 vaccines packed with dry ice shall establish the maximum quantity of dry ice that can be loaded in a given cargo hold and/or compartment or in the main deck (passenger cabin) when a passenger version aircraft is deployed for all cargo operations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dgca-fixes-norms-for-airlines-asks-them-to-carry-covid-19-vaccines-in-dry-ice-boxes-195592

08-01-2021||Shubhadeep Choudhury                                                                              ||BJP chief Nadda to visit West Bengal on Saturday||Tribune News Service Kolkata, January 8Exactly one month after his eventful visit to West Bengal, BJP president Jagat Prakash Nadda is coming to the state once again on Saturday to take part in a farmer outreach programme of his party.BJP has been targeting the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government for its reluctance to accept the PM-Kisan scheme for the state. During his one-day tour tomorrow, Nadda is expected to launch a fresh barrage of attack against Chief Minister Mamata Banerje on the subject.Nadda’s programme includes two temple visits – one in the morning and another one in the evening. He will also visit Jagdanandpur village at Katwa in East Bardhaman and address 'Krishok Surokshya Gram Sabha’ (“security of farmers” meting) at the village ground. According to BJP, the event will mark the beginning of 40,000 such meetings to be held across West Bengal before the assembly elections. This will be followed by kick-start of door to door rice collection campaign by Nadda. Christened ‘Ek Mutthi Chawal Sangrah’, this campaign of BJP is to assert the party’s and its government's commitment and conviction towards growth, progress and prosperity of farmers. Nadda will also have lunch at the residence of a farmer at Jagdanandpur.The source said that BJP’s plan was to reach out to the homes of all 73 lakh villagers across the state before the assembly elections.In the afternoon Nadda will lead a roadshow which will start from Burdwan Clock Tower and end at Lord Curzon Gate. Later, Nadda will hold a press conference at a resort at Burdwan and then address a meeting of the party’s core committee at the same venue.Nadda’s convoy was violently attacked by alleged TMC supporters last month (Dec 10) when he visited Diamond Harbour, Lok Sabha constituency of Abhishek Banerjee, TMC youth wing chief and nephew of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. While Nadda, who was in a bulletproof car, escaped unhurt, some of the other BJP leaders including party general secretary Kailash Vijayvargya sustained injuries in the attack. The incident had also triggered off a bitter clash between the centre and the state government.However, unlike Diamond Harbour, Bardhaman is not a TMC den. Sunil Kumar Mandal, the Bardhaman East constituency MP, has recently left the TMC to join the BJP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-chief-nadda-to-visit-west-bengal-on-saturday-195588

It is for the international community to hold Pakistan to account and ensure that it takes credible action against terror groups, terror infrastructure and individual terrorists, he added.Pakistan’s actions have also coincided with the Islamabad visit of US envoy on Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad followed by a US Department of Defence team landing in Rawalpindi for a strategic dialogue with the Pakistan army.Pakistan had put Masood Azhar, Zaki-ur Rehamn Lakhvi and Dawood Ibrahim on a list of wanted men in August last year. But officials here point out they face lesser charges of terror financing rather than mass murder of innocents.It is essential for Pakistan to get out of the FATF ‘grey list’ in order to access global finance at reasonable interest rates.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lakhvi-masood-arraignment-a-tactical-ploy-mea-195585

These have to be complied with by concerned shipping companies.“Details for this option being worked out and we will continue to remain in touch with the Chinese authorities as well as with shipping companies so that their humanitarian needs are taken care of,” added Srivastava.The National Human Rights Commission of India (NHRC) has already sought details from MEA and related ministries for action taken for the release of Indian sailors stranded in Chinese waters.“It appears that the rights to life, dignity, equality and liberty of Indian seafarers have been trampled down by a Member nation of UN in derogation of international human rights law and International covenants applicable in the field of human rights,” the NHRC has said.The sailors have been stranded onboard MV Anastasia and MV Jag Anand in Chinese waters for over 147 days now.About 70 ships full of Australian coal but manned by foreign seafarers have been waiting at Chinese ports since June last year. Beijing has refused to let them unload but importers and ship charterers want the ships to wait.“It is like a food delivery guy being hammered in a fight between neighbours,” Abdulgani Serang, Secretary of the National Union of Seafarers of India, said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/naveen-jindal-offers-to-buy-coal-to-get-sailors-stranded-on-china-coast-back-195570

Several other countries are now preaching carbon neutralisation, something that Indian industry has adopted on its own."The Indian industry is taking steps themselves to go carbon neutral. And they are doing it responsibly," he said.Javadekar also said that the country should gradually shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) to reduce pollution."Prices of EVs, as of now, are at least 40 per cent higher than their counterparts in diesel and petrol variants.But with the rising volume of EV sales, prices will come down," he stated.The Union minister said initially 3000 battery charging stations will be set up along Delhi-Chandigarh and Delhi-Agra highway.The government has allowed a battery swapping policy as well, under which discharged batteries would be replaced at designated facilities.Talking about the economic crisis caused by COVID-19, Javadekar said that the government had pumped in Rs 30 lakh crore to boost targeted sectors of the economy."This had helped the country to tread on the path of revival," he added. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-only-country-to-keep-commitments-on-climate-change-javadekar-195553
08-01-2021||Lahore||Mumbai attack mastermind Lakhvi gets 15 years in jail; India calls it 'farcical'||Mumbai attack mastermind and Lashkar-e-Toiba operations commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi was sentenced to 15 years in jail on Friday by a Pakistani anti-terrorism court here in a terror financing case.UN-proscribed terrorist Lakhvi, 61, who was on bail since 2015 in the Mumbai attack case, was arrested by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab province on Saturday.“The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Lahore convicted Lakhvi for commission of offences of terrorism financing in a case registered by the CTD for 15 years under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997,” a court official told PTI after the hearing.Also read: Lakhvi, Masood arraignment a tactical ploy, says MEAJudge Ejaz Ahmad Buttar sentenced Lakhvi to five years of rigorous imprisonment each on three counts with a fine of PKR 1,00,000 (approximately USD 620) each on three counts.“In default of payment of fine, he will have to undergo an imprisonment of six months each on three counts. He has been sent to prison to serve the sentences,” the official said.Lakhvi pleaded before the court that he was “falsely implicated” in this case.The LeT commander was accused of running a dispensary and using funds collected for terrorism financing.“He and others also collected funds from this dispensary and used these funds for further terrorism financing. He also used these funds for personal expenses,” the CTD said.Interestingly, Lakhvi was presented before the Lahore ATC on Friday and was convicted the same day in the terror financing case registered against him some time ago.The court was told that Lakhvi, a resident of Renal Khurd Okara district of Punjab, was living in Islamabad before his arrest in this case.Lakhvi was designated as a global terrorist by the UN in December 2008 for being associated with LeT and al-Qaeda and for “participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing or perpetrating of acts by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf or in support of” both the entities.Proscribed terrorists and entities are subject to an assets freeze, wherein all states are required to freeze funds and other financial assets or economic resources of designated individuals and entities, a travel ban that prevents the entry into or transit through nations’ territories by the designated individuals and an arms embargo.Last month, the UN Security Council’s 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee allowed for a monthly payment of Pakistani Rupee 1.5 lakh for Lakhvi to meet his personal expenses.The permission was granted 10 days before his arrest. Lakhvi has named his son Hafizur Rehman and brother Saadat Bashir Waheed who would send him PKR 90,000 and PKR 60,000 respectively in his bank account. He said that his son and brother both have the bank accounts in the same branch.The LeT, led by Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Saeed, is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.The global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is instrumental in pushing Pakistan to take measures against terrorists roaming freely in Pakistan and using its territory to carry out attacks in India and elsewhere.The Paris-based FATF placed Pakistan on the Grey List in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019 but the deadline was extended later on due to COVID-19 pandemic.ATC Lahore had sentenced Saeed for a collective imprisonment of 36 years in terror finance cases.He has been in Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore since July 2019. There are reports that he is given a ‘VIP protocol’ in jail.The UN has named Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, and the US, since 2012, has offered a USD 10 million reward for information that brings Saeed to justice.Routine for Pak to come up with 'farcical actions' prior to key international meets: IndiaNew Delhi: India on Friday scoffed at Pakistan after a court there sentenced Mumbai attack mastermind Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi to imprisonment over terror financing charges, saying it has become routine for it to come up with "farcical actions" prior to key international meetings.

Member of the Women’s Commission is blaming the victim for rape. The Budaun administration is concerned about how the post-mortem report of the victim, that brought out the truth, was leaked,” said the AICC general secretary in-charge for Uttar Pradesh, in a Facebook post.“Remember that at this time, a victim of Moradabad is fighting a battle against death in another horrific rape case. Women will not forgive this administrative system and such disgrace,” she said in the post in Hindi, referring to another incident of rape in the state.NCW member Chandramukhi Devi had on Thursday said the gang-rape and murder of the 50-year-old anganwadi worker could have been avoided if she had not gone out unaccompanied in the evening.            “I tell women again and again that they should never go out at odd hours under anyone’s influence,” she had said after meeting the woman’s family members in Budaun district of the state.“I think if she had not gone out in the evening or was accompanied by any child of the family perhaps this incident could have been avoided. But this was pre-planned as she was called through a phone call. She went (out) and then returned in such a state,” she had told reporters at the victim’s village in Budaun district.Devi has since retracted her statement after a backlash from the opposition and women’s bodies.On Sunday, the 50-year-old woman who had gone to a temple was found dead under mysterious circumstances. Her family members have accused the temple priest and his aides of raping and murdering her.An FIR was filed in the case and two persons were arrested while the priest was absconding. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-ensure-womens-safety-with-victim-blaming-priyanka-on-ncw-members-remark-on-budaun-victim-195550

India had chaired this committee when it was last in the UNSC during its seventh term from 2010 to 2011.In all there are 14 sanctions committees and three other committees, including CTC, Non-Proliferation Committee and Military Staff Committee.A non-permanent member like India will chair two sanctions committees after the UNSC agreed last year on fair distribution of work in the selection of Chairs. Decisions are by consensus and the reforms distributed work more uniformly between the Chair and Co-Chair. More important, it was agreed that chairs will be appointed bearing in mind the capacities and resources of members.Tirumurti said the Taliban Sanctions Committee has always been a high priority for India, keeping in mind its strong interest in Afghanistan.  India aims to keep the focus on the presence of terrorists and their sponsors threatening the peace process in Afghanistan. “It has been our view that the peace process and violence cannot go hand in hand,’’ he said.India’s chairing of the committee pitchforks it into a position that will have a crucial say on the Afghan peace process.India’s chairing of the Libya Sanctions Committee will put it in close consultations with all the major world and regional powers, including the US, Russia, Turkey and UAE.  “We will be assuming the chair of this committee at a critical juncture, when there is international focus on Libya and on the peace process,’’ said Tirumurti.India will chair the CTC in 2022, which coincides with the country’s 75th anniversary of Independence. “The chairing of this committee has a special resonance for India, which has not only been in the forefront of fighting terrorism, especially cross-border terrorism, but has also been one of its biggest victims,’’ said India’s UNPR.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-chair-unsc-panels-on-counter-terrorism-sanctions-195541

08-01-2021||Budaun (UP)||Badaun gangrape: Police quiz accused priest||The priest, who is the main accused in the alleged gangrape of an anganwadi worker in this Uttar Pradesh district, was quizzed throughout Friday night after his arrest in a late-night crackdown that ended his five-day run.The "mahant", Satya Narayan, was hiding in a forest area near the house of one of his followers in a village under the Ughaiti police station, from where he was picked up, the police said.The priest, who is in his 50s, was immediately arrested and interrogated by a police team.Four teams were formed to nab the accused, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Sankalp Sharma said.He will be taken for a medical examination and produced before a local court for seeking remand, the police said.The 50-year-old woman, who had gone to a temple, was found dead under mysterious circumstances on Sunday. Her family members accused the temple priest and his accomplices of raping and killing her.A case was registered against the accused and two of them were arrested on Tuesday night, while the priest was absconding for almost five days before he was held.The incident triggered an opposition outcry and a comparison with Delhi's 2012 Nirbhaya case after the post-mortem report confirmed rape, a broken rib cage, a fractured leg and injuries in the private parts of the victim.The incident took place on Sunday and the matter came to light that night itself when the priest and his accomplices took the body of the victim to her house, saying it was found in a dry well on the temple premises.The FIR was registered on Tuesday after an autopsy confirmed rape and the two accomplices of the priest were nabbed.The station house officer (SHO) of the Ughaiti police station has been suspended for a "delay in informing higher authorities, laxity in taking action, dereliction of duty and failure in taking speedy action".Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered "strongest possible action" in the case even as opposition parties have launched an attack on his government, terming the incident "horrific" and "shameful", with the Congress comparing it to the Nirbhaya case.Following the incident, Bareilly ADG Avinash Chandra had visited the crime spot and announced a reward of Rs 50,000 on the arrest of the priest."Based on complaints from the family members and the post-mortem report, a case has been registered under sections 376D (gang-rape) and 302 (punishment for murder) of the IPC," he had said.The ADG had said a second opinion on the post-mortem report was being sought from medical experts and only after that, any conclusion could be drawn.Budaun Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Dr Yashpal Singh said the woman died of trauma and excessive bleeding.Endorsing the CMO's opinion, District Magistrate Kumar Prashant said, "Whatever help can be given from the department will be given. She was an anganwadi sahayika (helper). We are also paying attention to the security of the family." The victim's son said his mother had gone to offer prayers at the temple on Sunday but did not return home within the expected time.It was only around 11 pm that the priest and his two aides came to their house and handed over her body, he added.Before the family members could ask how she died, the accused left the house saying she had fallen into a dry well and her body was pulled out subsequently.The victim's son said the police were informed of the incident on Monday.Amid the opposition uproar, the Chief Minister's Officer said in a tweet: "The UP CM @myogiadityanath has taken cognisance of the Badaun incident and instructed to take strongest legal action against the accused." The chief minister has also instructed the ADG, Bareilly zone to submit a detailed report on the incident and directed the Special Task Force (STF) to assist in the probe, it said.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who is also in charge of the party's affairs in Uttar Pradesh, hit out at the Adityanath government, alleging that there is something wrong in its intention on the issue of women's security.Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati too have condemned the incident.The Budaun incident comes months after a Dalit woman from Hathras was allegedly raped by four men on September 14 last year. She died on September 29 at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital.The National Commission for Women (NCW) has taken note of the Budaun incident and sent a team of its members for a probe.NCW member Chandramukhi Devi, who met the victim's family members on Thursday, said the incident could have been avoided had the woman not stepped out in evening.She, however, expressed dissatisfaction with the police action in the case.  "I tell women again and again that they should never go out at odd hours under anyone's influence."I think had she not gone out in the evening or if she was accompanied by any child of the family, perhaps this incident could have been avoided. But this was pre-planned as she was called through a phone call. She went (out) and then returned in such a state," she told reporters at the victim's village.

It is being implemented by the Centre in partnership with states.The Union Government’s move comes on the heel of a visit by a four-member team of the Ministry to the state regarding JJM, last month.The current team will visit Purba Medinipur, Paschim Medinipur, Nadia, Murshidabad, Birbhum, Bardaman, Bankura and Paschim Bardhaman districts of the state.These districts are in the political cross-hairs of the ruling BJP which has upped the ante to wrest power from the TMC in the state in the upcoming Assembly election, which will be held in April-May.The team members will interact with the field level officials involved in the implementation of water supply schemes.Also, they will interface with grass-root elected representatives such as gram pradhans, members of gram panchayats, members of the village water and sanitation committees, and the beneficiaries.The BJP considers West Bengal a political strategic frontier to conquer.Although the TMC and the Left parties are foes, they consider the BJP a common enemy.The Congress and the Left parties will contest the election in alliance. Their tone suggests they are more focused against the BJP.Reports suggest the BJP had already gone in an election campaign mode. Its president, JP Nadda, is expected to visit the state this week. Union Home Minister Amit Shah is also expected to make a two-day visit towards the end of this month.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jal-jeevan-mission-centre-sends-team-to-poll-bound-opposition-ruled-west-bengal-195497

It has been our view that peace process and violence cannot go hand in hand,” he said.Tirumurti will chair the CTC in 2022, the year in which India will commemorate the 75th anniversary of its independence.“India will also chair the Counter-Terrorism Committee in 2022, which coincides with the 75th anniversary of India’s independence. The chairing of this committee has a special resonance for India, which has not only been in the forefront of fighting terrorism, especially cross-border terrorism, but has also been one of its biggest victims,” he said.Tirumurti said the Libya Sanctions Committee, also called the 1970 Sanctions Committee, is a “very important” subsidiary body of the Council, which implements the sanctions regime, including a two-way arms embargo on Libya and assets freeze, a travel ban and measures on illicit export of petroleum.“We will be assuming the chair of this committee at a critical juncture, when there is international focus on Libya and on the peace process,” he said.The three committees are highly significant subsidiary bodies of the UNSC and India chairing them is a ringing endorsement of the country’s leadership to steer the panels. India is a leading voice at the UN in the fight against the global scourge of terrorism, particularly the threat posed in the region by cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan.India has underscored that the fight against terrorism will be a key priority for it as it sits at the UN high-table for the 2021-22 term.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said as a Council member, India would not hesitate to raise its voice against the enemies of humanity, including terrorism and would always speak in support of peace, security and prosperity.Former Indian Ambassador to the UN, Hardeep Singh Puri, had chaired the CTC for the term 2011-12 when India was last in the UNSC as the non-permanent member.The CTC, established in the wake of the 9/11 terror attack in the US, works to bolster the ability of UN member states to prevent terrorist acts both within their borders and across regions. It is assisted by the Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate (CTED), which carries out the policy decisions of the body, conducts expert assessments of each member state and facilitates counter-terrorism technical assistance to countries.Tirumurti thanked Permanent Representative of St Vincent and the Grenadines Ambassador Rhonda King, who, as the chair of the informal Working Group on Security Council Working Methods, had steered this process to its logical conclusion.The 1988 Sanctions Committee relating to Taliban oversees the sanctions measures imposed by the Security Council. Individuals and entities are designated on the 1988 Sanctions List as individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with the Taliban in constituting a threat to the peace, stability and security of Afghanistan.The committee designates individuals and entities for participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing or perpetrating of acts; supplying, selling or transferring arms; recruiting and supporting acts or activities of groups, undertakings and entities associated with the Taliban. The listed entities and individuals are subject to an assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo.Under the Libya Sanctions Committee, all member states are required to prevent the sale or supply of arms and related material to Libya; prevent the entry into or transit through their territories of all listed individuals; freeze all funds, other financial assets and economic resources that are owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the listed individuals or entities.The Flag State of a designated vessel is required to direct the vessel not to load, transport, or discharge petroleum, including crude oil and refined petroleum products, from Libya, among other measures.In 2021, India, Norway, Kenya, Ireland and Mexico join non-permanent members Estonia, Niger, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia and Vietnam and the five permanent members China, France, Russia, UK and the US in the Council. It is the eighth time that the country has had a seat on the powerful horseshoe table.

08-01-2021||Chandigarh||Ahead of talks with farmers, BJP leaders meet Amit Shah||Ahead of the talks between the farmers and the Centre’s representatives on Friday, two Punjab BJP leaders today met Union Home Minister Amit Shah.As hundreds of farmers continued with their protest, the Supreme Court on Thursday expressed concern over the possible spread of Covid-19 and asked the Centre if they were taking precautionary measures against the pandemic.Surjit Kumar Jyani and Harjeet Grewal discussed with Shah the ongoing situation arising out of the agitation.Grewal said they apprised Shah about the “deteriorating” law and order situation in Punjab. He alleged state-sponsored violence was being unleashed on BJP workers. Jyani said: “The houses of BJP leaders have been gheraoed for several weeks. We won’t tolerate ‘goonda’ elements,” he said.Sources say since civic body elections have been announced in Punjab, the BJP leaders are wary of the repercussions of the protest on party’s poll prospects. The duo earlier met Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar. Meanwhile, the leaders today launched a fresh attack on union representatives. Jyani alleged many farmer leaders had political aspirations and wanted to contest elections after returning to Punjab.“There are practical problems in dealing with 32 leaders. Nobody is ready to listen. We are aware they represent 32 unions, but they should choose their leader,” he said.Grewal questioned the credentials of the farm leaders. “Joginder Singh Ugrahan belongs to a Naxalite faction called Nagi Reddy Group in Punjab,” he alleged. He also questioned the presence of Yogendra Yadav and CPM leader Hannan Mollah at the protest site. Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, BKU (Dakaunda), said: “They earlier called us Khalistanis. Now they see a political motive. It is part of our union’s constitution that leaders can’t contest elections.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-talks-with-farmers-bjp-leaders-meet-amit-shah-195422

In the past two decades, there has been a significant increase in their stress levels.Major causes“At present, more than half of the Army seems to be under severe stress…. this is due to operational and non-operational reasons,” say the findings of the country’s leading think tank, United Services Institution (USI), which is compiling a book from the outcome of a seminar “Prevailing Stress Levels in Indian Army due to ProlongedExposure to Counter Insurgency/Counter Terrorism Environment”, which it had organised in October 2020.Excerpts of the same have been put up on the USI website under ‘strategic perspectives’ for the period October-December 2020.

08-01-2021||Gurnaaz Kaur||Designer who had an eye for unique patterns||It’s a day of great loss for the Indian fashion industry as the news of the death of Satya Paul, the man who reinvented saris, came today. He passed away in Coimbatore at the Isha Yoga Centre on Wednesday (January 6).His son Puneet Nanda announced the fashion designer’s death on Facebook on Thursday. Puneet also revealed that Satya Paul had a stroke on December 2, 2020, and he was slowly recovering in a hospital. Puneet wrote, “His only wish was to get all the things — he was being monitored and poked with — removed so he could fly away. We finally got clearance from doctors to take him back to Isha Yoga Centre, his home since 2015.” A while later, even Sadhguru tweeted about the demise.A pioneer in the fashion industry, Satya Paul was born in Leigha, a city in Pakistan, and came to India during the Partition. His creations are defined by a vivid colour palette, evocative designs and signature prints. Among India’s premiere brands, Satya Paul founded his namesake label on April 1, 1985. But even much before that, he entered the field of retail as he exported Indian handloom products to Europe and the US. This is when he got associated with weavers from different Indian villages. While we may know him for his ingenious design sensibility, catering to the classes, he was a great supporter of craftsmen.Saris were his canvas and he splashed colours on them to his heart’s desire, played with unusual motifs, bringing out something exclusive each time. This experimentation with the traditional attire, giving it a modern twist, lured fashionistas to own a piece of Satya Paul, a style statement! And his creativity wasn’t restricted to saris — in his collection were scarfs, stoles, shawls, bags, wallets, ties, socks, cufflinks and much more. His art is a mirror to his deep soul, a soul that was on its own quest. In his heartfelt post, Puneet shared about Satya Paul’s spiritual journey. He said Paul had been ‘steadfastly a seeker’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/designer-who-had-an-eye-for-unique-patterns-195427

But in case gold ornaments worth Rs 2 lakh are purchased through multiple cash transactions, the jeweller would not require to keep the customers’ details,” said the source.People involved in the jewellery industry, however, claimed that treating traders in gold as a means of generating “black money” does not augur well and the circular will have a far-reaching implication.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/enforcement-directorate-tightens-norms-for-selling-gold-in-cash-195136

In 2021, apart from India, centres likely in Dubai (UAE), Dhaka (Bangladesh), Kathmandu (Nepal) and Singapore.“After careful consideration, it has been decided that JEE Advanced will be held on July 3, 2021, and the eligibility criteria of scoring 75 per cent marks has been waived off for the ease of students,” the Minister said.The Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, will organise the exam for admissions in 23 IITs all over the country.In a meeting of the IIT-JAB, several key decisions have been taken.Elaborating upon them Prof VK Tewari, Director, IIT Kharagpur and Chairman, JAB, urged aspirants to focus harder to ensure their success.“While they might have missed the usual preparation and probably in a more disadvantageous situation compared to those who appeared for the examination in 2020, but looking at the aspirant community as a whole, the competition would remain the same considering the crème de la crème who will be appearing for the examination,” Tewari said.“I would recommend the parents of students to provide special guidance. They may seek information from various initiatives undertaken by the Education Ministry in this regard. Students should take help from the online resources and aim for the goal like Arjuna’s fish-eye,” he added.Prof Debashish Chakravarty, organising chairman, JEE (Advanced) 2021, said: “On July 3, the first paper of JEE (Advanced) will start at 9 am and end at 12 noon (IST). The second paper will be conducted from 2.30 to 5.30 pm (IST).“In 2021, apart from India, JEE (Advanced) centres are likely to be set up also in Dubai (UAE), Dhaka (Bangladesh), Kathmandu (Nepal), and Singapore.

08-01-2021||Lahore||Pakistan’s anti-terrorism court issues arrest warrant for Jaish chief Masood Azhar||In a significant development, an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan on Thursday issued an arrest warrant for banned Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar on the charges of terror financing.The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Gujranwala issued the warrant during a hearing in a terror financing case instituted by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab police against some members of the JeM.“ATC Gujranwala judge Natasha Naseem Supra issued an arrest warrant for Masood Azhar and directed the CTD to arrest him and present him in the court. The CTD told the judge the JeM chief was involved in terror financing and selling jihadi literature,” an official told PTI.He said the ATC judge issued the arrest warrant for Azhar on the request of a CTD inspector.Azhar is believed to be hiding in a “safe place” in his native town – Bahawalpur.Following the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019 in India, Pakistan’s Punjab province police had launched a crackdown on terrorism financing and in this connection arrested six activists of the JeM in Gujranwala, some 130 km from Lahore.The CTD said its teams raided the whereabouts of the JeM’s “safe house” and arrested its members—Muhammad Afzal, Muhammad Amir, Allah Ditta, Muhammad Iftikhar, Muhammad Ajmal and Muhammad Bilal Makki—and recovered lakhs of rupees from their possession.“The suspects were collecting funds to finance activities of JeM. The chargesheet against them has been submitted to the Anti-Terrorism Court Gujranwala and they are being interrogated,” the CTD said.Following immense international pressure after the Pulwama attack, the Pakistan government had arrested over 100 members of banned militant outfits including the JeM chief’s son and brother. The government also took control of the JeM, Mumbai terror attack mastermind Haifiz Saeed’s Jamaat-ud-Dawah (uD) and Falahai Insaniat Foundation (FIF) properties including seminaries and mosques across the country.JeM had claimed responsibility for the Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 CRPF soldiers.Pakistan’s Punjab government claimed to have taken over the administrative control of the JeM headquarters -- comprising Madressatul Sabir and Jama-e-Masjid Subhanallah – in Bahawalpur.According to the government, some 600 students are studying there and none of them is associated with any banned outfit or involved in any terror activity.In May 2019, the United Nations designated Azhar a “global terrorist” after China lifted its hold on a proposal to blacklist the Pakistan-based JeM chief, a decade after New Delhi approached the world body for the first time on the issue.The UN committee listed Azhar on May 1, 2019 as being associated with Al-Qaeda for “participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing, or perpetrating of acts or activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf of, or in support of”, “supplying, selling or transferring arms and related material to”, “recruiting for”, “otherwise supporting acts or activities of”, and “other acts or activities indicating association with” the JeM.Azhar is a fugitive released by India in exchange of passengers of the hijacked Indian Airlines plane IC-814 in 1999.After his release in 1999, Azhar formed the Jaish-e-Mohammed and scripted many audacious terror strikes in India.On February 26, 2019 India had launched air strikes on what was said to be JeM’s biggest training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot.The global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is instrumental in pushing Pakistan to take measures against terrorists roaming freely in Pakistan and using its territory to carry out attacks in India and elsewhere.The Paris-based FATF placed Pakistan on the Grey List in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019 but the deadline was extended later on due to COVID-19 pandemic.

That’s why immediately after my coming back, I (Akbar) made the complaint against her,” she said.She said due process was available to women and that Ramani had “no desire to go for due process”.“When Ramani says there was no availability of due process, it is incorrect. What they are saying is you can do a parallel trial without going to the courts and the legal system provides to redressal,” she said.She added that Ramani had “no desire to go for due process. There was no interest in due process. It is much easier to malign someone, defame someone on social media. It is impermissible”.Luthra reiterated that Akbar had an “unblemished reputation” that was destroyed by Ramani.“The common thread in all our evidence and theirs is that Akbar has a reputation and that reputation is unblemished till Ramani made her averments. It is not disputed,” Luthra said.The proceedings remained inconclusive and the court will further hear the matter on January 12.Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani on October 15, 2018.He resigned as union minister on October 17, 2018.Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as ‘media’s biggest predator’ that harmed his reputation.He has denied all allegations of sexual harassment against the women who came forward during the #MeToo campaign against him.Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar while they were working as journalists under him.He termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them.

08-01-2021||New Delhi||Are protesting farmers taking precautionary measures against Covid, SC asks Centre||As hundreds of farmers continue with their protest against the three farm laws in the national capital, the Supreme Court on Thursday expressed concern over the possible spread of COVID-19 and asked the Centre if they were taking precautionary measures against the pandemic."You must tell us what is happening? I don't know if farmers are protected from COVID-19. Same problem may arise in the farmers' protest too," a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said during a hearing of a PIL seeking a CBI probe into Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz in March last year in violation of restrictions imposed due to COVID19.The petitioners alleged the congregation led to faster spread of COVID-19 due to "inaction" on the part of the Centre and the Delhi government, putting others' lives at risk.As Solicitor General Tushar Mehta replied in the negative and said he will find out the status and file a report in two weeks, the Bench said it could give rise to a situation like Tablighi Jamaat event at Nizamuddin."We are trying to ensure that COVID-19 doesn't spread. Ensure guidelines issued are followed," the CJI said.The top court was hearing petitions challenging the validity of the three farm laws passed by Parliament last year.One of the advocates said Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad was not traceable and his whereabouts were not known.Granting time to the petitioners to file a rejoinder, the Bench said the matter will be taken up on Monday along with other petitions on the issue.Noting that there was no improvement in talks between agitating farmers and the government, the top court had on Wednesday said it would take up petitions against farm laws and those against farmers' protests on January 11."There is absolutely no improvement in the situation," CJI Bobde had said during the hearing of a PIL by advocate ML Sharma on the issue.Attorney General KK Venugopal had told the Bench, "There is a good chance that the parties may come to some conclusion in near future."The CJI - who had on December 17 indicated constituting a committee of independent and impartial persons, including agriculture experts, to end the stalemate between protesting farmers and the Centre - had said, "We understand the situation. We want to encourage the talks. We will keep the matter on Monday and will adjourn if you say so."Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had pointed out that since healthy talks were going on between farmers and the Centre, it would not be advisable to take up the matter immediately.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/are-protesting-farmers-taking-precautionary-measures-against-covid-sc-asks-centre-195024

08-01-2021||---||Farmers hold tractor march, say govt has time till Friday to repeal agri laws||New Delhi, January 7Ahead of the meeting with Union ministers on Friday, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait on Thursday said the government can try as much as it can, but the farmers will not go back home till the three Acts are repealed.“The government has time till tomorrow. It can make a law on MSP and take back the three laws."Today's tractor march was a trailer, the entire movie will be shown on January 26," he said.Not expecting any breakthrough before the eighth round of talks with the Union Government, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha in a show of strength started took out a tractor rally.The protesting farm groups started their tractor rally on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) expressway.Armed with Google maps and contact details of points-persons appointed to guide them, the farmers descended on the KMP from four different locations. Those camping at the Singhu and Tikri borders will be entering the expressway from Kundli and Sampla, respectively. The two groups will then meet mid-way before returning to their respective bases.Similarly, the farmers camped at the Ghazipur border will meet farmers coming from Rewasan in Palwal and return to their campsites later in the day.Shingara Singh Maan, president of Haryana unit of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan), said the tractor rally was only the start of a long-drawn-out battle for their rights.“This rally is an example of our strong resolve because we know this will take a long time and we are prepared to sit for many more months. Today’s show of strength will only empower our farmers to join in,” said Maan, who is leading the group from Tikri border towards Palwal.Maan said they were not expecting any breakthrough from the scheduled eighth round of talks with the Union Government’s representatives led by Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar.“We don’t think we will get anything substantive from the meeting. Kal kuch nahi hona (nothing significant will come out of the meeting). We have known for a while that this will be a long-drawn-out battle to get those bills repealed and all of us are prepared for that,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-hold-tractor-march-say-govt-has-time-till-friday-to-repeal-agri-laws-195010
08-01-2021||Vibha Sharma||What to expect from eighth round of talks between Centre and farmers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 7Ahead of the eighth round of talks with Union ministers on Friday, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait on Thursday said the government can try as much as it can but farmers will not go back home till the three Acts are repealed. “The government still has time till tomorrow. It can make a law on MSP and take back the three laws and fulfil demands of the agitation.“The tractor march today was a trailer, the full movie will be shown on January 26 (Republic Day when farmers have planned a tractor parade),” he said. Meanwhile, slamming the “attempts to defame the agitation”, Dr Darshan Pal of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha said “few anti-social elements are disturbing the protests by various activities”.“The discipline committee is investigating reports and individuals concerned will be handed over to the police. We are again reminding the government ahead of tomorrow’s meeting that these laws should be completely repealed and remunerative MSP should be made into a legal right of all farmers. We will never accept the amendments offered by government and towards fulfilling our demands, we will continue to intensify the protests,” he said, making clear unions’ stance at the meeting. While after the January-4 talks, it is more or less clear the government has ceded all it intends to persuade farmers to end the agitation speculations are it may offer or propose the choice of implementation of the three contentious laws on States, giving them the power/freedom to enforce them.Farmer’ leaders say after what Punjab BJP leaders said after their meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that “Maoists have infiltrated the movement, the PM knows best and farmers should listen to him, it is clear the government has not understood the gravity of the situation”. “It is not about which party is in power in which State, it is about farmers,” they say. However, while farmers threaten escalation it seems the government too is prepared for a long haul. Sources say the government has already relented on the proposed Power Act, the Ordinance on stubble pollution and offered amendments to the three Acts. “They (farmers) should tell us something new, we are ready to discuss the three Acts clause by clause,” they say. Given the kind of support/traction the agitation has received from common people, the matter has moved out of the hands of unions’ leaders for any resolution on lesser terms, this farmer and government negotiators know well. “It is now a people’s movement,” says a union leader.  But as Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has also pointed on many occasions, for the government “it is the matter of the entire country and not just Punjab and Haryana”. Politically, it is the question of 23 Lok Sabha seats of Punjab and Haryana and it remains to be seen how far the BJP-led Centre is willing to go to save those. Small and marginal farmers comprise almost 80 to 85 per cent. Plus if the government relents any further, it risks the chance of opening fronts of other such protests.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-to-expect-from-eighth-round-of-talks-between-centre-and-farmers-194999
