Delhi is the only state to have included through its own resources, vaccines of Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) (in 1999) and Typhoid (in 2004).“All these additional services are a strategy in itself when it comes to improved child survival. Immunization drive ‘Mission Indradhanush’ was launched during the month of April 2015 with an aim to provide vaccination to already vaccinated or partially vaccinated children up to 2 years of age with a due focus on high risk areas,” the report added.According to the survey, in the age group 0-1 year, 78.89 pc children are reported to be receiving or have received vaccination.“In this age group, 79.12 pc female and 78.70 pc male children are receiving or have received vaccination.

15-01-2021||New Delhi||Government nod to vehicle scrappage policy likely soon: Nitin Gadkari||The much-awaited policy to scrap 15-year old vehicles is likely to get a government nod soon, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Friday.On July 26, 2019, the government proposed amendments to motor vehicle norms to allow scrapping of vehicles older than 15 years in a bid to spur adoption of electrical vehicles."We have submitted the proposal and I am expecting that we will get approval as early as possible for the scrapping policy," the Road Transport and Highways Minister said.The policy is for scrapping of vehicles which are more that 15 years old and includes cars, trucks and buses, the Minister said addressing the "Atmanirbhar Bharat Innovation Challenge 2020-21" event.Gadkari's remarks come amid reports that the upcoming budget may unveil the vehicle scrappage policy that aims to boost automobile demand by phasing out old and polluting vehicles.A final call in this regard, however, will be taken by the Prime Minister's Office. The PMO had earlier sent the proposed policy for a fresh round of consultation with stakeholders.Gadkari said once the policy is approved, India will become a automobile hub and there will also be reduction in the prices of automobiles.He said recycled material from old vehicles will help reduce the prices."We will take scrap from all over the world and here we will make an industry where we can use all new material and the cost will be less... industry will be more competitive...we will get more export orders," he added.He said the automobile industry's turnover, which is Rs 4.5 lakh crore with Rs 1.45 lakh crore exports, will get a boost.Earlier, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that a policy for scrapping of old vehicles "is in the works" and will be announced after ministries concerned "fine-tune" it."Scrappage policy is in the works ... I would wait for the concerned ministries also to fine-tune everything and tie up the loose ends and then come to a stage where it can be announced by the ministry," Sitharaman had said in an interaction with the media after presenting Budget 2020-21.In May 2016, the government had floated a draft Voluntary Vehicle Fleet Modernisation Programme (V-VMP) that proposed to take 28 million decade-old vehicles off the road.A committee of secretaries (CoS) recommended to the ministry redesigning of the scheme for greater participation of states with partial support from the Centre.The CoS had suggested that the scheme may dovetail a calibrated and phased regulatory approach for capping the life of vehicles together with stricter implementation of emission norms and accordingly a revised consultation paper got in-principle nod of the PMO.

15-01-2021||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court panel on farmers’ agitation in limbo||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 15The Supreme Court’s four-member committee on farmers’ agitation appears to be in limbo after the lone farmers’ representative and Bharatiya Kisan Union National President Bhupinder Singh Mann recused himself in view of criticism from his own union which sacked him from its primary membership.Legal experts told The Tribune that the panel can’t start its work until it’s reconstituted and the vacancy is filled with a farmers’ representative in place of Mann.“The Supreme Court will have to nominate some other person in the committee. Since setting up of the committee is a unilateral action on the part of the court, only the court can find a replacement for Mann,” senior counsel Vikas Singh, who is appearing a PIL petitioner seeking guidelines on agitations, said.Advocate Virag Gupta said, “the Supreme Court may modify its previous order and allow the committee to continue with only three members or name Mann’s replacement. Since Kishan Unions have expressed their willingness to continue talks with the government it may keep its order on hold or even refer it to a Constitution Bench.”While staying the implementation of the three farm laws being opposed by farmers who have blocked key entry points to Delhi since November 26, 2020, a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde had on January 12 set up a four-member committee to hear the various stakeholders’ views.Beside Mann, the other three members of the committee were Pramod Kumar Joshi (Director, South Asia international Food Policy), Agricultural Economist Ashok Gulati and Shetkari Sanghatana leader Anil Ghanwat.They were mandated to talk to the agitating farmers on the Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Act 2020, Farmers Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act & Amendment to Essential Commodities Act and file a report before the court in two months.Advocate AP Singh, who is representing some farmers’ bodies in the case, said, “it was bound to happen as most of the members were pro-farm laws and their views were already known. Mr Mann is being guided by his conscience.” Asked about the future of the committee, he said, “We are planning something…You will come to know about it soon.”While forming the four-member panel, the top court had expressed the hope that it “may create a congenial atmosphere and improve the trust and confidence of the farmers.”It had said that “a stay of implementation of all the three farm laws for the present, may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith.”The top court had said that “this extraordinary order of stay of implementation of the farm laws will be perceived as an achievement of the purpose of such protest at least for the present and will encourage the farmers bodies to convince their members to get back to their livelihood, both in order to protect their own lives and health and in order to protect the lives and properties of others.”However, contrary to the court’s expectations, the farmer unions refused to budge from their position and continued to demand complete repeal of the three farm laws, leading to failure of the ninth round of talks with the government on Friday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-panel-on-farmers-agitation-in-limbo-198957

But it is not possible to deliver a high OTP without a fully engaged employee workforce. I am delighted everytime I see a winning OTP number, it signifies we are pleasing the customer and it signifies our employee culture is strong." AirAsia India and Vistara were at number two and three at these four airports in November with 89.9 per cent and 88.4 per cent on-time performance, respectively, the DGCA said.The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the coronavirus pandemic.All airlines in India have taken cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts, leave without pay and firing of employees in order to tide over the crisis. ---  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/6-3-crore-domestic-air-passengers-in-2020-56-per-cent-lower-than-2019-dgca-198953

He had shot down intruding Pakistani Sabre aircraft over Srinagar during the 1965 Indo-Pak war, but had died in action.The branch at Jammu Cantonment has been named after Naib Subedar (Honorary Captain) Bana Singh.Belonging to the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry, Bana Singh led the team which conquered the highest peak in Siachen glacier as part of Operation Rajiv in 1987, for which he was awarded the PVC. The peak was named as ‘Bana Post’ in his honour.Two other branches have also been renamed after PVC recipients. Capt Manoj Kumar Pandey’s name has been etched at the Lucknow’s Sadar Bazar branch.An officer from 11 Gorkha Rifles, Pandey had shown most conspicuous bravery, indomitable courage, exemplary personal valour, outstanding leadership and devotion to duty of an exceptionally high order, in the face of the enemy and made the supreme sacrifice during the attack on Jubar Top in Batalik Sector during the 1999 Kargil conflict.Company Havildar Major Piru Singh of the Rajputana Rifles has a branch in Jaipur named after him. He was decorated with the PVC posthumously for successfully occupying a Pakistani medium machine-gun post in Tithwal sector of Jammu and Kashmir in 1947. By that time he was left alone and as he moved out and lobbed grenades at the next enemy post, he fell to enemy fire.Two Maha Vir Chakra recipients, Brigadier Mohammad Usman and Captain Anuj Nayyar, have a branch in Agra and New Delhi, respectively, named after them.Brigadier Usman had been killed in July 1948 while fighting Pakistani soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir, while Captain Nayyar had laid down his life in Mushkoh Valley during the Kargil conflict.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pnb-names-six-branches-after-war-heroes-198945
15-01-2021||Madurai||Bulls and men compete at Tamil Nadu's Palamedu 'Jallikattu'||Bulls and men tried to get the better of each other during the bull-taming sport 'Jallikattu', a key event of the Pongal harvest festival celebrations, that was held here on Friday at the sprawling Palamedu sporting arena.A test of grit was on full display with the animals fiercely trying to get past the waiting men while the tamers attempted to hang on to their humps to emerge victorious.The animals were let out one after the other from 'Vadivasal,' a narrow entrance to the sporting arena after announcements on the bull, like who owned it and so on.As tens of hundreds of spectators cheered from the gallery, about 700 bulls and 600 plus men took part in the sport which stretched to eight rounds amid tight security and a number of people, which includes participants, sustained injuries.Organisers repeatedly directed enthusiastic tamers through the public address system to ensure that only one of them took on the bull and advised them on 'don'ts' like avoiding touching the horns of the animals.The bull owners were given prizes after their animals outmanoeuvred the men waiting to outwit them and the participants were rewarded when they managed to cling to the hump of the bulls for a while.Over 100 bulls and men were declared winners and the prizes given away include a range of things including bicycles, gold coins, utensils, and chairs.The event management committee announced here that the first prize, a car, went to a local youth who dominated 18 bulls.The first prize for the 'best bull' went to a local association which got a cow and a calf as prize.The second and third prizes for best tamers went to men who controlled 17 and 10 bulls respectively.The second prize winner however contested the decision of the committee in deciding the first prize winner and he declined to accept the second spot and left the premises.The youth who managed to control 18 bulls said he is pursuing diploma in civil engineering course.Elaborate preparations preceded the event, which coincides with 'Mattu' Pongal celebrations to honour cattle that help farming.Men seeking to dominate the bulls were tested for coronavirus and animals were examined by veterinarians.The opening 'Jallikattu' of the Pongal season was held at Avaniapuram here on Thursday. It was witnessed by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and DMK youth wing secretary Udhayanidhi Stalin and others. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bulls-and-men-compete-at-tamil-nadus-palamedu-jallikattu-198944

On Thursday, the MEA had made it clear that the JCM and boundary talks were separate mechanisms.Relations between Nepal and India, which had briefly started looking up, slid due to a cartographic war after New Delhi published a new map, including Kalapani within its territory in November 2019. Seven months later, India opened a road link via Lipulekh to Kailash Mansarovar, and in retaliation Nepal published a political map showing Kalapani and Lipulekh as its territory.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-nepal-discuss-railway-line-to-kathmandu-198938
15-01-2021||Kolkata||West Bengal will drown in Ganga if BJP comes to power: TMC||The Trinamool Congress on Friday said if the BJP manages to come to power in West Bengal, the state will drown in river Ganga, as all central government projects are flawed and have been unsuccessful.TMC Rajya Sabha MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy also mocked the saffron party for its call to turn the state into 'Sonar Bangla' (golden Bengal) if it emerges triumphant in the assembly elections, contending that the BJP-led government at the Centre has barely fulfilled any of its promises."If this party (BJP) comes to power, then surely Bengal will drown in the Ganga, as all programmes and projects of the Centre have typically flopped, bearing no results," he alleged.Criticising the Centre for demonetisation, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in 2016 promised that black money will be brought back to the country and that each person will receive Rs 15 lakh in their bank accounts."What happened to these promises? GDP growth rate has consistently fallen, unemployment increased and more than 100 people died while standing in queues to withdraw money from ATMs," he said.Even Home Minister Amit Shah had said the assurance of depositing Rs 15 lakh into bank accounts of people was a "jumla (rhetoric)", Roy said."Similarly, all promises of the Modi government are jumlas," he said.Roy alleged that the law and order condition in BJP- ruled states is "horrible", as was evident during the recent incidents in Hathras and Balarampur.The TMC leader also said deposit bases of public sector banks are gradually weakening, while those of the private lenders are "growing incrementally".After the BJP-led government came to power in 2014, bad loans have swelled, profitability has gone down and write-offs increased."I think there is a need for a probe by the Serious Frauds Investigation Office (SFIO), as all government and RBI guidelines are being sidelined," he claimed.Roy added that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has restored peace in the state. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-will-drown-in-ganga-if-bjp-comes-to-power-tmc-198937

They have a past of either being employed on a salary, or have pursued politics," Chaudhary said, adding that their presence generated apprehensions among farmers as representative of corporate sectorHe said the court's intention was above-board in drafting them on the committee.The BKS wants the committee to be representative of all stakeholders, including the small and marginal farmers, who constitute 86 per cent of the farmers in the country.The BKS has suggested also to the court to give representation to traders and consumers. If the industry section so desires, it may also be represented.Representations of all stakeholders will help find an amicable and durable solution that would carry forward country interest.Chaudhary said that the impression that farmers' representation from Punjab is holistic is erroneous and that 16 per cent of its farmers are small and marginal".Hitting out at the opposition parties, Chaudhary said they have lost their support base and are in search of an opportunity through the farmers."The Congress has crossed all bounds and sense of dignity while fishing in troubled waters."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bks-moves-apex-court-on-farmers-agitation-198935

Pakistan continues to provide safe haven to terrorists. In the training camps, across the LoC around 300-400 terrorists are ready to infiltrate," he said."There was an increase of 44 per cent in the ceasefire violations last year which is proof of Pakistan's sinister plans. There were also attempts to smuggle weapons using drones," he added.  There were efforts to smuggle weapons into India from across the border using drones and tunnels, he mentioned.General Naravane said the Indian Army was working towards reorganisation and modernisation in order to increase its war fighting capability.It is working with top education institutions like IITs on emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, block chain, quantum computing, unmanned systems, directed energy weapons and swarm drones, he said.Under the ‘Make in India’ scheme of the Central government, 29 modernisation projects worth Rs 32,000 crore have been awarded by the Indian Army.General Naravane said more than 5,300 soldiers of the Indian Army were part of the UN peacekeeping forces in extremely challenging areas of more than eight countries.He also dedicated the Indian Army mobile app to the country, stating that it will give immense information to people of this country, especially the younger generation.

15-01-2021||New Delhi||Govt wants farmer unions to form informal group to prepare concrete proposals: Tomar||Urging farmer unions to form an informal group among themselves to prepare concrete proposals to be discussed in the next meeting, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said on Friday detailed discussions took place at the ninth round of talks but could not reach a decisive stage.The two sides, therefore, decided to meet again on January 19 at 12 pm, Tomar told reporters after the end of the meeting that lasted for nearly five hours.“Talks took place over three farm laws in a cordial atmosphere and detailed discussions took place on some issues, but couldn’t reach a decisive stage,” he said.“We suggested they can form an informal group of people who can understand the laws better and prepare some concrete proposals, detailing what are farmers’ expectations and what clauses are problematic for them, which the government can consider with an open mind,” the minister said.He further said the government is hopeful of discussions reaching some decisive stage at the tenth round of talks on January 19.On the direct talks between the government and farmers continuing despite the Supreme Court appointing a panel, Tomar said everyone is fully committed to the apex court and the government will also present its side before the committee panel when invited.“Unions want to continue the dialogue with the government and we have no problem with that. The SC-appointed panel will also work for the welfare of farmers,” he said.The minister said solution can emerge from the government-farmers talks as well as from the SC-appointed panel’s deliberations.“Our effort is to resolve the issue through dialogue and we want the protest to end at the earliest given the adverse weather conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic situation,” he said.On Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s allegations against the government with regard to the farm laws, Tomar said, “Rahul Gandhi’s statements and actions are laughed at within his own party also.”“The Congress manifesto in 2019 itself promised these reforms and therefore Sonia and Rahul Gandhi should tell us whether they were lying at that time or are lying right now,” he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-wants-farmer-unions-to-form-informal-group-to-prepare-concrete-proposals-tomar-198919

Parents of these students were mostly shepherds and labourers, who had simple keypad mobile phones and faced network issues in rural areas.He concentrated on developing four fundamental skills of language, listening, speaking, reading and writing (LSRW) among students.At the beginning of lockdown, he started storytelling to develop their listening skills. After developing listening skill, students would narrate the same story through which they developed speaking skill.After that, Jadhav asked students to write down stories in a notebook. He used storytelling format to draw and retain the attention of pupils.Then, he asked students to record the stories. Now, students have made an e-library of 500 recorded stories.In this way, my students developed four fundamental skills of language and now they are perfect in listening, speaking, reading and writing."I am confident that my students will become good news anchors, reporters, writers and speakers, Jadhav told PTI.For his teaching innovation during the lockdown, Jadhav was selected for the award on December 24.The award is jointly instituted by Honey Bee Network and GIAN and is given to ideas for creativity and innovation or to traditional knowledge practices which solve day-to-day problems faced by the society.Jadhav was congratulated by NCP MP Supriya Sule, state ministers Amit Deshmukh and Varsha Gaikwad, among others, for his achievement.So far, Jadhav has received more than 70 state, national and international awards."My project is followed in 20 districts of Maharashtra, 24 states in the country and 14 countries in the world. The benefit of people is my real satisfaction than an award," he said."I am happy to be honoured. I will try to connect with more teachers with such platforms in the future," Jadhav said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-educator-gets-award-for-novel-teaching-method-in-lockdown-198917

"For those who want to join the national mainstream, we are committed to accept surrenders, even by putting our lives at great peril," he said.At the same time, Major General Bali made it clear that relentless operations will continue against those who pick up guns and resort to violence.In some of the videos, surrendered terrorists could be seen praising the Army for providing them an opportunity to shun the path of violence.The new strategy of the Army came into effect last year when Shoiab Ahmed Bhat of the Al Badr terror group expressed his desire to lay down arms during an ongoing encounter.He was part of the group which had killed a jawan of the Territorial Army in south Kashmir's Shopian district, but this did not deter the Army personnel in ensuring his surrender and handing him over to police after questioning.

15-01-2021||New Delhi||Mobile numbers of WhatsApp on Web users found on Google Search||As WhatsApp faces intense scrutiny over its upcoming data and privacy policy in India and elsewhere, another user data violation has been reported, this time on the WhatsApp on Desktop (Web) application, allegedly exposing personal mobile numbers via indexing on Google Search.Although WhatsApp is primarily a mobile app, currently being used by over 400 million users in India, some working professionals also use the instant chat app on their desktops and PCs via the Web version.Independent cybersecurity researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia on Friday shared some screenshots with IANS showing indexing of personal mobile numbers of WhatsApp users via Web version on Google Search."The leak is happening via WhatsApp on Web. If someone is using WhatsApp on laptop or on an office PC, the mobile numbers are being indexed on Google Search. These are mobile numbers of individual users not business numbers," Rajaharia told IANS.Earlier this week, concerned at private group chat links being available on Google Search, WhatsApp said that it had asked Google not to index such chats and advised users not to share group chat links on publicly accessible websites.Google had indexed invite links to private WhatsApp group chats, meaning anyone can join various private chat groups with a simple search. The indexed WhatsApp group chat links have now been removed from Google."Despite WhatsApp advising users and telling Google to remove the earlier exposed group chat links, the mobile numbers via WhatsApp Web application are now being indexed on Google Search," Rajaharia noted.A WhatsApp spokesperson said in an earlier statement that since March 2020, WhatsApp has included the "noindex" tag on all deep link pages which, according to Google, will exclude them from indexing."We have given our feedback to Google to not index these chats. Links that users wish to share privately with people they know and trust should not be posted on a publicly accessible website," the company spokesperson said.The issue was first cropped up in February last year when app reverse-engineer Jane Wong found that Google has around 470,000 results for a simple search of "chat.whatsapp.com", part of the URL that makes up invites to WhatsApp groups.According to Rajaharia, the latest leak of personal mobile numbers via WhatsApp on Web has not been addressed so far by the either Facebook-owned platform or Google.The revelation comes at a time when WhatsApp is changing its privacy policy and users will have to "agree and accept" if they plan to keep using the app post-February 8.On Friday, a single judge bench of the Delhi High Court recused from hearing a petition against the WhatsApp's upcoming data and privacy policy, on the grounds that it violates the right to privacy of citizens of India.The plea will now be listed before another bench and would come up for hearing on January 18. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mobile-numbers-of-whatsapp-on-web-users-found-on-google-search-198908

There is a process that needs to be followed. We are reviewing the cases," he said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/goa-govt-decides-to-shift-iit-project-out-of-sattari-amid-protest-198906

Let me say that the JCM and boundary talks are separate mechanisms.”              He said the JCM is an important mechanism that provides the opportunity of reviewing the entire gamut of bilateral partnership and providing political guidance to further enhance the unique ties between the two countries.“We look forward to constructive discussions on the numerous sectors that encompass our bilateral agenda,” he said.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/eam-jaishankar-holds-talks-with-nepalese-counterpart-gyawali-198881

15-01-2021||New Delhi||Central Vista: Construction work of new Parliament building begins||The construction work of the new Parliament building started on Friday, over a month after Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the project under the government's ambitious Central Vista redevelopment plan.The new Parliament building will have a triangular shape and is expected to be completed by the 75th anniversary of India's independence in 2022. The government plans to hold the monsoon session of Parliament in 2022 in the new building."The construction work of the Parliament building has started," an official said.PM Modi had laid the foundation stone for the new Parliament building, which is being constructed by Tata Projects Ltd., on December 10 last year. The project is estimated to cost Rs 971 crore.Earlier this week, a 14-member heritage panel gave its approval to the new Parliament building while also giving the go-ahead to the Central Vista redevelopment project.The Supreme Court had asked the Centre to seek prior approval from the panel and other relevant authorities before starting the construction of the new building.The construction work could not start earlier as the government had assured the Supreme Court that no construction or demolition work would commence till the apex court decided the pending pleas on the issue.The new structure will come up in front of the existing Parliament that was built nearly 94 years ago at a cost of Rs 83 lakh at that time and would eventually be turned into a museum.The new building will house larger Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha halls with capacities of 888 seats and 384 seats to accommodate an expanded Parliament after the freeze on its expansion lifts in 2026. The Lok Sabha Hall will also have an additional capacity, up to 1,272 seats, to host joint sessions.According to the plan, provisions will be made in furniture for smart displays and biometrics for ease of voting with an intuitive and graphical interface, digital language interpretation and recording infrastructure to produce real-time metadata, programmable microphones that put the control of managing the house with the Speaker.Besides the new Parliament building, the redevelopment of the Central Vista -- the nation's power corridor -- envisages a common central secretariat, revamping of the 3-km Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate, new Prime Minister's Residence and Prime Minister's Office, and a new Vice-President Enclave.

We note that the PWM Rules were framed in the year 2016 in place of 2011 Rules. There is no justification for long delay in finalisation of EPR models even after more than four years of the publication of the Rules. The same may now be finalised at the earliest, preferably within three months," the bench said.The NGT said that state level authorities also need to take necessary effective steps for enforcement, including coercive measures. Environmental compensation and penal action regime proposed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) may be duly implemented by state PCBs, State Level Monitoring Committees and all other concerned authorities, the tribunal said."CPCB may continue to coordinate with the State Level Monitoring Committees, the State PCBs/PCCs or any other authorities with reference to the steps taken by the State Level Monitoring Committees in coordinating with the concerned Local Bodies, Gram Panchayats, Waste Generators, Producers, Importers, Brand Owners, Recyclers, Manufactures, Retailers and Street Vendors in accordance with the rules. "Whenever, necessary CPCB may issue further directions from time to time in the light of experiences gained considering different suggestions and viewpoints, including the suggestions of the Oversight Committee for State of UP," the bench said.The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by CPCB alleging that states were not paying heed to the seriousness and ill effects caused by plastic.Referring to its 2013-14 annual report, the CPCB had said there were a total of 689 unregistered plastic manufacturing units running in the various states and UTs including Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Manipur, Puducherry, Punjab and Telangana.As per 2014-15 there were 217 such units in Andhra Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Telangana, it had said.The CPCB had said it had issued directions under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 on June 30, 2016 to various municipal bodies but they paid no heed till date.The apex pollution monitoring body has sought directions to states and UTs to prepare a plan of action for implementation of Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016 and its effective execution of such plan of action within the stipulated time frame as envisaged in the law.It has sought imposition of penalty on the respondents as per "Polluter Pays Principle" for their non-cooperation and inaction which has resulted in huge loss of "health, soil, animal, crops and groundwater etc apart from exemplary damages."

15-01-2021||Washington||Farm bills have potential to represent significant step forward for agri reforms: IMF||The IMF believes the farm bills passed by the Indian government have the potential to represent a significant step forward for agricultural reforms, but a social safety net is needed to protect those who might be adversely impacted during the transition to the new system, a spokesperson of the global lender said here.Gerry Rice, Director of Communications at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said the new measures would reduce the role of the middlemen and enhance efficiency."We believe the farm bills do have the potential to represent a significant step forward for agricultural reforms in India," Rice said at a news conference in Washington on Thursday."The measures will enable farmers to directly contract with sellers, allow farmers to retain a greater share of the surplus by reducing the role of middlemen, enhance efficiency and support rural growth," he said.Also read: Ahead of talks with Centre today, farmer leaders divided over tractor march on Republic Day"However, it is crucial that the social safety net adequately protects those who might be adversely impacted during the transition to this new system," the spokesperson said responding to a question on the ongoing protests by farmers against the laws in India.This can be done by ensuring that the job market accommodates those that are impacted by the reforms, he said.And of course, the growth benefits of these reforms will depend, critically, on the effectiveness and the timing of their implementation, so need to pay attention to those issues as well with the reform," Rice said.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at several Delhi border points, demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and legal guarantee of minimum support price for their crops.Enacted in September last year, the three laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed their apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

He, also, urged everyone to maintain peace and harmony and not pay heed to “false and unfounded inflammatory propaganda and rumour mongering” on the tractor march like "unfurling national flag at the Red Fort etc" to "malign and scuttle the movement".Also read: Farm bills have potential to represent significant step forward for agriculture reforms in India: IMFHowever, though Rajewal said that unions will finalise the contours of January 26 tractor march after their meeting with union ministers tomorrow, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait announced the programme for the day saying that farmers will hold simultaneous parade from Red Fort to India Gate on Republic Day."The Republic Day parade has been cut short, it will now be from Rastrapati Bhawan to India Gate, I am told. We will march from Red Fort to India Gate and meet it there. It will be a historic moment," Tikait said.According to Rajewal, efforts were being made to malign the agitation through ‘dushprachar’ (false propaganda).“The whole world is watching. This is not just a farmers' movement. It has become a mass movement across the country. A movement is successful only when it is completely peaceful, if there is violence it collapses,” he said, adding that, "Misconceptions/false inflammatory propaganda are being spread about the January 26 movement. Some people are saying that the national flag should be hoisted at the Red Fort, some are saying the Parliament will be stormed.”He accused the “anti-farmer forces and government agencies” of trying to malign and scuttle the peaceful agitation of farmers and common people. Urging everyone to maintain peace and calm, he told the farmers that the tractor march will be “from” Delhi borders.The exact outline of the programme for January 26 will be given following the meeting.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has expressed hope of positive discussions today. While unions have already specified that they will not appear before the court-appointed panel, they said they were ready to attend the scheduled talks with the government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmer-leaders-divided-over-tractor-march-on-republic-day-198831

However, the decision to carry on with the visit marks another step to improve ties though Oli has sought to raise the boundary issue on the eve of Gyawali’s arrival.“We look forward to constructive discussions on numerous sectors that encompass our bilateral agenda,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava while announcing the visit.After ties soured in the wake of India building a motorable road, India dispatched the RAW chief followed by the Army Chief and the Foreign Secretary to turn around ties. However, in a reflection of the contestation between New Delhi and Beijing, the Chinese defence minister arrived shortly after Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla visited Kathmandu.The two sides will discuss a wide range of issues, including supply of Covid vaccines to Nepal, development of Pashupatinath temple, Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project and the management of the open border, besides some MoUs.The problem of fake currency notes that is bedeviling both countries could also be discussed after the Nepal Home Ministry official said, “It is not just counterfeit Indian notes that circulate in the border area, fake Nepali notes are also being circulated. I do not know whether a MoU has been prepared already, but a proposal was prepared on the issue.”On the Pancheshwar project, Nepal’s Energy and Water Resources Minister Dinesh Ghimire, who returned from Delhi last week, said at a press conference that some crucial issues related to the development of the project have been resolved with the Indian side.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-foreign-minister-in-delhi-to-discuss-border-row-vaccine-198610

I have come here because I think the Tamil culture, language and history are essential for the future of India and need to be respected by everyone. The government is under the impression that they can destroy the cultures of this country and suppress the emotions of the Tamil people, crush their language and suppress the spirit of the Tamilians. I came to give them a message that no one can suppress the Tamil spirit, and those who think they can run roughshod and can push aside Tamil language and culture are mistaken,” said Gandhi, who was accompanied by DMK chief MK Stalin’s son Udaynidhi Stalin.Gandhi shared traditional Pongal meals with women at Madurai prompting BJP social media chief Amit Malviya to tweet, “Rahul Gandhi in Tamil Nadu is sounding like a tourist who is visiting India and landed up in the state to experience Tamil culture and watch Jallikattu.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/polls-in-mind-rahul-nadda-mark-pongal-in-tamil-nadu-198612

It asked the builder to refund the money in four weeks.“The occupation certificate is not available even as on date, which clearly amounts to deficiency of service. The allottees cannot be made to wait indefinitely for possession of the apartments allotted to them, nor can they be bound to take the apartments in Phase 1 of the project. The allottees said they have taken loans and are paying high rate of interest to the banks,” the SC noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-comes-to-apartment-buyers-rescue-junks-one-sided-clauses-198614

However, as a farmer leader and union leader, “in view of the prevailing sentiments and apprehensions amongst the farm unions and public in general, I am ready to sacrifice any position offered or given to me so as to not compromise the interests of Punjab and farmers in the country, I am recusing myself from the committee and I will always stand with my farmers and Punjab,” Mann said after the union he headed also distanced itself from him.After being selected by the SC, he had urged everyone to put forward their views before the panel.Union leaders claimed others on the panel will "also resign soon".Rajewal said efforts were being made to malign the agitation through ‘dushprachar’ (false propaganda). “The whole world is watching. This is not just a farmers' movement. It has become a mass movement across the country. A movement is successful only when it is completely peaceful, if there is violence it collapses."Misconceptions/false inflammatory propaganda are being spread about the 26 January movement. Some people are saying that the national flag should be hoisted at the Red Fort, some are saying the Parliament will be stormed,” he said, accusing “anti-farmer forces and government agencies” of trying to malign and scuttle the peaceful agitation of farmers and common people. Urging everyone to maintain peace and calm, he told the farmers that the tractor march will be “from” Delhi borders. The exact outline of the programme for January 26 will be given after tomorrow's meeting.Also read:Tractor march from Delhi borders on January 26 to be peaceful, says RajewalIf govts can last 5 years, so can farmers' protest, says BKU leader TikaitProtesting farmer unions welcome Bhupinder Singh Mann's decision, but say will not accept any committee||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-farmers-talks-ahead-of-ninth-round-mann-recuses-himself-from-sc-appointed-committee-198375
