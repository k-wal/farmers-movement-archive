The accused has been arrested and sent to jail, and the matter is being probed,” Superintendent of Police S Anand said.According to police, the girl was taken to a health centre in Tilhar from where she was referred to Shahjahanpur Medical College Hospital. She was sent back home after the medical examination.Meanwhile, BJP MLA from Tilhar Roshanlal Verma said he admitted the girl to the medical college after her condition worsened.“On getting the information that the condition of the girl is very bad, I reached her house and got her admitted to the medical college,” he told PTI.Verma also said that he raised the matter with the principal secretary to CM Yogi Adityanath, district magistrate and the superintendent of police.

12-01-2021||New Delhi||Will abide by the SC order on farm laws, says BJP||While farmers’ unions and ‘jathebandis’ rejected the Supreme Court order, the ruling BJP said it will abide by the ruling on the farm laws.Though the popular perception appears that the verdict has “given the Narendra Modi government some elbow room in the difficult situation”, sources say what it “may not have been able to convey to the people, the unyielding stance adopted by the unions will now give them the right perspective”.Meanwhile, according to BJP leaders the SC is clear that both the government and farmers should abide by its order. “Negotiations and talks are the only way to resolve matters in a democracy,” party leader RP Singh said responding to farmers’ objections.“The government had kept its side before the court that the laws should not be kept on abeyance. But we are not above the court, the BJP has always respected institutions and everyone should agree to the SC judgment,” he said.Regarding objections on names in the committee, Singh said they have not been recommended by the BJP or the government.“The names have been decided by the SC. They have been tasked to talk to people and give the correct feedback. A person may have his or her own inclinations but that does not mean he or she will not convey grievances fairly. It is clear those sitting on the agitation do not want to change the laws, they just want to show the government in poor light,” he said.  Party spokesperson Sudesh Verma said the government did not want the laws to be put on the hold but the highest authority in the country, the Supreme Court, wanted time to decide and everyone needs to respect that.“The SC has taken a humanitarian point of view. There should be no egos involved. It is neither a climb-down nor setback for the government. Those who are not ready to talk (to the committee) prove their argument is weak. The unions should trust the committee and not get caught by the conspiracy of the Congress and Left parties, I am sure the genuine farmers understand that,” he said.“The government did not want laws to be put on the hold, because many traders have signed contracts with farmers. We will abide by the SC order but the larger issue people need to understand is law making will be done by Parliament and not the people on the street,” Verma added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-abide-by-the-sc-order-on-farm-laws-says-bjp-197474
12-01-2021||New Delhi||S. Jaishankar calls for resolute action against terrorism||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday presented an eight-point action plan to the UN Security Council that included the scrapping of “blocks and holds without any rhyme or reason” on a person or organisation determined to have promoted terrorism.Jaishankar’s broadside was against China that kept a “hold” on Pulwama attack mastermind Masood Azhar from being designated international terrorist till the US warned China that it will take the matter to the UNSC.Jaishankar said his eight points would ensure that all nations “walk the talk” against terrorism and truly commit themselves to the goal of zero tolerance against terrorist activity.Speaking at the UNSC for the first time during an open debate on ‘International cooperation in combating terrorism’, Jaishankar acknowledged that some states don’t have the legal framework and technical expertise to detect and prosecute terrorist financing cases. “We must enhance their capacities” but the international committee must call out those guilty of providing safe havens and hold them accountable, he said in a broadside against Pakistan.The eight points suggested by Jaishankar for effective action against terrorism are: (i) there should be no “ifs and buts” in calling out terrorism; (ii) there should be no double standards. “Terrorist are Terrorists. There is no good or bad distinction and those who cover up are just as culpable”; (iii) increase effectiveness of sanctions by removing the practice of “blocks and holds without any rhyme or reason” as it erodes collective credibility.Jaishankar’s fourth point was about discouraging exclusivity as it facilitates radicalism by breeding fear and mistrust among communities.  He also said listing and de-listing under the UNSC regime must be objective and not for political or religious considerations. The linkages between terrorism and trans-national organised crime must be recognised and addressed vigorously.Jaishankar’s concluding two points were about strengthening the FATF’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing frameworks and adequate funding to UN counter-terrorism bodies.Jaishankar also drew attention to the pandemic-induced isolation and associated distress that has made the world more susceptible radicalising narratives and extremist propaganda. He also pointed out that terrorist groups and lone-wolf operatives have started using new technology such as drones and blockchains besides using social media network to radicalise and recruite youth.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/s-jaishankar-calls-for-resolute-action-against-terrorism-197473

The ayurvedic medicine practices the balance of three elements or doshas known as Vata, Pitta and Kapha.The demand of the Unani practitioners was first raised after the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM), India’s principal regulatory body for Ayurveda education notified its decision to allow postgraduate Ayurveda practitioners to perform 58 types of surgeries.Taking a cue from that the 8,000 Unani odd practitioners in Telangana are asking, “When the government can permit Ayurveda doctors to perform surgeries then why not us?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unani-practitioners-also-seek-the-right-to-perform-surgeries-197465
12-01-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||‘US planned to assist India against China after Doklam’||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 12In a classified document made public after just two years, the US said its Indo-Pacific strategy had a “particular focus” on India. The objective was to accelerate India’s rise by building stronger defence ties and also by offering diplomatic, military and intelligence support to help address continental challenges such as the border dispute with China.In other words, the US had taken a strategic decision to build an alliance with India against China in 2018, when the document was prepared. This happened a year after the India-China confrontation in Doklam and two years before both armies clashed violently in eastern Ladakh in mid-2020.The 10-page document, which explains the need to align US’ Indo-Pacific strategy with those of Australia, India and Japan, was released surprisingly early rather than after 30 years. Partly redacted, it sets out the Trump administration’s strategy for Indo-Pacific that was developed by the US National Security Council.The four members of the Quad – India, Australia, Japan and the US – had elevated their discussions to the level of Foreign Ministers in 2019, a year after the US had prepared the document followed by a second ministerial in Tokyo last year.The military part of the strategy sets out three aims – (i) deny China sustained air and sea dominance inside the first island chain in a conflict; (ii) defend the first-island-chain nations, including Taiwan; and (iii) dominate all domains outside the first-island-chain.The change of classification of the document in the last week of the Trump administration is a “gesture of reassurance to the United States alliance partners, including Australia, that we are not fading away but doubling down in the Indo-Pacific” and the language is likely to be seen to confirm to Beijing its claim that the US is seeking to contain China,” said reports quoting US sources.“It is highly classified, secret, not for release to foreign nationals, and I think it is a signal about the kind of continuity that the permanent government of America, if you like, the officials, want to see in America’s relations with the Indo-Pacific, including in managing Chinese power,” said Australian National University’s Rory Medcalf, a consistently strong proponent of the Quad since his days with the Lowey Institute.“This is very clear code for America holding its ground with Taiwan, with partners and allies in the South China Sea, with Japan, with Korea - really maintaining the integrity of those relationships and protecting them from Chinese assertiveness, from Chinese aggression,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-planned-to-assist-india-against-china-after-doklam-197463

He had reached Jodhpur straight from his wedding vacation to join the exercise.

12-01-2021||New Delhi||‘Khailstanis’ have infiltrated farmers' protest, Centre tells SC||The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Centre to file an affidavit on its claim that some banned organisations including ‘Khalistanis’ have infiltrated the ongoing farmers protest against the new farm laws.Attorney General KK Venugopal, appearing for the Centre, said that ‘Khalistanis’ have infiltrated the protest and he will file an affidavit along with the necessary inputs of the Intelligence Bureau (IB).A Bench of Chief Justice Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, which was hearing a clutch of petitions against the farm laws and the ongoing farmers protest at borders of Delhi, asked Venugopal to file the affidavit by Wednesday.       The Bench, in its order, said, “Laudably, the farmers have so far carried on the agitation peacefully and without any untoward incident. But it was pointed out in the course of hearing that a few persons who are not farmers have also joined, with a view to show solidarity with the farmers”.It said that an apprehension was expressed that the possibility of some persons creating trouble cannot be entirely ruled out.“In fact, a specific averment is made in an intervention application filed by one Indian Kisan Union, in...that an organisation by name “Sikhs for Justice”, which is banned for anti-India secessionist movement is financing the agitation. This averment is supported by the learned Attorney General also,” it said.During the hearing, senior advocate P S Narasimha, appearing for intervenor ‘Indian Kisan Union’ supporting the new farm laws, alleged that some banned organisations have been fuelling the protests of farmers.These kinds of protests can be “dangerous” he said, adding that groups like “Sikhs for Justice” are involved in these agitations.The Bench told Venugopal that somebody has made an allegation here on record that there are some banned organisations which are helping the protest.“Will you confirm this or deny?” the Bench asked the AG.The Attorney General said, “We have said that ‘Khalistanis’ have infiltrated the farmers’ protest. We can file an affidavit by tomorrow, along with the report of the intelligence bureau.”      The top court stayed the implementation of controversial new farm laws till further orders and decided to set up a 4-member committee to resolve the impasse over them between the Centre and farmers’ unions protesting at Delhi borders.The top court stayed the implementation of the three laws—the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act—against which several petitions have been filed challenging their constitutional validity.The committee members named are: Bhupinder Singh Mann, President of Bhartiya Kisan Union; Anil Ghanwat, President of Shetkeri Sangthana, Maharashtra; Pramod Kumar Joshi, director for South Asia, International Food Policy Research Institute, and agriculture economist Ashok Gulati.             On Monday, the apex court had pulled up the Centre for its handling of the farmers’ protest against the new farm laws saying it is “extremely disappointed” with the way negotiations between them were going and it will constitute a committee headed by a former Chief Justice of India to resolve the impasse.The eighth round of talks between the Centre and the farmer unions on January 7 headed nowhere as the Centre ruled out repealing the contentious laws, while the farmers’ leaders said they are ready to fight till death and their ‘ghar waapsi’ will happen only after ‘law waapsi’. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/khailstanis-have-infiltrated-farmers-protest-centre-tells-sc-197446

He was produced before the sub-divisional magistrate’s court on Monday,” Kotwali police station in-charge Sunil Kumar Singh told PTI Tuesday.“The youth was released on Monday on personal bond,” Singh added.Salman hails from Uttar Pradesh’s Deoria district and works as a mechanic in Bengaluru.He told the police he developed a friendship with the girl through a virtual platform and travelled the distance to offer her birthday gifts. “However, the girl’s family, got suspicious about him and called the police,” the SHO said.Singh said a return ticket to Bengaluru for January 11 and some cash were found on him.Singh said the girl’s parents asked the police to warn the man against any recurrence of such incident.The youth was booked under Section 151 of CrPC (arrest to prevent the commission of cognizable offences) and later released on bond, Singh said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/man-flies-hundreds-of-kms-to-offer-bday-gift-to-girl-he-met-online-lands-in-police-station-197442
12-01-2021||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Court grants bail to 2 people, casts doubt on credibility of police witnesses||A Delhi court on Tuesday granted bail to two persons in a case related to the north-east Delhi riots while casting doubts on the credibility of the two police witnesses in the matter.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav granted the relief to Mohd Shoaib and Shahrukh on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 20,000 with surety of like amount in the case of alleged vandalism and torching of a shop by a riotous mob in Gokalpuri area.The court noted that the prosecution was opposing both the bail pleas on the strength of their categorical identification by beat officers---Constable Vipin and Head Constable Hari Babu---in their statements recorded under section 161 (examination by police) of the Code of Criminal Procedure on April 7, 2020.Their identification was hardly of any consequence, it said, adding that even though they were posted as beat officers in the area at the relevant time of the incident, they waited till April to name the accused when they had categorically seen and identified them allegedly indulging in riots on February 25, 2020.“Being police officials, what stopped them from reporting the matter then and there in the police station or to bring the same in the knowledge of higher police officers. This cast serious doubts on the credibility of two police witnesses,” the court said in its order.It further said that the CCTV footage relied upon by the police in the case pertained to February 24, 2020, whereas the incident took place the next day.“No CCTV/video footage of February 25, 2020, (on which date the incident in question took place) has been placed on record by the investigating agency."The applicants (Shoaib and Shahrukh) were not arrested from the spot, instead their arrest has been formally affected in the case on April 15, 2020 (i.e after lapse of about 55 days of the date of incident) in Mandoli Jail,” it added.It also said both the accused were entitled for bail on the ground of parity as the role assigned to them was on identical footing as co-accused Rashid who was already out on bail.“Be that as it may, the investigation in the matter is complete; charge sheet has also been filed; trial in the matter is likely to take a long time; applicants cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity merely on account of the fact that other persons who were part of the riotous mob have to be identified and arrested in the matter,” it said.It directed both the accused not to tamper with evidence and to install 'Aarogya Setu' app on their mobile phones.During the hearing, advocate Salim Malik, appearing for the accused, claimed they have been falsely implicated in the matter and were mere “bonafide bystanders”.Special Public Prosecutor D K Bhatia, appearing for the police, argued that both the accused were allegedly present at the spot with an unlawful assembly which was armed with stones, sticks, petrol bombs and acid bottles.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 last year after clashes between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-court-grants-bail-to-2-people-casts-doubt-on-credibility-of-police-witnesses-197440

12-01-2021||---||Opposition parties get behind farmers, want farm bills repealed||New Delhi, January 12The Opposition parties have once again reiterated that the three farm acts should be repealed and a special Parliament session called to discuss the whole gamut of agrarian issues.Leaders from the Congress, the TMC, the RJD, the CPI (M), the CPI and the Forward Bloc put forward these views while taking part in the ‘Special Kisan Session’ of the Janta Parliament, which was moderated by leading activist P Sainath.“It is very clear that these farm laws are not for the welfare of our kisans. These are meant for profiteering of the corporates,” CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said.“We have said on a number of occasions that these laws have to be repealed and a legislation be brought to ensure the MSP. However, without a guarantee of procurement, the MSP will not be helpful. Only 6 per cent of farmers get the benefit of MSP in the country, MSP has to cover every farmer and every crop until that happens legislation will not be effective,” Yechury added.Prominent politicians who took part in the discussion were K Raju and Rajeev Gowda (Congress), D Raja (CPI), Sukhendu Sekhar Roy (TMC), Dipankar Bhattacharya (CPI-ML) Ghanshyam Tiwari (SP) and G Devarajan (Forward Bloc).Throwing the party’s weight behind farmer agitation, RJD MP and spokesperson Manoj Jha said that the opposition parties have not done enough to support the cause.“I have no qualms in accepting that opposition parties have not come out of their comfort zone. We have not done our bit,” Jha said.“We believe that a special session in Parliament will not help if it is bereft of debate. There has to be a difference between monologue, which this government is so fond of and a dialogue amongst colleagues. So we want a special session to discuss the farm issues and later on it should be sent to a select committee,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-parties-get-behind-farmers-want-farm-bills-repealed-197429

It can't be in the air. You (Ramani) have to prove it. Just by calling it my truth, doens't make it the truth.“You have not discharged the onus. You have not shown telephone record, car parking, CCTV,” Luthra said, adding that Ramani's “version and story is a figment of imagination”.She further said that “in a stroke, you finished his 50 years of hardwork”.“There were remedies available in law. They were available from 1860. Fact is, anytime there is a grievance at workplace, there is availability,” she said.The court will further hear the matter on January 14.Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani on October 15, 2018.He resigned as Union minister on October 17, 2018.Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as 'media's biggest predator' that harmed his reputation.He has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment against the women who came forward during #MeToo campaign against him.Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar while they were working as journalists under him.He termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/metoo-ramani-failed-to-prove-charges-of-sexual-misconduct-against-me-akbar-tells-court-197427
12-01-2021||New Delhi||Farm issue: All SC panel members favour farm laws with amendments||Moments after the Supreme Court formed a committee to resolve a debate over contentious farm laws, farm unions said they won’t be part of the panel that had “only government people”.BKU’s Rakesh Tikait said the committee did not have people who could represent the point of view or agitating unions which would continue their protests until the farm laws are repealed.The 41 agitating unions are currently discussing the SC order and will come out with a proper response, Tikait said.A look at the credentials of the four committee members meanwhile reveals they are all in favour of the farm law implementation with some amendments.Agricultural economist Ashok Gulati has been the most vocal supporter of deregulation of agriculture markets and has argued that the matter has been debated for years.PK Joshi has written articles in past days regretting prolonged agitation by farmers and noting that the Centre had made all our efforts to accommodate genuine concerns of the protesters.Joshi has also said that the agitators have been changing goalposts and had begun by seeking government assurance that the MSP won’t be discontinued. He has said the farmers later began seeking legal status for MSP and finally the repeal of laws altogether.The two farm leaders on the panel---Bhupinder Singh Mann of the BKU and Anil Ghanwant of  Maharashtra based Shetkari Sangathan had in mid-December met Agriculture Minister NS Tomar and called for the implementation of the laws after bringing certain amendments to satisfy the protesters.Agitation unions said their principal demand of farm law repeal cannot be addressed by a committee whose members favour the laws and are against the repeal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-issue-all-sc-panel-members-favour-farm-laws-with-amendments-197426

Why can’t the Centre immediately convene a Parliament session to repeal the laws? Why is it so adamant?” he said.The farmers’ organisations, meanwhile, have called a meeting at 4 pm on Tuesday to chalk out future strategy in the wake of the Supreme Court order.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-reject-scs-mediation-committee-proposal-say-nothing-less-than-repeal-197418

The government must withdraw. It must understand that farmers and people of India are opposed to the laws, it said in a statement.Farmer unions reiterate the fact that they will not participate in any court-ordered committee process further, one of their apprehensions about such a process got validated in the very constitution of the committee. It is clear that the court is being misguided by various forces even in its constitution of a committee. These are people who are known for their support to the three Acts and have actively advocated for the same. — With PTI inputs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-not-appear-before-sc-appointed-panel-protest-is-for-indefinite-time-farmer-unions-197417

12-01-2021||New Delhi||Policy update doesn’t affect privacy of messages: WhatsApp||WhatsApp on Tuesday has said its latest policy update does not affect the privacy of messages as the Facebook-owned company sought to address concerns around security of user data on the platform.In a blogpost, WhatsApp emphasised that it did not share the users’ contact lists or data of groups with Facebook for ads purposes, and that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook could read messages or hear calls between users on WhatsApp.Last week, WhatsApp had informed users of an update in its Terms of Service and privacy policy regarding how it processes user data and partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the social media giant’s products.It also stated that the users would have to agree to the new terms and policy by February 8, 2021, in order to continue using WhatsApp’s service.This kick-started a spate of conversations and memes on the internet over WhatsApp’s alleged sharing of user information with Facebook, and many users have started shifting to rival platforms such as Telegram and Signal.“We want to be clear that the policy update does not affect the privacy of your messages with friends or family in any way. Instead, this update includes changes related to messaging a business on WhatsApp, which is optional, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data,” WhatsApp said.It added: “WhatsApp accesses only the phone numbers from the address book (after getting user’s permission) to make messaging fast and reliable, and that it doesn’t share contact lists with the other apps Facebook offers.”“We use group membership to deliver messages, and to protect our service from spam and abuse. We don’t share this data with Facebook for ads purposes. Again, these private chats are end-to-end encrypted so we can’t see their content,” it noted.A report by internet security researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia had claimed that at least 1,700 private WhatsApp group links were visible on Google through a web search.WhatsApp noted that users could choose to set their messages to disappear from chats “for additional privacy”.The messaging giant, which has about 400 million users in India, said it would always be clear within the app when users are communicating with any business that uses its features designed for commercial entities.WhatsApp explained that some large businesses needed to use hosting services to manage their communication, and that it provided them the option to use secure hosting services from Facebook to manage WhatsApp chats with their customers, answer questions, and send information such as purchase receipts.“But whether you communicate with a business by phone, email, or WhatsApp, it (business) can see what you’re saying and may use that information for its own marketing purposes, which may include advertising on Facebook. To make sure you’re informed, we clearly label conversations with businesses that are choosing to use hosting services from Facebook,” WhatsApp added.WhatsApp said if users chose to interact with ‘Shops’ (Facebook branded commerce feature), their shopping activity could be used to personalise their ‘Shops’ experience and the ads the users saw on Facebook and Instagram.“Features like this are optional and when you use them, we will tell you in the app how your data is being shared with Facebook. If you have WhatsApp installed on your phone, you’ll have the option to message that business. Facebook may use the way you interact with these ads to personalise the ads you see on Facebook,” it added.Interestingly, a number of business leaders, including Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma and PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam, have spoken of moving to rival platforms.Mahindra said he had installed Signal while Nigam said he had moved 1,000-plus ‘PhonePe-rs’ to Signal, and recreated all his work groups and moved family groups.“...WhatsApp is by far and away the best product I’ve ever seen in the social/comm category. I trusted the WA founders. I loved the simplicity of their product. Never imagined switching to another chat app. C’est la vie,” Nigam tweeted.Sharma also advocated moving to Signal.“They say market has power. We are the largest market. Here in India WhatsApp/Facebook are abusing their monopoly & taking away millions of users’ privacy for granted. We should move on to @signalapp NOW. It is up to us to become victim or reject such moves,” he said in a tweet. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/policy-update-doesnt-affect-privacy-of-messages-whatsapp-197412

The parameter in the links indicates that they can be redirected to WhatsApp in all regions and in languages other than English," said the report.The CyberPeace Foundation along with experts from Autobot Infosec Private Ltd has launched an independent investigation into the matter."In all the links, the same redirection and outgoing sources were generated. However, in one link, a different URL was found and one new IP address that belongs to one of China's hosting company Alibaba Cloud," the report said.When the URL is manipulated, an error code is displayed in Chinese language, the report said, adding that the domain names found during the investigation seem to have been registered in China."The IP address of the link is 47.75.111.165, and it can be traced to Alibaba Cloud, the city of Hong Kong and the country of China," it further claimed.The news comes at a time when WhatsApp is asking users to either give their consent to sharing data with Facebook or lose their accounts after February 8, triggering a heated debate globally, including in India. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-hackers-luring-indian-whatsapp-users-into-part-time-jobs-197403
12-01-2021||Aditi Tandon||Dynastic politics biggest enemy of democracy: Modi||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 12Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said dynastic politics was emerging as the biggest enemy of democracy and the onus to uprooting it lay on the youth of India.Addressing the second National Youth Parliament on the occasion of Swami Vivekenanda’s birth anniversary, the Prime Minister exhorted the youth to participate in politics in large numbers.He said until the youth came forward, the poison of dynasties would continue to weaken democracy.Citing lessons from the life and times of Swami Vivekananda, the Prime Minister said dynastic politics was the source of social and political corruption in India, and the youth must take the lead in eradicating this “disease”.He said a new awakening in the country was witnessing people supporting honesty and performance in politics but a lot of change was still pending.“Dynastic politics is a huge challenge before the country and needs to be uprooted. Days for those who used to win elections merely on surnames are over but this disease has not been completely eradicated. Even today, there are people whose thoughts and goals are driven by the urge to preserve their family legacies in politics,” said the Prime Minister in oblique references to political families in India.He said “dynastic politics, like a new form of dictatorship, was raising the burden of non performance on the country”.“Dynastic politics strengths the sense of ‘me and my family’, rather than putting the nation first. It is also a major source of social and political corruption in India. Political dynasts feel if their past generations were not held accountable for corruption, they, too, cannot be held accountable. They see such distorted examples in their own houses. The onus on changing this scenario is on the youth,” Modi reiterated.He said the youth should participate in politics not with the intention to receive but with the intention to do something.“Until the common Indian youth enter politics, the poison of dynasties will continue to weaken our democracy. Youth participation in politics is critical to save democracy,” the Prime Minster said, who hailed the finalists of the National Youth Parliament debate on “Vocal for Local”.The PM also said the youth had to make this century the century of India.“Let your decisions be inspired by national good. Swami Vivekananda used to say the youth must become the builders of India. It’s your responsibility to lead the future and this responsibility stretches to the field of politics because politics is a strong tool for transformation,” he said, adding that the old perception in which politics was synonymous with loot and corruption was changing.“Today, people have become so aware that they have thrown their weight behind honest people. They are giving opportunities to honest, dedicated and service-driven people. Honesty and performance has become the first mandatory condition for politics. The awareness in the country has created this pressure and corruption has become a burden on those whose legacy used to be corruption,” he stressed.The Prime Minister said public representatives had now realised that they would need a strong CV and an account of work accomplished to go into the next election.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dynastic-politics-biggest-enemy-of-democracy-modi-197402
12-01-2021||New Delhi||IIT Guwahati researchers find new clues to how and why stars die||Researchers at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Guwahati, claim to have found important clues to understand the death of massive stars and have also revealed the problems with the existing models.The research in collaboration with Max Planck Institute for Physics, Munich, Germany, and Northwestern University, USA, has also been published in international journal Physical Review Letters (PRL)."Supernovae—the super explosions at the time of death of large massive stars—are considered to be the cradle of birth for new stars and synthesis of the heavy elements in nature. At the end of their life, the stars, especially massive ones, collapse resulting in an immense shock wave that causes the star to explode, briefly outshining any other star in its host galaxy."The study of supernovae and the particles they release helps us understand the universe because almost all matter that makes up the universe is a result of these massive explosions. However, the mechanism of these super explosions is not yet completely solved and has remained one of the enigmas of nature," said Sovan Chakraborty, Assistant Professor, Department of Physics, IIT Guwahati.According to the team, the solutions to the toughest challenges to the core collapse mechanism of the huge supernovae come from the tiniest subatomic particles called neutrinos."During the core collapse supernova explosion, neutrinos are created in several particle processes. Due to their neutral nature and extremely weak interaction with stellar matter the neutrinos escape the dying star and carry 99% energy of the collapsing star. Thus, the tiny neutrinos are the only messenger bringing information from the deepest interiors of the star. Neutrinos on the other hand have their own complexities," he said."This information is very crucial for the reason that in the extremely dense supernovae core neutrinos interact with other neutrinos and may interchange flavors. This conversion may happen rapidly (in nanosecond timescale) and flavor interchange can affect the supernovae process as the different flavors are emitted with different angular distribution."These 'fast' conversions are nonlinear in nature and are not confronted in any other neutrino sources but supernovae. We for the first time did a non-linear simulation of fast conversion with ‘all' the three neutrino flavors in supernovae," Chakraborty added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iit-guwahati-researchers-find-new-clues-to-how-and-why-stars-die-197401

Our operational preparedness is of high order,” he added.His words come even as armies of India and China are locked in an intense military stand-off in eastern Ladakh since April-May, 2020.On being questioned about the mobilisation by China in summer of 2020, the Army chief said it was nothing new, they came for usual training in the areas, and that the Indian army is ready."They had the first mover advantage in May, and we had the first mover advantage in August," he added.On Pakistan, the Army chief said it continued to embrace terrorism as a state policy. "We have zero tolerance for terror, and we reserve the right to respond at the place and time of our choosing and with precision," he said."The Army is in the middle of restructuring and are transforming from manpower to technology-intensive force, and we are looking at blockchain, big data, artificial intelligence and quantum computing. We are fully committed to various integrated commands. We will calibrate for smooth transition,” he said.The Army chief said land surpluses like those from the soon-to-be closed military farms would be used to seek infrastructure of equal value.On a recent report on stress in the military, he said the report was not based on an adequate sample size.They had only 400 samples; to get 99 per cent accuracy, the sample size should have been 19,000. With small sample size, the report could not be seen an increased stress, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-reduction-of-troops-on-border-with-china-says-army-chief-197391
12-01-2021||Satya prakash||Supreme Court stays implementation of farm laws||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 12A day after pulling up the Centre for its poor handling of farmers’ agitation, the Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the implementation of the three farm laws being opposed by farmers who have blocked key entry points to Delhi since November 2020.A Bench headed by CJI SA Bobde set up a four-member committee to hear the various stakeholders’ views on the Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Act 2020, Farmers Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act & Amendment to Essential Commodities Act and report back to it.Those named as members of the committee are — National president of Bharatiya Kisan Union Bhupinder Singh Mann, Pramod Kumar Joshi (Director, South Asia international Food Policy), Agricultural Economist Ashok Gulati and Shetkari Sanghatana leader Anil Ghanwat.Also read: 3 more protesting farmers die at Tikri borderFarmer leaders welcome SC verdict, but say protest to continueFarmers' agitation has been fearless: Filmmaker Gurvinder SinghOpposition parties get behind farmers, want farm bills repealed"We are going to suspend the implementation of the three farm laws until further orders," the top court said while setting up the committee.The panel will listen to the grievances of farmers on the farm laws and the views of the Government and submit a report to the court containing its recommendations within two months from the date of its first sitting which shall be held within 10 days. It posted the matter for hearing after eight weeks.“We are of the view that the constitution of a committee of experts in the field of agriculture to negotiate between the farmers’ bodies and the Government of India may create a congenial atmosphere and improve the trust and confidence of the farmers. We are also of the view that a stay of implementation of all the three farm laws for the present, may assuage the hurt feelings of the farmers and encourage them to come to the negotiating table with confidence and good faith,” it said.While maintaining that it didn’t want to stifle a peaceful protest, the court said, “…we think that this extraordinary order of stay of implementation of the farm laws will be perceived as an achievement of the purpose of such protest at least for the present and will encourage the farmers bodies to convince their members to get back to their livelihood, both in order to protect their own lives and health and in order to protect the lives and properties of others.”"We are looking to solve the problem. If you want to agitate indefinitely, you can. Every person who is genuinely interested in solving the problem is expected to go before the Committee. The Committee will not punish you or pass any orders. It will submit a report to us. We are going to take the opinion of the organisations. We are forming the Committee so that we have a clearer picture," the CJI said.To allay fear regarding Minimum Support Price (MSP) being done away with and possibility of farmers losing their land, the court said, “The Minimum Support Price System in existence before the enactment of the Farm Laws shall be maintained until further orders. In addition, the farmers’ land holdings shall be protected, i.e., no farmer shall be dispossessed or deprived of his title as a result of any action taken under the Farm Laws.”It said, “The representatives of all the farmers’ bodies, whether they are holding a protest or not and whether they support or oppose the laws shall participate in the deliberations of the Committee and put forth their view points,” the court said. “We are forming the Committee so that we have a clearer picture.”Many senior lawyers, who appeared on behalf of agitating farmers on Monday, were conspicuous by the absence on Tuesday."We cannot ask the Prime Minister... He is not a party here," the CJI said even as Government side told the court that the Agriculture Minister had been a part of the negotiations. “We are looking to solve the problem. If you want to agitate indefinitely, you can. Every person who is genuinely interested in solving the problem is expected to go before the Committee. The Committee will not punish you or pass any orders,” it clarified during the hearing.Several lawyers, including senior counsel PS Narasimha, representing Hyderabad-based Consortium of Indian Farmers Association (CIFA), said their clients were in favour of the farm laws.The Bench turned down farmers’ demand that the prime minister himself should approach them to hold negotiations, saying he was not a party to the proceedings.Earlier, Attorney General KK Venugopal opposed the stay, contending that “none of the petitioners who have attacked the farm laws have pointed out any single provision which is detrimental to the farmers and that the laws enacted by Parliament cannot be stayed by this Court, especially when there is a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of legislation.”While appreciating Venugopal’s arguments, the Bench said, “this Court cannot be said to be completely powerless to grant stay of any executive action under a statutory enactment” and went on to pass the stay order.Pulling up the government for poor handling of farmers’ agitation against farm laws, the Supreme Court had on Monday said it was “extremely disappointed” with the way the government is handling the issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-stays-implementation-of-farm-laws-197390
12-01-2021||Mumbai||Drugs case: Mumbai's famous Mucchad Paanwala shop co-owner held||The Narcotics Control Bureau on Tuesday arrested Ramkumar Tiwari, one of the owners of the famous 'Muchhad Paanwala' shop in Mumbai, in connection with a drugs case, an NCB official said.The paan shop, located at Kemps Corner in south Mumbai, has been famous as it is frequented by some celebrities.Tiwari was apprehended by a team of the NCB after questioning, the official said.His name cropped up during an investigation into a drugs case in which three persons, including a British national, were arrested with 200 kg of drugs from Khar and Bandra areas here on Saturday, when he said.The drugs included ganja, imported strains like 'OG Kush' (a strain of cannabis indica), and curated marijuana, some of which had been sourced from the US, the official said.Tiwari was summoned by the NCB for questioning on Monday and his statement was recorded, he said.Following the questioning, he was placed under arrest on Tuesday, the official said, adding that further probe into the case is on.The NCB on Saturday arrested three persons, including a British national, for allegedly supplying imported strains of ganja in the metropolis, an official earlier said.One of those arrested is a suspect in the drugs case being probed after the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput in June last year, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drugs-case-mumbais-famous-mucchad-paanwala-shop-co-owner-held-197388
12-01-2021||New Delhi||Budget 2021-22: Govt should provide additional funds, incentives for agri sector, say experts||The government should provide additional funds as well as incentives in the upcoming Budget to promote indigenous farm research, oilseeds production, food processing and organic farming for the overall growth of the agriculture sector, according to industry experts.The direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme should be utilised more to support farmers instead of giving subsidies, they added.“Food processing industry has played an important role in better price realisation for the farmer and reducing the cost of intermediaries. The budget must provide special incentives to food processing through incentives, such as interest subvention, lower taxes, access to technology and so on,” Ajay Shriram, chairman and senior MD, DCM Shriram, said.Referring to the successful PM-KISAN scheme, under which Rs 6,000 is paid annually directly into farmers’ bank accounts, he said the DBT mechanism should be fine-tuned and gradually should be utilised to support farmers in lieu of other subsidies.“Let the farmer decide how to judicially use the money. With the benefit of DBT, farmers can then buy better seed, use new-age fertilisers, optimise water usage and so on,” Shriram said.Stating that many Indian startups have invested in the agri-technology space, he advocated for a policy that encourages growth of these companies and adoption of latest techniques.He said there had not been any significant breakthrough in recent years from indigenous agricultural research and development (R&D) and this could be partly on account of resource crunch.“Two areas that need immediate attention are firstly linking agricultural research with industry requirements and secondly avoiding ideological resistance to new-age technologies such GM crops,” Shriram said.Consulting firm Deloitte India suggested that more funds should be allocated for research and development as well as for increasing the domestic production of oilseeds to reduce the imports of cooking oils.Stating that livestock farming was one of the key pillars for augmenting farmers’ income, the consulting firm said one of the big impediments for development of this sector was the prevalence of various diseases that affect mortality, productivity and overall production.“Supply of vaccines is not adequate to address the increasing demand. Funding for developing vaccines and creating necessary infrastructure would be required in this budget,” Deloitte said.Chirag Arora, founder, Organisch Overseas, said the government must encourage farmers to adopt organic farming.“The need of the hour is to encourage the private sector into the space by offering tax incentives to startups venturing into this domain. It also needs to augment investment on creation of cold-chains and increase storage capabilities,” Arora said.Last month, in a virtual pre-budget consultation with the Finance Ministry, Bharat Krishak Samaj (BKS) had said the government should incentivise balanced use of fertilisers by increasing urea price and lowering rates of phosphatic and potassic (P&K) nutrients in the upcoming Budget.BKS chairman Ajay Vir Jakhar had also sought a reduction in taxes on diesel and transport subsidy on fruits and vegetables but demanded tax on unhealthy foods. He had pitched for tripling investment for micro-irrigation and solar pumps for individual farmers as well as funding for distribution of soil moisture measuring sensors.“Prioritise investment in human resources over infrastructure. There are about 50 per cent vacancies in agriculture research institutions across India. Target 2 per cent expenditure on agri R&D of agriculture GDP over the next few years,” BKS had said.

The high-profile leader, who led from the front on Covid and the BJP’s pet project, the CAA, “will either have to be made the Chief Minister or be accommodated in the Centre with some important portfolio”. “The BJP has been working peacefully for the development of Assam, taking into consideration the interests of all communities,” Nadda said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nadda-launches-poll-campaign-in-assam-197180

12-01-2021||New Delhi||‘Extremely disappointed’, Supreme Court raps govt over impasse||Pulling up the government for the poor handling of the farmers’ agitation against farm laws, the Supreme Court on Monday said it intended to stay the implementation of the contentious laws and set up a committee to find an amicable solution to the problem.Also read:“We are extremely disappointed with the way the government is handling the issue. Last four times you said the negotiations were on. What negotiations are you talking about? If you have some sense of responsibility, and if you say you will withhold the implementation of laws, we will form a committee to decide,” a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told Attorney General KK Venugopal.Dhindsa, 2 cong MPs walk out of panel meetThree MPs , Partap Singh Bajwa and Chhaya Verma (both Cong) and Akali rebel SS Dhindsa walked out of a meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture on Monday, seeking to discuss farm laws.The court’s comments came after Venugopal said farmers’ organisations had rejected various offers made by the government.“People are committing suicide. People are calling names. People are suffering in the cold and the pandemic,” noted the Bench, which also included Justice AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.Abhay’s ‘conditional’ resignation letterSenior INLD leader and MLA Abhay Chautala has sent a ‘conditional’ resignation letter to the Speaker, saying it should be considered a resignation if the Centre fails to repeal the three new farm laws by January 26.“We don’t see why there should be an insistence that the laws must be implemented at any cost…Our intention is clear. We want an amicable solution to the problem. That is why we asked you last time why don’t you keep the laws on hold. But you keep asking for time,” it said. The Bench posted the matter for passing a formal order on Tuesday.During hearing on the petitions challenging the validity of the three farm laws and those seeking removal of agitating farmers from Delhi roads, the top court described the situation as “very delicate”.It said, “We are doing this because you have failed to solve the problem. The Union of India has to take the responsibility. The laws have resulted in a strike and now you have to solve the strike.”“It will not help you to say that this was started by the last government…. We have given you a very long rope. Don’t lecture us on patience. We will decide when to pass the order,” it told the government. It also commented that the law was brought in without much consultation.Venugopal and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta vehemently opposed the court’s proposal to stay the implementation of the farm laws, saying farmers from other parts of the country supported the laws. Venugopal said, “A law cannot be stayed by the SC unless the Lordships find that it violates the fundamental rights or constitutional schemes. Law has to be without the power to legislate, only then it can be stayed. No petitioners have raised any such issues.”“We have an apprehension that someone will do something… which will lead to breach of peace. Each one of us will be responsible if something goes wrong. We don’t want anybody’s blood on our hands,” the Bench said.The courts made it clear that it couldn’t restrain peaceful protest, saying it was for the police to deal with the situation, not the court. “We want to ensure there is no violence or bloodbath. If somebody breaks the law, you take action….”“We should not be understood that we are protecting any law breaker. We propose to pass this order to prevent loss of life and property,” the Bench noted. The farmers’ unions were represented by senior advocates Dushyant Dave, HS Phoolka and Colin Gonsalves. Dave said he needed to take instructions as there were a number of farmers’ bodies involved in the agitation.The Bench asked Phoolka to persuade women and old farmers to leave the stir due to the cold and Covid.CJI asks elderly farmers to returnThe CJI expressed concern over elderly farmers, women and children protesting in the severe cold. “Let me take a risk and say Chief Justice of India wants them (protesting farmers) to go back.”AG opposes stay suggestion, chidedThe SC questioned AG Venugopal’s vehement opposition to its suggestion. “We are not experts on economy. You tell us whether you are going to hold these laws or we will,” the CJI saidNo extra timeThe SC refused to grant extra time to the Centre, saying it had already granted the govt a ‘long rope’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/extremely-disappointed-supreme-court-raps-govt-over-impasse-197085
