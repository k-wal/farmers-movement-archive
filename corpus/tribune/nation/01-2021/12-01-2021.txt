12-01-2021||New Delhi||Will abide by the SC order on farm laws, says BJP||While farmers’ unions and ‘jathebandis’ rejected the Supreme Court order, the ruling BJP said it will abide by the ruling on the farm laws.Though the popular perception appears that the verdict has “given the Narendra Modi government some elbow room in the difficult situation”, sources say what it “may not have been able to convey to the people, the unyielding stance adopted by the unions will now give them the right perspective”.Meanwhile, according to BJP leaders the SC is clear that both the government and farmers should abide by its order. “Negotiations and talks are the only way to resolve matters in a democracy,” party leader RP Singh said responding to farmers’ objections.“The government had kept its side before the court that the laws should not be kept on abeyance. But we are not above the court, the BJP has always respected institutions and everyone should agree to the SC judgment,” he said.Regarding objections on names in the committee, Singh said they have not been recommended by the BJP or the government.“The names have been decided by the SC. They have been tasked to talk to people and give the correct feedback. A person may have his or her own inclinations but that does not mean he or she will not convey grievances fairly. It is clear those sitting on the agitation do not want to change the laws, they just want to show the government in poor light,” he said.  Party spokesperson Sudesh Verma said the government did not want the laws to be put on the hold but the highest authority in the country, the Supreme Court, wanted time to decide and everyone needs to respect that.“The SC has taken a humanitarian point of view. There should be no egos involved. It is neither a climb-down nor setback for the government. Those who are not ready to talk (to the committee) prove their argument is weak. The unions should trust the committee and not get caught by the conspiracy of the Congress and Left parties, I am sure the genuine farmers understand that,” he said.“The government did not want laws to be put on the hold, because many traders have signed contracts with farmers. We will abide by the SC order but the larger issue people need to understand is law making will be done by Parliament and not the people on the street,” Verma added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-abide-by-the-sc-order-on-farm-laws-says-bjp-197474
12-01-2021||New Delhi||S. Jaishankar calls for resolute action against terrorism||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday presented an eight-point action plan to the UN Security Council that included the scrapping of “blocks and holds without any rhyme or reason” on a person or organisation determined to have promoted terrorism.Jaishankar’s broadside was against China that kept a “hold” on Pulwama attack mastermind Masood Azhar from being designated international terrorist till the US warned China that it will take the matter to the UNSC.Jaishankar said his eight points would ensure that all nations “walk the talk” against terrorism and truly commit themselves to the goal of zero tolerance against terrorist activity.Speaking at the UNSC for the first time during an open debate on ‘International cooperation in combating terrorism’, Jaishankar acknowledged that some states don’t have the legal framework and technical expertise to detect and prosecute terrorist financing cases. “We must enhance their capacities” but the international committee must call out those guilty of providing safe havens and hold them accountable, he said in a broadside against Pakistan.The eight points suggested by Jaishankar for effective action against terrorism are: (i) there should be no “ifs and buts” in calling out terrorism; (ii) there should be no double standards. “Terrorist are Terrorists. There is no good or bad distinction and those who cover up are just as culpable”; (iii) increase effectiveness of sanctions by removing the practice of “blocks and holds without any rhyme or reason” as it erodes collective credibility.Jaishankar’s fourth point was about discouraging exclusivity as it facilitates radicalism by breeding fear and mistrust among communities.  He also said listing and de-listing under the UNSC regime must be objective and not for political or religious considerations. The linkages between terrorism and trans-national organised crime must be recognised and addressed vigorously.Jaishankar’s concluding two points were about strengthening the FATF’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing frameworks and adequate funding to UN counter-terrorism bodies.Jaishankar also drew attention to the pandemic-induced isolation and associated distress that has made the world more susceptible radicalising narratives and extremist propaganda. He also pointed out that terrorist groups and lone-wolf operatives have started using new technology such as drones and blockchains besides using social media network to radicalise and recruite youth.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/s-jaishankar-calls-for-resolute-action-against-terrorism-197473

The ayurvedic medicine practices the balance of three elements or doshas known as Vata, Pitta and Kapha.The demand of the Unani practitioners was first raised after the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM), India’s principal regulatory body for Ayurveda education notified its decision to allow postgraduate Ayurveda practitioners to perform 58 types of surgeries.Taking a cue from that the 8,000 Unani odd practitioners in Telangana are asking, “When the government can permit Ayurveda doctors to perform surgeries then why not us?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unani-practitioners-also-seek-the-right-to-perform-surgeries-197465

He had reached Jodhpur straight from his wedding vacation to join the exercise.

12-01-2021||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Court grants bail to 2 people, casts doubt on credibility of police witnesses||A Delhi court on Tuesday granted bail to two persons in a case related to the north-east Delhi riots while casting doubts on the credibility of the two police witnesses in the matter.Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav granted the relief to Mohd Shoaib and Shahrukh on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 20,000 with surety of like amount in the case of alleged vandalism and torching of a shop by a riotous mob in Gokalpuri area.The court noted that the prosecution was opposing both the bail pleas on the strength of their categorical identification by beat officers---Constable Vipin and Head Constable Hari Babu---in their statements recorded under section 161 (examination by police) of the Code of Criminal Procedure on April 7, 2020.Their identification was hardly of any consequence, it said, adding that even though they were posted as beat officers in the area at the relevant time of the incident, they waited till April to name the accused when they had categorically seen and identified them allegedly indulging in riots on February 25, 2020.“Being police officials, what stopped them from reporting the matter then and there in the police station or to bring the same in the knowledge of higher police officers. This cast serious doubts on the credibility of two police witnesses,” the court said in its order.It further said that the CCTV footage relied upon by the police in the case pertained to February 24, 2020, whereas the incident took place the next day.“No CCTV/video footage of February 25, 2020, (on which date the incident in question took place) has been placed on record by the investigating agency."The applicants (Shoaib and Shahrukh) were not arrested from the spot, instead their arrest has been formally affected in the case on April 15, 2020 (i.e after lapse of about 55 days of the date of incident) in Mandoli Jail,” it added.It also said both the accused were entitled for bail on the ground of parity as the role assigned to them was on identical footing as co-accused Rashid who was already out on bail.“Be that as it may, the investigation in the matter is complete; charge sheet has also been filed; trial in the matter is likely to take a long time; applicants cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity merely on account of the fact that other persons who were part of the riotous mob have to be identified and arrested in the matter,” it said.It directed both the accused not to tamper with evidence and to install 'Aarogya Setu' app on their mobile phones.During the hearing, advocate Salim Malik, appearing for the accused, claimed they have been falsely implicated in the matter and were mere “bonafide bystanders”.Special Public Prosecutor D K Bhatia, appearing for the police, argued that both the accused were allegedly present at the spot with an unlawful assembly which was armed with stones, sticks, petrol bombs and acid bottles.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 last year after clashes between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-court-grants-bail-to-2-people-casts-doubt-on-credibility-of-police-witnesses-197440

These are meant for profiteering of the corporates,” CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said.“We have said on a number of occasions that these laws have to be repealed and a legislation be brought to ensure the MSP. However, without a guarantee of procurement, the MSP will not be helpful. Only 6 per cent of farmers get the benefit of MSP in the country, MSP has to cover every farmer and every crop until that happens legislation will not be effective,” Yechury added.Prominent politicians who took part in the discussion were K Raju and Rajeev Gowda (Congress), D Raja (CPI), Sukhendu Sekhar Roy (TMC), Dipankar Bhattacharya (CPI-ML) Ghanshyam Tiwari (SP) and G Devarajan (Forward Bloc).Throwing the party’s weight behind farmer agitation, RJD MP and spokesperson Manoj Jha said that the opposition parties have not done enough to support the cause.“I have no qualms in accepting that opposition parties have not come out of their comfort zone. We have not done our bit,” Jha said.“We believe that a special session in Parliament will not help if it is bereft of debate. There has to be a difference between monologue, which this government is so fond of and a dialogue amongst colleagues. So we want a special session to discuss the farm issues and later on it should be sent to a select committee,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-parties-get-behind-farmers-want-farm-bills-repealed-197429

It can't be in the air. You (Ramani) have to prove it. Just by calling it my truth, doens't make it the truth.“You have not discharged the onus. You have not shown telephone record, car parking, CCTV,” Luthra said, adding that Ramani's “version and story is a figment of imagination”.She further said that “in a stroke, you finished his 50 years of hardwork”.“There were remedies available in law. They were available from 1860. Fact is, anytime there is a grievance at workplace, there is availability,” she said.The court will further hear the matter on January 14.Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani on October 15, 2018.He resigned as Union minister on October 17, 2018.Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as 'media's biggest predator' that harmed his reputation.He has denied all the allegations of sexual harassment against the women who came forward during #MeToo campaign against him.Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar while they were working as journalists under him.He termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/metoo-ramani-failed-to-prove-charges-of-sexual-misconduct-against-me-akbar-tells-court-197427
12-01-2021||New Delhi||Farm issue: All SC panel members favour farm laws with amendments||Moments after the Supreme Court formed a committee to resolve a debate over contentious farm laws, farm unions said they won’t be part of the panel that had “only government people”.BKU’s Rakesh Tikait said the committee did not have people who could represent the point of view or agitating unions which would continue their protests until the farm laws are repealed.The 41 agitating unions are currently discussing the SC order and will come out with a proper response, Tikait said.A look at the credentials of the four committee members meanwhile reveals they are all in favour of the farm law implementation with some amendments.Agricultural economist Ashok Gulati has been the most vocal supporter of deregulation of agriculture markets and has argued that the matter has been debated for years.PK Joshi has written articles in past days regretting prolonged agitation by farmers and noting that the Centre had made all our efforts to accommodate genuine concerns of the protesters.Joshi has also said that the agitators have been changing goalposts and had begun by seeking government assurance that the MSP won’t be discontinued. He has said the farmers later began seeking legal status for MSP and finally the repeal of laws altogether.The two farm leaders on the panel---Bhupinder Singh Mann of the BKU and Anil Ghanwant of  Maharashtra based Shetkari Sangathan had in mid-December met Agriculture Minister NS Tomar and called for the implementation of the laws after bringing certain amendments to satisfy the protesters.Agitation unions said their principal demand of farm law repeal cannot be addressed by a committee whose members favour the laws and are against the repeal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-issue-all-sc-panel-members-favour-farm-laws-with-amendments-197426

Why can’t the Centre immediately convene a Parliament session to repeal the laws? Why is it so adamant?” he said.The farmers’ organisations, meanwhile, have called a meeting at 4 pm on Tuesday to chalk out future strategy in the wake of the Supreme Court order.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-reject-scs-mediation-committee-proposal-say-nothing-less-than-repeal-197418

The parameter in the links indicates that they can be redirected to WhatsApp in all regions and in languages other than English," said the report.The CyberPeace Foundation along with experts from Autobot Infosec Private Ltd has launched an independent investigation into the matter."In all the links, the same redirection and outgoing sources were generated. However, in one link, a different URL was found and one new IP address that belongs to one of China's hosting company Alibaba Cloud," the report said.When the URL is manipulated, an error code is displayed in Chinese language, the report said, adding that the domain names found during the investigation seem to have been registered in China."The IP address of the link is 47.75.111.165, and it can be traced to Alibaba Cloud, the city of Hong Kong and the country of China," it further claimed.The news comes at a time when WhatsApp is asking users to either give their consent to sharing data with Facebook or lose their accounts after February 8, triggering a heated debate globally, including in India. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-hackers-luring-indian-whatsapp-users-into-part-time-jobs-197403
12-01-2021||New Delhi||IIT Guwahati researchers find new clues to how and why stars die||Researchers at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Guwahati, claim to have found important clues to understand the death of massive stars and have also revealed the problems with the existing models.The research in collaboration with Max Planck Institute for Physics, Munich, Germany, and Northwestern University, USA, has also been published in international journal Physical Review Letters (PRL)."Supernovae—the super explosions at the time of death of large massive stars—are considered to be the cradle of birth for new stars and synthesis of the heavy elements in nature. At the end of their life, the stars, especially massive ones, collapse resulting in an immense shock wave that causes the star to explode, briefly outshining any other star in its host galaxy."The study of supernovae and the particles they release helps us understand the universe because almost all matter that makes up the universe is a result of these massive explosions. However, the mechanism of these super explosions is not yet completely solved and has remained one of the enigmas of nature," said Sovan Chakraborty, Assistant Professor, Department of Physics, IIT Guwahati.According to the team, the solutions to the toughest challenges to the core collapse mechanism of the huge supernovae come from the tiniest subatomic particles called neutrinos."During the core collapse supernova explosion, neutrinos are created in several particle processes. Due to their neutral nature and extremely weak interaction with stellar matter the neutrinos escape the dying star and carry 99% energy of the collapsing star. Thus, the tiny neutrinos are the only messenger bringing information from the deepest interiors of the star. Neutrinos on the other hand have their own complexities," he said."This information is very crucial for the reason that in the extremely dense supernovae core neutrinos interact with other neutrinos and may interchange flavors. This conversion may happen rapidly (in nanosecond timescale) and flavor interchange can affect the supernovae process as the different flavors are emitted with different angular distribution."These 'fast' conversions are nonlinear in nature and are not confronted in any other neutrino sources but supernovae. We for the first time did a non-linear simulation of fast conversion with ‘all' the three neutrino flavors in supernovae," Chakraborty added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iit-guwahati-researchers-find-new-clues-to-how-and-why-stars-die-197401

12-01-2021||New Delhi||Budget 2021-22: Govt should provide additional funds, incentives for agri sector, say experts||The government should provide additional funds as well as incentives in the upcoming Budget to promote indigenous farm research, oilseeds production, food processing and organic farming for the overall growth of the agriculture sector, according to industry experts.The direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme should be utilised more to support farmers instead of giving subsidies, they added.“Food processing industry has played an important role in better price realisation for the farmer and reducing the cost of intermediaries. The budget must provide special incentives to food processing through incentives, such as interest subvention, lower taxes, access to technology and so on,” Ajay Shriram, chairman and senior MD, DCM Shriram, said.Referring to the successful PM-KISAN scheme, under which Rs 6,000 is paid annually directly into farmers’ bank accounts, he said the DBT mechanism should be fine-tuned and gradually should be utilised to support farmers in lieu of other subsidies.“Let the farmer decide how to judicially use the money. With the benefit of DBT, farmers can then buy better seed, use new-age fertilisers, optimise water usage and so on,” Shriram said.Stating that many Indian startups have invested in the agri-technology space, he advocated for a policy that encourages growth of these companies and adoption of latest techniques.He said there had not been any significant breakthrough in recent years from indigenous agricultural research and development (R&D) and this could be partly on account of resource crunch.“Two areas that need immediate attention are firstly linking agricultural research with industry requirements and secondly avoiding ideological resistance to new-age technologies such GM crops,” Shriram said.Consulting firm Deloitte India suggested that more funds should be allocated for research and development as well as for increasing the domestic production of oilseeds to reduce the imports of cooking oils.Stating that livestock farming was one of the key pillars for augmenting farmers’ income, the consulting firm said one of the big impediments for development of this sector was the prevalence of various diseases that affect mortality, productivity and overall production.“Supply of vaccines is not adequate to address the increasing demand. Funding for developing vaccines and creating necessary infrastructure would be required in this budget,” Deloitte said.Chirag Arora, founder, Organisch Overseas, said the government must encourage farmers to adopt organic farming.“The need of the hour is to encourage the private sector into the space by offering tax incentives to startups venturing into this domain. It also needs to augment investment on creation of cold-chains and increase storage capabilities,” Arora said.Last month, in a virtual pre-budget consultation with the Finance Ministry, Bharat Krishak Samaj (BKS) had said the government should incentivise balanced use of fertilisers by increasing urea price and lowering rates of phosphatic and potassic (P&K) nutrients in the upcoming Budget.BKS chairman Ajay Vir Jakhar had also sought a reduction in taxes on diesel and transport subsidy on fruits and vegetables but demanded tax on unhealthy foods. He had pitched for tripling investment for micro-irrigation and solar pumps for individual farmers as well as funding for distribution of soil moisture measuring sensors.“Prioritise investment in human resources over infrastructure. There are about 50 per cent vacancies in agriculture research institutions across India. Target 2 per cent expenditure on agri R&D of agriculture GDP over the next few years,” BKS had said.

The high-profile leader, who led from the front on Covid and the BJP’s pet project, the CAA, “will either have to be made the Chief Minister or be accommodated in the Centre with some important portfolio”. “The BJP has been working peacefully for the development of Assam, taking into consideration the interests of all communities,” Nadda said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nadda-launches-poll-campaign-in-assam-197180

12-01-2021||New Delhi||‘Extremely disappointed’, Supreme Court raps govt over impasse||Pulling up the government for the poor handling of the farmers’ agitation against farm laws, the Supreme Court on Monday said it intended to stay the implementation of the contentious laws and set up a committee to find an amicable solution to the problem.Also read:“We are extremely disappointed with the way the government is handling the issue. Last four times you said the negotiations were on. What negotiations are you talking about? If you have some sense of responsibility, and if you say you will withhold the implementation of laws, we will form a committee to decide,” a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told Attorney General KK Venugopal.Dhindsa, 2 cong MPs walk out of panel meetThree MPs , Partap Singh Bajwa and Chhaya Verma (both Cong) and Akali rebel SS Dhindsa walked out of a meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture on Monday, seeking to discuss farm laws.The court’s comments came after Venugopal said farmers’ organisations had rejected various offers made by the government.“People are committing suicide. People are calling names. People are suffering in the cold and the pandemic,” noted the Bench, which also included Justice AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.Abhay’s ‘conditional’ resignation letterSenior INLD leader and MLA Abhay Chautala has sent a ‘conditional’ resignation letter to the Speaker, saying it should be considered a resignation if the Centre fails to repeal the three new farm laws by January 26.“We don’t see why there should be an insistence that the laws must be implemented at any cost…Our intention is clear. We want an amicable solution to the problem. That is why we asked you last time why don’t you keep the laws on hold. But you keep asking for time,” it said. The Bench posted the matter for passing a formal order on Tuesday.During hearing on the petitions challenging the validity of the three farm laws and those seeking removal of agitating farmers from Delhi roads, the top court described the situation as “very delicate”.It said, “We are doing this because you have failed to solve the problem. The Union of India has to take the responsibility. The laws have resulted in a strike and now you have to solve the strike.”“It will not help you to say that this was started by the last government…. We have given you a very long rope. Don’t lecture us on patience. We will decide when to pass the order,” it told the government. It also commented that the law was brought in without much consultation.Venugopal and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta vehemently opposed the court’s proposal to stay the implementation of the farm laws, saying farmers from other parts of the country supported the laws. Venugopal said, “A law cannot be stayed by the SC unless the Lordships find that it violates the fundamental rights or constitutional schemes. Law has to be without the power to legislate, only then it can be stayed. No petitioners have raised any such issues.”“We have an apprehension that someone will do something… which will lead to breach of peace. Each one of us will be responsible if something goes wrong. We don’t want anybody’s blood on our hands,” the Bench said.The courts made it clear that it couldn’t restrain peaceful protest, saying it was for the police to deal with the situation, not the court. “We want to ensure there is no violence or bloodbath. If somebody breaks the law, you take action….”“We should not be understood that we are protecting any law breaker. We propose to pass this order to prevent loss of life and property,” the Bench noted. The farmers’ unions were represented by senior advocates Dushyant Dave, HS Phoolka and Colin Gonsalves. Dave said he needed to take instructions as there were a number of farmers’ bodies involved in the agitation.The Bench asked Phoolka to persuade women and old farmers to leave the stir due to the cold and Covid.CJI asks elderly farmers to returnThe CJI expressed concern over elderly farmers, women and children protesting in the severe cold. “Let me take a risk and say Chief Justice of India wants them (protesting farmers) to go back.”AG opposes stay suggestion, chidedThe SC questioned AG Venugopal’s vehement opposition to its suggestion. “We are not experts on economy. You tell us whether you are going to hold these laws or we will,” the CJI saidNo extra timeThe SC refused to grant extra time to the Centre, saying it had already granted the govt a ‘long rope’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/extremely-disappointed-supreme-court-raps-govt-over-impasse-197085

12-01-2021||---||WTO review backs Centre move to cut farm subsidies||New Delhi, January 11The World Trade Organisation’s review of India’s trade policies has expressed concern about the high level of government intervention in the agriculture sector.Members recognised the importance of the sector in supporting livelihoods and food security.At the same time, they urged India to reform its agricultural policies as they continue to be based on “significant levels” of domestic and export support for key crops, including through subsidies for certain crops such as sugar, and to inputs, said a summary report at the end of the review that has taken place after five years.The three farm acts that are at the centre of the farmers’ agitation are also aimed at reducing government intervention in agriculture.The review was skeptical about programmes such as ‘Make-in-India’ and ‘Self-Reliant India’ as well as preferences granted to local suppliers in the government procurement regime. Members welcomed these initiatives, while raising concerns about the possible trade restrictions they could introduce, urging India to be mindful of any trade implications.It noted that India’s trade policy had remained largely unchanged since the previous review. There is continued heavy reliance on instruments such as the tariff, export taxes, minimum import prices, import and export restrictions, and licensing.On tariff, concerns were expressed with respect to its complexity and uncertainty, the increase in tariff rates, tariff preferences, and tariff concessions.At the same time, Members commended India on its strong economic growth during the review period, particularly in the services sector, allowing India to become one of the world’s largest economies.Some members urged India to finalise ongoing regional trade agreement negotiations. They also encouraged India to consider simplifying its rules of origin requirements.India came in for praise from some members for providing duty free and quota free access for exports.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wto-review-backs-centre-move-to-cut-farm-subsidies-197012

12-01-2021||New Delhi||Staying implementation of agri laws not a solution: Farmer leaders||Farmer leaders on Monday said they would continue their agitation even if the government or the Supreme Court stays the implementation of the new agri laws.The farmer leaders, who said they were “sharing their personal opinion”, were also of the view that a stay is “not a solution” as it is only for a fixed period of time.They were reacting after the Supreme Court indicated that it may stay the implementation of the contentious farm laws and refused to grant more time to the Centre to explore the possibility of an amicable solution saying it has already granted the government a “long rope”.“We welcome the Supreme Court observation, but ending the protest is not an option. Any stay is only for a fixed period of time... till the issue is taken up by the court again,” Haryana Bharatiya Kisan Union President Gurnam Singh Chaduni said.The farmers want the laws to be repealed completely. The protest will continue even if the government or the Supreme Court stays their implementation, he said.Bhog Singh Mansa, president of Indian Farmers Union (Mansa), said a stay on the laws is “no big deal”.“A stay is not a solution. We are here to get these laws scrapped completely... the government has in a way already agreed to scrap the laws when it said it is willing to incorporate as many amendments as farmers want,” he said.“We appeal to the Supreme Court to terminate these laws as these are not valid constitutionally,” Mansa said, adding the protest will continue till the “the laws are not repealed or the BJP government completes its tenure”.Punjab Kisan Union president Ruldu Singh Mansa echoed similar sentiments, saying the agitation started with the demand of scrapping the agri laws and “it will end only when we win this fight”.Darshan Pal, president of Krantikari Kisan Union, said the farmer leaders are consulting their lawyers and a formal response will be given after the SC pronounces its verdict.Pulling up the Centre for its handling of the farmers’ protest, the apex court on Monday said it is “extremely disappointed” with the way negotiations between them were going and will constitute a committee headed by a former Chief Justice of India to resolve the impasse.“We are not experts on economy. You tell us whether the government is going to put on hold farm laws or we will do this,” the bench said.“We are sorry to say that the Centre has not been able to solve the problem and the farmers’ agitation,” it said.The eighth round of talks between the Centre and the farmer unions on January 7 headed nowhere as the Centre ruled out repealing the contentious laws while the farmer leaders said they are ready to fight till death and their “ghar waapsi will happen only after law waapsi”.The apex court had earlier sought the Centre’s response on a batch of pleas against the three contentious farm laws—the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.

12-01-2021||New Delhi||Centre to bear cost of vaccinating frontline workers: Modi spells out phase one of vaccine rollout||Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced highlights of his government’s plan to rollout vaccines for the coronavirus on Monday.In his virtual meeting with chief ministers to discuss vaccine plans, Modi said two vaccinations that were manufactured locally had already been approved for emergency use, and that four others would be eventually rolled out as well.The two that were approved, he claimed, were cost effective and were more suited to India’s needs. “Our experts have taken all precautions to provide the countrymen with effective vaccines,” he said.His government, he said, aims at vaccinating 3 crore people in the initial stages of rollout that begins on January 16. The people to be vaccinated first are what his government refers to as “corona warriors”---frontline workers, including health workers.However, public representatives will not come under this category, he said.The central government will bear the costs of the first phase of vaccinating frontline workers, he said."India is entering a decisive phase of vaccination in the fight against COVID-19," he said. He claimed that vaccination process has been slow globally---only about 2.5 crore people have been inoculated so far. His government would gradually vaccinate larger groups of people in the next few months, he said.“We aim to vaccinate 30 crore citizens in next few months,” he said.He said India had completed dry runs in almost districts of the country.“States must ensure no rumours regarding vaccination get spread. Social and religious groups need to be involved in this,” he said.Drug Controller General of India, the country’s federal drug regulator, has so far approved two vaccinations --- Covishield, a vaccine jointly developed by Oxford and  British-Swedish multinational pharmaceutical Astrazenenca that Pune's Serum Institute of India will manufacture for the country, and ‘Covaxin’, an indigenously developed vaccination by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council for Medical Research---for restricted emergency use. While the first vaccination has already completed trials and has shown an average of 70 per cent efficacy in two doses, the second one, ‘Covaxin’, is still in Phase 3 of its trials.The drug regulator’s approval of a vaccination that is still in Phase 3 of its trials has been controversial, with experts calling the approval premature. ICMR, one of India’s apex body overseeing biomedical research in the country, has since clarified that the approval was in “clinical trial mode”---a term that many experts say they have never heard before.--- Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-to-bear-cost-of-vaccinating-frontline-workers-modi-spells-out-phase-one-of-vaccine-rollout-196982

If you have some sense of responsibility, and if you say you will withhold the implementation of laws, we will form a committee to decide,” a three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told Attorney General KK Venugopal.The court’s comments came after Venugopal said farmers' organisations had rejected various offers made by the government."People are committing suicide. People are calling names. People are suffering in cold and the pandemic," noted the Bench, which also included Justice AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.“We don't see why there should be an insistence that the laws must be implemented at any cost…Our intention is clear. We want an amicable solution to the problem. That is why we asked you last time, why don't you keep the laws on hold? But you keep asking for time. We are not on the merits of the law. We are not on repeal,” it said.The Bench posted the matter for passing a formal order on Tuesday.During hearing on petitions challenging the validity of the three farm laws and those seeking removal of agitating farmers from Delhi roads, the top court described the situation as “very delicate”.It said, “We are doing this because you have failed to solve the problem. The Union of India has to take the responsibility. The laws have resulted in a strike and now you have to solve the strike.”"It will not help you to say that this was started by the last government… We have given you a very long rope. Don't lecture us on patience. We will decide when to pass the order,” it told the government. It also commented that the law was acted without much consultation.Venugopal and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta vehemently opposed the court’s proposal to stay the implementation of the farm laws, saying farmers from other parts of the country supported the laws.Venugopal said: “A law cannot be stayed by the Supreme Court unless the Lordships find that it violates the fundamental rights or constitutional schemes. Law has to be without the power to legislate, only then it can be stayed. No petitioners have raised any such issues”."Kindly remove the impression that we didn't do enough. We gave our best. But the farmers groups have been non-cooperative during talks," Mehta submitted."We have an apprehension that someone will do something a day which will lead to breach of peace. Each one of us will be responsible if something goes wrong. We don't want anybody's blood on our hands,” the Bench said.As a lawyer said he had full faith in the top court, the CJI asserted, "Whether you have faith or not, we are the Supreme Court of India. We will do our job."The CJI said it was for the police to deal with the situation not the court.The courts made it clear that it can’t restrain peaceful protest, saying it was for the police to deal with the situation, not the court. "We want to ensure there is no violence or bloodbath in the streets. If somebody breaks the law you take action".“We should not be understood that we are protecting any law breaker. If someone breaks the law, they will face the consequences. We are not encouraging breaking of law. We propose to pass this order to prevent loss of life and property,” the Bench noted.The farmers’ unions were represented by senior advocates Dushyant Dave, HS Phoolka and Colin Gonsalves. Dave said he needed to take instructions as there were 400 farmers' bodies involved in the agitation."Don't create an odd situation where the unions went to the government, but won't go to the committee," the CJI told Dave, who sought a day's time to respond. It asked Phoolka to persuade the women and old farmers to leave the protest site due to the cold and COVID19.Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing a Delhi resident, cautioned the court against the possibility of protests getting scaled up to demand repeal of the laws following the stay order.On behalf of the Delhi government, advocate Rahul Mehra alleged it was the ego of certain governments, which was not allowing a fair dialogue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-hints-at-staying-implementation-of-farm-laws-order-on-tuesday-196935
