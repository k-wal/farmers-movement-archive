The lockdown in Arunachal Pradesh’s capital complex was extended for another week in view of the spurt in COVID-19 cases in the region, a top official said on Saturday.The state cabinet chaired by Chief Minister Pema Khandu took the decision to extend the total lockdown in the capital region for another week till 5 am on July 20, Chief Secretary Naresh Kumar said.The previous lockdown which was imposed in the capital complex comprising Itanagar, Naharlagun, Nirjuli and Banderdewa on July 6 was scheduled to end at 5 pm on July 13.The total coronavirus caseload in the country on Saturday surged to 8,20,916 while the death toll climbed to 22,123 with 519 people succumbing to the disease in a 24-hour span, according to data updated at 8 am.The rise in the number of coronavirus cases has gained pace significantly.

11-07-2020||---||India in US-Russia rivalry over cybersecurity||New Delhi, July 11After Moscow emerged as a dependable ally during India’s tensions with China, all eyes are now on the United Nations to anticipate New Delhi’s stand on responding to cyber-attacks.Given the current tensions with China, India’s natural reflex would be to ally with the US cyberspace strategy that advocates use of force when faced with debilitating cyber-attacks.The lawful response of nations to cyber-attacks in self-defence is today one of the most heavily debated issues in international law.Already Russia and the US are ranged against each other with two competing proposals before two separate bodies. Interestingly, UN member states approved both the Russia approved OEWG (open ended working group) and US backed Governmental Group on Experts.The issue at stake is when will a cyber-attack lead to war against the alleged perpetrator? There have been several incidents of a grave provocative nature such as the targeting of an Indian nuclear plant, Stuxnet and Russian cyber-activity during the last US Presidential polls.While all nations share the expectations of responsible online behaviour, they differ on who should define the conditions under which a state can take aggressive action against the perpetrator of an on-line attack.At this juncture, while the US wants to retain the right to respond as it wishes to cyber-attacks, this is not an opinion shared by the other big powers Russia and China which want the UN to be in the centre of the picture, even if the process of deliberations is time-consuming.The biggest difficulty that states face when a cyber-attack is in progress is to find out who is the actual instigator. This problem makes nations hesitant to respond to cyber-attacks in self-defence as they fear violating the law of war.The fear is that in the absence of an international treaty, a nation under an aggressive or a domestically cornered leader may arbitrarily equate a cyber-attack with a traditional armed attack and respond by war.With the situation in a flux, it remains to be seen how India can influence opinion towards UN-mandated criteria for responding to a cyber-attack despite US impatience with first fleshing out the criteria in terms if severity, immediacy, directness, invasiveness, measurability and presumptive legitimacy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-in-us-russia-rivalry-over-cybersecurity-111556
11-07-2020||New Delhi||A work in progress: Jaishankar on disengagement, de-escalation on Sino-Indian border||As India and China attempt to lower weeks of border tension in eastern Ladakh, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said a disengagement and de-escalation process has been agreed upon between the two countries and it is “very much a work in progress”.“What just happened is that we have agreed on the need to disengage because the troops on both sides are deployed very close to each other. So there is a disengagement and de-escalation process which has been agreed upon,” he said during a video interactive session at the India Global Week.“It has just commenced. It is very much a work in progress. At this point, I really would not like to say more,” he said.Jaishankar’s comments came a day after India and China held another round of diplomatic talks during which both sides resolved to push ahead with “complete disengagement” of troops in eastern Ladakh in a timely manner for “full restoration” of peace and tranquility.At the meeting, it was decided that senior commanders of the two armies will meet “soon” to discuss further steps to “ensure complete disengagement and de-escalation”.People familiar with the development said the fourth round of Lt General-level talks will be held early next week with an aim to finalise modalities for withdrawal of troops from rear bases of the two militaries besides exploring ways to restore peace and tranquillity in the region.The formal process of disengagement of troops began on Monday morning after a nearly two-hour telephonic conversation between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sunday.Jaishankar held a telephonic conversation with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on June 17 during which both sides agreed that the overall situation would be handled in a responsible manner.The Indian and Chinese armies were locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) for the last eight weeks.The border tension escalated manifold after violent clashes in Galwan Valley on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.In the last six days, the Chinese military has withdrawn troops from all major friction points in line with a disengagement understanding with Indian Army.Both sides have held several rounds of diplomatic and military talks in the last few weeks to ease tension in the region.Tensions had escalated in eastern Ladakh around two months back after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-work-in-progress-jaishankar-on-disengagement-de-escalation-on-sino-indian-border-111552

Now it wants encounter killing of Dubey and his associates Amar Dubey and Prabhat Mishra as well.Apart from the encounters, the application also sought a probe into the criminal-political nexus in Uttar Pradesh.It cited the top court’s verdict in PUCL versus Union of India on extra-judicial killings in Manipur to invite judicial intervention in the matter.This is the second plea filed before the Supreme Court on this matter. Hours before Vikas Dubey was killed in an encounter near Kanpur on Friday morning, an advocate had filed a PIL in the Supreme Court seeking a direction to UP Government to ensure the gangster’s safety as he apprehended cops might kill him.Advocate Ghanshyam Upadhyay—who filed the petition seeking protection for Dubey on Thursday immediately after the history-sheeter was arrested in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh—had sought urgent listing of the matter.Both the matters are likely to be taken up on Monday.Dubey and his associates were on the run since killing of eight policemen, including DSP Devendra Mishra allegedly by them in Bikri village of Chaubeypur area of Kanpur on July 3.The cops had gone there to arrest Dubey.Terming encounter killings is a serious crime/culpable homicide and is an offence against the entire society, PUCL demanded that a committee headed by a retired Supreme Court judge should inquire into police encounters in Uttar Pradesh.It questioned the UP Police version of the encounter according to which Dubey was killed by cops when he tried to flee after a road accident.The police version of the encounter raised many questions, particularly if they were simple administrative liquidations in view of the pattern of encounters in Uttar Pradesh since January 2017, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pucl-moves-sc-seeks-sit-probe-into-vikas-dubeys-encounter-killing-111547

Hardik Patel as the Working President of Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee with immediate effect”.The founder of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS), Patel rose to prominence as the face of the Patidar agitation in 2015 that eventually turned violent. He still faces sedition cases in connection with the protests.Before he joined the Congress, he had claimed neither he nor any member of his Samiti would ever join politics or form a party and had argued for citizen activism. The Bharatiya Janata Party had accused him of being the Congress party's B-team during the 2017 assembly polls.Patel’s appointment is being seen as Congress party's attempt at wooing the resourceful Patidar community in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hardik-patel-appointed-gujarat-congress-working-president-111546
11-07-2020||New Delhi||Demands for Rahul to take over as party chief dominate Congress meet on COVID-19||A meeting of Congress Lok Sabha MPs called by party president Sonia Gandhi to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic and the political situation in the country was dominated by calls for Rahul Gandhi to take over as the party chief on Saturday.The demand was first raised by party chief whip in Lok Sabha K Suresh and seconded by a majority of MPs who attended the virtual meeting that lasted over three hours, said sources.Suresh is learnt to have said that Rahul Gandhi, who has been at the forefront of espousing people's issues during the pandemic, needs to take over the reins of the Congress at this critical time.The demands were raised with Rahul Gandhi in attendance at the meeting, even though neither he nor Sonia Gandhi said anything on this issue, said the sources.Manickam Tagore, Gaurav Gogoi, Anto Antony, Gurjeet Singh Aujla, Saptagiri Sankar Ulaka, and some others backed the demand.Rahul Gandhi resigned as Congress president after the party's 2019 Lok Sabha poll debacle and Sonia Gandhi was installed as interim chief on August 10 by the Congress Working Committee, the party's highest decision-making body.On Saturday, she had convened a meeting with party Lok Sabha MPs to discuss the current political and COVID-19 situation in the country.According to the sources, the MPs also raised the demands for convening the Monsoon Session of Parliament and how the government was evading parliamentary scrutiny.The India-China standoff was also raised by many MPs, including Rahul Gandhi, who said the government continued to mislead the country on Chinese incursions and the current situation in Ladakh.All the MPs demanded restoration of MPLADS funds which have been discontinued due to the pandemic.The Congress members said since they were public representatives, they were unable to fulfil their responsibilities in view of the suspension of the scheme.The Central Government suspended the Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) for two years in view of huge funds requirement to fight COVID-19. The funds under MPLADS for the next two years will be part of the Central pool to fight the pandemic.The Congress parliamentarians also raised the issues of economic downturn, agriculture distress and high petroleum prices.Many suggested the party should raise the cause of the middle class, who have been the hardest hit due to the slowdown and job losses.Rahul Gandhi said the Congress was not playing politics on the issue of Chinese incursions and the party did not want India to be seen as a "weak country" by ceding its land to China. He also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of "misleading" the country on the border issue, the sources said.On COVID-19, the former Congress chief said the central government had "mishandled" the situation and highlighted its apathy in handling the crisis.Now, he said, when the situation had gone out of hand, the Centre had left it to states to fend for themselves. He also demanded that the PM-CARES Fund be audited as it had accepted public money and raised the issue of donations received from some Chinese companies into the fund which, he added, needs to be probed.The Congress is likely to raise the issues discussed on Saturday during the Monsoon Session of Parliament, which may take place next month.The Congress has been critical of the BJP-led government over various issues, particularly its handling of the pandemic as COVID-19 cases have risen exponentially after the easing of lockdown, and the situation at the border with China in eastern Ladakh where 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent standoff with Chinese troops on June 15.The Congress has also been slamming the government for not granting financial relief to the poor. It had demanded cash transfer into their bank accounts.The party has also been raising the issue of rise in petrol and diesel prices and demanded a reduction in fuel charges after a slack in global crude oil prices.

However, if used for patients with severe conditions, proper informed consent is required. Rampant use is to be discouraged since the effect of the drug is directed at the ‘cykotine storm’. All investigational therapies are to be carried out only in proper health care facilities where close monitoring of patients is possible so that potential complications can be managed,” ICMR said.ICMR strongly recommended that the focus of clinical management should continue to remain on oxygen therapy (including high flow nasal oxygen), steroids (which are widely available and inexpensive), appropriate & timely administration of anti-coagulants and high quality supportive care, including mental health counselling for patients and families, proning, management of pre-existing illness and palliation of symptoms.Investigational therapies permitted in India for use in moderate to severely-ill COVID patients include Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Plasma therapy, all under clinical trial stage with improved safety but allowed for emergency use on the basis of limited trial evidence.ICMR said maintaining good hydration is also essential. “Based on severity of symptoms, COVID-19 can be categorised into 3 groups: mild, moderate and severe. For moderate and severe cases, adequate oxygen support, appropriate and timely administration of anti-coagulants and widely available and inexpensive corticosteroids, in accordance with the clinical management protocol, can be considered to be the mainstay of COVID-19 therapy.  For mild cases, which are nearly 80 per cent of the total cases, Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been recommended. The standard of care treatment strategies have shown to yield positive results,” government said.On investigational therapies ICMR said these can be used in specific sub-groups of patients on the basis of informed and shared decision making with the patient before prescribing these drugs. “Remember that these drugs are only permitted for restricted emergency use for COVID-19. Their indiscriminate use or use in conditions for which they are not desirable, may cause more harm than good,” ICMR told states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-govt-advises-cautious-use-of-remdesivir-flags-potential-harm-to-liver-kidney-111520

11-07-2020||Jaipur||Gehlot accuses BJP of trying to topple his govt; saffron party blames ‘infighting’ within ruling outfit||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and a number of his MLAs have accused the BJP of conspiring to topple the government in the state, a charge denied by the opposition party which blamed “infighting” within the ruling Congress for the current situation.The state police’s special operations group (SOG) has issued notices to Gehlot and Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot to record their statement in connection with the alleged attempts to topple their government. Notice has also been sent Government Chief Whip Mahesh Joshi to record his statement.The move came after the SOG on Friday registered an FIR against two people, who have been detained for their alleged involvement in horse trading of Congress MLAs for toppling the Ashok Gehlot government.“Notices have been issued to the chief minister, deputy chief minister and the government chief whip for recording their statement in connection with the matter,” an official source told PTI on Saturday.Sources said nearly a dozen MLAs and others may also be issued notices soon.Gehlot held a press conference on Saturday and alleged that amid the coronavirus pandemic, BJP leaders have “gone beyond humanity” and are engaged in toppling his government, but exuded confidence that the Congress dispensation will complete its five-year term.“The government in Rajasthan is stable, will remain stable and will last five years,” Gehlot said, and alleged that Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria, Deputy Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore and BJP state president Satish Poonia were executing the agenda of their party’s central leadership.“Amid the crisis posed by the coronavirus pandemic, BJP leaders have gone beyond humanity and are engaged in toppling the government,” the chief minister said.The BJP has sabotaged governments in several states. It now wants to play the same game in Rajasthan that it did in Madhya Pradesh. But they have been exposed and people will give the BJP a befitting reply at the right time, he said.Amid this revived political drama, movement of Congress MLAs have started at the chief minister’s residence. The legislators and party leaders would meet Gehlot on Saturday.On Friday night, over 20 Congress MLAs issued a joint statement alleging that BJP was trying to topple the Congress government in the state by “luring” legislators.They also alleged that the top leadership of the saffron party was involved in the “conspiracy”, while insisting that no temptation can shake their integrity.The BJP, however, has rejected the allegations saying whatever is going on with Congress is the result of infighting between the chief minister and his deputy.The party’s state president Satish Poonia said, “The BJP has nothing to do with all these allegations. During the Rajya Sabha elections also, they had levelled such allegations which are baseless.”“The Congress government has failed to deliver and could not manage the COVID-19 crisis properly. Which is why the state government is just trying to divert public attention.” Refuting the claim, Government Deputy Chief Whip Mahendra Chaudhary said there is no infighting in the Congress. “The BJP is behind the conspiracy of toppling the state government and they have been exposed,” he said.The Congress, which came to power in Rajasthan in December 2018, has 107 MLAs in the House of 200. It has the support of independent MLAs and legislators of other parties like the Rashtriya Lok Dal, CPI(M) and Bhartiya Tribal Party (BTP).Soon after it had won the Assembly election, both Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot were in the race for the chief minister’s post. The party high command later named Gehlot as the CM and Pilot his deputy.In the run-up to the Rajya Sabha elections for two seats in the state last month, Gehlot and Mahesh Joshi had alleged that the BJP was trying to poach Congress and other MLAs to destabilise the government.Joshi had also filed complaints with the SOG and the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) of the Rajasthan Police, demanding inquiry and actions in the attempts. Amid the allegations, the Congress and other MLAs were kept in resort till the June 19 Rajya Sabha polls to prevent any poaching attempt.Two persons, one from Udaipur and the other from Ajmer districts, whose calls were intercepted by the SOG were detained last night. Their phone numbers were intercepted for checking on criminal activities like smuggling of illegal arms and mining explosives, an official said.Their role in the matter and political affiliations, if any, are being probed, he said.On the basis of the information that came up during the call interceptions, the SOG on Friday registered FIR under IPC sections 124-A (sedition) and 120-B (conspiracy).The FIR mentions that two persons were allegedly talking about the rift between chief minister and deputy chief minister and toppling the Congress government by poaching MLAs. They also talked about the chances of earning Rs 1,000-2,000 crore by toppling the government, it stated.The FIR mentions information received through sources about conspiracy of forming a new government and also refers to conversation of the two persons regarding the deputy chief minister. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gehlot-accuses-bjp-of-trying-to-topple-his-govt-saffron-party-blames-infighting-within-ruling-outfit-111511

The Bell helicopter conducted anti-locust spraying aerial spraying operation in Bhopalgarh and Shekhala area of Jodhpur.Indian Air Force also has conducted trials in anti-locust operation by using a Mi-17 helicopter and the results are encouraging.“Swarms of immature pink locusts and adult yellow locusts are active in Barmer, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Churu, Jhunjhunu, Sikar, and Karauli of Rajasthan; Bhuj district of Gujarat and Auraiya and Etawah districts of Uttar Pradesh,” the statement said.No significant crop losses have been reported in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Haryana. However, some minor crop losses have been reported in some districts of Rajasthan.As per the Food and Agriculture Organisation’s Locust Status Update on July 3, the ministry said that many spring-bred swarms migrated to the Indo-Pak border before the monsoon rains. Some remained in the east to northern states of India and a few groups reached Nepal.The forecast is that these swarms will return to Rajasthan with the start of the monsoon in coming days to join other swarms still arriving from Iran and Pakistan, which is expected to be supplemented by swarms from the Horn of Africa in about mid-July, it added.Early breeding has occurred along the Indo-Pak border where substantial hatching and band formation will take place in July. This will cause the first-generation summer swarms to form in mid-August, the ministry said.Weekly virtual meet on Desert Locust of South-West Asian countries (Afghanistan, India, Iran and Pakistan) is being organised by the FAO. 15 virtual meetings of the technical officers of South West Asian countries have taken place so far.

Families are not generally permitted to reside in hard areas.“As desired by Director General (DG), BSF, all personnel weighing more than 105 kgs be posted out to hard areas and relieved immediately,” orders issued by the DG’s secretariat to the Personnel Directorate at Force Headquarters in New Delhi, on July 10, stated.A list of such “overweight” personnel along with remarks of the DG has also been sent to the Personnel Directorate. Being overweight or obese is a manifestation of diet and lifestyle, though in some cases it may be genetically induced.Raised in 1965 with 25 battalions, the BSF has emerged as the largest border guarding force in the world with 186 battalions, including three disaster management battalions. It is responsible for the peacetime management of the 4096.70-km border with Bangladesh and 2289.66- km border with Pakistan. The BSF is also deployed along a 237.2-km stretch of the Line of Control from Akhnoor to Kargil in Jammu and Kashmir under the operational control of the Army.The BSF’s responsibilities also include internal security duties, election duties, counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations, anti-Naxal operations and aid to civil authorities during natural calamities.Like with all uniformed forces, physical standards and health issues are a major concern with the BSF. Given its operation role and nature of duties, high levels of fitness and training are required across the force’s hierarchy. In addition to physical fitness, stress among the rank and file is also an issue, for which various mitigating measures have been implemented.Publicly available statistics by the Ministry of Home Affairs reveal that the leading cause of death among the personnel from the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), or paramilitary forces as they were known earlier, is not combat, but ill-health including cardiac disorders that are obesity-related.The CAPFs include border guarding forces such as the BSF, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force (ITBP) and the Shashtra Seema Bal and the non-border guarding forces such as the Central Reserve Police Force and the Central Industrial Security Force.Recently, the BSF introduced a three-week physical fitness course for officers of the rank of Commandant and Deputy Inspector General at the BSF Academy at Tekanpur. Earlier, some BSF officers were also sent to the ITBP Academy in Mussoorie for such training capsules.About two years ago, the CAPFs had made it compulsory for all security personnel to undergo an annual mental health test to determine their well-being and where required, bring in corrective measures based on their assessment scores.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/overweight-bsf-personnel-to-be-posted-to-hard-areas-immediately-111507

11-07-2020||New Delhi||No guarantee Trump will back India against China if tensions escalate: Former US NSA John Bolton||Former United States National Security Adviser John Bolton has said if the Sino-India border tensions escalate, there is no guarantee that US President Donald Trump will back India against China.“China has been behaving in a belligerent fashion all around its periphery, certainly in the East and South China sea, and its relations with Japan, India as well as others have declined,” Bolton told WION TV in an interview.On how far Trump was prepared to go to back India against China, he said: “I don't know which way he would go and I don’t think he knows either. I think he sees the geostrategic relationship with China, for example, exclusively through the prism of trade.”“I don't know what Trump will do after the November elections once the guard rail is removed... He’ll be back to the big China trade deal. If things were to develop between India and China in a more critical fashion, I’m not sure where he would come down,” the former US envoy to the UN said.Asked if he believes that if things were to escalate between India and China, there is no guarantee that Trump will back India against China, Bolton said: “That is correct”.Bolton also said he did not think Trump knew anything about the history of these clashes over the decades between India and China.Trump might have been briefed on it but history didn’t really stick with him, said Bolton, who was the US NSA from April 2018 to September 2019 under the Trump administration.“I think his gut instinct for the next four months is to take anything off the table that complicates what is already a difficult election campaign for him,” Bolton said.“So what he (Trump) would want is quiet along with the border whether it benefits China or India. From his point of view — No news is good news,” he said.The Indian and the Chinese armies were locked in the bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last eight weeks. The tension escalated manifold after the Galwan Valley clashes in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed.Both sides have held several rounds of diplomatic and military talks in the last few weeks to ease tension in the region.

The results of these trials were deliberated in the Subject Expert Committee of the DCGI’s office.The details of the primary endpoint of mortality and other key endpoints of lung function such as improvement in oxygen saturation were presented. Key inflammatory markers were presented to have reduced significantly with the drug thereby preventing hyper-inflammation in COVID-19 patients.After detailed deliberation and recommendations of the committee, the DCGI has decided to grant permission to market the drug under Restricted Emergency Use of the drug for the treatment of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) in moderate to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) patients due to COVID-19, subject to some conditions such as informed consent of patients and a risk management plan to be used in the hospital setup only.The drug will not be available off the shelf.The average cost of treatment with this indigenous drug is also lesser than comparable drugs which are part of the “investigational therapies” indicated in the Clinical Management Protocol for COVID-19 of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drug-regulator-okays-psoriasis-injection-for-restricted-emergency-use-in-treating-covid-19-patients-111494

Reportedly, he had also travelled to at least 14 countries in the past three years and might have invested his unaccounted money elsewhere,” the sources said, adding that he was also believed to have a dozen flats in parts of Uttar Pradesh under “benami” transaction or in the name of his family members and associates.The sources added that the ED would soon register a criminal complaint under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to probe proceeds of crime that were allegedly generated by Dubey, his associates and family members and if this money was subsequently used for the creation of illegal movable and immovable properties.“As Dubey is dead, the scheme of the PMLA enables the agency to continue criminal probe against accomplices of the prime accused in laundering the proceeds of crime and the properties acquired as a result of this criminal activity. Section 72 of the PMLA provides for ‘continuation of proceedings in the event of death or insolvency’,” the sources added.Dubey, 47, was shot dead on Friday by a team of UP police Special Task Force (STF), who claimed he was trying to flee after the car carrying him from Ujjain overturned on an isolated stretch of the highway on the outskirts of Kanpur city.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-to-register-money-laundering-case-against-vikas-dubeys-family-associates-111493

People live in shanties and dilapidated buildings with narrow lanes and open sewers.The first COVID-19 patient in Dharavi was found on April 1, nearly three weeks after Mumbai recorded its maiden positive case on March 11.Addressing a virtual press conference here on Friday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there were many examples from around the world that have shown that even if the outbreak is very intense, it can still be brought back under control."And some of these examples are Italy, Spain and South Korea, and even in Dharavi - a densely packed area in the megacity of Mumbai," Ghebreyesus said.On June 9, the tally of the coronavirus cases in Dharavi, once a COVID-19 hotspot in the city, reached 2,347 after nine new infections were detected.Mumbai has recorded over 88,000 COVID-19 cases and 5,129 deaths.Dharavi has only 291 active COVID-19 cases, while 1,815 patients have recovered and discharged from COVID-19 facilities.Ghebreyesus also underlined that only aggressive action combined with national unity and global solidarity can turn the COVID-19 pandemic around.He also stressed the importance of leadership, community participation and collective solidarity to control the virus."A strong focus on community engagement and the basics of testing, tracing, isolating and treating all those that are sick is key to breaking the chains of transmission and suppressing the virus," he added.On Saturday, India's COVID-19 tally reached 8.2 lakh with 27,114 new cases with 22,123 deaths.According to the Johns Hopkins University data, globally, there are over 12 million COVID-19 cases and the disease has claimed over 560,000 lives.

Announcing it, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar tweeted: “Under the leadership of PM @narendramodi, India fulfilled its resolve to double tiger numbers 4 years before the target through #SankalpSeSiddhi. @GWR @PMOIndia.”According to one of the most detailed wildlife surveys ever conducted, the country’s tiger population rose by 6 per cent to roughly 3,000 animals.Under the leadership of PM @narendramodi, India fulfilled its resolve to double tiger numbers 4 years before the target through #SankalpSeSiddhi. @GWR @PMOIndia pic.twitter.com/ChnPkCEzUG  Paired camera traps were placed at 26,760 different locations across 139 study sites, which generated approximately 35 million photos, including 76,523 tiger and 51,337 leopard photos.An application was sent to the Guinness Book of World Records to see if this was the largest wildlife survey ever conducted anywhere in the world.  The citation at the Guinness World Record website reads: “The fourth iteration of the survey, conducted in 2018-19, was the most comprehensive to date, in terms of both resource and data amassed. Camera traps (outdoor photographic devices fitted with motion sensors that start recording when an animal passes by) were placed in 26,838 locations across 141 different sites and surveyed an effective area of 121,337 square kilometres (46,848 square miles). In total, the camera traps captured 34,858,623 photographs of wildlife (76,651 of which were tigers and 51,777 were leopards; the remainder were other native fauna). From these photographs, 2,461 individual tigers (excluding cubs) were identified using stripe-pattern-recognition software.”“As well as unprecedented camera trap usage, the 2018 ‘Status of Tigers in India’ assessment also conducted extensive foot surveys that covered 522,996 km (324,975 mi) of trails and sampled 317,958 habitat plots for vegetation and prey dung. It’s estimated that the total area of forest studied was 381,200 km2 (147,181 sq mi) and cumulatively the collection and review of data equated to some 620,795 labour-days,” the citation further read.Apart from setting a new world standard in counting large carnivores, the encouraging results validated India’s efforts in tiger conservation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-2018-tiger-census-sets-a-guinness-record-111472

The programme was held at Dhobi Ghat that lacked enough space to accommodate large crowds.Interestingly, the GRP submitted a challan in a local court without arresting the seven, fearing it might lead to a law and order situation since they enjoyed political patronage. In the challan, the police said the SIT had nominated the seven after facts emerged following recording of statements and perusal of documents. The court has summoned the accused on July 30.Among those nominated in the FIR were Rahul Kalyan of Golden Avenue; Deepak Kumar, Karan Bhandari and Kabal Singh of Krishna Nagar; Deepak Gupta of Savan Nagar and Bhupinder Singh of Amarkot in Krishna Nagar.The SIT was constituted by the Punjab Police to investigate the role of the organisers, cops on duty, municipal corporation officials and loco pilots of the train that mowed down the spectators during the Dasehra celebrations.The GRP had registered a case under Sections 304-A (death by negligence), 337 (causing hurt) and 338 (grievous hurt) of the IPC at the GRP police station here on October 19, 2018, after the tragedy.Earlier, a magisterial probe conducted by Divisional Commissioner B Purursartha had held 23 persons, including officials from the MC, police, Railways and organisers, responsible for criminal negligence. The probe had indicted four MC officials.Sarabjit Singh Verka of the Punjab Human Rights Organisation, an NGO, had then said while MC employees and cops on duty had been proceeded against, the organisers who enjoyed political patronage had been left untouched.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sidhu-aide-among-7-organisers-named-in-dasehra-tragedy-fir-111147
11-07-2020||New Delhi/Patna||Holding Bihar polls will put people at risk: Chirag||The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), BJP ally, on Friday joined the opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in expressing concern over holding the Bihar Assembly polls amid the Covid-19 spread, with its president Chirag Paswan saying it would put people at risk and might result in a very low voter turnout.Paswan’s comments have again highlighted his party’s rift with its allies, especially the JD(U), which was quick to snub him and asserted that timely elections would be in interests of “good governance”.The BJP’s response was more guarded as the party said conducting elections was the prerogative of the Election Commission.In his tweets, the LJP president said, “Not only Bihar, but the entire country is affected by the coronavirus. It has impacted finances of the Centre as well as Bihar. Holding elections amid this will financially burden the state more.”He added, “The Election Commission should take a decision with a lot of deliberations. It should not happen that a huge population is put into danger. Polling percentage may also be very low if elections are held amid this pandemic which is not good for democracy.”However, he said his party was ready for the polls.The state polls are due in October-November. The Election Commission has so far not made any official announcement about the schedule.A few days ago, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav had said it would not be proper to hold the elections during the pandemic as he described the situation in the state as “scary”.Asked about whether he thought it would be proper to hold elections in time in view of the rising cases of the infection, he had said, “I think it would not be proper. The situation in the state is scary and the people have been left to fend for themselves in the face of the raging pandemic.” Both the BJP and JD(U) have asserted that they were ready for the polls and have been holding organisational meetings.JD(U) spokesman Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said his party believed that the Election Commission had taken a decision after consultations with all political parties to hold the elections on time.“The Janata Dal (United) has made its preparations keeping in mind the possibility of the elections being held on time,” he added.He added that timely elections would be in interests of “good governance and helping Bihar get its due respect on the national stage”.BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said the EC was already working on modalities to ensure not only free and fare, but also safe elections in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.If the EC is satisfied with situation, then the elections would surely be taking place on time, Anand said in a statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/holding-bihar-polls-will-put-people-at-risk-chirag-111148
