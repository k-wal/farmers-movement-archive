In the flight, 277 Indians were flown into Wuhan and 157 people were flown to New Delhi.While most of the 19 Indians were allowed to go to their respective cities following negative tests after their quarantine periods, three Beijing-bound families were unable to move towards the capital.One family returned to India after failing to reach Beijing, while another family is stuck in Shanghai waiting for Beijing health authorities to unblock their passports in the health kit application, without which they will not be permitted to travel to the capital city.The third family, which includes a child, continues to serve repeated quarantine periods in Wuhan even after they tested negative several times. Their additional quarantine period of 14 days is due to end on January 7 next year.All foreigners and locals living in China need to install a government-maintained COVID-19 application on their mobile phones for travel within the country and within their respective cities.

Moscow had also offered the platform for high level engagements between Foreign and Defence Ministers of China and India, a move that had reduced the tensions. However, the annual India-Russia summit could not take place for the first time in two decades because in-person preparatory meetings were not held.In his message, the Russian President also wanted both countries to maintain substantive political dialogue and carry out promising joint projects in various spheres, while cooperation within the SCO and BRICS yields good results.Incidentally, Putin wished both the US President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden whose win he acknowledged after over a month. To Trump, he wished him and his family good health, high spirits and well-being.With Biden, Putin noted that the pandemic and other global challenges testified to the importance of broad international cooperation and hope that by building a relationship in the spirit of equality and consideration for each other’s interests, Russia and the US could contribute much to enhancing stability and security at the regional and global levels.Incidentally, Putin wished the leaders of over 40 countries, including the two breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia.Though Putin also wished several former heads of government, former PM Manmohan Singh wasn’t’ among them. Putin extended New Year greetings to Shinzo Abe, Silvio Berlusconi, George W. Bush, Robert Kocharian, Romano Prodi, Serzh Sargsyan, Nicolas Sarkozy, Francois Fillon, Tarja Halonen, King Juan Carlos I and Gerhard Schroeder.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/despite-pandemic-india-russia-ties-developing-confidently-putin-191549

It will start from Vijay Chowk and end at the National Stadium instead of the Red Fort, the people said.Sources said over 2,000 Army personnel have arrived in Delhi since late November for Republic Day and Army Day parades, and they are being kept in a "safe bubble".The "safe bubble", created in the Cantonment area, comprises a large number of camps and those selected to stay in them will have almost "zero connectivity" with the outside world till the Republic Day celebrations on January 26 are over, sources said.The Army Day is celebrated on January 15. Similar arrangements have been made by the Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force.Two contingents of the IAF have been selected for the parade and one of them will participate in it. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/republic-day-parade-likely-to-be-shorter-to-have-smaller-marching-contingents-and-fewer-spectators-191537

30-12-2020||New Delhi||Union Cabinet approves export of Akash missile system||In a major move to boost domestic defence manufacturing, the government on Wednesday approved the export of indigenously-developed surface-to-air Akash missile system and set up a panel to ensure faster approvals for acquisition proposals by various countries.The Akash missile systems have over 96 per cent indigenous components and the weapon can hit targets at a range of 25 km.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said the export version of Akash missiles would be different from the system currently deployed with Indian armed forces.The decision to export the missile systems was taken at a Cabinet meeting presided by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Under the #AtmaNirbharBharat, India is growing in its capabilities of manufacturing a wide variety of Defence platforms & missiles. The Cabinet chaired by PM  @narendramodi ji today approved the export of Akash Missile System and a Committee for faster approvals has been created,” Singh tweeted.He said Indian defence exports so far included parts and components.“The export of big platforms was minimal. This decision by the Cabinet would help the country improve its defence products and make them globally competitive,” the defence minister said.Singh said the government intends to focus on exporting high-value defence platforms with an aim to achieve a target of USD 5 billion in defence exports and improve strategic relations with friendly foreign countries.The government has been majorly focusing on boosting domestic defence production and set a target of Rs 1.75 lakh crore (USD 25 billion) turnover in defence manufacturing by 2025.According to estimates, the Indian armed forces are projected to spend around USD 130 billion in capital procurement in the next five years.In May, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman rolled out a number of reform measures for the defence sector including making separate budgetary outlay to procure Indian-made military hardware, increasing FDI limit from 49 percent to 74 percent under the automatic route and generating a year-wise negative list of weapons which won’t be imported.In August, Singh announced that India will stop the import of 101 weapons and military platforms like transport aircraft, light combat helicopters, conventional submarines, cruise missiles and sonar systems by 2024.Subsequently, the defence ministry released the first list of items, with a detailed timeline,  whose import won’t be allowed. The decision was aimed at promoting the domestic defence industry.In a related development, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) identified 108 military systems and subsystems like navigation radars, tank transporters and missile canisters for the domestic industry to design, develop and manufacture.

30-12-2020||New Delhi||Retired bureaucrats term UP ‘epicentre of hate politics’, seek withdrawal of anti-conversion ordinance||Uttar Pradesh has become the “epicentre of the politics of hate, division and bigotry” and the institutions of governance are “steeped in communal poison,” alleged 104 retired civil servants in a letter to Chief Minister Adityanath.The signatories of the letter, including former foreign secretary Nirupama Rao, ex-national security adviser Shivshankar Menon, former chief information commissioner Wajahat Habibullah, also demanded immediate withdrawal of the anti-conversion ordinance.They alleged that the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance was being used to “victimise especially those Indian men who are Muslim and women who dare to exercise their freedom of choice”.Promulgated on November 27, the ordinance specifies the procedure for undergoing religious conversion and prohibits unlawful religious conversion. The BJP-led Madhya Pradesh government too has come up with a similar ordinance.“It has become painfully evident that, in recent years, UP state, once known as the cradle of the Ganga-Jamuna civilisation, has become the epicentre of the politics of hate, division and bigotry and that the institutions of governance are now steeped in communal poison,” the retired civil servants wrote in the letter dated December 29.They also referred to a case of an interfaith marriage involving a Muslim man and a Hindu woman in Moradabad.“In the Moradabad incident, 22-year-old Rashid and his 25-year-old brother, Saleem, were arrested, to be released only two weeks later when Rashid’s wife, Pinki, gave testimony that she had married him willingly, without any compulsion,” the letter, also signed by ex-police commissioner of Pune Meeran Borwankar, stated.  It added that the couple had married in July 2020, well before the promulgation of any ordinance on the issue of interfaith marriage, and were on their way to have their marriage registered on December 5 when they were accosted by alleged Bajrang Dal men, who accused Rashid of “love jihad”, and took them to the police.“The vigilantes who had accosted them brought Pinki’s family to the police station. What is inexcusable is that the police remained mute as the vigilantes harassed and interrogated the innocent couple. Pinki suffered a miscarriage, possibly as a result of the harassment. Rashid is reported to have said.“Does this not amount to effective murder of an unborn child and is the police force of your state, by their inaction, not complicit in this?” the letter stated.This is only one of a series of “heinous atrocities committed by your administration” against young Indians across Uttar Pradesh, it said.What is worse is that law enforcement machinery, with the active backing of the state government, is playing a role reminiscent of the “secret police in authoritarian regimes”, they alleged. “You can pose no greater threat to the nation than by turning its own citizens against one another, a conflict that can only serve the country’s enemies. As Chanakya taught us, a crafty politician must sow dissension amongst rivals. Here you are sowing dissensions among our own people,” the letter added. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/retired-bureaucrats-term-up-epicentre-of-hate-politics-seek-withdrawal-of-anti-conversion-ordinance-191507

An FIR was lodged at the Patel Nagar police station here on Tuesday against the couple who got married in September, the husband’s uncle in whose presence the ‘nikah’ took place and the qazi who solemnised the alliance, Patel Nagar SHO Pradeep Rana said.The high court, after the couple approached it seeking protection, had directed the District Magistrate to inquire into the matter, police said.The police found that the woman had converted to Islam without informing her parents or the district authorities prior to her marriage as is required by the law, SHO Rana said.Circle Officer Anuj Kumar said it was in violation of sections 3, 8 and 12 of the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018.Section 3 of the Act prohibits conversion either directly or otherwise, by use of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage. Section 8 of the Act says, “One who desires to convert his religion, shall give a declaration at least one month in advance to the District Magistrate or any official authorised by him for the purpose saying that he wishes to convert his religion on his own and at his free consent and without any force, coercion, undue influence or allurement. “The religious priest, who performs purification Sanskar or conversion  ceremony for converting any person of one religion to another religion, shall give one month’s advance notice of such conversion to the DM or someone authorised by him.”It further says any contravention of the provisions shall have the effect of rendering the said conversion, illegal and void.Section 12 says when an offence is committed under this Act everyone deemed to have taken part in its commission by way of aiding, abetting or counselling conversion shall be charged as if he has actually committed it.This is the first case of violation of the Act since it came into force in 2018, the Circle Officer said.In another case, the Uttarakhand High Court had recently asked the Haridwar administration to give protection to a couple after the wife cited a threat from her family due to their interfaith marriage.The woman had filed a notice before the district magistrate of Haridwar for changing religion from Islam to Hinduism.

30-12-2020||Mumbai||Bollywood being deliberately terrorised through NCB: Congress||Launching a veiled attack on the Centre and the BJP, the Congress in Maharashtra on Wednesday alleged that Bollywood was being deliberately "terrorised" through the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).In a statement, Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant also questioned when will the NCB summon actress Kangana Ranaut "who consumed drugs and forced others to take them", for interrogation.The federal agency has been probing the drug angle linked to actor Sushant Singh Rajput death case.The NCB had earlier questioned some actors in connection with the probe, conducted raids on several occasions to unearth the alleged "Bollywood-drugs" nexus, and arrested many suspected drug peddlers."A deliberate attempt is being made to terrorise Bollywood through the Narcotics Control Bureau. In the last three to four months, the NCB interrogated several artists and people associated with them. Even filmmaker Karan Johar was served a notice over a party organised by him two years ago, when Devendra Fadnaviswas chief minister of the state."When will the NCB call KanaganaRanaut, who consumed drugs and forced others to take them, for interrogation? She has returned to Mumbai," Sawant said.He said a video clip of Ranaut admitting to consumption of drugs has been in circulation on social media for the last several months."Her friend Adhyayan Suman had in an interview stated that Kangana forced him to take drugs. Both videos are in the public domain. Kangana has publicly stated that she had information about the Bollywood-drug nexus. Then why is the NCB not taking her seriously?" he asked.Sawant said the BJP should ask the actress to share the information with the NCB.Alleging that the BJP has "maligned" the image of Maharashtra, Sawant said the saffron party owed an apology to the people.The Congress and the NCP are constituents of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bollywood-being-deliberately-terrorised-through-ncb-congress-191478

30-12-2020||New Delhi/Chandigarh||Govt-farmers talks deadlocked over MSP, repeal of agri laws; consensus on 2 issues||The government and farm unions reached some common ground on Wednesday to resolve protesting farmers' concerns over rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning, but the two sides remained deadlocked over the main contentious issues of the repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar confirmed that the two sides have arrived at an agreement on Electricity Bill and Air Quality Management Ordinance.He said discussions on the three agriculture laws and the MSP as a guarantee for farmers will continue in the next meeting scheduled for January 4.Farm leader Gurnam Singh Charuni said the government has agreed to exclude farmers from air quality management ordinance and take back the electricity draft bill.After nearly five hours of the sixth round of negotiations between three union ministers and a 41-member representative group of thousands farmers protesting on Delhi borders, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said at least 50 per cent resolution has been reached with mutual agreement on two out of four items on the agenda and discussions would continue on the remaining two on January 4. READ: Hold talks with Modi, otherwise it's a futile exercise, Harsimrat and Jakhar tell farmersLandless octogenarian couple lends might to Tikri stirJoin protesters on New Year, people urged"Discussions on the three farm laws and MSP are continuing and will continue in the next round of talks on January 4," Tomar told reporters after the meeting ended.He said talks were held in a cordial atmosphere and the two sides reached an agreement on two issues -- one relating to the proposed electricity law and the other about an ordinance on penal provisions for stubble burning.He hailed the unions for maintaining peace and discipline during their protest, but urged them to send the elderly, women and children back to their homes due to the extreme cold weather.Tomar said the union leaders kept insisting on repeal of the three farm laws, but the government side tried to explain them the benefits of the Acts and sought to know specific problems faced by the farmers.On farmers' demand for a legal guarantee for procurement at Minimum Support Price (MSP), the minister said the government has already said it is ready to give a written assurance."Talks will continue on these two issues," Tomar said.After the meeting, Union leader Kalwant Singh Sandhu said Wednesday's talks mostly focussed on electricity and stubble burning, while the next meeting on January 4 would focus on the MSP guarantee and the three farm laws.Tomar was accompanied by Food and Railways Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash at the meeting.Meanwhile, three union ministers joined farm leaders on Wednesday to share ‘langar’ food arranged by protesting farmers during the talks to resolve the deadlock over new farm laws.The ‘langar’ (community kitchen) food arrived in a van at the meeting venue, Vigyan Bhawan, after around two hours of discussions had taken place and the two sides took a break for tea and snacks.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Food and Railway Minister Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash joined the farmer leaders to share their langar food during the break.Before start of the meeting, some union leaders had said farmers in some parts of the country are being forced to sell crops, including paddy, below the Minimum Support Price as market rates have fallen and asserted that the agitation will continue till the government agrees to their demands.“After new farm laws were implemented in Uttar Pradesh, prices of crops have fallen by 50 per cent. Crops are being bought at below MSP. Paddy is being sold at Rs 800 per quintal. We will raise these issues in the meeting,” Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait told reporters earlier.“We will not leave Delhi till our demands are met. We will celebrate New Year at borders,” he said.Punjab farmer leader Baldev Singh Sirsa came for the meeting carrying placards of media reports of fraudulent cases reported in Guna and Hosangabad after implementation of the new laws.“We don’t have any new agenda. The government is maligning us by saying farmers are not coming for talks. So we gave December 29 date for talks. We have given them our clear agenda but the government is insisting that laws are beneficial for farmers,” Sirsa said.Showing media reports, he said more fraudulent cases are being reported after the implementation of the new laws and these issues will be raised in the meeting.Tomar headed the government side, which also included Goyal and Parkash, who is an MP from Punjab.The sixth round of talks was originally scheduled for December 9 but it was called off after an informal meeting of Home Minister Shah with some union leaders failed to reach any breakthrough.The government had, however, followed up Shah’s meeting with a draft proposal sent to these farmer unions in which it had suggested 7-8 amendments to the new laws and written assurance on the MSP procurement system. The government has ruled out a repeal of the three agri laws.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various borders of the national capital for more than a month against these three new laws.The government has presented these laws as major agriculture reforms aimed at helping farmers and increasing their income, but the protesting unions fear that the new legislations have left them at the mercy of big corporates by weakening the MSP and mandi systems.

Now that the first authorisation or use of the vaccine outside of clinical trials has been granted, we still have more to do and will continue to provide more data to multiple regulatory authorities, until we are able to see the vaccine being used to save lives around the world.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-approves-oxford-covid-vaccine-indian-regulators-ask-for-more-data-191466

30-12-2020||New Delhi||SC stays release of 10 women naval officers from services||The Supreme Court on Wednesday stayed the release of ten women naval officers, who are seeking grant of permanent commission (PC), from the services as scheduled on December 31 this year.A vacation bench comprising justices Indira Banerjee and Aniruddha Bose took note of the submissions of senior advocate Meenakshi Arora, appearing for the women naval officers, and granted the interim relief.In the proceedings conducted through video conferencing, the bench said the Centre and the Chief of Naval Staff can file their replies to the petitions of the women officers and fixed their pleas for further hearing on January 19."We will direct that the matter be listed on January 19 along with pending writ petitions. In the meanwhile, there will be a stay on order of December 18 (on release/retirement of women officers)," it said.The bench said the interim order would not result in any equity in favour of the officers.Senior Advocate R Balasubramanian appeared for the Centre in the matters.The two separate petitions have been filed by ten women Short Service Commission (SSC) officers including Annie Nagaraja and CDR Vijayeta seeking grant of permanent commission in the Indian Navy. They were to be released from services on December 31.Earlier, the top court, in a landmark verdict on March 17 this year, had asked the Centre and the Navy to grant PC to Short Service Commission (SSC) women officers in the Indian Navy and had asked them to complete the modalities within three months.Later, it extended till December 31 the deadline for implementation of its judgement on grant of PC to women SSC officers in Navy after the Centre had moved the plea in June for extending the deadline by six months citing the COVID-19 pandemic.Prior to this, the apex court, on February 17, had granted the same relief of PC to SSC women officers in Army saying that women and men officers should be treated equally. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-stays-release-of-10-women-naval-officers-from-services-191451
30-12-2020||New Delhi||Protesting farmers firm in their demands as Centre, farm unions set to resume stalled talks||Thousands of farmers agitating against the three new central agriculture laws stayed put at their agitation venues near Delhi, which is going through a harsh spell of winter, unrelenting in their demand of withdrawal of the legislations.On Wednesday, a cold wave swept Delhi as the minimum temperature dipped to 3.5 degrees Celsius. It is likely to get even colder on New Year’s Eve, the India Meteorological Department predicted, as dry and icy winds barrelled through the plains.The farmers protesting against the new agri laws had reached Singhu border over a month ago.The Centre and the protesting farmer unions will resume stalled talks on Wednesday with the latter sticking to their hardline position that the parleys will only be on the modalities of repealing the three new agri laws and giving a legal guarantee on the MSP among other issues.Security remained tight at the Delhi borders with hundreds of personnel deployed at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri border points where the farmers have been camping.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Central Government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middleman and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The government has repeatedly asserted that the MSP and mandi systems will stay and has accused the Opposition of misleading the farmers.

30-12-2020||New York||US court shuts down fraud scheme targeting elderly Americans via India-based call centres||A US court has ordered the permanent shut down of a technical-support fraud scheme, masterminded by an American citizen and operated through call centres in India, that allegedly defrauded hundreds of elderly and vulnerable Americans.The US Justice Department said on Tuesday that the District Court entered the order of permanent injunction against Michael Brian Cotter, 59, of Glendale, California, and four companies — Singapore-registered Global Digital Concierge, Nevada-registered companies Sensei Ventures Incorporated and NE Labs Inc, and New York-registered Kevisoft — from selling technical-support services or software via telemarketing or websites.“The department is committed to protecting vulnerable Americans, particularly America’s seniors, from those who seek to steal their hard-earned savings,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark for the Civil Division.The Justice Department thanked India’s Central Bureau of Investigation for disrupting and prosecuting the scheme.“The department is grateful for the cooperation of foreign law enforcement, including India’s Central Bureau of Investigation, in investigating, disrupting, and prosecuting technical-support fraud schemes and other schemes originating abroad and directed at the American public,” said Clark, who also thanked the Legal Attache’s Office in Delhi for their substantial coordination efforts.The complaint filed in October 2020 alleged that Cotter worked with co-conspirators in India from at least 2011 to 2020 to operate a technical-support fraud scheme, under which the US consumers were contacted via internet pop-up messages that falsely appeared to be security alerts from Microsoft or another well-known company.The pop-up messages fraudulently claimed that the consumer’s computer was infected by a virus, purported to run a scan of the consumer’s computer, falsely confirmed the presence of a virus and malware, and then provided a toll-free number to call for assistance.The Justice Department said when victims called the toll-free number, they were connected to India-based call centres participating in the fraud scheme.Call centre workers asked victims to give them remote access to their computers and told victims that they detected viruses or other malware on their computers.Eventually, the call centre workers would falsely diagnose non-existent problems and ask victims to pay hundreds of dollars for unnecessary services and software.The complaint asserted that Cotter worked with co-conspirators in India to operate the scheme, including registering website domains, setting up shell companies, and entering into relationships with banks and payment processors to facilitate the collection of funds from victims of the scheme.Individual victims paid hundreds to thousands of dollars to the scheme for unwanted and unnecessary technical-support services.Under the terms of the consent decree of permanent injunction, the defendants agreed to be permanently barred from, among other things, offering for sale via telemarketing or website any technical-support service or software and advertising via computer pop-up messages.The consent decree also transfers ownership of 19 domain names alleged to have been used as part of the technical-support scheme to the United States, so that those domains can no longer be used as part of the fraud scheme.The widespread fraud allegedly committed, in this case, was brought to the attention of the Transnational Elder Fraud Strike Force by Microsoft, which often is impersonated by those engaged in technical-support fraud schemes.

30-12-2020||New Delhi||Man of many firsts, true visionary: Indian fashion community remembers Pierre Cardin||The first futurist designer, a thought leader and an empowered person who led radical changes in fashion is how Indian fashion community remembers legendary French designer Pierre Cardin. He died on Tuesday at the age of 98.An out-and-out pioneer, Cardin was a visionary who made a brave move deemed controversial in the late 1950s when he decided to start licensing products, such as pens, wallets and furniture, using his brand name.He was also one of the few first international designers who brought their clothing lines to India where he was a popular name in the 1980s and '90s.Celebrated designer Rina Dhaka said when she started reading fashion magazines as a young girl in the 1980-90s, if there was one global name she knew it was Cardin's, a thought also echoed by FDCI Chairman Sunil Sethi who has fond memories of attending his show in Delhi's Hauz Khas Village in 1994.Dhaka said post 1990s, one saw Cardin not so much on catwalks for fashion for women or men but more in accessories."He became renowned down to the fact that 'I own a Pierre Cardin pen in India or wherever I could be'. He was in many ways a great example of how we as designers can adapt to changing times and still be able to continue a brand over so many decades," Dhaka told PTI.Veteran actor-host Simi Garewal said Cardin was always in the "forefront in designing".Recalling her rendezvous with the iconic designer at the Venice Film Festival premiere of her 1972 film "Siddhartha", the actor said a leading French magazine Paris Match wanted to click her and Cardin together for an 'East meets West' photo-op."I was dressed in a sari. In French, he kept saying I looked beautiful during the photo shoot," Garewal told PTI.Years later Cardin came to India and the actor said when they met she was in a western dress."He asked me, 'Where is that sari?' He loved sari so much."         Cardin was an inspiration for couturier Rahul Mishra, who described the fashion icon as a "complete designer" whose work transcends eras."He was one of the most renowned designers in both luxury and life. From pens to caps, he was the one who started licensing products using the brand name.          "He was the first modernist designer the world has seen. The designs he created in the 1950s look as if they are from the year 2050," Mishra told PTI.When Mishra was studying at the Milan-based Istituto Marangoni, the private Italian school of fashion and design, the designer said one of his faculties used to address Cardin as "Pierre Cardini, because he was originally an Italian"."It was his father who removed the 'i' in Cardini when they went to Paris in his early days. He was a haute couturier in the 1950s. An undisputed thought leader and disrupter who changed fashion. He was a complete designer - be it clothes, pens, furniture, etc," he added.Veteran designer Tarun Tahiliani said the first ever fashion show he watched as a young man living in Mumbai was Cardin's and recalled how his wife Sailaja was selected as one of the models for the icon's show."That's how I ended up seeing my first ever fashion show of any consequence. And I sketched for a day and night. I then knew this is what I wanted to do," he told PTI.Tahiliani said he met Cardin around two decades ago and told the designer about how he inspired him."I said 'It's all because of you'. Had I not seen the show who knows what my path would have been because at that time there was no real fashion in India, it was a textile industry."               The couturier also said turning to licensing made him "one of the richest designers and perhaps even ruined his name towards the end because it was on everything".Sethi too had a Cardin anecdote to share - the designer's show in Delhi."He did a fashion show in 1994 in Hauz Khas Village and for us it was the event to go to. I remember the excitement of attending the show. Even today, how many international brands have had the courage to come here with their full collection and launch it while they launch their international collections?" Sethi told PTI.Pierre Cardin defined "aspiration" for his generation, he said, adding that French fashion always held fascination for Indians and Cardin was the one who brought it to the country."There can be a debate on whether he should have diluted the brand or not, but the credit of showing other designers how a fashion designer's brand equity can be leveraged, goes to him," Sethi added.Fashion designer Samant Chauhan said one of Cardin's most important contributions was combining the 'mini' and the 'maxi' skirts of the 1970s."In the 1970s, fashion was more exclusive and couturiers in Paris had a very limited clientele. The whole market is still very secretive. At that time, it was brave of him to move from haute couture to ready-to-wear," Chauhan told PTI.Designer Amit Aggarwal said Cardin's death is "one of the biggest losses" he has experienced in fashion in the last few years."He was the original futurist when it came to creating clothes, the vision he created back in the day is still relevant. It spoke of a far more empowered person, radical changes in fashion. His passing away is a dark day for fashion," Aggarwal told PTI.Celebrity designer Manish Malhotra called Cardin's death "the end of an era"."Pierre Cardin's finesse and appeal has revolutionised fashion and style since seven decades, and will continue to do so in many years to come," Malhotra told PTI.

30-12-2020||Lucknow||Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacks previous govts for delay in freight corridor project||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday accused previous governments of delaying the dedicated freight corridor project and ignoring modernisation of the Railways, saying politics should be kept away from infrastructure development.Inaugurating the New Bhaupur-New Khurja section of the Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC) via video-conferencing, he said the “roar” of Bharat and ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India) were clearly heard as the first freight train operated on the Khurja-Bhaupur section, and asserted that the corridor would also help farmers transport their harvest on time.Modi to lay stone of AIIMS-Rajkot tomorrowPrime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences in Rajkot, Gujarat, on December 31 via video-conference, the PMO said on Tuesday. To be built over 201 acres, the Rs1,195-crore project is expected to be completed by mid-2022, the PMO said. PTIThe Prime Minister also deprecated the tendency of people to target infrastructure during protests and demonstrations, saying infrastructure did not belong to any leader, political party or government but was that of the country and its citizens. Stressing that this project was the living example of the work culture of the government at the helm before 2014, Modi said the freight project was given permission in 2006, but it was only on paper as the then government lacked the “seriousness and urgency” with which it had to take it up with the states.After 2014, the project was restarted and officials asked to take it forward and by then the budget had gone up by 11 times, he noted.The Prime Minister said on coming to power, he personally monitored the project and held a dialogue with stakeholders, and got new technology as a result of which about 1,100-km work would be completed in the next few months.“Imagine not a single km in eight years and 1,100 km in six to seven years,” he said. The 351-km section has been built at a cost of Rs 5,750 crore. The EDFC is 1,840-km and extends from Ludhiana in Punjab to Kolkata in West Bengal. Modi also inaugurated the EDFC’s operation centre at Allahabad and flagged off the first 1.5-km goods trains. The Prime Minister said political apathy not just hampered the freight corridor project, but also had a bearing on the entire Railways. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prime-minister-narendra-modi-attacks-previous-govts-for-delay-in-freight-corridor-project-191298

It says the country’s large market will continue to attract investments.The report, ‘Foreign Direct Investment Trends And Outlook In Asia And The Pacific 2020/2021’, compiled by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, said the inward FDI flows to South and South-West Asia slightly decreased by 2 per cent in 2019, from $67 billion in 2018 to $66 billion in 2019.Driving force in S AsiaThe growth, however, was mainly driven by India, which accounted for 77 per cent of the total inflows to the subregion and received $51 billion in 2019, up 20 per cent from the previous year.The report said the majority of these flows were destined for the information and communications technology (ICT).Regarding the ICT sector, the report said the investment to India had evolved from information technology services for multinational enterprises to the thriving local digital ecosystem where many domestic players had attracted international investment.The report added that FDI outflows from South and South-West Asia increased for the fourth consecutive year, modestly growing from $14.8 billion in 2018 to $15.1 billion in 2019. The report noted that in the short term, both inflows and outflows from and to the subregion were expected to decline.“India’s economy, however, can prove the most resilient in the subregion over the long term. FDI inflows have been rising, albeit lower, growth after the pandemic and India’s large market will continue to attract investment,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-economy-on-strong-wicket-un-191224

We will organise a tractor march on Dec 31 if the government doesn’t accept our demands. The agenda includes modalities to be adopted for the repeal of the three Central farm laws; mechanisms to be adopted to ensure MSP is a legally guaranteed entitlement; amendments to the Commission for the Air Quality Management ordinance to exclude farmers from the penal provisions; revocation of the proposed Electricity Amendment Bill to protect farmers’ interests.The unions also clarified that they had earlier sought “necessary changes” in the Electricity Amendment Bill draft but now they wanted it to be revoked.The Centre had yesterday invited 40 farm unions for the next round of talks on December 30 at 2 pm at Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi. Responding positively, the unions had accepted the invite.Harinder Singh Lakhowal, BKU (Lakhowal) general secretary, meanwhile, said: “We are going for talks with the government with an open mind, but the latter’s intention is not clear. The Centre wants the impasse to continue and defame the protest.”“We will organise a tractor march on December 31 if the government doesn’t accept our demands,” he added.Dissociating from vandalisation of mobile towers, he said: “We only appealed to people to give up connection of a particular telecom company.” Thousands of farmers have been protesting against the three agricultural laws for the past 33 days at the Delhi borders.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/talks-today-farmers-firm-on-4-demands-191164
30-12-2020||New Delhi||New Covid variant highly infectious, not more lethal||The six UK returnees, who tested positive for the mutated virus, are largely asymptomatic and not too sick as the strain is not known to cause severe disease.Rakesh Mishra, Director, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, one of the 10 labs in the national genome sequencing consortium tracking Covid positive UK returnees, today said the variant “is not worse than the others and clinically does not present different or severe symptoms, but it is much more transmissible”.“Most people with the mutant strain are asymptomatic as is the case with normal strain where 80 per cent cases are mild,” he said.Of the six passengers with the variant, three were tested at NIMHANS, Bengaluru, two at CCMB, Hyderabad and one at NIV, Pune.Mishra said the variant had a greater capacity to infect people and that was a matter of concern as India witnessed second largest number of cases after the US and variants could emerge from within the country as well. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-covid-variant-highly-infectious-not-more-lethal-191163
30-12-2020||Aditi Tandon||New strain reaches India, 6 UK returnees +ve||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 29India today became the 14th country to confirm the presence of a new and more infectious strain of the Covid-19 virus with six persons who returned from the UK between December 21 and 23 testing positive. The samples of all international passengers who arrived between December 9 and 22 and tested positive will be subjected to genome sequencing to detect the mutant strain.The Union Health Ministry said the six persons were in isolation, their contacts had been quarantined and contact-tracing was in progress. In all, 33,000 passengers from the UK disembarked across Indian airports between November 25 and December 23. Of them, 114 have been found positive and their samples had been sent for genome sequencing, said officials. “This is an ongoing process,” Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said today as India stepped up surveillance for virus mutations.Read also: The 5 per cent random samples from Covid-positive people per state (new cases detected since November 25) which the government will test for mutations will include flyers from nations other than the UK as the strain is now widespread.In good news, Principal Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister K Vijay Raghavan said the current vaccines would work against the variant and there was no evidence to the contrary. “The virus variants are not sufficient to make the vaccines ineffective,” said Raghavan, advising “extraordinary caution as the mutant was 70 per cent more infectious”.Most of the tracked 30,000 UK returnees came between December 21 midnight and December 23. The 28-day tracking period — beginning November 25 — was adopted to be on the safer side as the virus incubation time is 14 days, Bhushan said.The government asked people to maintain extreme caution through winters and New Year festivities with NITI Aayog Member (Health) VK Paul saying the Centre had advised the states to consider night curfews to prevent overcrowding. “The parties must be avoided as these can turn into super-spreading events,” Paul said as India’s daily cases dropped to 16,432 — below the 17,000-mark after 187 days. Vaccine dry run successful: CentreThe Health Ministry on Tuesday said the two-day dry run for Covid-19 vaccination in Punjab, Assam, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat was successful. The objective of dry run was to undertake and confirm field implementation of CoWIN and test vaccine delivery arrangements.UK flights likely to remain suspendedNew Delhi: In view of the new Covid-19 strain being detected, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Tuesday said there could be slight extension of temporary suspension of passenger flights between India and the UK.
