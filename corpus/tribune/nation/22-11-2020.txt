We are reformists speaking for the betterment of the party. We are not against the Congress leadership. Rather we are strengthening the hands of leadership by proposing wide ranging reforms,” said Azad, days after another letter writer and former minister Kapil Sibal publicly said time for introspection in the Congress was over and now was the time for action.Reacting to Bihar election loss of the party, Azad blamed the five-star culture that, he said, was harming party’s prospects.“Congress leaders at various levels should give up this five-star culture at least during elections. State in charges must tour the field and not be in a hurry to return to their five star hotel at nights when they are managing elections. They should instead go among the people with the local leaders instead of leaving the turf open for opponents,” said Azad.He said there was no point in staying in top hotels in state capitals and return to Delhi after few days.“This is just a waste of money. There is a huge disconnect between people and leaders at district, block and state level. So why blame only the national leadership all the time,” asked Azad.He said Congress leaders must come through elected committees and that way they will feel closer to the people.The former minister also said the Congress president had already accepted the demand to hold elections to the post of party chief and the CWC.“I am not repeating that demand because it has already been accepted,” said the senior Congressman.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/now-ghulam-nabi-azad-hits-out-at-5-star-culture-in-congress-174263
22-11-2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala Police act amendment against freedom of speech, says Opposition; Vijayan defends move||Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Sunday said his government would consider creative suggestions on the controversial amendment to the police act providing for up to five years imprisonment to those making defamatory social media posts as the opposition termed it as an assault on freedom of speech.Amid widespread concerns that it was a tacit move to silence critics and the media, Vijayan said the government has the responsibility to uphold the freedom of the press as well as that of the citizens.Seeking to allay fears, he maintained that the amendment would not hamper the freedom to criticise.“The government will certainly consider all creative opinions and suggestions that are being aired with regard to this amendment,” Vijayan said in a Facebook post.Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on Saturday signed the Kerala Police Act Amendment ordinance brought by the Left front government envisaging addition of Section 118-A to prevent cyber attacks against women and children.The section stipulates either imprisonment for up to five years or a fine of up to Rs 10,000 or both to those who produce, publish or disseminate content through any means of communication with an intention to intimidate, insult or defame any person through social media.Defending the move, Vijayan said the government was repeatedly receiving complaints even from prominent public and cultural figures against the wide ‘misuse’ of social media, especially by certain online channels, he said.“They have brought to the notice of the government instances where inhuman and vile cyber attacks were carried out by some in the guise of journalism and how it even harmed the family lives of many,” he said.The use of personal likes or dislikes, political or non- political interests and so on to unsettle the peaceful atmosphere of families so as to settle scores arising out of revenge cannot be allowed, the chief minister asserted.“Along with ensuring the freedom of press, the government also has the responsibility of upholding a citizen’s individual freedom and his/her dignity as enshrined in the Constitution. The popular idea that one’s freedom ends where the others nose begins needs to be respected,” Vijayan said.Leader of the Opposition in the Kerala Assembly Ramesh Chennithala said the amendment was against the freedom of speech expression which is a constitutional right.“Amendment to Kerala Police Act shows the intolerance of @vijayanpinarayi government over free speech. This amendment is against the freedom of speech expression which is a constitutional right. The new law is a tacit move to silence critics and media. Nothing more, nothing less,” the senior Congress leader tweeted.He said the chief minister was trying to scuttle the voice of the Opposition.BJP state chief K Surendran said the addition of Section 118-A was a move against the freedom of expression of the people of the state.“There is an undeclared emergency in the state,” Surendran said at a press meet in Thrissur, questioning the need for the new provision under the guise of countering cyber attacks against women.There were existing laws which needed to be implemented properly to counter such crimes, he said.Vijayan said in the name of the freedom of press, individual freedom cannot be violated and similarly, in the name of individual freedom, the freedom of the press cannot be violated.Only those who think that it was their freedom to wreak havoc in others lives, can see the new law as an affront on their freedom.

Faced with opposition from the US, the EU and Brazil, the proposal was put off when it was first tabled at the WTO, with support from the WHO, on October 2.The Indian and South African leadership to the proposal has led to wide backing that is approximately close to three-fourths of the WTO membership, said sources.It has also found support from Medicines Sans Frontiers that urged all governments to “support this lifesaving move by India and South Africa to make sure human lives are prioritised and countries can tackle this pandemic by scaling up every COVID-19 medical tool that exists”.“Nobody can afford to let corporations that have been supported by billions in publicly-funded research money to simply pursue their bottom-line interests without regard to global COVID needs. This pandemic will not be over until it’s over for everyone,’’ it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-nepal-support-wto-proposal-co-sponsored-by-india-south-africa-174259

22-11-2020||Bengaluru||CBI arrests ex-Karnataka minister Roshan Baig in IMA ponzi scam||Former Congress minister R Roshan Baig was arrested by the CBI here on Sunday in connection with the multi-crore I-Monetary Advisory (IMA) ponzi scam, the agency sources said.Baig, who was disqualified as a Congress MLA after he revolted against the party last year, was summoned to the CBI office on Sunday morning and “based on material evidence, he has been arrested”, they said.The former Shivaji Nagar MLA was produced before a court which remanded him to 14 days judicial custody, the sources added.The multi-crore ponzi scheme run by Karnataka-based IMA and its group entities allegedly duped over a lakh of people to the tune of Rs 4,000 crore promising higher returns using Islamic ways of investment, the sources said.The scam came to light in June last year when the IMA operator Mohammed Mansoor Khan fled the country accusing Baig and some government officers of cheating him.Khan had alleged that Baig had taken about Rs 400 crore from him, a charge rejected outright by the latter.Baig was not inducted into BJP, unlike 16 other disqualified legislators of Congress and JDS, whose revolt led to the collapse of the HD Kumarasamy led coalition government last year.The seven-time MLA did not contest the byelections held in December last year while 14 others got BJP tickets after joining it.Khan came to India after much persuasion by the police and surrendered himself.The then coalition government of Congress and JD(S) had formed a special investigation team to probe the matter.However, the BJP government which came to power later handed over the case to the CBI.The CBI has arraigned an IAS officer, two IPS officers, a KAS officer and a corporation as accused among others in the case after the state government gave permission for prosecuting them.The IAS officer, who was the former deputy commissioner of Bengaluru Urban district, had allegedly died of suicide in his house a couple of months ago.

22-11-2020||Kolkata||CPI(M) disagrees with proposal to go soft on TMC||Left Front convener Biman Bose on Sunday said the CPI-ML (Liberation) stance of treating the BJP as enemy number one in West Bengal was not acceptable to CPI-M.CPI-ML (Liberation) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya, following the party’s success in Bihar where it won 12 seats in the recently concluded assembly elections as a part of the RJD-led grand alliance, has been airing the view that BJP should be singled out for attack in the assembly elections slated to take pace in West Bengal in April-May 2021.Answering a question in a press conference here today, Bose said CPI-ML (Liberation) was a political party on its right and it was entitled to have its views. However, Left parties of West Bengal did not agree with this assessment and would like to direct their attack against both TMC and BJP.Mamata Banerjee-led TMC was the ruling party in West Bengal, Bose pointed out and reiterated the charge that TMC and BJP were having an understanding.“Somebody from the state government (read Mamata Banerjee) spoke to Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s son when the ongoing investigations into cattle smuggling and illegal coal business picked up momentum. Why the phone conversation took place exactly at that point of time – neither before, not after,” Bose asked.The veteran CPI(M) leader, who was addressing media persons after a meeting of the Left parties and their allies at the CPI(M) state office here, claimed it was clear that TMC and BJP were having a relationship.“We cannot turn a blind eye to this like an ostrich,” Bose said.Bose said while the BJP indulged in communal politics openly, the TMC practiced competitive communalism.Jyotibabu (iconic CPI-M leader late Jyoti Basu) used to repeatedly say that the biggest crime committed by TMC was to bring the BJP to Bengal, Bose said.Asked for updates on the proposed electoral alliance between Left parties and Congress in West Bengal for the assembly elections), Bose replied that election did not figure in the discussions when the two sides had a meeting in Kolkata on Wednesday.“It was decided that we would discuss the issue of elections after November 26 (the day of the nation-wide strike call given by 10 trade unions). A date will be fixed for the meeting,” Bose said.When a reporter pointed out that TMC and BJP had already switched into the election gear and was not time was running out for the CPI-M and Congress to firm up their electoral arrangement, Bose said he did not think they (CPI-M and allies) were lagging behind in making preparation for the elections.The 16 party meeting held here today chalked out various programmes to be taken up jointly in November and December including the strike call on Thursday, Bose said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cpim-disagrees-with-proposal-to-go-soft-on-tmc-174241

22-11-2020||New Delhi||No leadership crisis in Cong; support for Sonia, Rahul apparent: Khurshid||Amid criticism of the Congress top brass by some leaders following a poor show in the Bihar polls, senior leader Salman Khurshid on Sunday said there is no leadership crisis in the party and an all-round support for Sonia and Rahul Gandhi is “apparent to anyone who is not blind”.Khurshid, who is among the leaders considered close to the Gandhi family, also said there are enough forums in the Congress for airing views and doing so outside the party “hurts” it, remarks that come days after senior leader Kapil Sibal and some others went public with their criticism of the party leadership.“The leadership listens to me, I am given an opportunity, they (those criticising in the media) are given an opportunity, where does this thing come from that the leadership is not listening,” Khurshid told PTI in an interview.Asked about comments by Sibal and another senior leader P Chidambaram on Congress’ poor showing in the Bihar election and recent bypolls, he said he cannot disagree with what they have said, but asked why does anybody have to go out and tell the media and the world that “we need to do this”.“Analysis is done all the time, there is no quarrel about analysis. It will be done. The leadership, of which all these people are a part, will appropriately look at what may have gone wrong, how we could have improved, and that will happen in the normal course, we needn’t talk about it in the public,” said Khurshid, a permanent invitee to the Congress Working Committee (CWC).His remarks come days after Sibal’s public criticism of the Congress leadership and his statement that the time of introspection was over and people no longer saw the party as an effective alternative.Asked about some leaders calling for having a full-time president, he said they should come forward and talk about it inside the party.“See our leader and say you don’t look good without a label, the leader will take a call,” Khurshid said.Hitting out at those voicing concerns that Sonia Gandhi has been interim chief for over a year, he asked who decides one year is too long for having an interim chief and asserted that if the process of electing a new president is taking time, there must be a good reason for it.“Nobody has gone away, they are all here. The only insistence is on a label, why do you insist on a label. There is no president in the Bahujan Samaj Party, there is no chairman in the Left wing parties, only general secretaries...Every party cannot follow the same model,” he said.The election committee is working on the election of the president which is taking time due to COVID, he said, adding that all the work and preparations are underway.Asked if everyone in the Congress is strongly behind Rahul Gandhi as their leader, Khurshid said, “I think that is apparent to anyone who is not blind, that people are fully supportive of Congress president Sonia ji and of Mr Rahul Gandhi, who is our former president. Everybody supports them.”“Those who question (the leadership), if they claim to be democrats, they should have some courtesy to include us who don’t question (the leadership) and inside the party we can decide whether they are more or we are more. All our objection is about this happening outside the party,” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-leadership-crisis-in-cong-support-for-sonia-rahul-apparent-khurshid-174239
22-11-2020||New Delhi||Retrograde step: IMA on govt allowing post-grad Ayurveda docs to perform surgery||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has condemned the move by the Central Council of Indian Medicine authorising post-graduate practitioners in specified streams of Ayurveda be trained to perform surgical procedures and described it as a “retrograde step of mixing the systems”.Demanding that the order be withdrawn, the IMA urged the Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM), a statutory body under the AYUSH Ministry, to develop their own surgical disciplines from their own ancient texts and not claim the surgical disciplines of modern medicine as their own.The notification by the CCIM listed 39 general surgery procedures and around 19 procedures involving the eye, ear, nose and throat by amending the Indian Medicine Central Council (Post Graduate Ayurveda Education) Regulations, 2016.In a statement, the IMA said, “Such a deviant practice is unbecoming of a statutory body. The IMA will have no objections for the council to develop their own dedicated disciplines without mixing modern medicine surgical disciplines.”              It also demanded that the government should refrain from posting any doctor of modern medicine in the colleges of Indian medicine.“The IMA sees this development as a retrograde step of mixing the systems which will be resisted at all costs. All over India students and practitioners of modern medicine are agitated over this violation of mutual identity and respect.“What is the sanctity of NEET if such lateral shortcuts are devised? IMA demands to withdraw the order and first delineate the Indian Medicine disciplines based on original Indian Medicine texts,” the doctors’ body said.Meanwhile, AYUSH Ministry Secretary Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha said the notification by the CCIM does not amount to any policy deviation or any new decision.“This notification is more of the nature of a clarification. It streamlines the existing regulation relating to post graduate education in Ayurveda with respect to the specified procedures.“Further, the notification does not open up the entire field of surgery to Ayurveda practitioners and specifies a set of surgical procedures. It outlines that not all post-graduates of Ayurveda can perform these procedures. Only those specialised in Shalya and Shalakya are allowed to perform these surgical procedures,” Kotecha said.Chairman of the Board of Governors, CCIM, Vaidya Jayant Devpujari clarified that these surgical procedures are being performed in Ayurveda institutes for over 20 years and the notification legalises them.“The purpose of bringing out the notification is also to set boundaries by specifying the list of procedures so that practitioners restrict themselves to the set of surgical procedures as mentioned in the regulation,” Devpujari said.According to the November 20 gazette notification the procedures listed include removal of metallic and non-metallic foreign bodies from non-vital organs, excision of simple cyst or benign tumours (lipoma, fibroma, schwanoma etc) of non-vital organs, amputation of gangrene, traumatic wound management, foreign body removal from stomach, squint surgery, cataract surgery and functional endoscopic sinus surgery.

The further investigation conducted by MDMA is only limited to the mandate provided to it by the Jain Commission Report…” it said, adding that a progress report by MDMA on further investigation and its status is submitted to the designated court in Chennai.The Jain commission of inquiry in the assassination of the former prime minister has recommended a probe into “larger conspiracy” by MDMA and it required monitoring/tracking of absconding suspects and the role of Sri Lankan and Indian nationals in the case.The probe agency further said the top court had already on March 14, 2018, dismissed an application by Perarivalan for recall of the May 11, 1999 verdict of the top court, holding him guilty in the case.It said, “The claim of the petitioner that he is innocent and did not have knowledge about the conspiracy to assassinate Rajiv Gandhi is neither acceptable nor maintainable.”The top court had earlier asked the counsel for petitioner, A G Perarivalan, whether the court can exercise its jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution to request the Governor to decide his plea of pardon filed under Article 161.Article 161 empowers a Governor to pardon a convict in any criminal case.The top court had said, “We don’t want to exercise our jurisdiction at this stage but we are not happy that a recommendation made by the government is pending for two years”.The state government had earlier told the top court that the Cabinet has already passed a resolution on September 9, 2018 and recommended to the Governor for the premature release of all seven convicts in the case.On January 21, the apex court had asked the state government to inform whether a decision has been taken by it on a pardon petition of a convict in the case.The MDMA was set up in 1998 on the recommendations of the Justice M C Jain Commission of Inquiry which had probed the conspiracy aspect of Gandhi’s assassination.Perarivalan’s counsel had earlier said his role was only limited to procuring nine-volt batteries, which were allegedly used in the improvised explosive device (IED) that had killed Gandhi.On March 14 last year, the apex court had asked the MDMA to file a status report with regard to a LRs sent to Sri Lanka for examining one of the accused, Nixon alias Suren, who is lodged in a Colombo jail.The top court had earlier dismissed a plea of Perarivalan seeking recall of the May 11, 1999, verdict upholding his conviction.It had said the material brought on record before it does not inspire confidence to interfere with the verdict in which Perarivalan and three others were initially awarded the death sentence, which was later commuted to life term.The CBI had earlier submitted that Perarivalan had even visited Jaffna in Sri Lanka in the first week of June 1990, besides attending a public meeting along with other conspirators which was addressed by former Prime Minister V P Singh on May 7, 1991 in Tamil Nadu.Perarivalan’s counsel had submitted that he was just 19 years old when the incident took place and had no knowledge of what he was doing and for what purpose the batteries were purchased.Gandhi was assassinated on the night of May 21, 1991 at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu by a woman suicide bomber, identified as Dhanu, at a poll rally.Fourteen others, including Dhanu herself, were also killed. Gandhi’s assassination was perhaps the first case of suicide bombing which had claimed the life of a high-profile leader.  In its May 1999 order, the top court had upheld the death sentence of four convicts—Perarivalan, Murugan, Santham and Nalini—in the assassination case.In April 2000, the Tamil Nadu governor had commuted the death sentence of Nalini on the basis of the state government’s recommendation and an appeal by former Congress president and Rajiv Gandhi’s widow Sonia Gandhi.On February 18, 2014, the top court had commuted the death sentence of Perarivalan to life imprisonment, along with that of two other prisoners—Santhan and Murugan—on the grounds of an 11-year delay in deciding their mercy pleas by the Centre. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tn-guv-to-decide-on-remission-to-convict-in-rajiv-assassination-case-cbi-to-sc-174237
22-11-2020||New Delhi/Riyadh||Climate change must be fought in integrated, holistic way: PM Modi at G20||Climate change must be fought not in silos but in an integrated, comprehensive and holistic way, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at a G20 event on Sunday and asserted that the entire world can progress faster if there is greater support of technology and finance to developing nations.Addressing the G20 side event on ‘Safeguarding the Planet’, Modi said India is not only meeting its Paris Agreement targets, but also exceeding them.“Inspired by our traditional ethos of living in harmony with the environment, and the commitment of my government, India has adopted low-carbon and climate-resilient development practices,” he said.The entire world can progress faster if there is greater support of technology and finance to the developing world, Modi said.“For humanity to prosper, every single individual must prosper. Rather than seeing labour as a factor of production alone, the focus must be on the human dignity of every worker,” the prime minister said.Such an approach would be the best guarantee for safeguarding the planet, Modi said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/climate-change-must-be-fought-in-integrated-holistic-way-pm-modi-at-g20-174234
22-11-2020||Bhopal||MP govt orders probe in Netflix series’ temple kissing scenes||Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra on Sunday said the state police have been asked to examine the series ‘A Suitable Boy’ being streamed on Netflix to check if kissing scenes in it were filmed in a temple and if it hurt religious sentiments.The minister also hinted at taking legal action against the makers of the series.An office-bearer of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth wing of the ruling BJP, has claimed the kissing scenes were filmed in a temple in MP’s Maheshwar town and submitted a complaint to the Rewa superintendent of police.“The series ‘A Suitable Boy’ was released on an OTT media platform. Kissing scenes were filmed inside a temple with bhajans being sung in the background. I consider it objectionable. I think this hurt feelings,” Mishra, the state’s Home minister, said in a video statement on Sunday.“I have directed police to examine the series and determine what action can be taken against the producer and director of this series,” the minister added.Meanwhile, BJYM national secretary Gaurav Tiwari told PTI that he had submitted a memorandum to Rewa SP Rakesh Kumar Singh on Saturday demanding an apology from Netflix and makers of the series and removal of “objectionable scenes”.“Parts of the series were filmed in Maheshwar town in Madhya Pradesh. The kissing scene inside the temple has hurt our sentiments,” Tiwari claimed.Talking to reporters, Rewa SP said further action will be taken after footage of the objectionable scenes is received from Netflix.“I have received a memorandum from Gaurav Tiwari, in which it is said that objectionable scenes in the series were shot in a religious place. Legal action will be initiated after examination,” he said.The six-part Netflix series has been directed by renowned filmmaker Mira Nair, who is known for her critically-acclaimed films such as “Salaam Bombay”, “Monsoon Wedding” and “The Namesake”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-govt-orders-probe-in-netflix-series-temple-kissing-scenes-174233
22-11-2020||Hyderabad||Take a leaf out of this ‘green’ wedding invite of railway officer||For a ‘green’ beginning of his married life, a 29-year-old officer in the railway traffic service designed his wedding cards embedded with seeds for invitees to use them to reap flowers and vegetables.“I want to contribute to greenery. So I came up with this idea. Each card has three varieties of flower-bearing plants—lily, marigold and chrysanthemums,” K Shashikanth told PTI.The envelope has three seeds of different vegetable plants—green chilli, tomato and lady’s finger, he said.Not only with a request to attend his marriage, the soon-to-be-bridegroom insists friends and relatives to share pictures of the plants they grow using his eco-friendly wedding card.“They (invitees) also have a responsibility to grow the flowers and vegetables, he said.The wedding would take place on November 28 at Shadnagar near here.Explaining the process of making the card, Shashikant said after making the paper pulp, it would be pressed to the required gauge and size and then seeds are embedded.He placed an order with an Agra-based startup for making such innovative, unique wedding cards at Rs 200 each.Amazed by the initiative of the young man, Cyberabad Police Commissioner VC Sajjanar said Shashikanth has become a role model to all bureaucrats and an inspiration to all.In a press release, Sajjanar appealed to others like this young man to follow eco-friendly methods for everything they do to reduce pollution in the environment and safeguard Mother Earth.

22-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality ‘poor’, likely to deteriorate further||Delhi’s air quality remained “poor” on Sunday and government agencies said it is likely to deteriorate further due to unfavourable meteorological conditions.The city’s 24-hour average AQI was 274 on Sunday. It was 251 on Saturday, 296 on Friday, 283 on Thursday and 211 on Wednesday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.The central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said Delhi-NCR’s air quality is likely to deteriorate to the “very poor” category on Monday due to unfavourable meteorological conditions.The predominant surface wind direction was northwesterly and the maximum wind speed 12 kmph on Sunday, it said, adding that the wind speed is likely to drop to eight kmph on Monday.The central agency said the AQI is likely to deteriorate to the upper end of the “very poor” category between Tuesday and Friday.As many as 649 farm fire counts were observed over Punjab, Haryana and adjoining regions on Saturday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR.Stubble burning accounted for 12 per cent of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution on Sunday. It was 13 per cent on Saturday, 15 per cent on Friday, 20 per cent on Thursday and eight per cent on Wednesday.The minimum temperature settled at 6.9 degrees Celsius on Sunday,  the lowest in the month of November in 17 years, according to IMD.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion. Delhi’s ventilation index—a product of mixing depth and average wind speed – was around 6,500 m2/s on Sunday and is likely to drop to 1,500 m2/s on Monday and Tuesday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.Earlier in the day, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the Public Works Department has installed 23 anti-smog guns and deployed 150 tankers for water sprinkling at key intersections and construction sites to reduce dust pollution. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhis-air-quality-poor-likely-to-deteriorate-further-174225
22-11-2020||Guwahati||Ahead of elections, top BPF leaders join BJP in Assam||Ahead of the next year’s assembly polls, with a shot in the arm for BJP, two top leaders of Bodoland Peoples Front (BPF), an ally of the ruling saffron party in Assam, including founding leader and Rajya Sabha MP Biswajit Daimary, on Sunday joined the leading partner.Along with Daimary, who has resigned from the Rajya Sabha on Saturday, BPF’s General Secretary and MLA Emmanuel Mosahary joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in presence of Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, state BJP president Ranjit Kumar Dass and national General Secretary Dilip Saikia in Guwahati.Sonowal welcomed both the tribal leaders to BJP and hoped that their joining would benefit the party.The tribal dominated party BPF since 2016 is the ruling partner of the BJP in the state and also a member of the saffron party led North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA).However, both the BJP and BPF are fighting against each other in the Bodoland Territorial Council’s crucial polls to be held on December 7 and 10.“I have quit the BPF earlier on November 11 and from Sunday I would work for the people from the BJP platform,” Daimary told IANS over phone.The 49-year-old tribal leader, whose Rajya Sabha tenure was scheduled to end in mid 2026, in his resignation letter, available with IANS, to Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu, said: “I request that my resignation be accepted by you with immediate effect.” Daimary and Mosahary’s resignations are big setbacks for the BPF just two weeks before the politically significant elections to the 40-member BTC.The BJP had wrested power from the Congress in Assam in 2016 by becoming the single largest party with 60 MLAs in the 126-member Assembly and formed an alliance with the BPF and the Asom Gana Parishad, which won 14 and 12 seats, respectively. The ruling alliance also has the support of an Independent MLA.The Hagrama Mohilary-led BPF has been ruling the BTC since its first elections in 2005 after the autonomous tribal constitutional body was constituted in 2003.The all-important elections to the Assam Assembly are expected to be held in March-April next year. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-elections-top-bpf-leaders-join-bjp-in-assam-174223
22-11-2020||New Delhi||Govt exploring modalities of emergency authorisation of COVID-19 vaccine||The government is exploring the modalities of emergency authorisation and usage of anti-coronavirus vaccines pending completion of phase-three clinical trial and regular licensure.The issue of advance purchase commitment for vaccines, including pricing, was also discussed in a recent meeting attended by NITI Aayog Member (Health) Vinod Paul, Principal Scientific Adviser to the government K Vijay Raghavan and Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan.“It was decided that the PMO-constituted Vaccine Task Force (VTF) will lay down the principles for emergency use authorisation while the National Expert Group On Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) should take the lead in setting the principles for advance market commitment, including vaccine pricing,” a source said.These developments assume significance against the backdrop of Pfizer seeking emergency use authorisation of its COVID-19 vaccine from the US regulators. Another US-based biotechnology giant, Moderna, said it also intends to apply for an emergency use authorisation (EUA) with the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) in the coming weeks.Meanwhile, five vaccines are under different phases of clinical trials in India. The Serum Institute of India is conducting the phase-three trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, while Bharat Biotech and ICMR has already started the phase-three trial of the indigenously developed COVAXIN jab.An indigenously developed vaccine by Zydus Cadila has completed phase-two clinical trial in the country. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories will soon start combined phase two and three trials of the Russian COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V in India.According to the source, an urgent meeting of the vaccine task force (VTF) with experts will be convened to review the scientific status of vaccines globally and whether, if so how and when should the decision on emergency authorisation of vaccines be taken.The terms of references for two major bodies dealing with vaccine introduction—the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) and the Central Drug Standards and Control Organisation (CDSCO) -- will be set and their roles clearly defined for authorisation and emergency authorisation.It was also agreed at the meeting that one point of contact will be responsible for examining and responding to authorisations given (or in the pipeline), globally, the source said.Towards advance market commitment, NEGVAC should lay down principles for procurement and price negotiations. Using these principles, negotiations should be speedily initiated.It was also decided at the meeting that a NEGVAC group should be proactively reaching out to each company as their results from phase three are announced, a source said.Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech have announced that its vaccine appears 95 per cent effective at preventing mild to severe COVID-19 disease in a large, ongoing study. Moderna has also announced that its COVID-19 vaccine has shown to be 94.5 per cent effective in preventing the deadly disease. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-exploring-modalities-of-emergency-authorisation-of-covid-19-vaccine-174222
22-11-2020||Jaipur||BJP seeks probe into Rajasthan minister’s audio clip||The BJP on Sunday sought an inquiry after an audio clip in which a Rajasthan minister is allegedly heard using a casteist slur against a Congress worker surfaced on social media.                        In the purported conversation over the phone, Rajasthan Sports Minister Ashok Chandna is allegedly heard using a casteist slur against Congress’ Raju Gurjar over the ticket for the panchayat polls in Bundi district and dared him to contest the elections. The casteist slur has been made at the end of the conversation. Chandna could not be reached for comments while the opposition BJP has demanded an inquiry into the issue. “An inquiry into the matter should be ordered and if it is the voice of the minister, he should be sacked,” BJP spokesperson Ramlal Sharma said. Congress worker Raju said he was threatened by the minister on November 8 for demanding the ticket for the Panchayat elections.  “I had been working for the party for the past 17 years and demanded the ticket for the elections of the panchayat samiti member from Ward No.5 of Nainwa in Bundi. I texted the minister seeking an update on it but he lost his cool. He called back and threatened me,” Gurjar alleged.Gurjar is now contesting the elections as an Independent candidate. The polling in Nainwa will take place on November 27. Chandna represents the Hindoli (Bundi) assembly constituency of Rajasthan.

22-11-2020||New Delhi||India to launch deep sea mission in 3-4 months: MoES official||India will soon launch an ambitious ‘Deep Ocean Mission’ that envisages the exploration of minerals, energy and marine diversity of the underwater world, a vast part of which still remains unexplored, a top official of the Ministry of Earth Sciences said.The Ministry’s secretary, M Rajeevan, said required approvals are being obtained for the “futuristic and game-changing” mission, and it is likely to be launched in the next three to four months.The mission, which is expected to cost over Rs 4,000 crore, will give a boost to efforts to explore India’s vast Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf, another senior official of the MoES has said.Rajeevan said the mission would also involve developing technologies for different deep ocean initiatives.“The multi-disciplinary work will be piloted by the MoES and other government departments like the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), Department of Biotechnology, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) will be stakeholders in this mission,” Rajeevan added.Some of the technologies involved will be developed by organisations such as the ISRO and DRDO.“One of the main aspects of the mission will be design, development and demonstration of human submersibles,” the MoES official said.Another aspect was exploring the possibility of deep sea mining and developing necessary technologies, the official added.The official said the move strategically significant as it would enhance India’s presence in the Indian Ocean, where other players, namely China, Korea and Germany, are active.Last week, China live-streamed footage of its new manned submersible parked at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. This was part of its mission into the deepest underwater valley on the planet.India has been ear-marked nearly 1.5 lakh square kilometres of area in the central Indian Ocean for exploration.In September 2016, India signed a 15-year contract with the International Seabed Authority (ISA) for exploration of Poly-Metallic Sulphides (PMS) in the Indian Ocean.The ISA is an institution set up under the Convention on Law of the Sea to which India is a Party.The 15-year contract formalised India’s exclusive rights for exploration of PMS in the allotted area in the Indian Ocean.The ISA earlier approved 10,000 sq km for India with a 15-year PMS exploration plan along the Central Indian Ridge (CIR) and Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) region of the Indian Ocean.Poly-Metallic Sulphides (PMS), which contain iron, copper, zinc, silver, gold, platinum in variable constitutions, are precipitates of hot fluids from upwelling hot magma from deep interior of the oceanic crust, discharged through mineralized chimneys.PMS in the Ocean Ridges have attracted worldwide attention for their long-term commercial as well as strategic values.“The aim is to be prepared when rules are formalised in this area. The deep oceans frontier is yet to be explored. We have been working on it on a piecemeal basis but the thrust is to carry out work on mission mode,” the official added. The mission will also involve the procurement of more advanced deep sea vessels for explorations. The existing vessel Sagar Kanya is nearly three-and-half decades old. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-launch-deep-sea-mission-in-3-4-months-moes-official-174211
22-11-2020||Agartala||Death toll rises to 2 in Tripura firing incident||The death toll in the firing incident in Panisagar area of Tripura rose to two on Sunday with a fire service employee succumbing to his injuries, a police officer said.43-year-old Srikanta Das, a carpenter who was among the protesters, was killed and at least 23 others were injured when police opened fire at picketers, who had blocked the Assam-Agartala National Highway at Panisagar in North Tripura district on Saturday, police said.The demonstrators were protesting against a government plan to rehabilitate over 6,000 Brus in Kanchanpur sub-division.Biswajit Debbarma, a fire service personnel, who was injured by the protesters and admitted at GBP Hospital with polytrauma and head injuries died early Sunday, Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) of New Capital Complex, Piya Madhuri Majumder said.Locally known as “Assam-Agartala Road”, the NH-8 is often called the lifeline of Tripura as it connects the state with the rest of the country.The Joint Movement Committee (JMC), comprising Bengalis and local Mizos, had called an indefinite bandh in Kanchanpur and had blocked the highway on Saturday.Trouble started, when a contingent of police and paramilitary, including Tripura State Rifles (TSR), was involved in a scuffle with JMC activists following an altercation over withdrawal of the road blockade.JMC convenor Sushanta Baruah alleged that police personnel had opened fire on the protestors “who were demonstrating peacefully” while ADG Rajiv Singh said the police was compelled to fire in self defence since the crowd had turned unruly and tried to snatch weapons from the security personnel.Meanwhile, JMC chairman Zairemthiama Pachuau said, the indefinite strike, which entered its seventh day on Sunday, is continuing at Kanchanpur.“The situation is calm, but tense. We are waiting to discuss the situation with a government delegation, comprising a minister and some MLAs, which is likely to be held here at 4 pm.“State minister for Social Welfare Shantana Chakma informed us that the delegation is on way from Agartala, about 200 km from here’, Pachuau told PTI over phone.The state government has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the police firing and has announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the family of the deceased.State Law minister Ratan Lal Nath, who is also the cabinet spokesperson, said that the probe would be conducted by district magistrate of North Tripura, Nagesh Kumar, and he would submit the report “within one month”.Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb chaired a meeting with Deputy Chief Minister Jishnu Devbarma in presence of Director General of Police V S Yadav and Additional Director General of Police Rajiv Singh and took stock of the situation on Saturday night, Nath told reporters here.The Bru issue had started in September 1997 following demands of a separate autonomous district council by carving out areas of western Mizoram adjoining Bangladesh and Tripura.About 30,000 Bru tribals had then fled Mizoram due to the ethnic tension there and took shelter in refugee camps in Tripura.The first attempt to repatriate the Brus was made in November 2009 by the Centre along with the governments of Tripura and Mizoram.However, the effort had met with little success.A quadripartite accord was signed among the Union Home Ministry, state governments of Mizoram and Tripura and leaders of Bru refugees in January this year to permanently settle Bru evacuees in Tripura.The Centre sanctioned Rs 600 crore as rehabilitation package for the displaced Brus as a final solution to the 23-year-old imbroglio.The JMC chairman had told newsmen recently that the North Tripura district magistrate had assured that 1,500 families would be settled in the area.“But now the government is trying to settle 6,000 families,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/death-toll-rises-to-2-in-tripura-firing-incident-174208
22-11-2020||Rampur (Uttar Pradesh)||Rampur royal family value pegged at Rs 2,664 crore||The royal family of Rampur has finally been assigned a value -- Rs 2,664 crores.In their submissions to the district and sessions judge of Rampur, the court-appointed commissioners on Saturday filed their estimates of assets that belonged to the last Nawab of Rampur.The court will now hold daily hearings to meet the December deadline that the Supreme Court had set for the division of property among the claimants.The Nawab of Rampur, Raza Ali Khan, was the first to accede to India after Independence in 1949 on the condition that two things would not change -- ownership of property and the right of primogeniture.After he died in 1966, both spurred a dispute that led to one of the longest-running civil suits in the country that is now in its 48th year.He was survived by six daughters and three sons.The five properties have 18 claimants, including former MP Begum Noor Bano and former MLA Kazim Ali Khan.According to the court-appointed commissioner for immovable assets, advocate Arun Prakash Saxena, "The Khasbagh Palace is spread across a 350-acre property, Benazir Kothi and orchard occupy 100 acres, Shahbad Castle 250 acres, Kunda orchard is 12,000 square metres and Nawab's private railway station is 19,000 square metres." "These immovable assets have been valued at approximately Rs 2,600 crore," he said.More than half of this estimate, Rs 1,435 crore, has been attributed to the Khasbagh Palace, the sprawling royal residence built in phases till 1930 and was host to Ghalib, Begum Akhtar and Fida Hussein Khan.Moveable assets that were evaluated in the five properties range from art (paintings by Baroque portrait artist Sir Peter Lely and 19th-century British portrait artist John Hanson Walker), vintage cars (a 1939 Buick, a 1954 Dodge convertible, 1956 Austin convertible, 1956 Jeep Willys, 1956 Fiat, 1957 Plymouth and Fargo trucks), the throne, swords and daggers to gold cigarette cases, chandeliers, crockery, statues, mirrors, carpets, etc."The valuation of the moveable assets was conducted by a private interior and commercial designing firm, which arrived at Rs 64 crore," said advocate Harsh Gupta, who has been representing one of the claimants, the family of the Nawab's second son Zulfiquar Ali Khan.Last year, the Supreme Court had asked the Rampur district judge to evaluate the property and come up with a plan for the division of assets.It had earlier said that the Muslim personal law would prevail over the traditional gaddi system, which made way for the women in the family to stake claim to the property as well.Before the lockdown, the court-appointed commissioner for moveable assets, Saurabh Saxena, had submitted the valuation report of the Nawab's armoury -- with vintage guns, gem-studded swords and knives with tangs made of precious stones -- at Rs 76 lakh.The Nawab's heirs had contested the conservative assessment and planned on challenging it in court.The most disappointing was the much-awaited opening of the Khasbagh Palace strongroom, which was said to have jewels locked away. When it was opened in August last year, the lockers were found to be empty.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rampur-royal-family-value-pegged-at-rs-2-664-crore-174200
22-11-2020||Hyderabad||Fake Army Major dupes 17 prospective brides of Rs 6.61 crore||A conman, who impersonated as an Army Major to dupe 17 prospective brides to the tune of Rs 6.61 crore, was running an organised racket by converting a rented room in Hyderabad as an 'Army office'.In addition to dressing as an Army officer, he had decked up the room in such a manner that the brides and their family members never had any doubt about his credentials during video conferences he used to have with them from the 'office'.After having a free run for six years during which he cheated 17 prospective brides, he was finally caught on Saturday when he was trying to dupe another woman.The police investigations revealed that Srinivas Chowhan, whose real name is Mudavath Srinu Naik, had used the money to buy a duplex house in Hyderabad and three cars, including a Mercedes Benz.Hailing from Prakasam district's Kilampalli village in Andhra Pradesh, Srinivas had studied only up to ninth standard.

Over 4 crore of the total over 7 crore voters exercised their franchise.Following a Supreme Court direction in February this year, the Election Commission had in March asked political parties to justify why they chose candidates with criminal history to contest elections.Assembly elections in Bihar were the first full-fledged polls where such details of their candidates were made public by parties.

22-11-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal to likely lose chance to conduct Phase II trial of Sputnik V for want of govt approval||West Bengal will likely lose the chance to conduct Phase II clinical trial of Russian COVID-19 vaccine candidate Sputnik V because of the delay in grant of approval by the state government, a top official of an organisation involved in facilitating the exercise said on Sunday.The trails were proposed to start at the state-run College of Medicine and Sagore Dutta Hospital (CMSDH) in North 24 Parganas district adjoining Kolkata later this week along with six other centres in different parts of the country."We are on the verge of losing Phase II trials of Sputnik-V vaccine at the CMSDH because of the slow approach of the state health department in giving the approval. We had applied for the approval on November 4 and there is no response yet," the head of business development at site management organisation CliniMed LifeSciences, Snehendu Koner, told PTI.He said while the initial feasibility process at CMSDH started along with the other centres where the trials are to take place, the approval could not be obtained in time.After securing the health department's approval, the consent of the hospital's Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) is also required before starting the trials, Koner said.The IECs of the rest six institutions have already given the go ahead for the trials.When contacted, a senior official of the state health department, who was unwilling to be named, said, "This is an internal matter of our department. However, I believe that several official holidays on account of festivals could have delayed the approval process. I cannot talk much about it. We will look into it."The site management organisation had conducted necessary surveys to check infrastructure and cold storage facilities at the Sagore Dutta Hospital before approaching the state health department for approval to conduct the trials."Such approvals from the state health department are not required to conduct trials for any vaccines or drugs. But surprisingly, we were asked to seek approval this time which delayed the process and eventually we are losing it," he said.Clinical trials of Sputnik V will be conducted by pharma major Dr Reddy's Laboratories in coordination with Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).The RDIF will be supplying 100 million doses of its potential COVID-19 vaccine to Dr Reddy's Lab.During the Phase II trials, 100 volunteers will be chosen all over the country. Out of them 75 will be administered the vaccine, while the rest will be given placebo -- a substance or treatment which is designed to have no therapeutic value.Koner said Phase III of the trial of the vaccine candidate will begin in India in January and the state health department and the CMSDH will be urged to expedite the approval process.The site management organisation facilitates clinical trials by national and global pharmaceutical companies engaged in drug and vaccine development.Citing interim trial results, Russia's health ministry claimed earlier this month that Sputnik V vaccine had shown 92 per cent efficacy in preventing COVID-19.The announcement had followed results unveiled earlier by vaccine developers Pfizer and BioNTech, who said their vaccine was more than 90 per cent effective at preventing the coronavirus disease.The calculation was based on 20 confirmed COVID-19 cases split between vaccinated individuals and those who received the placebo, the RDIF had said.

22-11-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra BJP opposing MVA govt’s every move for sake of it: Sena MP Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday claimed BJP leaders in Maharashtra were opposing every move of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government just for the sake of it.In his weekly column ‘Rokhthok’ in the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, Raut, referring to the controversy over reopening places of worship in the state, said those who link fight against COVID-19 to ‘Hindutva’ are “enemies” of the people.He also said the unlock process in Delhi began too soon, leading to the present spike in COVID-19 cases there.Blaming the Delhi government’s “overconfidence” for the present crisis, the Sena’s chief spokesperson apprehended another lockdown in the national capital.“Markets, public places and places of worship will be closed down again. Why did this happen, Maharashtra BJP leaders should think...they are opposing every move of the MVA government for the sake of it,” he said.The Rajya Sabha member further said BJP leaders staged protests over their demand for granting permission for the ‘Chhath Puja’ celebration in Maharashtra.“You may have won the Bihar polls, but there is no need to drag Mumbai’s Bihari population into the controversy.Lakhs of people gather on Mumbai’s seashore and in the pandemic, this is illegal,” he said.The BJP governments refused permission for Chhath Puja at public places in Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, but the party demands the same in Maharashtra, he said.“The BJP wants to criticise every step of the state government even if it means people lose their lives,” he alleged, and said if the BJP feels there should be another lockdown in Maharashtra, “it is the state’s bad luck”.Raut also said those who could not give the ‘Bharat Ratna’ to Hindutva ideologue V D Savarkar are planning to rename Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in Delhi.“This is laughable...create your own legacy instead of renaming institutions in whose creation you have no role to play. This country hasn’t been built in last six years,” Raut said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-bjp-opposing-mva-govts-every-move-for-sake-of-it-sena-mp-raut-174179

22-11-2020||New Delhi||Tariff hike needed as pricing 'unsustainable', market condition to drive decision: Mittal||Telecom tariff hike is needed as the current rates are "unsustainable" and market conditions will be seen before a call is taken, telecom czar and chairman of Bharti Airtel Sunil Mittal has said.On the issue of whether or not Chinese telecom equipment vendors will be allowed to participate in next-generation 5G networks, Mittal said the larger question is that of the nation's decision and asserted "what the country decides will be accepted by everyone".Where tariffs are concerned, the company has already taken a clear stance on the issue, he said adding that Airtel is of the firm view that tariffs need go up."...current tariffs are unsustainable but Airtel cannot move without the industry moving or the regulator moving," Mittal told PTI in an interview.Industry needs a tariff hike at some point in time, he said adding "we will have to see the market conditions to do it".Mittal was replying to a question on the timing for what seems to be an imminent industry-wide tariff hike in the Indian market and whether Airtel will initiate it or wait for rivals to make their first move.It is pertinent to mention that in August this year, Mittal had described 16 GB data consumption a month for Rs 160 as a tragedy.The company has maintained that Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) should rise to Rs 200 and eventually to Rs 300 for a sustainable business model. Bharti Airtel's mobile ARPU stood at Rs 162 for the September quarter from Rs 128 in Q2 FY20, and Rs 157 in the preceding June quarter.The Bharti Group supremo - who has time and again drawn attention to the high taxes and levies in the sector - further said that telecom being a "high capital-intensive industry" required a steady flow investments into networks, spectrum, towers and technology and it was therefore important for the industry to be "sustainable"."This industry needs tonnes of money, it is a high capital-intensive industry...buying spectrum, putting out networks, fibre, radio, towers...this is a continuously investing industry," Mittal said.Unlike setting up of steel or power plants, or refineries, the telecom sector needs a continuous and recurring infusion of capital."You have to, every year, spend billions of dollars afresh to get new technology, more coverage, more capacity...so this industry needs to be sustainable. Government wants India to be Digital India, and people to be connected. I think we will have to leave it in their safe hands," he said.As it is, the telecom policy and new digital communications policy states that revenue maximisation is not the objective, he added.On the issue of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) and the recent difference of opinion that has cropped up between Telecom Department and the company on when the next tranche of payment is due, Mittal pointed out that Airtel had already paid Rs 18,000 crore, "significantly more than anyone else"."We have paid Rs 18,000 crore...whatever they decide...we have paid significantly more than anyone else...so we will see, when final decision comes," he said.Mittal said that 5G spectrum prices are "unaffordable" but, in the same breath added that India has ample time for its 5G road map."5G spectrum prices currently are unaffordable and India has the time. Nobody in world is far on 5G...even countries in Europe...the UK, the US...5G coverage is still very sparse. So we are okay, India is not behind," he said.Asked when he expects full-fledged 5G rollouts in India, Mittal said, "The point is, when you need it...connected cars, robotic surgeries, that is what it is needed for. So, do we really have that on fire, at the moment? I don't think so." To a question on whether 2G will continue to exist in India even with the advent of newer generation of technologies, Mittal said Airtel has already switched off entire 3G layer and will keep on moving 2G customers to 4G."As soon as we can, we will keep on moving our 2G customers to 4G, that process is going on. That's the process, it just keeps happening evolutionary, organically, just every month," Mittal added.On whether Chinese telecom equipment companies will be allowed to participate in 5G, Mittal said: "It is not question of being allowed or not being allowed. It is question of country's decision...whatever the country decides, will be accepted by everyone".

22-11-2020||New Delhi||Fee support, data cards and laptops: DU colleges step up efforts to help students following LSR suicide case||From having one-on-one interactions with students to ensure their mental wellness to providing fee support, internet data cards and laptops to those in need, Delhi University colleges are doing everything they can to help the students during the COVID-19 pandemic.The colleges have stepped up efforts after an LSR student died by suicide allegedly over financial constraints in continuing with her studies.According to Lady Sri Ram college Principal Suman Sharma, the college administration has announced a reduction in fee for a few courses, setting up a committee to provide laptops and allowed some second-year students to reside in hostels."Given the fact that students are not able to avail certain facilities of the college due to being off-campus, the college has removed such charges from the fees this year. This has led to a substantial reduction in the fee. In addition, it is possible to pay the fee in instalments," she said."Keeping in mind the exceptional circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, current second-year students upon fresh application and on the basis of need will be allowed to stay in the hostel after the commitments to incoming first years and the current third years, who already are in the hostel, have been met," he added.Miranda House Principal Bijaylaxmi Nanda said the college is working on facilitating internet data packs to students on whom the burden has increased due to classes moving online during the pandemic."We realised it during the first month of lockdown only that just online classes will not be enough and equal attention will have to be paid to mental wellness. We took some steps but we will increase our efforts now and focus on one-on-one interactions," Nanda said. "We are exploring options for offering financial support to students not just in terms of fee waiver but to provide internet data cards as well to help in online classes,” she added.The staff association of the St Stephen's college has also approached college principal, demanding setting up of a committee to reach out to students facing monetary issues."As we are all aware, the pandemic has caused great distress in society. There is an increased financial hardship and some of our students are facing genuine difficulties in accessing online classes and paying the fees," staff association president Nandita Narain said."Some of the faculty members have been receiving requests from students for help with both the payment of fees and also for obtaining devices to attend the online classes. We fear that there are many more students out there who have not yet reached out," she added.According to Simrit Kaur, the principal of Shri Ram College of Commerce, the college has been receiving requests for scholarships and laptops since the lockdown."There are a few students who had their own devices but there were a few who needed help with laptops, we have tried facilitating each student with the kind of help they needed. We are also providing round-the-clock counselling services to students so that if there is an issue it can be addressed timely," Kaur said. Aishwarya, a student of the Lady Sri Ram (LSR) College for Women and an IAS aspirant, was found hanging at her Shadnagar house in Telangana's Ranga Reddy district on November 2.In a suicide note purportedly written by her, the 19-year-old said she did not want to burden her parents with her educational expenses, police said.The second-year BSc Mathematics (Honours) student had returned to Telangana from Delhi in March after those staying in the hostel were asked to go home by the college authorities in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Delhi University colleges are closed since March in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and all teaching and learning activities have moved completely online since then.

22-11-2020||Guwahati||Marginal improvement in Tarun Gogoi’s health condition: Doctor||The health condition of former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi marginally improved on Sunday morning, and he is currently semi-conscious, Abhijit Sarma, the superintendent of Gauhati Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), said.The veteran Congress leader was admitted to GMCH on November 2 due to post-COVID complications.Sarma told reporters that doctors have repeated all clinical tests and his vital health parameters have shown improvement compared to that of Saturday.“He is semi-conscious now. We had said last night that 48 hours were very critical for him. Twenty four hours have passed and there is no deterioration in his health condition.That is the most important thing,” he stated.Gogoi’s pulse rate and blood pressure are under check, and his oxygen saturation level 95-97 per cent.“The only worry is the urine output, which is around 100-120 ml in 24 hours,” he said, adding that doctors will soon decide on the next step that was to be taken to improve his kidney functioning.The 84-year-old politician spontaneously opened his eyes and looked around in the morning, the GMCH superintendent said.“There was slight movement, which we call moto movement. This is a good sign. Technically speaking, although he is critical, he is stable haemodynamically,” he maintained.A big team of doctors from various departments are attending to Gogoi.“We are constantly in touch with doctors from AIIMS.They are satisfied with the treatment protocol and we will continue with that,” he stated.Asked if the doctors would attempt dialysis to deal with his urine output, Sarma said that would be the last option.“As he is on inotropic support, we have kept dialysis as the last resort,” he added.The veteran Congress politician’s health condition deteriorated on Saturday following multi-organ failure and he became unconscious with difficulty in breathing.Assam Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that Gogoi has been put on invasive ventilation.His son and Lok Sabha MP Gaurav Gogoi rushed to the hospital along with Assam Chief Secretary Jishnu Barua. A host of MPs, MLAs and other senior leaders of the Congress also reached GMCH late on Saturday to enquire about his health.On October 25, the three-time chief minister, who was undergoing treatment for COVID-19 and other post-recovery complications, was discharged from GMCH after two months.Gogoi had tested positive for COVID-19 on August 25.His health condition was being monitored by a nine- member committee of doctors, led by the head of pulmonary medicine Dr Jogesh Sarma.The panel was constituted by the state government when he tested positive for COVID-19 in August.After his discharge from hospital last month, the veteran Congress politician continued to remain under observation of the doctors’ team at his residence here.In the days before he tested positive for COVID-19, Gogoi was at the forefront of the Congress initiative to form a ‘Grand Alliance’ comprising all the opposition parties for the 2021 assembly polls.

But at 1 pm, Chomsky and Prashad received an email informing them about the cancellation of the virtual event.The duo asked the organisers if the move was a result of censorship.In his statement today, Dharkar said, on the morning of the session, they came across correspondence in the public domain, between Chomsky, Prashad and a group of activists, which clearly mentioned that this session would also be used to make a statement regarding "how they feel about corporations such as the Tatas, and the Tatas in particular, including airing the views of these activists, which was never the intended purpose of the session".The Tata group, one of India's leading multinational conglomerates, is the main sponsor of Tata Literature Live festival."I do not wish to comment on their reasons for accepting an invitation to participate in an event and using the platform to air adverse views about the main sponsor."What I do want to state as strongly as possible is that the festival which I founded and run with a dedicated team, owes its success to a free expression of ideas, not a free expression of someone's specific agenda. The expression of such an agenda - whether against a specific organisation, a corporation or an individual - is therefore misplaced in the discussions at our festival," Dharkar said.Dharkar said cancellation of the session is a considered decision he has taken in his capacity as festival director."Much as I deeply respect and admire the work of Prof. Noam Chomsky, this decision was necessary to protect the integrity of the festival," he added.The founder-festival director said the success of the festival is due to the literary talent it has been able to consistently attract from all five continents."Another important reason is the wide range of ideas the festival has featured from writers across the political, economic and social spectrum... The diversity of thought and subjects featured every year is another reason for the festival's success," Dharkar noted.In a statement issued on People's Dispatch, Chomsky and Prashad on Saturday said the panel was to talk about the broad issues that threaten the planet, but then also talk about the specific role of countries such as India and corporations such as the Tatas.The issues about the Citizenship Amendment Act, Adivasi (tribal) killing, the industrialisation of indigenous lands and environmental degradation were also to be discussed during the session, it said."We wanted to talk about how governments such as those led by the Bharatiya Janata Party and corporations such as the Tatas are hastening humanity towards a deeper and deeper crisis," the statement said."We wanted to appear at this platform in the spirit of open discussion to hold our dialogue about extinction and internationalism, about the darkest part of our human story and the brightest sparks of hope that shine in our world," it said.

22-11-2020||New Delhi/Riyadh||Coordinated efforts by largest economies will lead to faster recovery from Covid-19: PM at G20||Terming the COVID-19 pandemic an important turning point in history of humanity and the biggest challenge the world is facing since World War II, Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G20 summit on Saturday called for a new global index based on talent, technology, transparency and trusteeship towards the planet in the post-corona world.Modi also said that “Work from Anywhere” is a new normal in the post-COVID world and suggested creation of a virtual G20 secretariat as a follow up and documentation repository.Saudi Arabia’s King Salman opened the Group of 20 Summit as the coronavirus pandemic overshadowed this year’s gathering of heads of state that is being held in the virtual format. India is scheduled to host the G20 summit in 2022.“Had a very fruitful discussion with G20 leaders. Coordinated efforts by the largest economies of the world will surely lead to faster recovery from this pandemic. Thanked Saudi Arabia for hosting the Virtual Summit,” Prime Minister Modi tweeted.At the G20 Summit, Modi said that he put forward a need to develop a new global index based on talent, technology, transparency and trusteeship towards the planet.Multi-skilling and re-skilling to build a talent pool will enhance dignity and resilience of workers, he said, adding that the value of new technologies should be measured by their benefit to humanity.“Transparency in our processes helps in inspiring our societies to fight crisis collectively and with confidence. Spirit of trusteeship towards planet Earth will inspire us for a healthy and holistic lifestyle,” he said in a series of tweets.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), in a statement on Modi’s participation in the G20, said the prime minister termed the COVID-19 pandemic as an important turning point in history of humanity and the biggest challenge the world is facing since World War II.He called for a decisive action by the G20, not limited to economic recovery, jobs and trade, but focussing on preserving planet Earth, noting that “all of us are trustees of humanity’s future”.The prime minister called for a new Global Index for the post-corona world that comprises four key elements – creation of a vast talent pool, ensuring that technology reaches all segments of the society, transparency in systems of governance, and dealing with Mother Earth with a spirit of trusteeship, according to the MEA.Based on this, the G20 can lay the foundation of a new world, he said.At the G20 summit, the prime minister called for greater transparency in governance systems which he said “will inspire our citizens to deal with shared challenges and enhance their confidence”.Modi also offered India’s IT prowess to further develop digital facilities for efficient functioning of the G20.The prime minister underscored that in the past few decades, while there has been an emphasis on capital and finance, the time has come to focus on multi-skilling and re-skilling to create a vast human talent pool.This would not only enhance dignity of citizens but would make citizens more resilient to face crises, Modi said.He also said that any assessment of new technology should be based on its impact on ease of living and quality of life.The summit saw participation of respective heads of state or government of 19 member countries, European Union, other invited countries and international organisations.Prime Minister Modi congratulated Saudi Arabia and its leadership for its successful presidency of the G20 this year and for organising the second G20 Summit in 2020 through a virtual format despite the challenges and obstacles posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.The summit under the Saudi presidency centred on the theme ‘Realizing Opportunities of 21st Century for All’.The agenda of the summit is spread out over two days with two sessions focused on overcoming the pandemic, economic recovery and restoring jobs, and building an inclusive, sustainable and resilient future.

A five-point de-escalation programme was also released, but it has not been followed, other than the September 21 agreement of not adding more troops.The Indian Army is circumspect as the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) backtracked on agreements to disengage along the LAC in June.Also, there are fresh areas of confrontation, like the 70-km stretch along the southern part of Pangong Tso where India now dominates the heights overlooking the Moldo garrison of the PLA. China wants India to move back, but New Delhi wants an iron cast assurance that Beijing would not occupy these heights.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-standoff-india-china-military-talks-deadlocked-173881

22-11-2020||Aditi Tandon||Private hospitals fleeced patients: House panel||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 21All Indians must be vaccinated against Covid-19 and the government must create a mechanism in advance to check black marketing and hoarding of the vaccine as soon as it becomes available, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health has warned the government as the vaccine race intensifies.In a comprehensive review of the national Covid-19 response, the committee said a sustainable pricing model to treat Covid patients could have averted many deaths. It lamented that “instances of patients being turned away from overburdened hospitals due to lack of vacant beds became the new normal during the pandemic.”Says need a Strategy against bio weapons“Amidst the uncertainty in Covid treatment protocol, India’s out-of-pocket expenditure of 62.4 per cent may have further driven many families below the poverty line. The number of government hospital beds was inadequate to handle the increasing rush of Covid and general patients,” said the panel, noting that the situation led to private hospitals heftily overcharging patients. In the report titled “The Outbreak of Pandemic Covid-19 and its Management”, the panel has said the Centre must address the “abysmally low” public spending on health and raise it from the current nearly 1 per cent of the GDP to 2.5 per cent in two years. The spending on health research should be increased to at least 1.72 per cent of the GDP, which was the global average, it said.“The Unesco Institute of Statistics data shows that the US spends almost 2.84 per cent of its GDP on health research and China spends 2.19 per cent. India spent 0.67 per cent in 2017 and 0.65 per cent in 2018,” rued the committee.In a significant comment, the committee has noted with concern the biological weapon potential of the Covid-causing Sars-Cov2 virus at a time when the world is debating its origins (manmade versus natural) and the WHO is reviewing the International Health Regulations.“The committee agrees with the Department of Health Research that a holistic approach is needed for ensuring bio-security against biological weapons. The ministry should engage with agencies and actively participate in ongoing international treaties. We strongly recommend the ministry to conduct more research and work towards training and capacity building for management of public health emergencies arising out of bio-weapons,” said the panel.On vaccine research the committee has called for the “highest level of ethical and procedural standards” and said “the ministry must follow a transparent approach so that any irregularity in the approval and production of vaccine was avoided; subsidise vaccine cost for weaker sections, rural areas and urban slums and be cautious about black-marketing and shortage of vaccines.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/private-hospitals-fleeced-patients-house-panel-173895

The daily positivity rate yesterday was 4.34 per cent. Higher volumes of testing eventually led to a low positivity rate,” said the Health Ministry.The WHO advice to countries is 140 tests per day per million people until national positivity rates fall below 5 pc. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cumulative-positivity-rate-falls-173899
