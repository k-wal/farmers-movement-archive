Chinese companies had earlier completed the Hambantota port in the south-east. This has helped China establish lookouts on both flanks of Sri Lanka overlooking the Indian Ocean.Things are likely to change after the US sanctioned 24 Chinese companies, which means US companies cannot do business with them. Sources said some of the Chinese companies are in tie-ups with US firms as subcontractors and equipment suppliers in the Colombo Port City project and it seems unlikely that they will get a special waiver.If this first economic strike by an executive fiat becomes law, sources expect the legislation to be more well-rounded since there is bipartisan political consensus in the US on containing China. This means a future law could even bar third country companies from partnering with Chinese companies. This possibility is high after reports quoted US officials as saying that the sanctioned mother company CCCC is the “Huawei of Construction.” This would further cripple Chinese construction activity in other countries unless their leaders decide to defy the US, they added.Sri Lanka’s involvement with Chinese companies had begun under Mahinda Rajapaksa as President. Rajapaksa is back and more politically powerful after his brother comprehensively won the Presidential elections and he helmed the sweep of the Parliamentary polls.Though Rajapaksa has ensured that diplomatic civility has guided India-Sri Lanka ties, he has made no move to accommodate Indian interests by opening a port on the northern coast or allocating oil blocks in the common waters separating the two nations.Sources said if the US sanctions gather pace, not just Colombo Port City but other infrastructure projects in Myanmar and Thailand, that cause South Block unease, may seize-up and could be up for grabs. In this respect, they referred to moves by Japan which has set up a mega fund for projects in Asia Pacific and the US that has created a new overseas infrastructure funding organisation which could fill the breach.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-sanctions-could-put-chinas-sri-lanka-project-in-trouble-132747

28-08-2020||New Delhi||Sushant Singh Rajput case: Press Council asks media not to carry out its own ‘parallel trial’||Taking strong objection to the coverage of the Sushant Singh Rajput case by many media outlets, the Press Council of India said on Friday the media should adhere to the norms of journalistic conduct in covering cases under investigation and is advised not to carry out its own “parallel trial”.The media should not narrate the story in a manner so as to induce the general public to believe in the complicity of the person indicted, the Press Council of India (PCI) said in its advisory.The Council said it has noted with “distress that coverage of the alleged suicide by a film actor by many media outlets is in violation of the norms of journalistic conduct” and, therefore, advises the media to adhere to the norms framed by it.Asserting that publishing information based on gossip about the line of investigation by official agencies on the crime committed is not desirable, the PCI said it is not advisable to vigorously report crime related issues on a “day to day basis and comment on the evidence without ascertaining the factual matrix”.Such reporting brings undue pressure in the course of fair investigation and trial, it said.“The media is advised to refrain from giving excessive publicity to the victim, witnesses, suspects and accused as it will amount to invasion of their privacy rights,” the PCI said.Identification of the witnesses by the media needs to be avoided as it endangers them to come under pressure from the accused or associates as well as investigating agencies, it said.The PCI asserted that the media is advised not to “conduct its own parallel trial or foretell the decision to avoid pressure during investigation and trial”.The reporting of the alleged suicide by the actor by some of newspapers is also in violation of the norms formulated by the Council for reporting on suicide, it said.The norm prohibits publishing stories about suicide prominently and advises the media not to unduly repeat such stories, the PCI said.The media is expected not to use language which sensationalises or normalises suicides or presents it as a constructive solution to the problems, it said.The PCI asked the media not to use sensational headlines or use photographs, video-footage or social media links while reporting on suicide cases. Actress Rhea Chakraborty has been accused of abetting the suicide of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.The Supreme Court had last week upheld the transfer of an FIR, lodged by Rajput’s father in Patna against Rhea Chakraborty and others for allegedly abetting his son’ssuicide and misappropriating his money, to the CBI.The 34-year-old actor was found hanging on June 14 in his flat in suburban Bandra.

28-08-2020||---||Reject both central proposals on GST: Chidambaram to states||New Delhi, August 28States must reject both options the Centre has given on pending GST compensation issue and demand in one voice that Centre must find the resources and provide the money to the states, Congress veteran P Chidambaram said on Friday.The former Finance Minister said the latest assault on the states is part of an elaborate design of the government to financially cripple the states and reduce them to beg for money from the Centre.“In either option, the Central Government is passing the buck of financial burden to the states. Under the law, the obligation to compensate the states falls solely on the Central Government.The two options given by the Modi Government to the states to bridge the GST compensation gap is a gross violation of the law and an abdication of the responsibility of the Central Government,” Chidambaram said.The option most states are considering is for the Centre to help them borrow and then repayment to be made later after 2022 through cess collections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reject-both-central-proposals-on-gst-chidambaram-to-states-132742
28-08-2020||New Delhi||SC refuses to impose pre-broadcast ban on telecast of Sudarshan TV programme||The Supreme Court Friday refused to impose pre-broadcast ban on Sudarshan TV from telecasting ‘Bindas Bol’ programme, whose latest promo claimed that the channel was all set to broadcast a “big expose on conspiracy to infiltrate Muslims in government service”.A Bench comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and KM Joseph said it has to first circumspect in imposing a prior restraint on publication or the airing of views.       “At this stage, we have desisted from imposing a pre-broadcast interlocutory injunction on the basis of an unverified transcript of a 49 seconds clip. The Court has to be circumspect in imposing a prior restraint on publication or the airing of views,” the Bench said. “We note that under statutory provisions, competent authorities are vested with powers to ensure compliance with law, including provisions of the criminal law intended to ensure social harmony and the peaceful coexistence of all communities,” the Bench said.The apex court issued notice to Centre, Press Council of India, News Broadcasters Association and Sudarshan News on a plea filed by an advocate Firoz Iqbal Khan with a grievance pertaining to a programme scheduled for broadcast today at 8 pm.“Having regard to the importance of the issues which arise from the petition under Article 32, we direct that notice be issued to the respondents, returnable on September 15,  2020.  “On the next date of listing, the court will consider appointing amicus curiae to assist it towards a resolution which advances the protection of constitutional rights,” the bench said.The apex court said that prima facie, the petition raises significant issues bearing on the protection of constitutional rights. “Consistent with the fundamental right to free speech and expression, the Court will need to foster a considered a debate on the setting up of standards of self-regulation,” the apex court said.Together with free speech, there are other constitutional values that need to be balanced and preserved including the fundamental right to equality and fair treatment for every segment of citizens, the top court said.The petitioner has relied on the transcript of a clip of 49 seconds, which, according to petitioner’s counsel, was aired on the television channel in the course of the last week.  The contention of the petitioner is that the clip contains statements which are derogatory of the entry of Muslims in the civil services.The counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner submitted that the airing of views in the course of the programme would violate the Programme Code enumerated under the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act 1995, together with the Code of Ethics and News Broadcasting Standards Regulations.During the course of the hearing, it has been highlighted that the expression of views derogatory to a particular community has a divisive potential. In the viral clip, channel’s Editor-in-Chief Suresh Chavhanke had alleged a conspiracy in the “overwhelming” number of Muslim students clearing the Union Public Service Commission exams and was scheduled to broadcast big expose on “conspiracy to infiltrate Muslims in government service”. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-impose-pre-broadcast-ban-on-telecast-of-sudarshan-tv-programme-132741

28-08-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Opposition states may approach Supreme Court on GST shortfall||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 28Opposition states are coordinating moves to approach the Supreme Court under Article 131 of the Constitution to avoid the chaos that could be created by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s offer to individually allow them to borrow the shortfall in GST dues from the RBI, said sources here.The sources said at least nine states are in consensus with the move, but some among them feel they should first exhaust the political option of approaching the President and the Prime Minister.  Although Sitharaman had done her sums while announcing that out of the shortfall of Rs 2,35,000 crore, only Rs 97,000 crore was due to the states and the rest was lost due to “hand of God”, the sources said some states feel that this issue should be best contested in the political domain while the question of borrowing could be explored legally.Moreover, Delhi, which is among the dissenters, cannot come on board on the issue because it is not allowed to borrow from other sources. The preference of the AAP Government will be to participate in any petitioning before the country’s highest offices, they said.Sources spoke in detail on the technical issues that will crop up if the states were to borrow from the RBI which would be compensated later by the Centre. Besides the seven states – Punjab, Chattisgarh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Puducherry – who figured in the webinar with Congress President Sonia Gandhi on the eve of Thursday’s GST Council meeting, Kerala and Odisha may also be inclined to join hands to approach the Supreme Court, they added.Besides understanding the fine-print of the Centre’s offer to make up for the shortfall, the states are also gearing up to send their replies on Sitharaman’s two options.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-states-may-approach-supreme-court-on-gst-shortfall-132730

Almost every district of the state has reported a death from among the personnel of the uniformed force. A bulk of the cases is from Hyderabad. There are 13 units in the state with over a hundred cases each, including the unit in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) area.According to details in the report, out of 1,967 police personnel who tested positive in Hyderabad, 891 are still active and remaining 1,053 have been discharged. Hyderabad has lost 23 personnel, which is the highest among all the units. The data was released an after Additional Superintendent of Police for Jagtial district in Telangana, Dakshinamurthy K, died of a cardiac arrest after being tested positive for coronavirus last week.The senior officials felt the need to evaluate the extent of damage done by COVID-19 in the uniformed forces that have been instrumental in putting the standard operating procedures relating to the pandemic in place. Telangana and Andhra Pradesh (AP) have seen a spurt on the incidence of COVID-19 cases with AP reporting over 10,000 cases daily.

Japan, under Abe, was among the first countries to back India during the Doklam incident.As an elderly politician, Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso could be a stop-gap arrangement till the next elections when Shinjiro Koizumi from the young brigade and Fumio Kishida, Taro Kono and Yoshihide Suga among the seniors will stake claim.All of them have a consensus on parking Japan’s huge surplus in Indian mega projects and in mirroring the US moves to forge closer security and defence ties, said sources.Giving an example of the unanimity on deployment of Japanese capital, the sources said it was PM Junichiro Koizumi, the father of current Cabinet Minister Shinjiro, who pushed for the Bullet Train project. Finally, it was Abe who clinched it after 15 years.There was a time when Indian resisted the Bullet Train project. Japanese political class unanimously agreed to finance the dedicated freight corridor projects instead. Then PM and current contender Taro Aso had approved the massive funding for the project, even if it led to the Japanese temporarily shelving their plan to fund the Bullet Train project.Other possible successors such as Fumio Kishida and Yoshihide Suga have worked too closely with Abe’s foreign policy approach for the last eight years to effect a substantial shift.In defence as well, there has been erosion of resistance within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to changing the pacifist Constitution. As a result, Abe ensured that his successors will continue to strengthen defences and boost military spending. But with India, ties in this sphere have not gone beyond warm words, joint naval exercises and diplomatic consultations on South China Sea at the Quad level.Abe’s successor is unlikely to deviate from this path and will be willing to sign a logistic sharing arrangement with India to push it forward, said sources while pointing out that the resignation took interlocutors by surprise as they were aiming at an Abe-Modi summit via videoconferencing on September 10.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-shinzo-abes-exit-unlikely-to-change-india-japan-equations-132723

It had fixed for Friday, but again more time was sought by the defence counsels.The CBI has already filed a 400-page written argument.They include former deputy prime minister L K Advani, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh, BJP leaders M M Joshi, Uma Bharti, Vinay Katiar, Sadhvi Rithambara and Sakshi Maharaj, besides Ram Teerth Kshetra Trust secretary Champat Rai.The trial is at the verge of conclusion and is at the stage of arguments. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has submitted its arguments to which the defense counsels have to rebut by filing their own written arguments. Once the arguments stage is over, the court would deliver its judgment.The Babri Masjid in Ayodhya was demolished on December 6, 1992, by 'kar sevaks' who claimed that an ancient Ram temple stood at the same site.

Till date, 30 of the 54 countries have ratified the agreement.“Making Africa resilient for Indian business should be followed up by making Indian business resilient for Africa,” Chhabra said while addressing a FICCI webinar attended by members of the Indian and African Diplomatic Corps. Stating that India is a natural fit to engage in business in a challenging environment and diversity in Africa, Chhabra said 10 guiding principles outlined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his visit to Uganda in 2018 remained a priority.In the past few years, India’s focus on Africa led to an unprecedented 34 high-level visits, including those by the President, Vice President and the Prime Minister.The Secretary also said India welcomed all countries in the continent to join the satellite pan-Africa e-VidyaBharti and e-Aarogya projects. For instance, he said, 14,000 students enrolled in educational scheme in Ghana within weeks of  e-VidyaBharti starting.Chhabra further said India had opened nine of the 18 new missions it planned to have in Africa and suggested to the business community to reach out to the Embassy/High Commission with specific issues.During a review meeting with the African Union, it was noted that India implemented over $ 6.4 billion under the Lines of Credit committed/ongoing out of the overall $ 10 billion made at the 3rd India-Africa Forum Summit in 2015.Having already held three India-Africa Forum Summits, the fourth this year was postponed to 2021 following the outbreak of the global health pandemic.  The bilateral trade with Africa has been growing at a steady pace. From a modest US $ 5 billion in 2001 it stood at $ 69 billion recently, recording a 12 per cent year-on-year growth.Among the major challenges faced by India is the  level of engagement by China with Africa. According to data on China-Africa Research Initiative, in 2018, the China-Africa bilateral trade stood at $ 185 billion while Chinese investment was $ 5.4 billion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-can-benefit-from-african-continental-trade-pact-mea-132717

28-08-2020||Thiruvananthapuram||‘Guest artiste’, ‘always jumping gun’- Shashi Tharoor in firing line of Congress colleagues in Kerala||The antipathy towards Shashi Tharoor in the Congress' Kerala unit is not new and dates back to 2009 when he was suddenly selected to contest the Lok Sabha polls from Thiruvananthapuram. But recently, the tirade against the diplomat-turned-politician has sharply increased.This comes in the wake of his support to handing over of Thiruvananthapuram airport to the Adani Group even as his party has vehemently opposed the decision. The opposition to him has also intensified as he was one of the 23 signatories to a letter calling for reforms in the Congress.The latest to slam Tharoor was fellow MP Kodikunnil Suresh, who on Friday termed him "a guest artiste"."Tharoor is not a politician. He is yet to understand on how to carry on party and parliamentary politics by being within the framework of Congress guidelines. He is one who often jumps the gun. Tharoor came into the Congress as a guest artiste and continues to be the same," Suresh told the media mere.Yet another MP K Muraleedharan made a veiled attack on him. "Tharoor is a global personality, while I am a simple person and hence I am not commenting on him," was Muraleedharan's jibe.State Congress president Muallapally Ramachandran has time and again expressed his displeasure in the way Tharoor conducts himself and has said he has to express himself in the party forums only. He also noted that since Covid broke out, Tharoor has been based in Delhi.On Friday, Ramachandran told the media that as far as he is concerned, the Tharoor issue is a closed chapter for him.“As a disciplined party worker, I will not make any statement,” he said, adding that he does not wish to complicate any issue as it would affect the party.But batting for Tharoor was senior Congress legislator PT Thomas who said just because he wrote a letter, it should not be taken against him, and called him a “jewel”.“The stand of the Congress party in Kerala on issues will be said by the state president. Tharoor is a jewel for the Congress party," he said.Tharoor is now in his third term as the member from the prestigious Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha seat.Way back in 2009, when a dozen leaders from the state capital in Delhi trying to get the party nomination, Tharoor who was not at all in the reckoning, shocked all by being made the candidate. A senior Congress leader had then said: "We were all waiting for a few days to meet the high command and suddenly came this man (Tharoor), who flew down from the US, met the high command and got the seat."

28-08-2020||New Delhi/Mumbai||Sushant death: ED summons Goa businessman; NCB gathers details||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned a Goa-based businessman in connection with its money laundering probe linked to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, officials said on Friday.They said Gaurav Arya, who runs a hotel in the coastal state, has been asked to depose before the central probe agency at its office in the Ballard Estate area of Mumbai on August 31.The summons was stuck at his property in Goa as the agency was not able to get in touch with him, they said.Arya is being called after the ED came across some mobile phone messages reportedly sent by actor and Rajput's live-in partner Rhea Chakraborty to him in 2017 and they purportedly indicate discussion of certain banned narcotics, they said.In some news channel interviews, Arya had said that he has never dealt in narcotics and his last interaction with Rhea was about three years ago, adding he will "comply" with all legal probes and procedures.The agency will also summon some other people with whom Rhea, 28, had similarly interacted in connection with alleged procurement of certain drugs and banned narcotics apart from talking about some other professional deals.The agency is looking at the money laundering angle in this case and hence all such conversations and entities are required to be questioned to establish facts and to find out if any criminality is involved, a senior official said.It had questioned Rajput's talent manager Jaya Saha recently after her name allegedly figured in one of such chats regarding a chemical called CBD (cannabidiol).She has denied any wrongdoing during the questioning and is understood to have told the agency that prescribed amounts of CBD can be used to treat anxiety.The ED has also intimated the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) about these purported drugs-linked chats and the anti-narcotics agency is now probing these leads.Rhea, the main accused in the case, her father Indrajit Chakraborty, brother Showik and multiple staff members of her and Rajput have been grilled by the ED till now.On Thursday in Mumbai, the ED opened some bank lockers in the presence of Indrajit Chakraborty after it had issued prohibitory orders against their operation.Meanwhile, the NCB, the third federal investigative agency probing the linked instances surrounding the death of the 34-year-old actor, is scanning through the details shared by the ED with it apart from collecting some other information linked to Rajput and his close associates.A three-member team of the NCB had reached Mumbai from Delhi on Thursday and it held a meeting with the ED team that is investigating the case.It is expected that the NCB will soon summon various people who feature in the "WhatsApp conversations" that were obtained by the ED from two mobile phones of Rhea after forensic cloning.Rhea is expected to be called for the NCB grilling later, they said.The ED's case filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) stems from an FIR filed by Rajput's father on July 25 with the Bihar Police in Patna against Rhea, her father, mother Sandhya Chakraborty, brother Showik, Rajput's manager Samuel Miranda and Shruti Modi and unknown persons, accusing them of cheating and abetting his son's suicide.Rajput's father has also alleged financial irregularities in his complaint to the police.In the complaint, Singh alleged that an amount of Rs 15 crore was siphoned off from Rajput's bank account in one year to accounts of persons not known or connected to the late actor.                However, the ED has not found any direct transaction made from Rajput's account to that of Rhea except an instance where it intercepted a mobile phone message where Rhea allegedly talks about obtaining details of a debit card used by the late actor from his house manager Samuel Miranda.  Some cash deals in this case are also under the scanner of the agency.Rhea has maintained that she "never consumed" any banned narcotics and that she will cooperate with all the probe agencies as a law-abiding citizen.

28-08-2020||---||COVID-19 not a ground to postpone Bihar polls: Supreme Court||New Delhi, August 28The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a PIL seeking to defer the Bihar Assembly polls due to COVID-19, saying the pandemic can’t be a ground for postponing elections.“How can we ask the Election Commission of India (ECI) to not hold elections? COVID cannot be a valid ground for postponement of elections,” a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan told petitioner Avinash Thakur.The Election Commission would consider everything, it said, terming the petition “premature” as notification for the Assembly polls was yet to be issued.Thakur had sought a direction to the Chief Election Commissioner to postpone the polls due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the ground that the Representation of the People Act provides for the deferment of polls in extraordinary situations.As the petitioner’s counsel said the Representation of People Act provides for the deferment of polls due to an extraordinary situation, the Bench reminded him that it was for the poll panel to decide and that the court can’t direct it not to conduct elections.He tried to impress upon the Bench by arguing that human life was paramount at a time when lawmakers and common people alike were suffering due to the pandemic.But the Bench dismissed the petition, expressing its inability to order deferment of polls even before the EC has considered the issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-not-a-ground-to-postpone-bihar-polls-supreme-court-132700

28-08-2020||Satya Prakash||SC sends notice to Centre on PIL seeking state-wise determination of minorities||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 28The Supreme Court on Friday issued a notice to the Centre on a petition challenging the validity of the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutes Act (NCMEI), 2004.A Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul asked the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Law and Justice; and the Ministry of Minority Affairs to respond to the PIL filed by Delhi BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay.The petitioner has sought a state-wise determination of minority status on the basis of population for the purpose of administering educational institutions.Upadhyay wanted the top court to direct the Centre to frame guidelines for identifying minorities at the state-level.On behalf of Upadhyay, senior advocate Vikas Singh said Hindus were in minority in 10 states but had not been declared so.The petitioner specifically challenged the validity of Section 2(f) of the National Commission for Minority Education Institution Act, 2004, on the ground that it gave unbridled power to the Centre to declare any group as a minority without there being proper guidelines.Section 2((f) of the NCMEI Act says, “minority”, for the purpose of this Act, means a community notified as such by the Central Government.The term ‘minority’ has also not been defined under the Constitution or under the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992.According to a 2011 census, Hindus are in minority in eight states — Lakshadweep (2.5 per cent), Mizoram (2.75 per cent), Nagaland (8.75 per cent), Meghalaya (11.53 per cent), Jammu and Kashmir (28.44 per cent), Arunachal Pradesh (29 per cent), Manipur (31.39 per cent) and Punjab (38.40 per cent).The top court had on November 10, 2017, declined to entertain a plea filed by Upadhyay seeking minority status for Hindus in seven states and one Union Territory and asked him to approach the National Commission for Minorities (NCM). Later, the NCM had said it was not for it to define the term ‘minority’.Upadhyay contended that despite being a minority in these states, Hindus were not in a position to avail of the benefits meant for them, and the communities which formed a majority in these states were still taking benefits meant for minorities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-sends-notice-to-centre-on-pil-seeking-state-wise-determination-of-minorities-132676
28-08-2020||New Delhi||Recoveries exceed active Covid cases by more than 18 lakh; case fatality drops to 1.82 per cent||The effectiveness of the Centre's 'test, track and treat' approach is reflected in the progress on the COVID-19 recovery front and the reduction in fatality rate, the government said on Friday, highlighting that recoveries exceed active cases by over 18 lakh as on date.The Union health ministry pointed out that in the past five months, more than three-fourth of COVID-19 cases had recovered and less than one-fourth are active now."Effective treatment of positive cases has resulted in a progressively dipping COVID case fatality rate, which is pegged at 1.82 per cent as on date," the ministry said.The number of recoveries is nearly 3.5 times the active cases of coronavirus infection currently, it said.With more patients recovering and being discharged from home isolation and hospitals, India's COVID-19 recoveries are nearing 26 lakh.With a total of 60,177 patients having recuperated in a span of 24 hours, the recoveries have surged to 25,83,948 and the recovery rate has reached 76.28 per cent."Higher number of recoveries has led to a constantly growing difference between recoveries and active cases. Crossing 18 lakh, the difference stands at 18,41,925 today," the ministry said.The Union government has adopted a graded and evolving strategic response to COVID management in India within the larger evolving global context.The early focus on surveillance and contact-tracing through house-to-house survey was continuously strengthened with increase in testing for ensuring early identification of positive cases.This has ensured prompt isolation of the confirmed positive cases either in supervised home care for the mild and moderate ones or in hospitals in case of those exhibiting critical symptoms, the ministry said.The Centre has led the country-wide response and management with steady ramping up of hospital infrastructure through the three-tiered dedicated COVID facilities — Dedicated COVID Hospitals (DCHs) with ICU bed, ventilators etc, for critical care management; Dedicated COVID Health Centres (DCHCs) with oxygen beds and doctor on call facility and COVID Care Centres (CCCs) with isolation beds.As on date, the country has 1,723 DCHs, 3,883 DCHCs and 11,689 CCCs with a total of 15,89,105 isolation beds, 2,17,128 oxygen-supported beds and 57,380 ICU beds.A record single-day spike of 77,266 infections in a day pushed India's COVID-19 tally to 33,87,500 on Friday, while the death-toll climbed to 61,529 with 1,057 people succumbing to the disease in a span of 24 hours, the data updated at 8 am showed.

According to estimates, the Indian armed forces are projected to spend around $130 billion in capital procurement in the next five years. The government now wants to reduce dependence on imported military platforms and decided to support domestic defence manufacturing.The Defence Ministry has set a goal of a turnover of USD 25 billion (Rs 1.75 lakh crore) in defence manufacturing in the next five years that included an export target of USD 5 billion (Rs 35,000 crore) worth of military hardware.

28-08-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC declines bail to activist Sudha Bharadwaj in Elgar case||The Bombay High Court on Friday refused to grant bail to lawyer and activist Sudha Bharadwaj, an accused in the Elgar Parishad-Koregaon Bhima case being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).A bench led by Justice RD Dhanuka rejected an appeal filed by Bharadwaj in June this year, whereby she had challenged a special court’s order that denied her bail on health grounds.Bharadwaj, 58, had approached the HC seeking bail, saying that she suffered from chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.She had said these comorbidities put her at a higher risk of contracting coronavirus while at the Byculla women’s prison where an inmate had tested positive for COVID-19 earlier.The court, however, noted the submissions made by the NIA and the Maharashtra government that the prison authorities were taking all precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and that they were providing necessary medical care to Bharadwaj for her comorbidities.The NIA counsel, Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, also told the court that if at any time Bharadwaj’s condition needed further treatment or if she was required to be admitted to a hospital, even a private one, the state would provide for the same.He pointed out that poet-activist Varavara Rao, a co-accused in the case, had been admitted to the state-run JJ Hospital and then shifted to the private Nanavati Hospital in the city for treatment of COVID-19 and other ailments.“In our view, no case is made out for grant of bail. This appeal is devoid of merits,” the HC said while dismissing Bharadwaj’s plea.On August 21, pursuant to an HC order, the state government had submitted a report stating that Bharadwaj had been examined in the prison by a medical officer and that her health condition was found to be “stable and satisfactory”.The state report stated that Bharadwaj’s vital health parameters were stable. It stated that she had been suffering from mild depression too, and had complained of body ache.The state said that Bharadwaj had been given medication for dizziness and had been advised to continue medicines for her chronic conditions.Bharadwaj’s counsel Ragini Ahuja, however, pointed out that the report of August 21 did not mention that Bharadwaj suffered from hypertension or from a heart condition.She pointed out that previous report of the state had said that Bharadwaj suffered from ischemia, a heart condition.Ahuja claimed the latest medical report, therefore, was inconsistent and perhaps “bogus”.The bench, however, said the present report probably only dealt with Bharadwaj’s vital parameters vis-a-vis COVID- 19.It said: “In our view, there is no substance in the appellant’s submissions on inconsistencies in the medical report.”Bharadwaj has been lodged in the Byculla women's prison here since September 2018 following her arrest in the case.The case pertains to the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune district on December 31, 2017. It is alleged that speeches made by some activists at the conclave led to violence near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial on outskirts of Pune city the next day.

The jets are yet to be formally inducted into the IAF.Sources said the Defence Minister, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat and the entire top military brass of the country will attend the event at the Ambala airbase.In a telephonic conversation with Singh on June 2, Parly had conveyed her readiness to visit India to further explore ways to enhance bilateral defence ties.India had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 for procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of around Rs 58,000 crore.The Rafale jet is capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA's Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile and Scalp cruise missile will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.Meteor is a next-generation beyond visual range air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) designed to revolutionise air-to-air combat. The weapon has been developed by MBDA to combat common threats facing the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Sweden.Of the 36 Rafale jets, 30 will be fighter jets and six will be trainers. The trainer jets will be twin-seater and they will have almost all the features of the fighter jets.While the first squadron of the Rafale jets will be stationed at the Ambala airbase, the second one will be based at the Hasimara base in West Bengal.

Life has to move ahead. A precious year of students cannot be wasted,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra had said, adding that students' careers “cannot be put under jeopardy for long”.As per the public notices issued by National Testing Agency (NTA) -- which conducts the tests, JEE (Main) April 2020 is scheduled to be held from September 1 to 6, while NEET-UG 2020 exam is scheduled for September 13.The order paved the way for conducting these much-awaited examinations next month.Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta had assured the Bench that due precautions and safeguards would be taken while conducting these examinations.A group of 11 students from 11 states had moved the top court seeking quashing of the July 3 notices issued by NTA for conducting JEE (Main) April 2020 and National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET)-Undergraduate examinations in September. They wanted the examinations to be rescheduled due to COVID.Referring to the pandemic, petitioners' advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava had urged the court to direct the authorities to conduct the tests after normalcy was restored.“Conducting the aforesaid examinations across India at such perilous time is nothing else but putting lives of lakhs of young students (including petitioners herein) at utmost risk and danger of disease and death. The best recourse at this stage can be to wait for some more time, let COVID-19 crisis subside and then only conduct these exams, in order to save lives of the students and their parents,” the plea had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cabinet-ministers-from-6-non-bjp-ruled-states-move-sc-want-jee-neet-postponed-132666

It spoils their reputation if they are innocent and gives them undue visibility if they are guilty,"Chakraborty reached the DRDO guest house in Mumbai on Friday morning for questioning by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).This is for the first time that Chakraborty (28) is being questioned by the CBI in the Sushant death case.The Supreme Court last week upheld the transfer to the CBI an FIR, lodged by Rajput's father in Patna against Chakraborty and others, for allegedly abetting his son's suicide and misappropriating his money.The 34-year-old actor was found hanging on June 14 in his flat in suburban Bandra.

He joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 1942 and died the same year at the age of 32.The bronze statue of Kotnis, known in China as Ke Dihua, would be formally unveiled at the medical school at Shijiazhuang in September, state-run Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday.Kotnis’ medical assistance during the difficult days of the Chinese revolution was praised by Chinese leader Mao Zedong. His status and memorials were also set in some of the Chinese cities in recognition of his services.He was married to Chinese national Guo Qinglan, who died in 2012.Apart from the school named after him as the Shijiazhuang Ke Dihua Medical Science Secondary Specialised School, there are memorials of Kotnis in both Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province, and Tangxian county where he once worked.Late Chinese leader Mao Zedong was deeply affected by his death, the report said.Mao wrote in his eulogy: “The army has lost a helping hand and the nation has lost a friend. Let us always bear in mind his internationalist spirit.”According to Liu Wenzhu, an official of the Shijiazhuang Ke Dihua Medical Science Secondary Specialised School, since the founding of the school in 1992 more than 45,000 medical professionals have graduated from it.Each of the new students and staff must swear in front of a stone statue of Kotnis that they would work like him, he said.Liu hopes that Kotnis will be remembered not only as a symbol for inspiring medical students to work hard but also an eternal bond between the people of China and India.“We are the world’s two most populous countries ... We should always be friends, coexisting peacefully,” he told Xinhua. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-to-unveil-bronze-statue-of-dr-dwarkanath-kotnis-132662
28-08-2020||New Delhi||Mount Everest summit success rates doubled over last 30 years, study finds||The success rate of summiting Mount Everest, the world's tallest peak, has doubled in the last three decades, while the death rate for climbers has hovered unchanged at around 1 per cent since 1990, according to a study.Researchers at the University of Washington and the University of California, Davis, in the US also found that the number of climbers on Mount Everest has greatly increased, crowding the narrow route through the dangerous "death zone" near the summit.The findings, published on Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE, analysed the success and death rates for all first-time climbers who had a permit to summit Everest during the period of 2006 to 2019.The study shows that the summit success rates from the 1990 to 2019 have essentially doubled; two-thirds of climbers now reach the summit, verses one-third previously.The researchers found that the overall death rate of around one per cent hasn't changed.They also found that a contemporary 60-year-old climber has the same success rate—about 40 per cent -- as a 40-year-old climber in the prior period, suggesting "60 is the new 40" when it comes to summiting the Everest.A contemporary 60-year-old climber has about the same death rate—about 2 per cent as a 48.5-year-old in the earlier period, according to the researchers.They also found that more women are attempting the climb in recent years (14.6 per cent) versus the previous period (9.1 per cent), with women and men having very similar odds of success or death in both periods.The doubling of the summit success rate is likely due to a number of factors.Weather forecasting has dramatically improved since the "Into Thin Air" storm of 1996, giving climbers more information on the best window to push for the summit, according to the researchers.Some climbers are using elevated flow rates of supplemental oxygen—and doing so lower on the mountain, they said.The most popular routes have fixed lines, meaning climbers can clip into ropes tethered to the mountain for their ascent and descent, making it safer if they fall, the researchers noted.Increased experience of expedition leaders and high-altitude porters may also have helped boost success rates, according to the researchers.Interestingly, while more climbers are making it to the top in recent years, today's climbers are actually less experienced in climbing tall peaks in Nepal than climbers who attempted Everest in the 1990s and early 2000s, they said.Mount Everest draws over 500 climbers each spring to attempt the summit during a small window of favourable conditions on the rugged Himalayan mountain that tops out at just over 29,000 feet.The study identified patterns in the characteristics of mountaineers—such as age, sex and prior experience—that might influence their likelihood of summiting or dying during the spring climbing season."Mount Everest is still a very dangerous mountain, and climbing it will never become a walk in the park, because it's way above the limits of what most people can do," said study lead author Raymond Huey, a professor at the University of Washington."Unfortunately, reported statistics of risk on Everest are often inaccurate," Huey said.By analysing climbing data, the researchers said they have provided accurate information on the chances of success and on the chances of dying, thereby helping climbers make an informed decision about whether to attempt this great peak.These patterns also can help Nepal and China in deciding whether to institute restrictions on climbers such as maximum age or experience level, Huey added.Previously, the team applied the same statistical methods to climbers during the period of 1990 to 2005 and, as a result, they were able to compare success and death rates between the two periods.During 1990 to 2005, more than 2,200 first-time climbers attempted to summit Everest, according to the researchers.During 2006 to 2019, that number increased to more than 3,600 climbers, they said.The researchers focused on climbers with paid permits, excluding climbers with additional tasks—such as high-altitude porters, photographers and support staff—along with those who attempted to summit in other seasons, or who were attempting the summit for the second time or more.They also excluded a handful of years from the analyses when extreme events such as ice fall avalanches or earthquakes led to cancellations of the climbing season.The team also looked at the effects of crowding near the summit for the past two climbing seasons.Detecting possible effects of crowding is difficult with available information, the researchers said, but their analysis didn't show any impacts of crowding on success or death rates.However, crowding must slow climbers, increasing their exposure in the death zone, they added.

28-08-2020||New Delhi||SC says COVID can’t be ground for postponing Bihar polls||Stating that COVID-19 cannot be a ground for postponing elections, the Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a PIL seeking to defer the Bihar assembly polls till the state is free of the novel coronavirus.The Election Commission of India would consider everything, a bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said.The bench, also comprising Justices RS Reddy and MR Shah, said it was a premature petition as no notification for the assembly polls has been issued till now.The petitioner, Avinash Thakur, had sought a direction to the Chief Election Commissioner to postpone the polls due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the ground that the Representation of the People Act provides for the deferment of polls in extraordinary situations.“How can we ask the Election Commission of India (ECI) to not hold elections? COVID cannot be a valid ground for postponement of elections,” the bench stated.The petitioner’s counsel said the RP Act provides for the deferment of polls due to an extraordinary situation.To this the bench said it was for the ECI to decide and the court cannot direct the poll panel to not hold elections.The petitioner’s counsel also argued that elections were not paramount but human life was, and even MLAs and common people were suffering due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The bench said it cannot pass orders for the deferment of polls and the ECI would take into account every situation.It said no writ can be applied like this and dismissed the PIL.

The 28-year-old actress lashed out at those making allegations against her without any evidence.  On August 19, after the Supreme Court allowed the CBI to take control of the Sushant Singh Rajput death case, Bihar Police Chief Gupteshwar Pandey, while speaking to the media, said: "Rhea Chakraborty ki koi aukat nahi ki woh Bihar ke Chief Minister se sawaal karein." In an interview with NDTV and India Today, Rhea without naming the police officer clarified that as someone who loved Sushant, she can question anyone, even Bihar CM. "Just because I was his girlfriend and less successful, makes me a gold-digger? 'Bengali girls do black magic', 'uski aukat kya hain (what's her stature)', always the girlfriend and bahus (daughters-in-law) are blamed. I thought we have moved past this. Me being a Bengali is a cherry on the cake - that all Bengali women do black magic," said Chakraborty. "My aukat is that Sushant Singh Rajput, who everyone claims to love, loved me," Rhea told NDTV in a live interview.Sushant was found dead in his Mumbai apartment on June 14. More than a month later, his father KK Singh filed a case in Bihar, accusing Chakraborty and her family of cheating him financially and mentally harassing him, driving him to suicide."I don't seem to understand why I am at the centre of this case. Maybe because of the witch hunt mentality, because the family has made these allegations. Never thought the world could be so sick. Never knew people cannot see through the false stuff. Made my life a soap opera and everyone is judge and jury," said Chakraborty.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/my-aukat%C2%A0is-that-sushant-singh-rajput-loved-me-says-rhea-chakraborty-to-bihar-dgp-pandey-132652
28-08-2020||New Delhi||Govt permits meals on flights; airlines can put flyers on no-fly list for refusing to wear mask||The government has permitted the airlines to serve pre-packed snacks, meals and beverages on domestic flights and hot meals on international flights, according to an official order.Moreover, any passenger who refuses to wear a face mask in a flight could be put on the no-fly list by the airline, said a senior official of the aviation regulator DGCA.Due to the coronavirus pandemic, in-flight meal service was not permitted on domestic flights since their resumption on May 25. On international flights, only pre-packed cold meals and snacks were being served depending on the flight duration since May this year.In an order issued on Thursday, the Civil Aviation Ministry said: “Airlines may serve pre-packed snacks or meals or pre-packed beverages on domestic flights depending on the duration of the flight. Airlines and charter flight operators can serve hot meals and limited beverages on international flights as per the standard practices,” it added.The ministry said only single-use disposable trays, plates and cutlery should be used while serving food or beverages in domestic and international flights.“Crew shall wear a fresh set of gloves for every meal/beverage service,” it noted.The Ministry also permitted the aircraft operators to let passengers use the in-flight entertainment system on international as well as domestic flights wherever available.“Disposable earphones or cleaned and disinfected headphones will be provided to passengers at the start of the journey,” it noted.Meanwhile, a senior official of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said: “A passenger who refuses to wear a face mask can be put on the no-fly list by the airline. No new order has been passed in this regard as the airline and its cabin crew are sufficiently empowered under the existing DGCA rules to take action.”As per the DGCA rules, an airline can choose to put an unruly passenger on its no-fly list after internal deliberations. Subsequently, other airlines may follow suit in putting that passenger on their no-fly lists.Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, special international flights have been operating under the ‘Vande Bharat Mission’ and bilateral air bubble arrangements that have been signed with various countries.Domestic flights resumed in India on May 25 after a gap of two months in view of the pandemic. However, airlines are allowed to operate 45 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights.

28-08-2020||Satya Prakash||Students can't be promoted without holding final-year exams: SC||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 28Students can't be promoted without holding final-year examinations by September 30 as fixed by the University Grants Commission (UGC), the Supreme Court ruled on Friday.However, a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said if a state felt it could not conduct examinations by September 30, it must approach the UGC for new dates to hold the examinations.For any exemptions from the UGC guidelines, states will have to seek permission from the Commission, said the Bench which had earlier refused to stay the UGC's July 6 circular on the issue.Holding that a State Disaster Management Authority can postpone final-year examinations under the National Disaster Management Act (NDMA), the Bench said fresh dates had to be worked out in consultation with the UGC.Apart from some students, Yuva Sena, the youth wing of the Shiv Sena, and governments of Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha and Delhi had questioned the UGC’s July 6 circular asking universities to conduct final-year examinations by September 30. These states maintained that students could be promoted without examination in view of the extraordinary situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.On behalf of the UGC, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had argued that universities could seek extension of the deadline but they could not take a decision to confer degrees without holding examinations. The UGC, which regulates higher education in India, had refused to relent on the September 30 deadline for conducting final-year examinations of universities and colleges, saying the decision was taken “after due deliberation by taking into account and balancing all relevant factors”.The July 6 guidelines were based on recommendations of experts, it had said, adding that it was wrong to claim that it would not be possible to conduct the final-year examinations in terms of the guidelines, the UGC had said.It had said the decisions of some states to cancel examinations directly affected standards of higher education and was an encroachment on the legislative field of coordinating and determining the standards of higher education exclusively reserved for Parliament under Schedule VII of the Constitution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/students-cant-be-promoted-without-holding-final-year-exams-sc-132649

He was reportedly taken to the CBI office in Bandra Kurla Complex, the official said, adding that he was brought back around 7.30 pm.The CBI team, which is in the city for the last eight days to investigate the Sushant death case, had on Thursday recorded the statement of Rhea’s brother Showik Chakraborty.The CBI has so far questioned Pithani, Rajput’s cook Neeraj Singh and domestic help Deepesh Sawant, among others, as part of its probe in the high-profile case.The agency has also recorded statements of Rajput’s chartered accountant Sandip Sridhar and accountant Rajat Mewati.Earlier, before the CBI took over the probe, the Mumbai police had recorded Rhea Chakraborty’s statement in connection with Rajput’s suicide.The Supreme Court last week upheld the transfer of an FIR, lodged by Rajput’s father in Patna against Rhea Chakraborty and others for allegedly abetting his son’s suicide and misappropriating his money, to the CBI.The 34-year-old actor was found hanging on June 14 in his flat in suburban Bandra.

28-08-2020||Vijay Mohan||HC directs govt to consider granting disability benefits to defence officer trainees on par with civilian officers||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 28In a significant development which may lead to removal of a long-pending anomaly for disabled officer trainees of the defence services and their widows, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has directed the central government to resolve the matter. In a petition filed by the widow of a deceased gentleman cadet who was boarded out of the Indian Military Academy for a disability suffered during training which was declared “attributable to military service”, it was pointed out that while most civilian employees who are disabled during training or service cannot be discharged from service due to a disability, there was no such protection for military personnel under the Persons with Disabilities Act. Further, those civilian trainees and officer-trainees of organisations such as the Central Armed Police Forces who are discharged on account of disabilities, are paid proper disability pension and their widows are paid family pension on demise, whereas officer-trainees of the defence services are paid a much lower monthly ‘ex gratia’ rather than disability pension. The petition also states that even below officer rank recruits of the defence services are paid proper disability pension while officer-trainees of the defence services are paid a much lower amount. Providing the figures, the petition avers that while civilian officer-trainees and military jawan-trainees are paid Rs 36,465 and Rs 18,000 per month as disability pension respectively, military officer-trainees are paid only Rs 12,240.It was also pointed out that while widows of disabled civil officer-trainees and military jawan trainees are paid Rs 16,830 and Rs 9,000 respectively as family pension on their demise, there is no policy to pay any amount at all to widows of disabled military-trainees.The High Court has directed the Ministry of Defence, the Chief of the Army Staff and the Adjutant General to consider all points raised in the petition within two months.The Bench also expressed hope that “unnecessary litigation” on the issue would be avoided.Sources point out that though this anomaly affects a very low number of trainees invalided out of military academies, the discrimination remains very stark and the then Defence Minister, Late Manohar Parrikar, wanted to rectify the policy.  A Committee of Experts under Parrikar in 2015 had come down heavily upon the staff of the ministry and had remarked that “the non-resolution displays utter insensitivity and obstinacy of the establishment and shows how graciousness and large-heartedness is lacking in all of us”. The matter, however, continues to hang fire. After Parrikar moved out of the defence ministry, the same objections that had been set aside by him were reiterated on file by ministry staff, sources said.A disabled bedridden officer-trainee remarked that the orders of the High Court had brought hope to him that perhaps the top civil and army officers would now be able to rein in the staff and get the anomaly rectified soon on the strength of judicial orders.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-directs-govt-to-consider-granting-disability-benefits-to-defence-officer-trainees-on-par-with-civilian-officers-132646

I was at the COVID care centre when I received a call that an elderly patient's oxygen saturation level has gone down."After consultation with senior doctors, it was decided to shift him to a bigger hospital," said Nikam.He said the centre has its own ambulance van but its driver had fallen sick just a few hours ago and he was under medication and on saline at the facility."It was not appropriate to ask him to drive the van in that condition. So we called '108' emergency ambulance service but the call did not get connected."We also made calls to another driver but he was also not reachable," Nikam told PTI.The doctor said since patient's condition was worsening, he decided to drive the ambulance himself."I along with one more doctor (Rajpurohit) got into the ambulance van and drove out of the care centre. We went to a couple of hospitals but could not get an ICU bed for the patient."Finally, a bed was available at a private hospital where the patient was admitted," he added.Nikam, a BHMS doctor who has his own clinic in the Parvati area, said the condition of the patient was now stable."We have a forum called Metro Medical Foundation through which I along with some other doctors provide service at the COVID care centre in Marketyard," he said.The elderly patient's son, who was also admitted to the care centre, was all praise for Nikam and Rajpurohit whom he termed as true "COVID warriors".He said the two doctors did not waste time in attending to his father and taking him to hospital in the ambulance."Dr Nikam and Dr Rajpurohit, who was accompanying him, not only drove the ambulance, but also took efforts to find a bed for my father. They finally admitted him to one of the hospitals and saved his life," he said.He said his father is now stable.

As a Sufi she believed in non-violence and religious harmony. Yet when her adopted country needed her, she unhesitatingly gave her life in the fight against Fascism,” said Basu, who formally unveiled the commemorative plaque in a small ceremony to be broadcast on social media, given the coronavirus social distancing requirements.“It is fitting that Noor Inayat Khan is the first woman of Indian-origin to be remembered with a Blue Plaque. As people walk by, Noor's story will continue to inspire future generations. In today's world, her vision of unity and freedom is more important than ever,” added Basu, who is also founder-chair of the Noor Inayat Khan Memorial Trust (NIKMT), which installed a sculpture of Noor in nearby Gordon Square in 2012.The SOE was an independent British Secret Service set up by Britain's war-time Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1940 and Noor became its first female radio operator sent into Nazi-occupied France. She was posthumously awarded the George Cross (GC) for her bravery in 1949.Anna Eavis, Curatorial Director at English Heritage, said: “We're so pleased to be able to continue unveiling our 2020 blue plaques with this virtual ceremony after a very quiet few months."I am particularly delighted to start with Noor Inayat Khan, whose courage was unfaltering even in the face of such extreme danger.”   The new plaque reads: “Noor Inayat Khan GC, 1914-1944, SOE Agent codename ‘Madeleine' stayed here”.Mahatma Gandhi and BR Ambedkar are among some of the other Indian-origin historical figures to be honoured with similar Blue Plaques at buildings associated with their stay in London.Noor joins the likes of Ada Lovelace, the pioneer of computing, and Rosalind Franklin, the scientist who helped discover DNA, to make up only 14 per cent of over 950 such Blue Plaques celebrating women across London.English Heritage said that while the figure is still unacceptably low, its ongoing “Plaques for Women” campaign has seen a dramatic rise in the number of public nominations for women since it launched in 2016.Later this year, the charity plans to unveil plaques to Christine Granville, a remarkable secret agent of the Second World War, and Barbara Hepworth, one of the 20th century's greatest artists.“Nominations are the lifeblood of the London blue plaques scheme and if we are to continue to see a significant increase in the number of blue plaques for women, we need more female suggestions,” the charity said.

The Congress needs to target the BJP with surgical strikes instead of wasting its energy on targeting its own,” Sibal said today after the Lakhimpur Kheri district unit of the Uttar Pradesh Congress passed a resolution seeking action against the leaders who dissented.The letter mentioned Jitin’s history of “betrayal of Gandhis” and how his father Jitendra Prasada contested the Congress president’s election against Sonia in 1999 and lost.Jitin, the Brahmin face of the Congress in UP, is also a special CWC invitee and was at the receiving end at the committee meeting on Monday, which saw leaders attack letter writers who are also CWC members (Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mukul Wasnik and Anand Sharma).Former minister and Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari cryptically tagged Sibal’s post to say “prescient” as if foretelling the future of the ginger group that spoke publicly for inner party reform.UP Congress chief Ajay Lallu, meanwhile, said the resolution by a district unit was not official but was certainly an expression of “sentiments of the people”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kapil-sibal-says-prasada-being-targeted-in-up-over-letter-132364

The Supreme Court on Thursday said it would examine the issue after senior advocate CS Vaidyanathan, representing liquor baron Vijay Mallya’s United Breweries (Holding) Ltd (UBHL), said the company’s total assets were far greater than its liabilities.The UBHL has challenged the Karnataka High Court’s order upholding the decision of a single judge to wind up the company. Vaidyanathan told a Bench headed by Justice UU Lalit that the court should not uphold winding up of the company as it had far more assets than its liabilities.The Bench also reserved its verdict on a petition of Mallya, who has sought review of its 2017 order holding him guilty of contempt of court for transferring USD 40 million to his children.Vaidyanathan said the HC erred in not accepting its offer of settlement and gave its finding of upholding the decision to wind up the company.Declines to hear exam pleaThe SC refused to entertain a petition seeking to postpone the Foreign Medical Graduates Examination (FMGE), a licensure examination held for students who have done MBBS course from foreign countries, slated for August 31.Refuses to take up petition on CoronilThe SC declined to entertain a petition challenging a Madras HC order staying a single judge's order that had restrained Patanjali Ayurveda from using the trademark ‘Coronil’. “If we prevent the use of the word Coronil during the pandemic on the ground that there is some pesticide on its name, it will be terrible for the first product,” a Bench led by JI SA Bobde said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-reserves-verdict-on-review-plea-by-mallya-132365

"The Centre may convene another GST Council meeting once the states have decided their options and the RBI agrees to the Centre’s proposal," Sitharaman said.As a result of a tanking economy due to the "hand of God" which may led to a contraction, the compensation gap this year was expected to be Rs 2.35 lakh crore, she said.But according to the Centre's calculations, Rs 1,38,000 crore is due to losses because of the pandemic.Therefore, the Centre has estimated the shortfall in compensation due to Covid at Rs 97,000 crore under the first option. States going for this window can borrow 0.5 per cent of their state GDP sans the conditionalities prescribed earlier."Under the second option, the entire gap of this year can be met by the borrowing of states, and arrangements could be made with the RBI," said Sitharaman, but implied reforms in power tariff etc. Shecomplimented the participants at the GST Council for displaying statesmanship by focusing on the issue at hand.Don’t thrust solutions"I appeal to the Centre not to thrust solutions on us. We are a sovereign state, not a banana republic."— Manpreet Badal, Finance Minister, PunjabCouncil not consensual"Sad state of affairs.

The issue will be decided by a seven-judge Constitution Bench after a five-judge Constitution Bench on Thursday delivered a verdict contrary to an earlier one by a Bench of the same strength.The five-judge Constitution Bench, headed by Justice Arun Mishra, ruled that provision can be made for reservation for the sub-castes within Scheduled Castes, saying, “The entire basket of fruits cannot be given to mighty at the cost of others under the guise of forming a homogeneous class.”“There are un-equals within the list of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and socially and educationally backward classes. Various reports indicate that Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes do not constitute a homogenous group. The aspiration of equal treatment of the lowest strata, to whom the fruits of the reservation have not effectively reached, remains a dream. At the same time, various castes by and large remain where they were, and they remain un-equals. Are they destined to carry their backwardness till eternity?” the Bench asked.“The constitutional goal of social transformation cannot be achieved without taking into account changing social realities,” it said.It disagreed with an earlier Constitution Bench judgment delivered in 2004, which had ruled against giving preferential treatment to sub-castes within Scheduled Castes.“Once the state has the power to give reservations, it can also make sub-classification to extend benefit to those sub-castes not receiving the benefit," the top court said in its latest verdict.The verdict came in a case arising out of an appeal filed by Punjab Government challenging a 2010 verdict of the Punjab and Haryana High Court striking down Section 4(5) of the Punjab Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes (Reservation in Services) Act, 2006.The provision provided for ‘first preference’ to the Balmikis and Mazbhi Sikhs for SC quota in public employment.Help for needy||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/seven-judge-bench-to-revisit-2004-verdict-on-sc-sub-caste-quota-132374

Exactly a week back, the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s readout on Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) had asked both sides to “jointly uphold the big picture of bilateral relations”, which was also stated by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on August 17.Answering questions on China at the weekly media briefing, Srivastava especially referred to a recent interview of External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar where he spoke of various past border incidents and noted that what was common was that “all border situations were resolved through diplomacy”.The MEA spokesperson’s accent on talks to resolve border irritations comes a few days after Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat had said India had “military options” to deal with Chinese aggression in eastern Ladakh if talks at military and diplomatic levels continue to be stalemated.The MEA also pointed out that Jaishankar had said that a solution “must be predicated on honouring all agreements and understandings” and attempt must not be made to “alter the status quo unilaterally”.The last meeting of the WMCC held on August 20 had seen New Delhi forcefully putting across the formulations expressed by Jaishankar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mea-indirectly-rules-out-military-option-132379

He advised them to smell vulnerabilities early to avoid frauds.The comments come in the midst of the steadily slowing credit off-take, leading many to wonder if banks have become too “risk-averse” owing to their concerns over asset quality in a pandemic-stricken economy.As per the RBI’s annual report released earlier this week, frauds doubled to Rs 1.85 lakh crore in FY20.Das warned banks that extreme risk aversion would deprive them of their income and create a situation where they would be unable to earn their bread.He appreciated the government’s response to the Covid-19 crisis as being fiscally “very prudent and very calibrated”. He said the government was “responsible” in announcing the measures right from the start which focused on the poor and vulnerable.He also welcomed the government’s strategy of consolidating public sector banks, saying lenders with large balance sheets would be helpful. He, however, said that while size was essential, efficiency was “more important”. “There is no risk aversion but prudent banking.

28-08-2020||---||Self-reliance in defence sector to boost our global standing: Prime Minister||New Delhi, August 27Weeks after the announcement of “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (self-reliant India), Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said it was not inward-looking, but designed to strengthen a global order in which India would have a central role in ensuring stability in its immediate neighbourhood.PM Modi gave this message at webinar “Atmanirbhar Bharat – Defence Industry Outreach” organised jointly by industry body FICCI and the Department of Military Affairs headed by General Bipin Rawat.The PM addressed concerns of the foreign industry, which has been edgy about rules being changed.Speaking in Hindi, PM Modi said, “Atmanirbhar Bharat is for all — the MSME, Indian industry and foreign partner as well. It is a commitment of the government and a win-win for all.” India, he said, was committed to emerging as an export hub.The government has taken several reform measures like bankruptcy code, ease of business etc. “India is changing its focus from licence production to joint production,” the PM added.Meanwhile, earlier answering questions from the industry, Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar made an important announcement, saying the request for proposal (RFP) would be out shortly. “It is under legal vetting and will be released to the industry partner,” he added.Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL), a shipyard under the MoD, and private company L&T have been selected as Indian partners.The two will tie up with a foreign manufacturer under the strategic partnership model.The Defence Secretary also spoke about the naval utility helicopter project. “It is being processed and is at the initial stage,” he added.At the event, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Rawat said, “Nothing will give the armed forces greater satisfaction than fighting and coming out victorious in war with indigenous technology and equipment.”In an address at a seminar on promoting self-reliance in defence, Gen Rawat also said India’s armed forces are committed to hand-hold the domestic industry in developing next generation military platforms and equipment.Delving into complex security scenario, he said as India grows in stature, the security challenges are bound to increase “exponentially”.He said the armed forces did not have any bias towards imported equipment. “India today is transiting through a period which is chequered with numerous challenges and threats. Our collective response to Covid-19 has firmly established our ability to overcome any such unforeseeable eventuality,” he said.
