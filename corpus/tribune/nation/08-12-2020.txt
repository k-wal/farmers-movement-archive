08-12-2020||New York||Nirmala Sitharaman, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw in Forbes 2020 list of 100 most powerful women||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, US Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, Biocon Founder Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw and HCL Enterprise CEO Roshni Nadar Malhotra have been named among the world’s 100 most powerful women by Forbes, a list topped by German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the 10th year in a row.The women on the 17th annual Forbes Power List hail from 30 countries and were born across four generations.“There are 10 heads of state, 38 CEOs and five entertainers among them. But where they differ in age, nationality and job description, they are united in the ways they have been using their platforms to address the unique challenges of 2020,” Forbes said.Sitharaman is ranked 41st on the list, Nadar Malhotra comes in at the 55th spot, Mazumdar-Shaw—described as “India’s richest self-made woman”—is ranked 68th and chairwoman of Landmark Group Renuka Jagtiani is ranked 98th.Merkel ranks No. 1 for the tenth year in a row. “Merkel remains the de facto leader of Europe, leading the region’s largest economy after steering Germany through financial crisis and back to growth. Her leadership is marked by her steely reserve, from standing up to Donald Trump to allowing more than a million Syrian refugees into Germany,” Forbes said, adding: “the big question that the public is now asking is who and what will come after Merkel’s time in office comes to an end.”      Harris, who became the first woman, first Black American and first Asian American to be elected vice president—“an unprecedented trifecta of firsts for California Senator Harris”, is ranked third on the list.Harris’s “rapid ascension in US politics has also catapulted” her onto the Forbes list of the World’s 100 Most Powerful Women for the first time. European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde is ranked second for the second straight year.“From fighting the pandemic to re-engineering American politics, these influential women, including New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams, are making history,” Forbes said.Several of this year’s Power Women received “global plaudits” for their effective responses to COVID-19.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern (No. 32) vanquished a first and second wave of the virus in her country by implementing strict lockdown and quarantine procedures.Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen (No. 37) implemented a rigorous contact-tracing program in January, as a result, to date, the island of 23 million people has lost only seven lives to the virus, Forbes said.There are 17 newcomers on this year’s list, illustrating that women are “leading all aspects of a society transformed by a global pandemic”.New CEO of American multinational company United Parcel Service Carol Tomé (No. 11) and head of California-based Clorox Linda Rendle (No. 87) are responsible for helping provide essential services that have kept Americans connected and clean.CVS Health executive vice-president and incoming CEO Karen Lynch (No. 38) leads the pharmacy giant’s vast COVID-19 testing programme and, in 2021 will be responsible for its critical handling of coronavirus vaccines.The list also includes Co-Chair of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Melinda Gates (5), US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (7), Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg (22), Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina (39), UK’s Queen Elizabeth II (46), celebrated artistes Rihana (69) and Beyonce (72). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nirmala-sitharaman-kiran-mazumdar-shaw-in-forbes-2020-list-of-100-most-powerful-women-181587
08-12-2020||New Delhi||Honey adulteration: CSE rebuts Chinese company’s claim||The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Tuesday rebutted the Chinese company Wuhu Deli Foods’s statement which denied having knowledge that their transaction had to do anything with adulterating honey with sugar syrup.In a statement, China-based Wuhu Deli has categorically denied that it knew the said syrups being solicited by the CSE investigators were to bypass the tests to prove the authenticity of honey in India. Its statement also mentions that the company believed the transaction had only to do with syrup, and nothing to do with honey.The CSE, in a statement, rebutted the claim, and said it was a fact that Wuhu Deli sent it a shipment of samples that contained syrup with the intention of helping it to bypass the honey testing protocols in India.“It is a fact that Wuhu Deli sent us a shipment of samples that contained syrup with the intention of helping us to bypass the honey testing protocols in India. It is unfortunate that because CSE is not a food importer, it did not have requisite clearances to import food products and had to cancel the shipment from Wuhu Deli. If we manage to get possession of this shipment, we will be happy to get its contents tested,” the CSE said.Wuhu Deli was one of the companies that were contacted by investigators from CSE posing as a fictitious honey trading firm trying to find out if Chinese sugar and rice syrup could be brought into India and mixed with Indian honey, and whether this syrup-spiked honey would pass the Indian testing standards.The CSE said its investigators wrote to Wuhu Deli seeking syrups that could bypass the honey specifications as mandated by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSAAI).“We clearly wrote asking for syrups that could pass C3, C4 tests, including those for SMR, TMR, and foreign oligosaccharides,” says CSE.“These testing parameters that the CSE researchers mentioned in the email to Wuhu Deli are to specifically test the authenticity of honey in India — and not meant for that of sugar syrups or rice syrups (which Wuhu Deli alleges it thought it was dealing in). In fact, Wuhu Deli’s response to CSE’s request says — in clear terms — that its high fructose syrup could pass all these tests. Not just that, it also quoted prices for 10 container loads (200 tonnes) of this syrup that could bypass the above testing parameters for honey authenticity in India,” the CSE said in its statement.The environment watchdog further said it was common knowledge that the Chinese companies have expertise in syrups, which when adulterated in honey can pass the Indian testing parameters.“There are numerous sellers on online marketplaces like Alibaba who advertise this. Wuhu Deli is one such advertiser and has been rated by Alibaba as a ‘gold supplier’,” it said.

We have asked UTs to privatise discoms. Discoms must become far more competitive and provide cheap power,” he observed.He said the government had identified 10 champion sectors for production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme which will play a major role in making India a manufacturing hub, and give the country economies of scale.He also wanted a reduction in logistics costs by undertaking sustained and well planned urbanisation which would be the next big driver of growth.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/too-much-democracy-hindering-reforms-niti-aayog-ceo-181579

We have spoken to all Opposition leaders and decided our next course of action. The delegation has been limited to five because of the COVID-19 situation although we are trying to see if they allow more leaders to join. In that case we have to rush leaders to Delhi as they are mostly in their respective states,” said Yechury.CPI general secretary D Raja, too, confirmed that the delegation will meet Kovind on Wednesday.“Leaders from different political parties (those opposing the farm bills) will sit, discuss and take a collective stand on the contentious farm laws before meeting President Ram Nath Kovind,” Pawar told reporters.A sit-in meeting of the Opposition parties was ruled out as most of the leaders are not in Delhi.Opposition parties, including the Congress, have extended their support to the farmers’ agitation and demanded the repeal of the three laws.The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain.

08-12-2020||New Delhi||Only 4 states have appointed judicial, non-judicial members of Lokayukta: Report||Only four states—Bihar, Manipur, Odisha and Tamil Nadu—have appointed judicial and non-judicial members of anti-corruption ombudsman Lokayukta, according to a Transparency International India report.The report issued on the eve of International Anti-Corruption Day analyses the working of Lokayukta (state-level ombudsman) in the country, seven years after the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act 2013 came into being after a massive push from the India Against Corruption movement of 2011.“It has been around 50 years since Maharashtra appointed Lokayukta in 1971; 10 year of the famous Anna movement and seven years of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013. But in actuality, there is little progress in anti-corruption landscape of country,” a statement from Transparency International India, a civil society organisation, said.The Act mandates appointment of Lokpal at the Central level to inquire into allegations of corruption against important public functionaries, while Lokayukta is the state-level ombudsman.The report on the state of affairs at anti-graft panels across the country said that out of the 28 states and three union territories (UTs), the post of Lokayukta is vacant in eight states and UTs namely Assam, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand and Puducherry (In J and K institution dissolved).“Interestingly, the apex court and many High Courts while dealing with the issue of appointment of Lokayuktas or the anti-graft ombudsmen in several states failed to achieve any success,” it said.The posts of two judicial members of Lokpal (Central Ombudsman) are vacant, while 22 states and UTs have not appointed Up-Lokayukta (Member), it said.“There are only four states namely Bihar, Manipur, Odisha and Tamil Nadu which have judicial and non-judicial members of Lokayukta appointed,” it said.The report said out of the 28 states and three UTs, nine—Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Goa, Jharkhand, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh—have not amended their Lokayukta Acts to bring them in line with the Lokpal and Lokayukta Act of 2013.“Karnataka and Kerala Lokayukta Acts can be considered model state level laws, which can be followed by other states/UTs,” it said.As many as 10 states have no official websites or their websites cannot be accessed, the report said.“Lokpal (Email mode) and three states namely Odisha, Maharashtra and Mizoram have online complaint facility,” it said.

08-12-2020||New Delhi||3 COVID-19 vaccine candidates under active consideration of drug regulator: Health Ministry||Three COVID-19 vaccines candidates, developed by Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India and Pfizer, are under active consideration of India’s drug regulator and there is hope that early licensure is possible for all or any of them, the Union Health Ministry has said on Tuesday.Over the last four days, the Indian arm of US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, Pune-based Serum Institute of India and Hyderabad-based pharmaceutical firm Bharat Biotech have applied to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) seeking emergency use authorisation for their potential COVID-19 vaccines.At a press briefing, NITI Aayog member (Health) VK Paul said the COVID-19 situation in India had stabilised with active cases showing a “clear-cut declining trend” even though the pandemic situation in many other countries is becoming quite serious.The concern and anxiety that arose following an increase in daily cases of infection in Delhi had also settled now, he said.Asked what steps would be followed by the DCGI in the absence of a water-tight emergency use authorisation law for granting licence to vaccine makers, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said not all countries’ regulatory framework or rules and acts mentioned emergency use authorisation.“So, the fact that this phrase is not used in the national regulatory framework of any country does not mean that specific country does not have an enabling provision to accord an approval which is early and which is distinct from a regular market approval. India’s regulatory framework has a specific provision for grant of emergency use authorisation. Although this phrase is not used,” he said.The New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019, clearly specifies that under specific special situations, relaxation, abbreviation, omission, or deferment of data including local clinical trial data may be considered for approval.“This is our law. Similarly, other countries also have their legislations,” Bhushan said.Giving a bird’s-eye view of the Indian landscape of COVID-19 vaccines, Bhushan mentioned that eight vaccines were at different stages of development.One is Covishield, which is being manufactured by Serum Institute of India in collaboration with AstraZeneca. Phase two and three clinical trials of this vaccine is underway and the firm has applied form emergency use authorisation.Another is Covaxin, which is being indigenously developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and is presently in phase three of clinical trials. It has also applied to the DCGI seeking emergency use authorisation.The third one is ZyCOV-D, being developed by Cadila Healthcare Ltd in Ahmedabad in collaboration with central government’s Department of Biotechnology and is in phase two of the trials.The fourth vaccine candidate is Sputnik V, which is being manufactured by Dr Reddy’s Lab, Hyderabad, in collaboration with Russia’s Gamaleya National Centre, and according to their mutual agreement, the phase two trial in India is over and phase three will begin next week.The fifth one is NVX-CoV2373, which is being developed by Serum Institute of India in collaboration with Novavax, and its phase three clinical trial is under consideration with the drug regulator.The sixth vaccine candidate is Recombinant Protein Antigen based vaccine, to be manufactured by Biological E Limited, Hyderabad, in collaboration with MIT, USA. Its pre-clinical animal studies have concluded and phase one and two human clinical trials have started.Another one is HGCO 19 being manufactured by Genova in Pune in collaboration with HDT, USA. Its pre-clinical animal studies are over and phase one and two clinical trials is set to start.The eighth vaccine is being developed by Bharat Biotech International Ltd in collaboration with Thomas Jefferson University, USA and it is at the pre-clinical stages.“Another vaccine, which is in initial stages, is the one being developed by Aurbindo Pharma. So there are a total of nine vaccines out of which six are in clinical trials and three are in pre-clinical stage,” Bhushan said.“There are multiple vaccine candidates in different stages of development and some may get licensed in the next few weeks. But we cannot foretell at this moment because licensure or market authorization is the domain of the national regulator,” he added.Most of the vaccines are of two or three doses to be administered three to four weeks apart.Significant to note that even after vaccination, COVID precautions must be taken and this had been advised by WHO also, Bhushan said, adding: “Vaccination does not mean people become carefree.”About cold chain infrastructure augmentation, the health secretary said presently the system consists of 85,634 equipment for storage of vaccine at about 28,947 cold chain points across the country.“Data on frontline healthcare workers being is uploaded on Co-WIN software in preparation of COVID-19 vaccination. The current cold chain is capable of storing the first lot of three crore COVID-19 vaccines for healthcare, frontline workers,” he said.He told the press conference that while 2.38 lakh auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) provided vaccination under universal immunisation programme, only 1.54 lakh such health workers would be used for COVID-19 inoculation.“National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) has recommended that around one crore health workers should be given priority in the vaccination drive,” Bhushan added.

The disease was first reported from Eluru city but has now reportedly spread in Denduluru.The health authorities have already discharged 263 people from hospital after treatment. Some serious patients have been referred to hospitals in Vijayawada and Guntur.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/eluru-mystery-disease-may-be-caused-by-anti-mosquito-fogging-181564
08-12-2020||Shubhadeep Choudhury                                                                                  ||Jalpaiguri court orders second post-mortem of slain BJP worker||Tribune News Service Kolkata, December 8The CJM’s court at Jalpaiguri on Tuesday ordered a fresh post-mortem on Ulen Roy, the BJP worker who died during the “Uttarkanya Abhiyan” organised by the party at Siliguri on Monday.Allowing a petition filed by Santibala Roy, the widow, the court ordered conducting fresh post-mortem of the deceased in the presence of three doctors with comprehensive video recording. The court also ordered the West Bengal Police to submit a compliance report by the December 11, 2020.The death of Roy (50), whose body has been found to have marks that may have caused by cartridge fired from a shot gun, has triggered a big controversy with BJP and TMC blaming each other for the mishap.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said in a meeting at Raniganj on Tuesday that BJP had killed its own man to gain political mileage. “Ray was in possession of a shotgun at the rally”, senior TMC minister Subrata Mukherjee alleged at a press conference here on Tuesday.“A very extensive investigation has revealed that Roy died due to a shotgun injury. It is a well-known fact that the police force does not use shotguns. These guns were brought by members of the BJP to spread panic in the rally”, Mukherjee said and added that CID was probing the case.Mukherjee also claimed that police had used water cannons and teargas only to disperse the crowd.In response, Dilip Ghosh, Lok Sabha Member and West Bengal BJP president said that pellet wounds were found on Roy’ chest. Ghosh said Roy was charging toward a barricade when he was shot. Acknowledging that police did not carry shotgun, Ghosh said it was possible that some TMC goon, who was standing with the police wearing their uniform, had fired a shotgun at BJP activists.“If Roy was shot by one of us, the pellet wounds would have been found on his back”, Ghosh said and added that there were also some other BJP workers having injuries similar to Roy.An autopsy was conducted on Roy last night itself, but the BJP refused to accept the findings and got the slain worker’s widow to petition the court for a fresh autopsy by a team of doctors and video-recording of the examination.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jalpaiguri-court-orders-second-post-mortem-of-slain-bjp-worker-181563

08-12-2020||Kolkata||Mamata announces monthly allowance scheme to cover clergies of all religions||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday promised expanding the honorarium scheme for the clergy beyond the Hindu priests.Addressing what was for all practical purposes a political rally, but touted as an “administrative meeting”, at Raniganj in Paschim Bardhaman district, Mamata said priests of gurdwaras and churches as well as tribal priests would also be given monthly allowance and appealed to them to apply for their inclusion.The chief minister also announced that doubling of the honorarium amount from existing Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000 was in active consideration of the state government.After coming to power in 2011, Banerjee had announced honorarium for Imams and muezzins, a decision that was struck down by the Calcutta High Court. Monthly allowances of Imams and muezzins are now routed through the State Wakf Board.While muezzins get Rs 1,000 per month, Imams get a monthly allowance of Rs 2,500. The BJP, not one to miss on such an opportunity, has been accusing Banerjee of discriminating against Hindu priests whose monthly allowance is less than what an Imam gets.The BJP propaganda has evidently prompted Mamata to consider doubling the allowance of the priests. As of now 8,000 Hindu priests are getting the Rs 1,000 as monthly allowance in West Bengal.Mamata today also announced Rs 2.76 crore for the development of “Majhi Than”, “Johar Than” and “Manasa Than”, places of worshipping of the tribals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-announces-monthly-allowance-scheme-to-cover-clergies-of-all-religions-181558
08-12-2020||Aditi Tandon||COVID vaccine approvals in next few weeks, all who need vaccine will get one: Govt||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, Dec 8With nine vaccines in different stages of development in India and three under consideration of the national drug regulator for emergency approval, the Centre on Tuesday said some of the vaccines under review would get licence in the next few weeks and the vaccination drive would start thereafter “at the earliest.”Pfizer India, Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech vaccines are with the Central Drug Standards Control Organisation which will hold extensive safety review of available trial data before granting licences for use in India.“We hope a decision on the three vaccines would be taken expeditiously without compromising scientific rigour. Early licensure is possible in respect of all three vaccines or any one of them. We can’t say when exactly the approval will come but early decision is expected,” VK Paul, chairman of the National Expert Group on COVID Vaccine Administration, said today.The government said everyone who needs a vaccine will get a vaccine, but three categories will be inoculated first.These include one crore health workers, two crore frontline workers (personnel of police, armed forces, home guard, disaster management volunteers and municipal workers) and 27 crore people who are plus-50 and those under-50 with comorbid conditions.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said additional cold chain facilities over and above those needed for routine Immunisation were available to vaccinate three crore health and frontline workers and the rest of the capacity was being augmented.Without commenting on when the first dose of the vaccine would be given, the Central experts said “timelines will be clear once the licensure is granted by the national regulator.”The experts also clarified that COVID precautions would have to be taken even after vaccination as advised by the WHO.Asked what considerations the regulator would have while granting licensure, Bhushan said Indian laws provide for “relaxations, omissions, abbreviation, deferment of data including local clinical trials” in case of an emergency situation.He was answering questions on whether Pfizer vaccine could be considered for approval despite the company seeking waiver from trying the product on Indians.The government said states had begun setting up vaccine delivery mechanisms down to block level and meetings of state steering committees and district and block level task forces were under way with first rounds to be completed by December 15.India currently has 2.39 lakh trained vaccinators (ANMs) under the universal Immunisation programme and the government will draw 1.54 lakh from among them for COVID inoculation.“The idea is that routine Immunisation should not suffer. We will use our experience of elections and routine Immunization to vaccinate people and turn exercise can last over a year,” the Health Secretary said.He said the digital platform — easy to use mobile application COVIN — would be available to individuals for downloading and registering as a beneficiary and for the official system to track beneficiaries and vaccine delivery.“Those who register as beneficiaries will get an electronic certificate which they can store in a digital locker to be available to all COVIN users,” Said the secretary noting that the world’s largest Immunization programme would be concluded with people’s participation and the challenge would be to ward off the anti vaccine lobby and disinformation.“Good communication would be necessary and we will have to prepare people to accept some adverse events as happen with all vaccines including those we have been administering for decades under routine Immunization. The question is government should have mechanisms to deal with those events which we have under universal Immunization programme and will use for COVID,” Rajesh Bhushan said delineating government preparation for vaccine rollout.VK Paul urged people to have faith in Indian scientists and the regulator and trust them when they approve a vaccine as safe.Most vaccines will have two to three doses to be administered three to four weeks apart.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-vaccine-approvals-in-next-few-weeks-all-who-need-vaccine-will-get-one-govt-181557
08-12-2020||New Delhi||Amid slogans and speeches, farmers observe Bharat Bandh at Delhi’s Tikri border||Rousing speeches and slogans reverberated through the air at Tikri border, one of the protest sites against the Centre’s new farm laws, where farmers observed ‘Bharat Bandh’ on Tuesday.Chants of ‘Jai kisan’, ‘Humara bhaichara zindabad, Kisan ekta zindabad, tanashahi nahi chalegi’, could be heard loud and clear as over 2,000 farmers shouted in unison.    Flags of different farmers unions were planted sporadically across the venue. The national flag was raised in the centre from where the leaders delivered their speeches.Calling on his farmer brothers, a BKU leader said, “This is the last leg of our ‘andolan’ and it is important that we remain disciplined to make our protest successful.”As farmers sat on the ground listening to his speech, the leader added, “It is unfortunate that today in our country, if someone raises their voice and talks about the good of the country, they are termed anti-national (desh drohi)…”            Although the farmers had requested that shops remain closed in support of Bharat Bandh, almost all shops in the vicinity of the protest site were open. However, there wasn’t any incidence of violence.“I have kept my shop open so that the farmers can get whatever they need. I wholeheartedly support the farmers protest,” said Anil Kumar, who runs a departmental store in Baba Azad colony located adjacent to the protest site.With the farmers in the centre, the police have created a multi-layered barricading around them to prevent any possibility of the bandh turning chaotic.   “Although we don’t expect the protest to turn violent, we are prepared. We have deployed enough force,” a Delhi police official said.Tikri is one of the border points of Delhi where thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting against the three contentious farm laws in the past 13 days.The farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The Centre has repeatedly asserted that these mechanisms will remain. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-slogans-and-speeches-farmers-observe-bharat-bandh-at-delhis-tikri-border-181553

Shops in a few towns in Bundi, Baran and Jhalawar were closed to support the farmer unions’ call for a nationwide strike against the Centre’s agri laws, while others were open as usual.Roadways buses, trucks and mini buses were seen plying on the roads as well as auto-rickshaws and e-rickshaws.In Jaipur, the NSUI members holding a demonstration in support of protesting farmers clashed with the BJP Yuva Morcha workers outside the saffron party’s office.Workers of the National Students’ Union of India (NSUI), the student wing of the Congress, had assembled outside the BJP state headquarters to hold a demonstration, and members from both sides confronted each other and clashed.“We were holding a peaceful demonstration but the Yuva Morcha members hit some of our members,” NSUI spokesperson Ramesh Bhati charged.DCP Manoj Kumar said some protestors tried to forcefully enter the BJP office and were stopped by police. He said the situation was under control, and added that there was no stone-pelting incident.BJP state president Satish Poonia condemned the incident.“Congress’ support to the ‘Bharat Bandh’ is unfortunate. At the behest of the government, the goons of the Congress pelted stones at the BJP office today. The Chief Minister wants to create chaos. Today’s incident is condemnable,” he said in a video message.Transport Minister Pratap Singh Khachariyaws and his supporters visited markets in the state capital on tractors and other vehicles, and appealed to the shopkeepers to participate in the bandh called by farmers.The minister, who was seen driving a tractor, passed through several markets, including Sodala, MI road and in the walled city area.Another vehicle rally was taken out in Malviya Nagar and JLN Road to show solidarity with the protesting farmers. The members were holding placards that read “No Farmers, No Food”.Shops in several markets of Jaipur had opened in the morning but they were forced to shut later, locals alleged. Shopping malls and some restaurants were closed as well.In Kota, Congress workers, led by the local leader Ravinder Tyagi, marched in the main markets and appealed to business and trade organisations and shopkeepers to support the farmers’ protest.In Bikaner, most business establishments were open, barring the shops in the main markets at the district headquarters. Mandis were closed.Jodhpur division also witnessed partial impact of the strike.The bandh has been called against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020, all of which were passed by Parliament recently.The three farm laws enacted in September have been projected by the government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandis, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

China has also deployed an equal number of troops, according to officials.Meanwhile, China has cancelled plans to jointly launch commemorative stamps with India to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, the state media reported on Tuesday.China’s State Post Bureau has decided to cancel its plan to jointly launch commemorative stamps with India, state-run CGTN-TV reported, quoting a statement by the bureau without mentioning the date of the event.No reason was given for the decision, the report said.There was no reaction available from India’s Ministry of External Affairs.In November 2019, India and China finalised 70 celebratory activities in 2020 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries with a host of cultural, religious and trade promotion activities besides military exchanges.The joint release of commemorative stamps was one of the activities listed by both the countries.The celebrations were initially hit by the breakout of the coronavirus in December last year in the central Chinese city of Wuhan which later snowballed into a pandemic.

India imports around 18 per cent of its crude oil requirement from the country.Saudi Arabia is also a major source of LPG for India.Last month, the Army chief travelled to Nepal on a three-day visit that had significant diplomatic overtone.In October, Gen Naravane travelled to Myanmar along with Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on a very crucial visit during which India decided to supply an attack submarine to the Myanmar Navy besides agreeing to further deepen military and defence ties.

The farmer leaders included eight from Punjab and five from various nationwide organisations.“We will decide whether or not to go for the meeting tomorrow at 12 noon at Singhu border, said AIKS leader and CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Hannan Mollah after meeting Amit Shah.“The minister said they will give their proposals on amendments tomorrow...They are not ready for rolling back the laws,” Mollah added.“We told them we have been discussing the same thing for the past five meetings. They should have given proposals six months back. Maybe there would have been discussions then. Since they are not ready to retreat, it seems improbable that we will attend the meeting,” he said.Some farmer leaders said they first expected the meeting would take place at Shah’s residence here but the venue was shifted to National Agricultural Science Complex, Pusa.President of the Krantikari Kisan Union Darshan Pal said: “Shah again started talking about what we have been hearing and discussing all this while. He said they will send a fresh proposal. We will see the proposal and decide on the next meeting with the government. We had much hopes from this meeting given the stature of Amit Shah in the Narendra Modi government.”Apparently, Shah said the government was ready give written assurance on issues related to stubble burning, MSP, the APMC, stock limits and, Power Act.“There were indications on amendments but the government is not ready to roll back the laws. The issue will continue for long…we are getting more support for our cause,” Darshan Pal said. The meeting came on a day a ‘Bharat Bandh’ observed by farmers to press their demand affected life in some states.Farmers’ ‘Bharat Bandh’ to push for repeal of central farm laws disrupted life in several places with shops closed, transport affected and protesters squatting on roads and train tracks, though many states also remained largely unaffected.Interestingly, as the day wound to a mostly peaceful close and farmers termed their show of strength a success.Though leaders said “we will demand just a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ from Home Minister Amit Shah”, before proceeding for the meeting, which was seen as a positive move to break the weeks-long impasse, the sudden move also led to a divide among ‘jathebandis’.Also read: Bharat Bandh: Shops, commercial establishments closed in Punjab, HaryanaBharat Bandh underscored need for repeal of Farm Acts: Capt Amarinder5-member Opposition delegation to meet President on farm bills on WednesdayBharat Bandh: Life hit in some states as farmers take national centrestageCongress MPs from Punjab continue sit-in at Delhi's Jantar MantarNeed agri reforms but current farm laws don’t reflect reform, must be scrapped: HoodaMixed response in Delhi as businesses, transport services remain largely unaffectedOnly 13 of the 40 unions who are part of the Centre-farmer talks had been invited and the biggest of them all — BKU Ekta (Ugrahan) — was not one of them, though officials and farmer leaders insisted that names were “unanimously and mutually decided”.Meanwhile, some names on the list, leaders with known political leanings, such as Rakesh Tikait, Hannan Mollah and Shiv Kumar Kakkaji, also led to criticism and high drama ahead of the important meeting.The meeting, however, appeared to have created discord among the organisations spearheading the protests on Delhi’s borders for the past 12 days with the head of the BKU (Ugrahan), which is one of the largest outfits in the bloc, questioning the rationale of the talks a day before the scheduled official consultations.Reacting to the Home Minister’s important invite, BKU (Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan said farmer leaders “should not have gone to meet him separately because it creates misunderstanding among those struggling for their rights”.Ugrahan said though Amit Shah had approached him for talks twice separately, he refused and demanded that all organisations be invited jointly.“We are sticking to the demand of withdrawal of all five anti-farmer laws, to enact law for procurement of all farm produce at MSP throughout the country and strengthening the PDS. Struggling farmers will not accept anything less,” Ugrahan said.However, BKU (Dakonda) “appealed to all supporters of the farmers’ protest that its not a division of any sort”.“It is just another regular meeting called on short notice. All organisations sent a delegation to attend it. Nothing can be finished or finalised in this meeting,” the union said.In a social media post, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, who was not invited to the meeting with Shah, said there was no need for the talks before official consultations and hoped that the leaders attending today’s meet would keep in mind the view of the larger group.Farmer leaders have been firm on their demand for repeal of three new farm laws enacted in September, which they claim will benefit corporates and end the mandi system and the minimum support price (MSP) regime.Interestingly, some leaders also raised objection to the Home Minister’s residence as the venue though officials blamed it on “communication gap”.While it is a known fact that Shah only steps in when something concrete is in sight, some unions from Haryana have also extended support to the government on the three laws and asked Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar that “three Acts are not repealed”.Tomar, too, advised “Opposition parties to stop playing politics on the issue related to the welfare of farmers”.“The Prime Minister is trying his best to bring agriculture on rails and political parties should stop playing politics on the issue,” he said.Sources said Shah also tried to reason with leaders on the same lines, expanding on the benefits of the laws at the meeting, in which Tomar was also present.A Cabinet meeting is planned tomorrow ahead of the farmers’ meeting with the union leaders, sources say.However, while the Centre may be ready for some amendments, farmers say “there can be no midway”.Meanwhile, ahead of the meeting, farmer leaders said they would just listen (to Shah) and take the Centre’s proposal back for discussion with other unions. The fact is while the BJP-led Centre is under pressure to resolve the issue, farmer leaders are also under pressure to not give in.The government has maintained that it is committed to the welfare of farmers and have presented these laws as major reforms for their benefits.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-not-ready-to-repeal-farm-laws-say-farmer-leaders-after-meeting-with-shah-181534
08-12-2020||Kathmandu/Beijing||Nepal, China announce revised height of Mount Everest||Nepal and China on Tuesday jointly announced that the revised height of the world's highest peak Mount Everest was 8,848.86 metres, about 86 centimetres more than the previous measurement done by India in 1954.The Nepal government decided to measure the exact height of the mountain amid debates that there might have been a change in it due to various reasons, including the devastating earthquake of 2015.The new height of Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, is 8,848.86 metres, China and Nepal jointly announced on Tuesday, China's state-run Xinhua news agency said in a brief report.Nepal recalculates the height of Mount Everest at 8848.86 metres, the country's Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali announced in Kathmandu.The new height is 86 cm more than the previous measurement. According to the measurement done in 1954 by Survey of India, the height of Mount Everest is 8,848 metres.According to China's past measurement, the height of Mount Everest is 8844.43 metres which were four metres less than Nepal's calculations.Earlier, the media reports said Chinese surveyors had conducted six rounds of scaled measurement and scientific research on Mount Everest and released the height of the peak twice in 1975 and 2005, which was 8,848.13 metres and 8,844.43 metres respectively.In Tibetan language, Mount Everest is known as Mount Qomolangma.China and Nepal settled their border dispute in 1961 with the boundary line passing through the summit of Mount Everest.Mount Everest is located in the collision and compression zone between the edges of the Indian plate and the Eurasian plate, where crustal movement is very active."Accurately measuring the height of Mount Qomolangma is helpful to the study of the elevation changes of the Himalayas and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau," Gao Dengyi, an atmospheric physicist with the Chinese Academy of Sciences told the Chinese state media earlier.

08-12-2020||Aditi Tandon||Need agri reforms but current farm laws don’t reflect reform, must be scrapped: Hooda||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, Dec 8Former Haryana Chief Minister and Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Tuesday said there was a need for agricultural reforms but “there is no reflection of reforms in the new laws” and they needed to be scrapped.He said the farm laws were passed without any consultations with the farmers, and therefore the Centre must call a Parliament session, repeal these laws and start the reform process afresh.“We are not against reforms but the current laws must be repealed and fresh reform process initiated after consultations with stakeholders,” said the former Haryana CM.On the issue of 2019 Congress manifesto promising to abolish the APMC Act, a matter flagged by Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday, Hooda said the BJP was “misrepresenting facts”.“We promised to take the mandis near the farmers and in Haryana we did that. In my own village we have set up purchase centres at every 10 km for a population of 10,000,” he said.The senior Congress leader questioned the government on why it didn’t agree to the opposition demand for bringing a fourth law notifying anyone who buys below MSP would be punished.Hooda also said the Haryana Government had lost the trust of the people and the Assembly due to mishandling of the farmers agitation and should face a ‘vote of no confidence’.Insisting that the Bharat Bandh on Tuesday was successful, Hooda urged the Haryana Governor to call an emergency session of the state Assembly and allow a floor test.“Seven of the 10 MLAs of BJP ally JJP have dissociated from the government on the farmers issue and three Independents have also done so. The government is in minority and we will move a no confidence vote the day a session is called,” he said.The Congress veteran cited examples from his time as CM in Haryana and said the contract farming agreement was strict and such that the farmer interests were protected unlike in current laws.“Our August 9, 2007 notification in Haryana says the contract farming agreement between sponsor and producer shall be registered with district marketing enforcement offices in the presence of both parties and the agreed rate and contract rate shall not be less than MSP of preceding year. It says where there is no MSP, amount of security will be 15 per cent of prevailing market rate for that crop.”Hooda said there was no such safety in the Central farm laws.He also mentioned that the report of the working group on agriculture, which he chaired during the UPA times, to say one of the panel recommendations was that banks can’t charge more than 4 per cent interest rate to farmers who return short term crop loans in time.In Haryana, he said, this interest was scrapped altogether.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/need-agri-reforms-but-current-farm-laws-dont-reflect-reform-must-be-scrapped-hooda-181530

It shall not only relieve large swathes of north Bihar from the menace of floods, but also provide irrigation to a whopping over 2.14 lakh hectares of command area," said Kataria.He stressed that the interlinking of rivers programme is very important for enhancing water and food security of the country and would be very helpful in providing water to water-scarce, drought-prone and rainfed farming areas.The Seemanchal region encompasses four districts of Purnia, Katihar, Araria and Kisanganj, which account for 24 Assembly constituencies.The region is demographically preponderated by Muslims. Almost every year, it faces large-scale problems due to floods. The voters of the region show preference for the main Opposition RJD in the state.This interlinking project envisages diversion of part of surplus water of Kosi river through existing Hanuman Nagar barrage to the Mahananda basin, which remains deficient in providing water for irrigation.Mechi is an important tributary of Mahananda river. Hence, channelling Kosi water into the Mahananda will optimise redistribution of the surplus waters. Kosi generally gets flooded during the monsoon seasons.During the meetings, Kataria mentioned that most of the clearances for another big-ticket Ken-Betwa link project had been accorded and DPRs had already been shared with the states of MP and UP.Similarly, the water sharing in Par-Tapi-Narmada link project is also under discussion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nda-govt-pushes-major-river-linking-projects-in-rjd-bastion-north-bihar-181520

08-12-2020||Melbourne||New Zealand mosque shooter travelled to India before carrying out attack: Report||Brenton Tarrant, the Australian-born attacker who killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, travelled extensively around the world, including India where he spent nearly three months, before moving to New Zealand to carry out the country's worst massacre in 2019, according to a detailed report into the shootings released on Tuesday.Five Indians were among those killed in the terror attack on March 15 last year that also left dozens of others wounded and had shaken New Zealand, regarded as one of the most peaceful countries in the world.The 792-page Royal Commission of Inquiry report notes that after leaving school, the 30-year-old attacker worked as a personal trainer at a local gym until 2012 when he suffered an injury."He never again worked in paid employment. Instead, he lived off the money that he had received from his father and income from investments made with it… With the money from his father, the individual travelled extensively. First, in 2013, he explored New Zealand and Australia and then between 2014 and 2017 he travelled extensively around the world," it said.Between April 15, 2014, and August 17, 2017, the individual travelled extensively and always alone, except for his travel to North Korea as part of a tour group."The longest visit the individual made to any one country was to India where he stayed between November 21, 2015, and February 18, 2016. The countries that he visited for periods of about a month or more included China, Japan, Russia, South Korea among others," said the report that took about 18 months to compile.The inquiry report did not provide details of what Tarrant was doing in India during his nearly three-month stay in India.However, The New Zealand Herald reported that there was no evidence that he met with extremist groups while oversees, investigated potential targets, or carried out any training, in a report.The inquiry did not believe that the travel fuelled his racist views to any great extent, rather concluding: "Put simply, he travelled widely because he could and had nothing better to do." it said.But he did visit right-wing internet forums, subscribe to right-wing YouTube channels, and "read a great deal about immigration, far right political theories and historical struggles between Christianity and Islam", it added.About the attacker's upbringing in Australia, the Royal Commission of Inquiry report notes that it was marked by a number of stressors, including his parents' separation and his mother's subsequent relationship with an abusive partner.He expressed "racist ideas" from an early age and was also an avid internet user, it said."In February 2017, he booked flights to New Zealand to arrive in Auckland on August 17, 2017, and then on to Dunedin on August 20, 2017. We see these activities as the first manifestations of his terrorist intent," said the report that details the extensive world travels of Tarrant."We are satisfied that by January 2017 the individual had a terrorist attack in mind. We are also satisfied that when the individual came to live in New Zealand on 17 August 2017, it was with a fully-developed terrorist ideology based on his adoption of the Great Replacement theory and his associated beliefs that immigration, particularly by Muslim migrants, into Western countries is an existential threat to Western society and that the appropriate response (at least for him) was violence," it said.In a 74-page manifesto the attacker had posted online, he described himself as a white supremacist who was out to avenge attacks in Europe perpetrated by Muslims.Tarrant was sentenced in August to life in prison without the possibility of parole after pleading guilty to 92 counts of terrorism, murder and attempted murder.The report contains interviews with hundreds of people including security agencies, Muslim community leaders, international experts and officials in England, Norway and Australia, along with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who was praised globally for her compassionate response to the attack.The prime minister swiftly banned the sale of the high-capacity semi-automatic weapons used in the attack at two mosques in the South Island city and launched a global movement against online extremism.

It had come to knowledge that Suraj's parents had approached the woman's parents in Moradabad with a marriage proposal but Singh strongly opposed their proposal, which agitated Suraj."During interrogation, Suraj disclosed that after Singh refused his marriage proposal for his daughter, he got angry and made a plan to kill him. He started following Singh and his wife from November 28 onwards," he said.On the day of the incident, the accused took a knife from the couple's kitchen and allegedly stabbed him on the head and later took a pressure cooker from the kitchen and banged it on his head several times till he became unconscious, the DCP said.

08-12-2020||New Delhi||Mobile technology to be used for Covid vaccination drive, says Modi||With the chances of a Covid vaccine being available soon increasing, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the mobile technology would be used for mass inoculation against the pandemic.Speaking at the India Mobile Congress, he said mobile technology had enabled benefits worth billions of dollars to reach the deserving and also helped the poor and vulnerable during the pandemic."It is also with the help of mobile technology that we will embark on one of the world's largest COVID-19 vaccination drives," he said.He did not provide details.Three leading coronavirus vaccine developers -- Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Bharat Biotech -- have applied for emergency use authorisation in India.While Pfizer India has applied to drug regulator for permission to import its experimental mRNA vaccine for sale and distribution without the requirement for local clinical trials, Serum Institute of India Limited, AstraZeneca's India vaccine partner, has applied for emergency use authorisation using data from Phase-III trials that were conducted locally, as well as in Brazil and the UK.Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech has sought nod Covaxin which is being indigenously developed in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The applications mean that a mass vaccine effort could be shortly under way in a nation that has the world's second-largest coronavirus caseload.At the IMC, Modi said, "We need to work together to ensure a timely roll-out of 5G to leapfrog into the future and empower millions of Indians."He also pitched for making India a global hub for telecom equipment, design, development and manufacturing.Speaking on mobile technology, he said it was because of this that the government was able to provide benefits worth billions of dollars to millions of Indians."It is because of mobile technology that we are seeing billions of cashless transactions which boost formalisation and transparency. It is because of mobile technology that we will enable smooth contactless interface on toll booths," he said.

08-12-2020||New Delhi||AAP says CM Kejriwal under house arrest; Delhi Police deny claim||The Aam Aadmi Party on Tuesday alleged that the Delhi Police has put Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest after he met protesting farmers at the Singhu border, a claim denied by the city police.Kejriwal had visited the Singhu border on Monday and reviewed facilities for farmers protesting against the Centre’s new agri-marketing laws.Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia also said that he was not allowed to enter inside Kejriwal’s residence. The AAP leader later addressed a press conference outside the CM’s residence.Addressing a press conference earlier, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj claimed the city police has put Kejriwal under house arrest.“On the direction of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Delhi Police has put Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest ever since he visited farmers at Singhu border. No one has been permitted to leave or enter his residence and he has not been allowed to meet anyone.“When our MLAs went to meet the chief minister, they were beaten and thrown on the streets. The party volunteers were also not allowed to meet,” he alleged.Refuting the charge, Satish Golcha, Special Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) North Zone said the situation in the national capital is peaceful.“It is claimed in certain sections on social media that there have been restrictions on the movement of the Chief Minister of Delhi. I would like to clarify in this regard that these claims are totally baseless. There are absolutely no restrictions. The chief minister is doing his normal engagements and there is normal movement. Further he is going out of his residence for his engagements,” he told reporters.Anto Alphonse, Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) also tweeted a photograph of the entrance of Kejriwal’s residence and denied the allegations.“This claim of CM Delhi being put on house arrest is incorrect. He exercises his right to free movement within the law of the land. A picture of the house entrance says it all,” the DCP tweeted.Addressing a press conference outside Kejriwal’s residence, Sisodia claimed that he and several party MLAs were not allowed to meet the CM.“Still the police is falsely saying that there is no house arrest. They are doing this because Kejriwal denied permission to convert Delhi’s stadiums into temporary prisons for the protesting farmers. They are afraid of Kejriwal and fear that he will come out to support the bandh,” he said.Bhardwaj said that AAP members will ensure that Kejriwal is “released”.“We were told that there are direct orders from the MHA to keep Kejriwal under house arrest till the farmers protest is going on. Today, all our party members have assembled here and we will go towards Kejriwal’s residence. If police stop us, we will not misbehave but will go to the residence and ensure that Kejriwal is released,” he said.AAP leaders Durgesh Pathak, Dilip Pandey and Somnath Bharti also protested outside Kejriwal’s residence. AAP MP Bhagwant Mann claimed he was stopped by the police from entering the residence.“We had heard of emergency, but today we experienced it. I am not being allowed to go in and meet the CM. I am the elected representative and I am not being allowed. The BJP government is rattled and is trying to stop the Delhi CM from showing his support to the protesting farmers,” Mann claimed.Opposition BJP and Congress called the so-called house arrest of Kejriwal a “political gimmick”.Delhi BJP spokesperson Naveen Kumar said the AAP is indulging in politics of lies and betrayal.“AAP is constantly doing politics of lies and betrayal. Yesterday, CM Kejriwal went to Singhu border and he also went to a party in the evening. This is the video. They are calling resting at home as house arrest,” he tweeted and posted a purported video of Kejriwal’s residence.Delhi Congress president Anil Chaudhary said, “It is a gimmick. How can he go out in support of Bharat Bandh when his own government has notified the new farm law? He must be waiting for Amit Shah’s permission before leaving his residence.”                 AAP leaders, however, reiterated that the Centre has put Kejriwal under house arrest to ensure that he does not express his support to the protesting farmers.“Arvind Kejriwal was put under house arrest ever since he returned from the Singhu border. The government does not want Kejriwal to stand with farmers and that is why they took this step,” AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh charged.“By putting Kejriwal under house arrest, the Centre wants to curb all the voices that have come out in support of farmers,” Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) members also raised slogans of “Police Jhooth Bolna Band Karo” and “Arvind ji Ko Riha Karo” outside Kejriwal’s residence.The party has extended its support to the Bharat Bandh called by farmer organisations.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, are protesting at various border points of Delhi against the new farm laws.The Centre’s offer to amend the contentious laws failed to cut ice with farmer groups during the fifth round of talks on Saturday.

It is our responsibility to support the farmers. We have followed all instructions of the Prime Minister during the nationwide lockdown. But the farmers have been sitting on the streets; so please support the farmers for a day on their call for 'Bharat Bandh'.""Joined by Khadoor Sahib MP Jasbir Singh Gill and Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu. Had the morning tea over press talk at Jantar Mantar," he also tweeted.The MPs are also demanding a 'Winter Session' of Parliament which, they claimed, the government was deliberately trying to delay.Aujla said that when farmers arrived in Delhi, they were stopped on the Delhi-Haryana border. "They asked for permission to go to the Ramlila Maidan or the Jantar Mantar, but their demands were not met and thus they have to continue their protest on the Delhi borders," the Congress Lok Sabha MP from Amritsar said.Several leaders of various political parties from Punjab have travelled to Delhi to make their presence felt in the ongoing farmers' agitation.The farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh have given a call for 'Bharat Bandh' or nationwide strike on Tuesday over the three new central farm laws.A number of political parties have extended support to the farmers' cause.

08-12-2020||Washington||Several US lawmakers, American Sikhs voice support for agitating farmers||Several US lawmakers and eminent members of the Sikh community in America have voiced their support for farmers agitating in India against the new farm laws and urged that they be allowed to protest peacefully.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting on various borders of Delhi since November 26, seeking repealing of the three farm laws enacted in September.Dubbing these laws as "anti-farmer", these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislations would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture."I stand in solidarity with the Punjab farmers in India protesting for their livelihoods and protection from misguided, manipulative government regulations,” Congressman Doug LaMalfa said on Monday."Punjab farmers must be allowed to protest peacefully against their government without fear of violence," said the Republican lawmaker who represents Californian's first Congressional district.India has called the remarks by foreign leaders and politicians on protests by farmers as "ill-informed" and "unwarranted" as the matter pertained to the internal affairs of a democratic country."India is the world's largest democracy - they owe it to their citizens to allow peaceful protest. I encourage these folks and PM (Narendra) Modi to have peaceful, productive discussions,” Democratic Congressman Josh Harder said.Congressman TJ Cox said India must uphold the right to peaceful demonstration and ensure their citizens' safety.The rights of farmers protesting must be respected and meaningful dialogue is the way forward, the Democratic leader asserted.Congressman Andy Levin said he was inspired by the movement of farmers in India."I see it as a harbinger of a people power year in 2021," the Democratic lawmaker said.The US Sikh Community on Monday urged Modi to accept the demands of the agitating farmers and continue to have a dialogue with them.In a letter, the Sikhs of America urged the prime minister to recognise the farmers’ protest as a national protest and not a regional one.Signed by eminent Sikh-American Jasse Singh and several other members of the community, the letter ridiculed effort by a section of society and media to brand a genuine protest by the Sikhs as a separatist or a pro-Khalistan movement.This is a national movement of the farmers and not restricted to just Punjab alone, Singh said."Please accept the demands of our farmers," the letter said."Any kind of aggression on behalf of the government against these peaceful protests by farmers will go against the principles and values of our great democracy and even against the principles of your party," said the letter, a copy of which was submitted to the Indian Embassy here in Washington DC.Observing that there are hundreds of thousands of farmers throughout the nation protesting against the three laws, the letter said that there is no doubt that these new laws were brought in for the betterment of farmers."But now we see that farmers do not want it and are giving an extraordinarily strong message against these laws which is being watched not only in India but throughout the world," the letter said.Protests at such a massive scale are a clear mandate that farmers do not want these laws, the letter said."We request you not to impose these laws against the mandate. Farmers have always been the backbone of Indian economy and development and their mandate should not be ignored,” it said.Agitating farmer unions have threatened to block national highways and occupy toll plazas across the country during their 'chakka jam' protest from 11 am to 3 pm on Tuesday as part of their stir.The farmers' protest has also caught the attention of the mainstream US media. “The protests have spread beyond New Delhi. Farmers marched and waved banners in the southern states of Kerala and Karnataka and in the north-eastern state of Assam.Sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh, who would be less affected by the farm overhaul, set up a protest camp in solidarity, clogging a central artery on the state's border with Delhi,” The New York Times reported.According to a CNN report, "Tens of thousands of farmers have swarmed India's capital where they intend to camp out for weeks to protest new agricultural laws that they say could destroy their livelihoods."

08-12-2020||New Delhi/Chandigarh||Bharat Bandh passes off peacefully; life hit in some states as farmers take national centrestage||Life was disrupted in several parts of the country on Tuesday as shops and commercial establishments stayed closed, transport was affected and protesters squatted on key roads and rail tracks in response to a ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by farmers demanding a repeal of the new agri laws.As the day wound to a mostly peaceful close and the farmers termed their show of strength a success, Union Home Minister Amit Shah stepped in to call their leaders for talks, ahead of the sixth round of talks between Central ministers and farmer representatives on Wednesday.“There is no midway. We will demand just a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ from Home Minister Amit Shah,” farmer leader Rudru Singh Mansa told reporters at the Singhu border where thousands of farmers have been protesting for the last 12 days. A delegation of 13 leaders will meet Shah.The nationwide shutdown was observed in around 10,000 places in 25 states, claimed Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav.                                Emergency services were exempted and banks, too, continued operations as the pan-India shutdown, backed by most opposition parties and trade unions, rolled out noisily but peacefully with its impact felt in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi, the epicentre of the snowballing protests, as well as in states such as Odisha, Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkhand.The pandemic appeared to recede into the background as security was stepped up across the country, restive crowds demonstrated in some places and the numbers swelled at Delhi’s border points. Protesters also blocked railway tracks at several places in West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha.As slogans such as “Kisan Ekta Zindabad” were heard in protest centrepoints such as Tikri and the agitation picked up pace, so did social media with the hashtag #Aaj_Bharat_Bandh_Hai trending worldwide till late afternoon.From the Rajasthan capital Jaipur, where ‘mandis’ were closed but shops open, there were reports of clashes between workers of the state’s ruling Congress and the BJP.In Delhi, where most main markets were open, tension spiralled with the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alleging that Delhi Police had put Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal under house arrest till evening. City police denied the claim but AAP leaders stuck to their stand.Farmer unions had threatened to block national highways and occupy toll plazas across the country during a ‘chakka jam’ protest from 11 am to 3 pm.All India Kisan Sabha general secretary Hannan Mollah described the shutdown as a show of strength by the farmers.“We are standing by our demand that we want a complete repeal of the three laws and will not accept any cosmetic changes… If our demands are not met, we are ready to take our agitation to the next level,” Mollah said.The protesting farmers fear the new laws will pave the way for eliminating the safety of the Minimum Support Price cushion and do away with ‘mandis’, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. The government maintains the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture.Opposition parties are expected to meet Kovind on Wednesday evening to raise their concerns about the three laws.“Leaders from different political parties (those opposing the farm bills) will sit, discuss and take a collective stand on the contentious farm laws before meeting President Ram Nath Kovind,” NCP chief Sharad Pawar told reporters.Farmers from Punjab and also Haryana have been the drivers of the movement against the laws. In both states, shops and commercial establishments were closed as were thousands of fuel pumps. Farmers assembled at highways and other key roads in both states since morning. All major parties in Punjab — the ruling Congress, AAP and the Shiromani Akali Dal—extended their support.Over 50,000 government employees took mass casual leave in support of farmers, said Punjab Civil Secretariat Staff Association president Sukhchain Khaira.In neighbouring BJP-JJP ruled Haryana, the opposition Congress and Indian National Lok Dal extended their support.The Haryana Police traffic advisory had warned commuters that main national highways would be closed and the peak time of impact was expected to be between 12 noon to 3 pm.In West Bengal, where the ruling Trinamool Congress joined the Congress and the Left in supporting the shutdown but stayed away from enforcing it, the response was mixed. Railway tracks were blocked in several places and there were sit-ins on major roads.Life was hit in Bihar too with train tracks, highways and inner roads teeming with protesters as opposition parties extended their support.In Jehanabad, the movement of Patna-Palamu Express was obstructed for a few minutes until the bandh supporters, squatting on the tracks, were chased away by the police.Train services were also affected in Odisha as activists of farmers’ organisations, trade unions and political parties held sit-ins on tracks in Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Bhadrak and Balasore.Elsewhere in the state, ruled by the Biju Janata Dal, normal life was hit with markets and offices shut and Congress and Left supporters blocking major roads.    Major cities in Congress-ruled Chhattisgarh were deserted with most business establishments closed and public transport keeping away.In Maharashtra, where the ruling Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress combine extended its support, wholesale markets in major cities like Pune, Nashik, Nagpur and Aurangabad were shut. Retail shops also downed shutters in many cities.Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) were closed in many parts of the state.The state government appealed to protesters to not disrupt public transport services and buses and local trains were unaffected.“…The situation needs to be created to put pressure on the government, and to achieve this, farmers need to hit the streets. But no one should resort to violence,” said social activist Anna Hazare who went on daylong fast in his village Ralegan Siddhi village in Maharashtra’s Ahmednagar district.There was a mixed response in other states as well.In Assam, shops pulled down shutters, protesters blocked traffic and demonstrations were staged but most offices were functioning. Dozens of protesters were detained, officials said.The ruling TRS and opposition parties, including the Congress and various unions, held protests across Telangana.In Tamil Nadu, the opposition DMK and its allies, including the Congress, held protests across the state but life was mostly unaffected.In the union territory of Puducherry, ruled by the Congress, however, the ‘bandh’ call evoked a near total response.Normal life was affected in parts of Karnataka as farmers and workers hit the roads. Many organisations in the state came out in support of the bandh.In some states, including in Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh, life continued unimpeded.The three contentious laws at the centre of the farmer protests are the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.

His pitch on the importance of reforms comes ahead of Tuesday’s Bharat bandh over the three new farm laws. But during his brief address, the Prime Minister made no direct reference to the new laws or the farmers’ protests.“Reforms are needed for development. Reforms are very much needed for a new order and to give new facilities. We cannot build the next century with the laws of the previous century,” he said. “Some laws that used to be good in the past century have become a burden in the present century. Reforms should be a continuous process,” he said.Meanwhile, the BJP today slammed opposition leaders for “jumping on” the agitation bandwagon to save their “political astitva (existence)”. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad accused them of “duplicity and shameless double standards” over reforms in the farming sector which they had themselves advocated while in power.Farmer leaders said political parties were responding to their “genuine demands”. “It doesn’t mean farmers are affiliated to them, it is part of democracy, why is everyone so surprised,” said Kavitha Kuruganti of Mahila Kisan Adhikar Manch, one of the 40 unions invited for talks with the Centre.
