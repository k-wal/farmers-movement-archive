The test will be offered in regional languages from next year.“In line with the vision of #NEP2020, the Joint Admission Board (JAB) of #JEE (Main) has decided to conduct the JEE (Main) examination in more regional languages of India,” Nishank tweeted.“The examination will also be conducted in regional languages where entry to State Engineering Colleges is decided based on an examination (conducted in regional language). State language of states who admit students based on the #JEE(Main) will also be included under this.“This decision has far-reaching implications as Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) has pointed out that top-scoring countries in PISA examination use mother tongue as a medium of instruction. The decision of JAB will help students comprehend questions better and score higher,” he said in a series of tweets.According to National Testing Agency (NTA) officials, the regional languages in which the test will be offered are yet to be decided.“The exam will be offered in those regional languages in which the states are already conducting their local entrance exams for engineering. More languages will be added following whichever states are part of the JEE-Main and want their language to be included in the test,” an official said.Last year, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee while questioning the inclusion of Gujarati as a medium of writing the exam, demanded inclusion of other regional languages.The Ministry of Education had then clarified it has been offering the test in Gujarati following a request from the state and said that the test will be offered in all the 11 languages from 2021. The ministry also asked NTA to explore the possibility of offering the competitive exams in as many languages as possible.

22-10-2020||New Delhi||Next stimulus should focus on short-gestation infra projects: Niti Aayog Vice Chairman||Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar on Thursday said the Indian economy might end up with a lower contraction in the current fiscal than projected by various organisations and also stressed that the next stimulus should focus on short-gestation infrastructure projects.Participating in a virtual event organised by Public Affairs Forum of India (PAFI), Kumar said helicopter money is not something that the government is looking at.                      Generally, helicopter money refers to quantitative easing policy by the central bank to ensure more liquidity in the system.“There are some people who now say that it may not be as bad as it has been forecast and there are signs that we may not have economic contraction (of) 9.5 per cent or 10 per cent that we thought about,” he said.According to him, recovery in August and September was quite smart, and it has been witnessed across many high frequency indicators.“I think this third quarter, we will see smaller contraction (in economic growth) than had been forecast and fourth quarter could well be a wash if not a small positive.“So if that is true, then, I think we might end up with a contraction, which is lower but nonetheless contraction itself is very unprecedented thing,” he said.The Reserve Bank of India has projected the Indian economy to contract 9.5 per cent in the current fiscal while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have estimated contraction at 10.3 per cent and 9.6 per cent, respectively.Kumar also said the next stimulus should focus on short-gestation infrastructure projects as it will have a strong multiplier effects and can sustain growth.“There are enough productivity enhancing expenditures which can be rolled out in a relatively short span,” he said          “At the moment we are looking for stimulus which can sustain growth and give legs to recovery that we are seeing already and I am hoping that the Ministry of Finance will be focusing in the same direction,” he added.His statement comes days after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that she has not closed the option to come up with one more stimulus.Kumar also noted that Indian banks need specialisation and the government is looking at it.He said there is a huge potential to mobilise India’s financial domestic savings.“5,000 tonnes of gold are lying idle in India. We will have to find ways to monetise this gold,” Kumar said.The Niti Aayog Vice Chairman said that he won’t be concerned even if India debt to GDP ratio increases from 68 per cent to 80 per cent as long as the money is used for productive purposes.“We borrow at national level, not sub-national level,” he noted.Participating in the event, Kotak Mahindra Bank Managing Director Uday Kotak said that compared to April and May, the situation in October in terms of the real economy, especially in tradable and physical areas, have certainly got much better.“Important factors that are working for us as a country are extremely strong external account, including the current account position, which is giving us much less fragility on the global side and huge amount of surplus liquidity around the world is leading to significant investment flows.“Third, in India, we had extraordinary accommodative monetary policy with clear guidance and unambiguous way forward. Fourth is an expensive fiscal policy, including the packages, combined with the fact that revenues have been lower,” he said.He also noted that finally the world has changed the way it is moving away from concentration with dominant countries in a new geo-political framework.Replying to a question on Non-Performing Assets (NPAs), he said, “We had two moratoriums that delayed recognition of NPAs. Still early to declare victory, we need to watch two more quarters to get a sense of NPAs”.Kotak also noted that if Indian economy has to take off, the financial sector must have the capacity and ability to support economic growth.In the medium term, he said that India must increase its spending on defence, health and infrastructure.

22-10-2020||Gorakhpur/New Delhi||33 Indian labourers held ‘hostage’ by Somalian company; High Commission trying to resolve crisis||The Indian High Commission in Kenya has said that it is in touch with the Somalian government to rescue 33 Indian labourers who are allegedly been kept hostage by a company in Mogadishu.It also said that it was trying to provide the required assistance to the labourers.“This mission is in constant touch with Somalian government for immediate rescue of 33 Indian labourers from Mogadishu, Somalia. We are in touch with the labourers also for getting them the assistance needed, at the earliest. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Somalia has assured that arrangements will be made for these people to visit India soon,” the Commission tweeted in Hindi on Wednesday in reply to a tweet by activist Rajesh Mani. Rajesh Mani of Manav Seva Sansthan said 33 Indian labourers, including 25 workers from Uttar Pradesh, have been held hostage by a company in Somalia for the last eight months.He said the matter came to his knowledge after a labourer from Kushinagar district contacted him.The activist said he took to Twitter to contact the Indian High Commission in Kenya to seek help.“I contacted the Indian High Commission in Kenya and the External Affairs Ministry through Twitter and e-mail. They gave assurance of helping the labourers,” he said.Mani said out of the 33 labourers held hostage, 21 belong to Gorakhpur division. Six of the labourers are from Bihar and one each from Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, he said.According to the activist, the labourers had joined the company 10 months ago. In the first two months, the company treated them well, but from the last eight months, the workers were not paid their salaries, he said.“On Tuesday, one Sugreev Kushwaha of Kushinagar contacted me through WhatsApp, and told me that 33 Indian labourers were living in difficult conditions as the company at Mogadishu in Somalia, where they were working, had made them hostage in the factory campus. He said they have not been paid from the last eight months. He also sent me a video clip showing their condition,” Mani said.“When the labourers demanded their salary, the company made them hostage inside the factory campus, took their passports and threatened to shoot them. They have also not been given food, water and medicines since the last 15 days. The labourers have been confined to their rooms and kept hungry and thirsty. The company is treating them like bonded labourers,” he added.

22-10-2020||Vibha Sharma||Nadda slams Amarinder, says agitation not of 'farmers but middlemen'||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 22BJP president JP Nadda on Thursday slammed Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh and those “instigating” farmers in Punjab, saying that ongoing agitation in the state is “not of farmers but middlemen”.Farmers in Punjab are not even allowed to choose their ‘aarthiya’, the BJP president said while addressing a group farmers from the Delhi region in the party headquarters.Nadda said it was because of monopoly of some people in the 'mandis' that farmers had to sell their produce at a price lower than market rate, a situation which they would now be able to change with the new agriculture Acts.Slamming the Congress, which is leading the agitation in Punjab and has also got three counter legislations cleared from the state Assembly, Nadda said a “well-educated” person like Amarinder Singh was saying that the MSP should be mentioned in the Act whereas he knows very well that it was always implemented via an executive order.“Amarinder Singhji MSP is always implemented through an executive order. If you were so keen to make it legal why did your party not do so for the 55 years it was in power....who stopped you from making it legal, including it in the Act,” Nadda said accusing Congress of “fueling agitation because they know nothing except politics”. Nadda said the same party de-notified fruits and vegetables out of the APMC in 2014 and mentioned in their 2019 manifesto that they said they would make trade of agriculture produce, including exports, etc. free from all restrictions.Reiterating the party's oft-repeated assurance about the MSP, the BJP president said subsequent governments remained indifferent towards farmers but Prime Minister Narendra Modi changed that by implementing several pro-farmer programmes.With the three new agricultural Acts continuing to pose a challenge, the party has tasked ministers, MPs, spokespersons and local leaders to reach out and spread the message about their benefits among farmers and general public.A number of farmers’ leaders and organisations of BJP are also engaged in the job.  Farmers of 360 villages of Delhi on Thursday presented a note of thanks to Prime Minister Modi for bringing the agricultural laws.While general secretary Tarun Chugh is holding meetings with farmers in villages of Punjab, spokesperson Sambit Patra has also been entrusted with the responsibility of communicating with farmers’ leaders and organisations and establishing the party-line, say sources.A liaison committee of eight members has been formed, they add.Meanwhile, party leaders also claim that eventually the Punjab Government will have to “withdraw the counter Bills”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nadda-slams-amarinder-says-agitation-not-of-farmers-but-middlemen-159562
22-10-2020||New Delhi||Joint committee of Parliament summons social media giants Facebook, Twitter||Social media giants Facebook and Twitter have been issued summons by a joint committee of Parliament on the issue of protection of data and its privacy, sources said on Thursday.Representatives of Facebook India have been asked to appear on Friday before the Joint Committee on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, chaired by BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi, while Twitter officials are required to appear before the panel on October 28, as per the notice issued by the Lok Sabha Secretariat.Summoning officials of Amazon and Google on the same issue is also under active consideration of the joint committee of Parliament, the sources said.When contacted Lekhi said, “Whosoever is required, whether an individual or an entity, will be asked to depose before the panel on the issue of protection of data and its privacy and their respective social media platforms will be thoroughly examined by the panel.“It would be inappropriate and unfair to look at the calling of social media platform from the political prism. The committee has representatives from across the political spectrum and the deliberations on the Bill are being held from the national interest perspective,” she said.Meanwhile, the Centre on Thursday warned Twitter about its location setting that showed Leh in China, saying any disrespect towards the country’s sovereignty and integrity is totally unacceptable.In a strongly-worded letter, Ajay Sawhney, Secretary in the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), asked Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to respect the country’s sensitivities, sources in the ministry said.Twitter came under heavy criticism and faced backlash from social media users after its geotagging feature displayed “Jammu & Kashmir, People’s Republic of China” in a live broadcast from Leh’s Hall of Fame, a war memorial for fallen soldiers in the Union Territory of Ladakh.Last month, Union Information and Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had also written to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and accused the social media platform’s employees of supporting people from a political predisposition that lost successive elections, and of “abusing” the prime minister and senior cabinet ministers.The parliamentary standing committee on Information and Technology chaired by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor had also summoned Facebook officials on the alleged misuse of its hate speech rules.

22-10-2020||New Delhi||Pan-India Khoya survey after sample failures in Delhi: Food regulator||Ahead of the festive season, apex food regulator has launched a pan India quality survey of Khoya, an essential ingredient of all India sweets.Khoya or mawais is widely used in preparing most sweets.The survey follows a recent representation to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India by the Federation of Sweets and Namkeen manufacturers who said they were being supplied adulterated khoya.A pilot survey in Delhi under the guidance of FSSAI recently showed sample failure of some Khoya samples which led to the FSSAI launch a national survey.Samples were tested for acidity, maximum added starch, added sugar, urea, detergent and neutralizers. “There was some sample failure which is why a decision was taken to launch an all India khoya survey,” CEO of FSSAI Arun Singhal said today.Commissioners of Food Safety of all states and UTs have been asked to earmark khoya mandis in big cities and test samples.So far 700 samples from 15 states have been collected and more are on the way.“Test results are expected in a month. These will help identify key hot spots for adulteration of khoya in India and strengthen state efforts in devising targeted enforcement drives to ensure a supply of safe quality sweets to every Indian,” FSSAI said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pan-india-khoya-survey-after-sample-failures-in-delhi-food-regulator-159560
22-10-2020||Jodhpur||Rajasthan HC stays proceedings against Shourie, others in Laxmi Vilas Palace sale case||The Rajasthan High Court High court on Thursday stayed the proceedings of a trial court which had ordered reopening of a probe against former disinvestment minister Arun Shourie and four others over the sale of a government-owned hotel in Udaipur two decades back.The Jodhpur bench of the high court has summoned records of the case from the special CBI court, asking it not to proceed against the five petitioners until further orders.Last month, the CBI court ordered the registration of a new FIR against former Union disinvestment minister Arun Shourie, the then department secretary Pradip Baijal, Lazard India Ltd managing director Ashish Guha, valuer Kantilal Karamsey and Bharat Hotels director Jyotsana Suri over the sale.The CBI had already filed a closure report after its earlier investigation into the sale of Laxmi Vilas Palace Hotel.According to the initial complaint, the five had conspired through the disinvestment process in 1999-2002 to sell the ITDC-owned hotel to a private company for a meagre Rs 7.52 crore, causing a loss of Rs 244 crore to the exchequer.The counsel for the five petitioners appeared before the court of Justice Vijay Bishnoi through video conferencing. The day’s hearing lasted over an hour.Arguing his case himself, Shourie explained the disinvestment process. He said one individual had twice challenged the process before a division bench of this court in 2002 and 2006. Both times, the pleas were dismissed.Shourie said the trial court had made observations against him, alleging that he is of “dual character”, without giving him a hearing.The counsel said the trial court grossly erred in passing the order.They argued that it could not be said on the basis of the material collected by the Central Bureau of Investigation during the probe that the petitioners were involved in the commission of a crime.Additional Solicitor General of India S V Raju also supported petitioners’ arguments.“The CBI has filed closure reports twice in the matter with detailed reasons on why no offence is made out against any of the persons named in the FIR. But the trial court without considering the said reasons in the right perspective has illegally passed the impugned order,” Raju argued.The trial court had also ordered that Shourie and others should be summoned before it through an arrest warrant and also directed that the administration should take over the hotel till the matter is settled.Both directions were earlier put on hold by the high court. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-hc-stays-proceedings-against-shourie-others-in-laxmi-vilas-palace-sale-case-159559
22-10-2020||---||India-US talks have their own dynamics: MEA||New Delhi, October 22“Diplomatic calendars have their logic. The last two meetings were also held towards the end of the year,” said the Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava during a media briefing on Thursday.Srivastava was attempting to dispel the impression that the timing of the India-US two plus two on October 27 close on the heels of the Quad Foreign Ministers’ meeting was meant to contain China.India has not gone public with the China threat during bilateral interactions with the US and its allies, preferring to keep within closed doors the strategising on the People’s Liberation Army’s aggression in the maritime and land domains. The previous two Indo-US two plus two dialogues were held in New Delhi in September 2018 and in Washington in December 2019, pointed out Srivastava.Fielding questions on the agenda, expectation of the likely outcome and the agreements to be signed, Srivastava counseled patience in order not to prejudge the outcome.  He also maintained that the discussions next week between India’s Defence and Foreign Ministers with their US counterparts will not focus on a single issue when he was asked whether economic and immigration issues will also be discussed at the interaction.  A pre-meeting MEA readout also did not mention China nor did it talk of a free and open Indo-Pacific, an euphemism for not allowing China to have its way in the East China Sea and South China Sea. Srivastava instead said previous rounds of talks have enabled both sides to further progress the bilateral relationship and strengthen the institutional framework for cooperation across all sectors.  In this respect the MEA enumerated six areas—political, security and defence, economic, commercial, technology and people-to-people contacts. “We have regular dialogue for various levels to discuss ongoing bilateral cooperation and to exchange views on developments in the region,” he said while expecting the third India-US 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue to entail a “comprehensive discussion on cross cutting bilateral issues of mutual interest”.The visiting US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defence Mark Esper will have separate bilateral meetings with their counterparts. They will also meet NSA Ajit Doval and will jointly call on PM Narendra Modi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-us-talks-have-their-own-dynamics-mea-159555

The PM and the RoK President had two phone conversations….in these conversations there was an exchange of views on the Covid situation as well as the ongoing diversification of the international value chain,’’ added Srivastava.South Korea has suggested the revival of in-person diplomacy including the initiation of two plus two talks with India.Seoul also wants India to back its Trade Minister Yoo Myung-hee for the WTO DG’s post. Yoo is pitted against Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria and a decision is expected in early November.In May, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had held a broad-based virtual meeting on the Covid crises with his counterparts from Quad countries plus Israel, Brazil and South Korea.“The special partnership spans a range of areas and has made great strides in recent years since PM Modi went to Seoul in 2015,” said Srivastava.“As you mentioned yesterday, cooperation and solidarity between Korea and India will be stronger and deeper in all areas,” the RoK President had said while replying to a tweet addressed to him by PM Modi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/south-korea-to-help-india-diversify-value-chain-159553
22-10-2020||Kathmandu||R&AW chief meets Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli||Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) chief Samant Kumar Goel paid a courtesy call on Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and said India will not allow interruption in the friendly bilateral relations with Nepal and resolve all outstanding issues through dialogue, according to a top Nepalese official on Thursday.His visit comes ahead of the upcoming official trip of Indian Army Chief Gen. M M Naravane to Nepal in the first week of November. Goel called on Prime Minister Oli at his official residence at Baluwatar on Wednesday evening, the premier’s press advisor Surya Thapa told PTI.During the meeting, Goel “expressed his views regarding not to allow interruption in friendly relations between Nepal and India, resolving all the outstanding issues through dialogue and continuing mutual cooperation”, Thapa said.Sources here said the chief of India’s external intelligence agency is also expected to meet chiefs of different security agencies in Nepal, including the Nepalese Army, during his visit.The ties between the two countries came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal protested the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through its territory. Days later, Nepal came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories.In the midst of the row, Gen Naravane said that there were reasons to believe that Nepal objected to the road at the behest of “someone else”, in an apparent reference to a possible role by China in the matter. The comments triggered angry reactions from Nepal.India too had published a new map in November 2019 showing the areas as its territories.After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it a “unilateral act” and cautioning Kathmandu that such “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it.In June, Nepal’s Parliament approved the new political map of the country featuring areas which India maintains belong to it.In its reaction, after Nepal’s lower house of parliament approved the Bill, India termed as untenable the “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims by the neighbouring country.India said Nepal’s action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks.Prime Minister Oli has been asserting that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura belong to his country and vowed to “reclaim” them from India.The Lipulekh pass is a far western point near Kalapani, a disputed border area between Nepal and India. Both India and Nepal claim Kalapani as an integral part of their territory—India as part of Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district and Nepal as part of Dharchula district.

Kindly refer to the state-wise election schedule to know when you will get it along with a hoard of false promises,” Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said while his colleague Shashi Tharoor posted a caustic tweet attacking Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman who announced the controversial sop in Bihar today.“You give me votes, I will give you vaccines. What appalling cynicism! Will the EC rap her (FM) and her shameless government on the knuckles,” Tharoor said attracting a rebuttal from BJP’s general secretary in charge of Bihar Bhupendra Yadav who said to Tharoor: “Your attempt to twist the FM’s statement reeks of desperation. All parties issue manifestoes. Vaccines will be made available to all Indians at nominal costs. States can make them free. In Bihar, we will.”BJP’s defence failed to cut ice with the opposition which asked tough questions as did those on social media.NC vice president Omar Abdullah asked if the BJP would be paying for COVID vaccines from the party treasury? “If it’s coming from the government treasury then how can Bihar get free vaccines while the rest of the country has to pay? There is so much wrong with this blatant populism that shamefully exploits COVID fears,” said Abdullah.BJP’s announcement also triggered a chain reaction today with Tamil Nadu CM E Palaniswamy promising a free COVID vaccine ahead of state polls.“They are politicising the health of citizens with vaccine election-ism,” Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel tweeted today with RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav slamming the sop saying the BJP had nothing else to offer in Bihar.Acerbic reactions also came from TMC’s Saugata Roy, Shiv Sena’s Priyanka Chaturvedi and SP’s Akhilesh Yadav who questioned BJP for the move.Public health experts termed BJP’s announcement as intriguing with Rijo M John, guest faculty at IIM Kozhikode asking after FM’s remarks, “Is it an ethical allocation of a vaccine that will be the most in demand? Should we not prioritise healthcare workers, elderly and the most vulnerable first?”Researcher Anant Bhan pointed to Tamil Nadu’s vaccine promise to say, “Political promises of this ilk are as infectious as COVID 19 itself.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/politicising-a-public-good-oppn-experts-slam-bjps-free-vaccine-sop-159545

22-10-2020||New Delhi||IndiGo considers buying freighters, aims to haul cargo globally||Seeing a tremendous growth in the cargo segment, airline major IndiGo might add freighter aircraft to its fleet.Industry insiders told IANS that the airline is evaluating a proposal to add freighter aircraft, which will help the company expand cargo services to China, Singapore and Malaysia in the near future.The move to haul more cargo via freighters assumes significance as the segment has seen a massive demand surge due to the pandemic.When contacted the company did not elicit a response.According to industry insiders, with air passenger numbers expected to remain low, the industry is look at other avenues to augment revenues such as the dedicated Cargo services.In the initial days of the lockdown, the sudden demand for freight and high charges allowed airlines to gain some revenue.This trend is expected to continue.At present, the airline continues with "CarGo in cabin" operations.These type of services are expected to be retained even after resumption of full schedule.Currently, the airline has 10 passenger aircraft completely deployed for cargo operations in freighter mode.The airline has managed to earn marginally higher revenue within the last five to six months at limited capacity as compared to the last financial year.It has already transported cargo equivalent to the loads carried in the last financial year.Till September, the airline has operated over 1,700 cargo charters, transporting more than 14,300 MT of supplies since April 18th across 21 destinations within India and internationally, including new stations like Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan, Cairo in Egypt, Almaty in Kazakhstan and Tashkent in Uzbekistan.Besides, the move allows it to become the only second player in the airline industry that has freighter aircraft in its fleet.The proposal also provides the airline with a differentiated service standard than the aircraft belly space provide in other type of passenger planes.Such a differentiated standard would include temperature controlled cargo service essential for ferrying vaccines and perishable items.The airline has been an active participant in the Centre's 'Lifeline Udan' scheme.

22-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Umar Khalid tells court he’s in sort of solitary confinement||Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid, arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in connection with north-east Delhi riots in February, told a court here on Thursday that he was not allowed to step out of his cell and it was sort of a “solitary confinement”.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat directed Tihar Jail Superintendent to be present before the court on Friday to hear the matter.Khalid made his submissions directly to the court through video conferencing when he was produced before it on expiry of his judicial custody in the case.The court also pulled up the Assistant Jail Superintendent of Tihar prisons for not unmuting the microphone when Khalid told him that he wanted to speak to the judge.Khalid said the official told him the microphone will be unmuted if the judge gave the permission for it.“If an undertrial wants to say something, then unmute and let him speak or you tell us that he wants to say something,” the judge told the jail official.Khalid alleged that he was alone in his cell and not allowed to step out of his cell or talk to anyone.“I have not been allowed to step outside at all. I am alone in my cell. No one is allowed to meet me. It is practically sort of a solitary confinement. I am not well for the last three days. I am feeling discomfort. This is like a punishment. Why am I given this punishment? I reiterate that I need security but it cannot be that I have to be in my cell all day,” he claimed.He further said that on Wednesday he was shown an order passed by Additional Superintendent Pradeep Sharma of Jail number 2, in which it was stated that Khalid should not be allowed out of his cell for 24 hours a day.“I request a recall of that order. In the morning, the Jail Superintendent came and asked the jail staff to allow me to go outside. I was allowed to step out for 10 minutes and then after he left, I was not allowed to go outside since then,” Khalid alleged.When his counsel, advocate Trideep Pais, told the court that no adverse steps should be taken against him by the jail authorities for putting forward his grievances, the judge said, “Khalid should not be punished for putting forward his grievances. You should take care of it.”The court had on October 17 directed the Tihar Jail Superintendent to provide adequate and security in judicial custody.The directions came on an application filed by Khalid seeking adequate security in prison so that he was not harmed by anyone in judicial custody.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-umar-khalid-tells-court-hes-in-sort-of-solitary-confinement-159518

Officials are searching my house. They are scared and trying to intimidate me so that I don’t disclose names of erring I-T officers and others who were involved in the scam. I have proof and I will disclose it soon,” Sarma told reporters.When contacted, Gujarat BJP spokesperson and media coordinator Prashant Vala told PTI that the party will comment on Sarma’s issue at an appropriate time.Surat BJP president Nitin Bhajiawala also refused to comment on the matter.“I do not want to comment at this point,” he told PTI.On Wednesday, Sarma in a tweet claimed the I-T department’s investigation wing did not take into account the cash deposit of Rs 110 crore by a prominent jeweller after demonetisation and taxed the firm for an income of just Rs 84 lakh.He tagged his Twitter post to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.“Hon’ble PM shri @narendramodi ji, This is how idea of Demonetisation defeated by the corrupt. Cash deposit is Rs 110 cr, income Rs 0.84 cr & tax Rs 0.80 cr. IT(Inv)wing closed eyes & Settlement Commission accepted illogical arguments & caused huge revenue loss.@PMOIndia @FinMinIndia,” Sarma tweeted.Alleging that some I-T officers, jewellers and CAs were involved in money laundering during demonetisation, Sarma said he will disclose the names of culprits in coming days.

22-10-2020||New Delhi||Himalayas poised for a series of big earthquakes, says study||The entire Himalayan arc is poised to produce a sequence of great earthquakes, and the next big quake—of the magnitude of 8 or above—may occur during our lifetimes, according to a study reviewing geological, historical, and geophysical data.The human toll of such an event in the densely populated countries across the arc is likely to be unprecedented, the researchers said.The study notes that the sequence of future Himalayan earthquakes could be similar to the great earthquakes that occurred in the twentieth century along the Aleutian subduction zone, which extends from the Gulf of Alaska to Kamchatka in Russian Far East.The review, which appeared in the journal Seismological Research Letters in August, used basic geological principles—stratigraphic analysis, structural analysis, soils analysis, and radiocarbon analysis—to estimate the size and timing of prehistoric earthquakes and evaluate future risk."The entire Himalayan arc extending from the eastern boundary of Arunachal Pradesh (India) in the east to Pakistan (in the west) has in the past been the source of great earthquakes," study author Steven G. Wesnousky told PTI."These earthquakes will occur again and scientifically, it would not be a surprise if the next great earthquake occurred in our lifetimes. But the resolution of our studies is at best on the order of 100 years, longer than a human lifetime," said Wesnousky, a professor of geology and seismology and director of the Center for Neotectonic Studies at the University of Nevada at Reno, US.Seismologist Supriyo Mitra noted that the research matches previous studies."The research is a comprehensive review of paleoseismological studies of past Himalayan earthquakes and a forecast of the future events based on the findings," said Mitra, a professor in the department of Earth sciences at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata."The Himalayan faults, as shown in the paper, are poised to produce an 8-plus magnitude earthquake. So yes, we are staring at a big one in the future. How far from now no one can tell," Mitra, who was not involved in the study, told PTI.Prior studies have examined the rate of strain accumulation that is occurring along the Himalayan arc from satellite observations.In the latest study, the timing and size of most recent prehistoric earthquakes were defined from geology.The methodology directly applies geologic principles to defining the past size and timing of earthquakes recorded by sediments broken and deformed by earthquake offsets at sites along the length of the Himalayan Frontal Thrust, Wesnousky said.Satellites can help in finding the location of active earthquake faults but unable to provide any information on the past timing and size of earthquakes on those faults, he said."These observations taken together are telling us that sufficient strain has accumulated along virtually the entire arc to again produce great earthquakes as we observe in the geologic record," Wesnousky explained.Major cities along and close to the Himalayan frontal thrust include Chandigarh and Dehradun in India; and Kathmandu, Nepal.Strong and damaging shaking in such great quakes could extend southward as far as India's capital, Delhi, one of the largest cities in the world with a population of more than 11 million, Wesnousky added.North India has witnessed many earthquakes of small magnitude in the past four months, raising popular speculation about a big one in the region.However, he said, scientists have yet to find a systematic relationship between the occurrence of small earthquakes and the timing of greater earthquakes in the future."These small earthquakes are thousands of times smaller than the great earthquakes we are studying," he said.

22-10-2020||Kolkata||Modi invokes Durga to reaffirm commitment to women's safety, empowerment||Invoking Goddess Durga, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday reaffirmed his government's irrevocable commitment to women's empowerment and safety.Reaching out to the people of West Bengal during the state's biggest festival Durga Puja, the PM said though it was being celebrated on a limited scale due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the "enthusiasm is still unlimited".Noting that Goddess Durga is worshipped as a symbol of 'Shakti' (strength), Modi said his government is consistently working for the empowerment of women."From opening Jan Dhan accounts for 22 crore women, giving soft loans to them under the Mudra Yojana, to launching Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao initiative, granting permanent commission to women in the armed forces and extending maternity leave from 12 to 26 weeks, we have taken a number of steps for their empowerment," he told a gathering at the Durga Puja celebration organised by the BJP.He said anti-rape laws were made more stringent to include death penalty."We are alert towards the security of women. We have strengthened laws against rape. Now, there is even provision for death penalty to the perpetrators," he said in his virtual address to the people of the state.In Bengal, Goddess Durga is also worshipped as a daughter, he said, adding that women must be treated with respect.The Prime Minister's remark came in the backdrop of a string of incidents of rape and murder of women, including the Hathras incident, that shocked the nation and triggered outrage against the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh.The Prime Minister recalled the contributions of reformers from Bengal like Rammohun Roy and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, spiritual leaders Ramkrishna Paramhans and Swami Vivekananda, cultural giant Rabindranath Tagore, and revolutionaries like Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Syama Prasad Mookerjee and Khudiram Bose in shaping India's national identity.Durga Puja, he said, is the epitome of pluralism and reflected the collective strength of India.“I feel blessed to be a part of Durga Puja celebration on Mahashashti...This time we are all celebrating Durga Puja amid the coronavirus crisis. Devotees of Maa Durga, organisers of pandals, all have shown amazing restraint. The numbers may have been affected, but the grandeur is the same, the divinity is the same," Modi said.Beginning his address in Bengali, Modi shared his puja greetings and appealed to the people to adhere to social distancing norms (do gaz ki duri) and wear face masks while taking part in the festivities.“There is so much power in the devotion to Goddess Durga here that it seems I am not in Delhi but amongst you in Bengal,” Modi said.Speaking about the development schemes of his government for the people of the state, Modi said under the Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana pucca dwellings were built for about 30 lakh poor families."About 90 lakh poor women have been given free gas connections under the Ujjwala scheme. Bank accounts of about four crore poor of Bengal have been opened through Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana. Under the Jal Jeevan Mission Scheme, clean piped water will be delivered to about four lakh households," he said.Listing out various developmental projects for the state, Modi said Rs 8,500 crore had been approved for Kolkata’s East-West Metro project.Noting that the Union government had adopted the mantra of Purvodaya for the development of eastern India, the Prime Minister said West Bengal had to play an important role in its success and reach the objective of Sonar Bangla (Bengal made of gold).Atmanirbhar (self-reliant) Bharat is a key component of the government's growth plans, he said."For Bengal's infrastructure, continuous work is being done to improve connectivity. The Centre has adopted the mantra of Purvodaya- the rise of east. We have been taking decisions for the development of eastern India."West Bengal has to play an important role in Mission Purvodaya. I am confident that West Bengal will soon become the hub of this mission," he said.We have to move forward with the mantra of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas’, the Prime Minister asserted.The BJP had made elaborate arrangements for live viewing of the PM's virtual address from the national capital.Apart from the event venue in Salt Lake, where the West Bengal BJP has organised Durga Puja for the first time, his speech was streamed live across 10 selected pandals spread across districts.The event was televised live at over 78,000 polling booths across the state's 294 assembly constituencies.Assembly polls are likely in West Bengal around April-May next year.After decades of its limited presence in the politically polarised state, the BJP emerged as the main rival to the ruling Trinamool Congress winning 18 of the state's 42 Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 general election.With the BJP's political clout growing manifold in the last few years in the state, where it has never been in power, its leaders have expressed confidence that the saffron party will end Mamata Banerjee's 10-year rule in the assembly polls.

22-10-2020||New Delhi||SC doing its part to deal with stubble burning, Centre and states have to do theirs: Delhi HC||The Supreme Court is already doing its part to deal with stubble burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana and now the Centre and the state governments have to do their bit, the Delhi High Court said  on Thursday.The court made this observation while declining to entertain a plea seeking immediate steps to prevent stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana on the grounds that it would aggravate COVID-19 related problems.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan said the apex court on October 16 constituted a committee headed by its former judge, Justice M B Lokur, to monitor the steps taken by these states to prevent stubble burning.The high court further said that if it too hears the same issue, then there would be a danger of contradictory orders being passed.With the observation, the bench disposed of the application which was moved by Sudhir Mishra, an advocate, in his main PIL filed in 2015 seeking directions to the Centre to take immediate steps to control increasing air pollution in the national capital.The application had contended that stubble burning would increase the air pollution drastically in the national capital and could further aggravate the health problems in the city in view of the coronavirus pandemic.     The high court, however, gave liberty to Mishra to approach it in the future in case of any necessity or difficulty.During the hearing, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma said the sun was not visible on Thursday and it was an emergency like situation in the national capital due to the poor air quality.The ASG also referred to a news report which stated that people who have recovered from COVID were facing respiratory problems as the air quality worsened in the national capital region and were flocking to the hospitals.He said that according to the news report the situation has arisen as the lungs of people who recovered from COVID were badly damaged due to the infection.The high court said that “it was for the Union and the states to take steps to address the issue of stubble burning and poor air quality”.It further said that “the apex court was doing its part and now the governments have to do theirs”.The top court on October 16 constituted the committee to monitor the steps taken by the neighbouring states to prevent stubble burning.It also ordered deployment of National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Service Scheme (NSS) and Bharat Scouts and Guides for assisting in the monitoring of stubble burning in the agricultural fields of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi-NCR, saying all it wants is that “people of Delhi-NCR can breathe fresh air without any pollution”.The apex court also directed the court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) and chief secretaries of Delhi and the three states to assist the Lokur panel to enable physical surveillance of fields where stubble is burnt.

22-10-2020||Mumbai||Rescinded order to ensure CBI not misused: Maharashtra Home Minister||A day after the state government withdrew “general consent” given to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe cases in the state, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the step was taken to ensure that the Central agency is not misused for political purpose.“CBI will need Maharashtra governments permission henceforth (to operate in the state). It can’t carry out investigation here in Mumbai till we issue permission,” the minister told reporters on Thursday.Maharashtra government on Wednesday withdrew general consent given to the agency to probe cases in the state, a day after CBI took over a case registered by UP Police against “unknown” channels and persons over alleged fudging of TRPs.The move follows apprehension in the state government that the CBI would take over a similar case on alleged fudging of TRPs in Maharashtra in a bid to move it away from the purview of Mumbai police.Deshmukh referred to the apprehension, saying the government wanted to avoid such a thing happening.The CBI was formed as per Delhi Police Establishment Act, Deshmukh said.The state Home Department’s order issued on Wednesday said: “In exercise of the powers conferred by section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, the government of Maharashtra hereby withdraws the consent accorded to the Members of the Delhi Special Police Establishment vide Government Order dated 22nd February 1989.”“CBI had been given a free pass by the earlier government. We have withdrawn it. We thought about political scores being settled through CBI. So we have withdrawn the permission granted earlier to avoid such a thing happening,” he said.“Earlier, CBI had taken up the investigation in some cases. We are concerned about the use of CBI to intervene in the ongoing TRP scam and hence Maharashtra decided to withdraw its permission,” the minister said.Deshmukh said a Supreme Court judge had a few years ago described CBI as the “government’s parrot”, adding: “We want to avoid it happening now.”After registering an FIR on October 6, Mumbai police had claimed that three channels, including Republic TV, were prima facie involved in manipulating TRPs. Republic TV had subsequently approached the Bombay High Court, where its counsel had asked for the case to be transferred to the CBI.

Will the ElectionCommission rap her & her shameless Govt on the knuckles? https://t.co/ri1UlWWmgD  Taking a swipe, main rival RJD said the vaccine belongs to the country, not the BJP.  Interestingly, the CM face of ‘mahagathbandhan’, Tejashwi Yadav, also had a point about Sitharaman releasing the vision document, terming it a clear case of lack of BJP leadership in Bihar.Read more: Palaniswami assures free COVID-19 vaccine to Tamil Nadu peopleThe election document was unveiled by Sitharaman and senior leaders, including Bhupender Yadav, Nityanand Rai, Ashwini Choubey and Ravi Shankar Prasad. Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, who has tested positive for the coronavirus disease, is admitted in AIIMS-Patna.Countering the criticism on vaccine promise, BJP’s IT cell in charge Amit Malviya said not just Bihar, the Centre will provide vaccines to all states at nominal cost and it was up to the state to decide whether to give it for free or not since health is a state subject. “BJP’s manifesto promises free COVID-19 vaccine. Like all programs, the Centre will provide vaccines to states at a nominal rate. It is for the state governments to decide if they want to give it free or otherwise. Health being a state subject, Bihar BJP has decided to give it free. Simple,” Malviya said reacting to the criticism.By promising free vaccination for Covid in its election manifesto BJP has again proved that it's more dangerous than virus.A which don't treat it's people equally has no right to rule the country.Shame on the cheap ideology of BJP.  Coming a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi hits the campaign trail in the state, the BJP’s manifesto speaks about his vision of making ‘Atmanirbhar Bihar’ and goes with the tagline “BJP hai to bharosa hai” , emphasising on  trust enjoyed by him among  masses by virtue of pro-people measures such as the Jan Dhan scheme, the Ujjwala Yojana, etc.According to the surveys, while Nitish Kumar appears to be losing ground, the Prime Minister continues to sway masses in politically-sensitive Bihar. Sitharaman said the party believes in “fulfilling poll promises”. “As soon as the COVID-19 vaccine will be available for production at a mass scale, every person in Bihar will get free vaccination. This is the first promise mentioned in our poll manifesto,” she added.Indian minister quoting her party (BJP ) manifesto promises free #COVID19 #vaccine to each person from Bihar state which is going to polls; sparking concerns about whether a vaccine will be used as a political tool, rather than reaching those on frontline, and most at risk, first https://t.co/S3L4bWReLm  Requesting voters to extend support to the NDA CM candidate Nitish Kumar, she said: “Bihar is a politically-sensitive state. Here, people cannot be fobbed off with empty promises. Claims made by parties are likely to be weighed against their past track record. This is where the BJP scores.”Apart from free vaccination for coronavirus and recruitment of teachers in primary, secondary and higher educational institutions, the BJP also proposed to develop the state into an IT hub with a promise of five lakh jobs in the sector.The document also promised employment in the health sector which is in for a major facelift through projects like the AIIMS at Darbhanga.Other promises include self-reliance for one crore women through microfinance, ‘pucca’ houses for 30 lakh people and boost to fisheries, dairy sector and production of maize, fruits, vegetables, betel leaves, honey and makhana, etc., through farm producer organisations and introducing Hindi as a medium of instruction for medical, engineering and other technical courses.BJP’s manifesto promises free Covid vaccine. Like all programs, center will provide vaccines to states at a nominal rate. It is for the state Govts to decide if they want to give it free or otherwise.

22-10-2020||New Delhi||Contract of insurance is of utmost good faith, says SC||A contract of insurance is of “utmost good faith” and a proposer who seeks to obtain life insurance policy is duty-bound to disclose all material facts bearing upon the issue, the Supreme Court has said.The apex court said this while setting aside the March verdict of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) which had dismissed the plea of an insurance firm against the order asking it to pay full death claim along with interest to the mother of the deceased.A bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud noted that the proposal form requires a specific disclosure of pre-existing ailments, so as to enable the insurer to arrive at a considered decision based on the actuarial risk.“A contract of insurance is one of utmost good faith. A proposer who seeks to obtain a policy of life insurance is duty-bound to disclose all material facts bearing upon the issue as to whether the insurer would consider it appropriate to assume the risk which is proposed,” said the bench, also comprising Justices Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee.The bench delivered its judgement on an appeal filed by the insurance firm against the NCDRC's verdict which had rejected its plea against the state's CDRC order in the matter.While setting aside the NCDRC's order, the bench noted the proposer had failed to disclose that he was suffering from pre-existing illness and also about vomiting of blood which had taken place barely a month prior to the issuance of policy.“The investigation by the insurer indicated that the assured was suffering from a pre-existing ailment, consequent upon alcohol abuse and that the facts which were in the knowledge of the proposer had not been disclosed,” it said.“We are, therefore, of the view that the judgment of the NCDRC in the present case does not lay down the correct principle of law and would have to be set aside. We order accordingly,” it said.The counsel appearing for the insurance firm informed the apex court that during the pendency of proceedings, the entire claim was paid over to the nominee, except the amount of cost.“Having regard to the age of the respondent (mother of deceased), who is 70 years old and the death of the assured on whom she was likely to be dependent, we are of the view that it would be appropriate for this court to utilise its jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution, by directing that no recoveries of the amount which has been paid shall be made from the respondent,” it said.In August 2014, a proposal for obtaining insurance policy was submitted by the man and the form contained questions pertaining to his health, medical history and required a specific disclosure on whether any ailment, hospitalisation or treatment had been undergone by him.The proposer had answered these queries in the negative, indicating that he had not undergone any medical treatment or hospitalisation and was not suffering from any ailment.Based on the information provided by the man, an insurance policy was issued. Later in September 2014, he died following which a claim was lodged.During independent investigation, the hospital treatment records were obtained and it revealed that he had been suffering from hepatitis C.The insurance firm had repudiated the claim in May 2015 on account of non-disclosure of material facts.The nominee had initiated a consumer complaint before the district consumer disputes redressal forum which had directed the insurance firm to pay full death claim together with interest.The appeal against the order was rejected by the state consumer disputes redressal commission and later the NCDRC also dismissed the plea of the insurance firm.

22-10-2020||Islamabad||Pakistan parliamentary panel approves govt’s bill to seek review of Jadhav’s conviction||A Pakistani parliamentary panel has approved a government bill that seeks a review of the conviction of death-row prisoner Kulbhushan Jadhav, complying with the directives of the International Court of Justice, according to a media report on Thursday.The draft bill titled “the International Court of Justice (Review and Reconsideration) Ordinance” was discussed and approved by the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Law and Justice on Wednesday despite stiff resistance from the Opposition.Taking part in the debate, Federal Minister for Law and Justice Farogh Naseem said the bill had been introduced in compliance with directives of the International Court of Justice (ICJ).He warned that in case the bill was not adopted by Parliament, Pakistan could face sanctions for not complying with the ICJ’s verdict.Fifty-year-old retired Indian Navy officer Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017.In 2017, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence handed to him by a military court.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.However, the committee’s members from the Opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) requested its chairman Riaz Fatyana to reject the bill, the Dawn reported.However, Fatyana, who belongs to the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), decided to settle the matter through voting. He also tried to stop two PTI members from leaving the hall before voting.Eight members voted in favour of the bill, while five opposed it, the report said. The Opposition members termed the bill as NRO for Jadhav.The NRO is the National Reconciliation Ordinance, which former president and military dictator Gen (retd) Pervez Musharraf offered to the-then exiled political leadership and under which several corruption cases against different politicians were dropped.Aliya Kamran of the JUI-F accused the government of misleading the country’s establishment, saying that they are not here to legislate for Jadhav and the bill should be presented before the public and bar associations for a public debate.“The legislation is unnecessary since the judgement of former chief justice of Pakistan Nasirul Mulk has already said the constitutional courts can review the judgements of the military courts,” Kamran said.Syed Naveed Qamar of the PPP said that through the legislation, the government was trying to give Jadhav relief of appeal against the sentence of a military court which is not even available to a Pakistani citizen.This is tantamount to giving an NRO to Jadhav and “we oppose this bill”, he said.The Law Minister said his ministry had sought to pre-empt a possible Indian move of filing a contempt petition against Pakistan in the ICJ by promulgating the said ordinance.In such a scenario, the country could face sanctions if the matter was referred to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), he said.The minister pointed out that neither India nor Jadhav had filed a petition before the Islamabad High Court to seek relief permissible under the ICJ verdict.Subsequently, the law ministry had to file a petition for the appointment of a lawyer for Jadhav which is pending adjudication.A Pakistani court was informed on October 6 that India failed to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav in the case of the review of his death sentence by a military court in this country.Earlier, Pakistan had again rejected India’s demand that an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s counsel should be appointed for Jadhav to ensure a free and fair trial in the case.On October 8, India said that Pakistan has failed to address the core issues in Jadhav’s case and pressed for an “unimpeded, unconditional and unhindered” consular access to him as ordered by the ICJ.“The core issues need to be addressed if we have to have effective review and reconsideration as ordered by the international court of justice. Pakistan must show its intention to deliver on the core issues,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said.

22-10-2020||Hyderabad||Former Telangana home minister Narasimha Reddy dead||Senior TRS leader and former home minister of Telangana Nayani Narasimha Reddy died here on Thursday. He was 76.Reddy, who served as the first home minister of Telangana after it’s formation in 2014, had been undergoing treatment at a private super-speciality hospital here for post-COVID complications with lung damage and the end came at 12.25 am, hospital sources said.Reddy, a senior trade union leader in Hyderabad, had played an active role in the separate Telangana agitation.He was elected to the Legislative Assembly in undivided Andhra Pradesh for three terms in 1978, 1985 and 2004.Reddy had served as a minister in the government of late YS Rajasekhara Reddy when TRS, then an ally of Congress, joined the government in 2004.Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Wednesday visited the private hospital, where Narasimha Reddy was being treated, and enquired about his health condition.Rao, who recalled his association with Reddy during the separate Telangana agitation and in the government, expressed grief over death of the senior leader, an official release said.The Chief Minister directed that the funeral of Narasimha Reddy be conducted with official honours, it said.Several TRS leaders, state BJP president and MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar, state Congress president and MP N Uttam Kumar Reddy condoled the death of Narasimha Reddy.

22-10-2020||United Nations||India recorded export growth of 4 per cent in September: UN||Export growth declined in India in the third quarter of 2020 relative to the same quarter last year but picked up pace in September, according to a global trade update by the UN.The UNCTAD's new global trade update said that global trade recorded a 5 per cent drop in the third quarter of 2020 compared with the same period last year. This marks an improvement on the 19 per cent year-on-year plunge recorded in the second quarter, and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) expects the frail recovery to continue in the fourth quarter.India's export growth saw a decline of 6.1 per cent in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to third quarter of last year. However, India recorded export growth of four per cent in September, it said.Depending on how the COVID-19 pandemic evolves in the winter months, the UN trade and development body expects the value of global trade to contract by 7 per cent to 9 per cent with respect to 2019."The uncertain course of the pandemic will continue aggravating trade prospects in the coming months," UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said."Despite some 'green shoots' we can't rule out a slowdown in production in certain regions or sudden increases in restrictive policies."  Although a 7 per cent to 9 per cent decrease would be a negative finish for the year, Kituyi said it's a much more positive result than was expected in June, when the UNCTAD had projected a 20 per cent year-on-year drop for 2020.Since then, trade trends have improved primarily thanks to the earlier-than-expected resumption of economic activities in Europe and east Asia, it said.The UNCTAD said the sharp and widespread decline in international trade in Q2 2020 was similar for developing and developed countries. But exports from developing economies appear to be recovering faster.Year-on-year growth of developing nations' exports improved from -17 per cent in the second quarter to -6 per cent in July, while those from developed nations increased from -22 per cent to -14 per cent. South-South trade – commerce among developing countries – has shown some resilience, with the year-on-year decline sitting at 8 per cent in July, up from 16 per cent in the second quarter.The report's assessment of trade in different sectors said that the pandemic had hit the energy and automotive industries the hardest, while mitigation responses, including tele-working and personal protection measures, had led to strong growth in sectors such as communication equipment, office machinery, and textiles and apparel.UNCTAD's analysis gives special attention to COVID-19 medical supplies, which include personal protective equipment, disinfectants, diagnostic kits, oxygen respirators and other related hospital equipment.According to the report, exports of COVID-19 medical supplies from China, the European Union and the United States rose from about USD 25 billion to USD 45 billion per month between January and May 2020.The increase in such trade, however, has primarily benefited wealthier nations, with middle- and low-income countries largely priced out from access to COVID-19 supplies, the report says.The UNCTAD warns that if a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available, the access divide between residents in wealthy and poor countries could be even more drastic.While some low-income countries have the capacity to locally manufacture some protective equipment, this may not be the case for vaccines, which require stronger manufacturing and logistics capacities.The report calls on governments, the private sector and philanthropic sources to continue mobilising additional funds to fight the COVID-19 pandemic in developing countries and to support financial mechanisms, such as the global COVAX initiative, to provide safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to poor countries.

22-10-2020||Washington||US proposes not to issue business visas for H-1B speciality occupations||The State Department has proposed not to issue temporary business visas for H-1B speciality occupations which allowed several companies to send their technology professionals for a short stay to complete jobs on site in the US, a move which could affect hundreds of Indians.The proposal, if finalised, will eliminate any misconception that the "B-1 in lieu of H policy" provides an alternative avenue for foreign professionals to enter the US to perform skilled labour that allows, and potentially even encourages, them and their employers to circumvent the restrictions and requirements relating to the H non-immigrant classification established by Congress to protect the US workers, the State Department said.The move, made public on Wednesday, less than two weeks ahead of the November 3 presidential election, is likely to impact several Indian companies which send their technology professionals on B-1 visas for a short stay to complete jobs on site in the US.On December 17, 2019, the Attorney General of California announced a USD 800,000 settlement against Infosys Limited to resolve allegations that approximately 500 Infosys employees worked in the state on Infosys-sponsored B-1 visas rather than H-1B visas, the State Department said."The proposed changes and the resulting transparency would reduce the impact of foreign labour on the US workforce of aliens performing activities in a speciality occupation without the procedural protections attendant to the H-1B classification," it said.In its federal notification issued on Wednesday, the State Department said the US architecture firm seeking protection from rising labour costs in the country might believe it could lay off its US architects and contract for the same professional architectural services to be provided by a foreign architecture firm.If the foreign firm sought H-1B visas for its architects, it would be required to pay the prevailing wage for architects in the area of intended employment in the United States, presumably the same wage the US architects had been paid, and meet the other requirements enacted by the Congress to protect US workers.But under the B-1 in lieu of H policy, the foreign architects could ostensibly seek B-1 visas and travel to the US to fill a temporary need for architecture services, as long as they retained a residence in the foreign country and continued to receive a salary, perhaps significantly lower than what is customary for US architects, dispersed abroad by the foreign firm (or under the auspices of a foreign parent or subsidiary), the State Department said.Under the Department's guidance, visas could be issued for multiple architects planning temporary work in the US in certain situations. However, a foreign employer may succeed in undermining the US immigration law and policy by rotating architects between the US and the foreign country to effectively fill the position of one US architect at a significantly lower cost, the notification said."If the architects who intended to perform skilled labour were "of distinguished merit and ability... seeking to perform (temporary architectural services) of an exceptional nature requiring such merit and ability, one might argue the current regulatory language suggests this type of labour is a permissible basis for B-1 non-immigrant visa issuance," the State Department said.This potential outcome is harmful to the US workers and contrary to the policies of the Trump administration, it said.The State Department said the application process for a B-1 visa does not include similar procedural requirements to protect the US workers like that of H-1B visas.Also, the fees for the B-1 visas are far less than that of H-1B visas.While Congress required H-1B employers to pay significant fees to fund assistance to the US workforce as well as prevention and detection of fraud related to skilled labour, employers are not required to pay comparable fees to employ skilled workers under the B-1 in lieu of H policy, it said.According to the notification, the State Department estimates that this proposal will affect not more than 6,000 to 8,000 foreign workers per year, specifically aliens intending to provide services in a speciality occupation in the US.As per its estimate, up to 28 per cent of the approximately 8,000 annual B-1 visa issuances under the B-1 in lieu of H policy were to foreign workers who applied for a visa to perform services in a speciality occupation for a small entity in the US.

More recently, the National Clean Air Programme has spurred action on major air pollution sources, says the global survey.More than half of the deaths were associated with outdoor PM 2.5 and others were linked to the use of solid fuels, such as charcoal, wood, and animal dung, for cooking. Long-term exposure to outdoor and household air pollution contributed to over 1.67 million annual deaths from stroke, heart attack, diabetes, lung cancer, chronic lung diseases, and neonatal diseases in India in 2019. Overall, air pollution is now the leading cause of death among all health risks, says the study. The report highlights the ongoing challenge of high outdoor air pollution.May aggravate Covid, says reportAlthough the link between air pollution and Covid-19 is not yet known, there is clear evidence to suggest that air pollution leads to heart and lung diseases, raising concern that exposure to high levels of air pollution during the winter in South Asian countries and East Asia could exacerbate the effects of Covid-19, according to the report.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bad-air-killed-1-16-lakh-infants-in-india-last-yr-159230

The Supreme Court has decided to examine the issue in view of divergent verdicts delivered by it. Admitting an appeal arising out of a judgment of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, a three-judge Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud issued notice in the case.Complainants Manu Solanki and others had accused Vinayaka Mission University of deficiency in service and unfair trade practice by inducing them to get admitted in an unrecognised offshore programme (dental course) in 2005-2006 consisting of two-year study in Thailand and two-and-a-half-year study in the university. The programme was neither affiliated with the university nor recognised by the Dental Council of India, they alleged.The complainants were aggrieved by the national consumer commission’s decision that said educational institutions didn’t impart services and hence the consumer courts didn’t have jurisdiction to entertain complaints against them. The judgment was based on the Supreme Court’s decision in Anupama College of Engineering versus Gulshan Kumar in which it was said educational institutions didn’t render service.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-to-see-if-education-centres-fall-under-consumer-act-159236
