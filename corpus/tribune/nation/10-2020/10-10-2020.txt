Strict action as per law will be taken against those involved,” he said.Asked about the photograph, he said the image shows July 17, 2020, as the date when it was clicked.A show-cause notice has been issued to Mohan under the Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act’s provision, governing removal of the vice-president and appropriate action would be taken, he said.Rajeswari, when asked why she had not complained earlier, said she initially tolerated the vice president’s behaviour, but decided to lodge a complaint now when his ill treatment intensified.Only the vice-president hoisted the national flag and she was not allowed to do so (during important occasions), she alleged.Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar said it was ‘barbaric’ and promised tough action as per law.The AIADMK government had all along given due respect and recognition for the marginalised people, including Scheduled Castes and Tribes, he said.MDMK general secretary Vaiko said such humiliation was outrageous, while DMK MP Kanimozhi said it was strongly condemnable and the leaders demanded tough action.Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi Thol Thirumavalavan demanded the immediate arrest of those involved for obstructing the official work of the panchayat president.Not only Theruku Thittai, the scenario was the same in several other villages, the VCK leader alleged and urged the government to review the situation and take appropriate remedial action.Meanwhile, cadres of VCK and Left outfits gathered in front of the Buvanagiri police station in the district, demanding the arrest of the vice president and secretary.The incident comes months after a woman Dalit panchayat president in Tiruvallur district was not allowed to unfurl the national flag on Independence Day.She did so later following the intervention of district authorities.

10-10-2020||New Delhi||CSIR, KPIT conduct successful trial runs of hydrogen fuel cell prototype car||The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and KPIT Technologies successfully ran trials of India's first Hydrogen Fuel Cell (HFC) prototype car running on an indigenously developed fuel cell stack, a statement said on Saturday.The HFC technology uses chemical reactions between hydrogen and oxygen (from air) to generate electrical energy, eliminating the use of fossil fuels.Further, the fuel cell technology emits only water, thus cutting down the emission of harmful greenhouse gases along with other air pollutants.The fuel cell is a low-temperature PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) type that operates at 65-75 degrees Celsius, which is suitable for vehicular applications.The CSIR and the KPIT have developed a 10 kWe (Kilowatt-electric) automotive grade LT-PEMFC (low-temperature PEM fuel cell) stack based on the CSIR's know-how."The heart of the PEM fuel cell technology includes the membrane electrode assembly, which is wholly a CSIR know-how."KPIT brought in their expertise in stack engineering which included light-weight metal bipolar plate and gasket design, development of the balance of plant (BoP), system integration, control software and electric powertrain that enabled running the fuel cell vehicle,” read the statement.“The fuel cell stack uses extremely thin metal bipolar plates, thus reducing the stack weight by about two-thirds," it added.In 2016, National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), Pune, and Central Electro Chemical Research Institute (CECRI), Karaikudi – both CSIR labs – as part of the Industry Originated Project (IOP) category of the New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative (NMITLI) scheme partnered with the KPIT for the development of an automotive grade PEM Fuel Cell technology."The HFC technology, with further adoption and use, is poised to make the world a cleaner place with reduced air pollution levels," read the statement.The trials were run on a battery-electric passenger car platform retrofitted with the fuel cell stack.However, it is expected that the technology is more suited for commercial vehicles (CV) such as buses and trucks. Battery electric buses/trucks require a large battery to achieve the desired operating range.In comparison, HFC technology requires a much smaller battery for a very large operating range. Hence, HFC technology offers more promise for the commercial vehicle segment, said the statement."The FC vehicle is fitted with a Type III commercial hydrogen tank. Its capacity is around 1.75 Kg of H2 stored at about 350 bar pressure and the FC vehicle should run for approximately 250 km range under typical Indian road conditions at moderate speed of 60-65 kmph."The entire fuel cell stack and its associated components with the powertrain were retro-fitted in a standard 5-seater sedan car," the statement added.KPIT Chairman Ravi Pandit said the technology had a great future and owing to its indigenous development, was expected to be more commercially viable than ever before.CSIR-NCL Director Ashwini Kumar Nangia said the time had come for renewable energy based on hydrogen as fuel to power transportation in the country.This will reduce the petrol and diesel import bill, while hydrogen is the cleanest fuel with water as the only by-product.

10-10-2020||New Delhi||Any peace deal with Taliban will not be detrimental to national security of India: Abdullah Abdullah||Any peace deal with the Taliban “will not and should not be detrimental” to the national security of any country including India, and it is for New Delhi to decide whether to engage with the militant outfit, top Afghan peace negotiator Abdullah Abdullah said on Saturday.In an interview to PTI, Abdullah, the chairman of the powerful High Council for National Reconciliation, also dispelled India’s apprehensions that a prominent role for the Taliban as part of a possible outcome to the ongoing intra-Afghan peace talks could be detrimental to its strategic interests.“It is not in our interests if any terrorist group has any foothold in Afghanistan. The agreement should be one which is acceptable to people of Afghanistan. It should be dignified, sustainable and durable,” Abdullah said.The influential Afghan leader also said if a peace deal is struck with Taliban, then all other terror groups “freelancing in mountains and deserts of Afghanistan and launching attacks on us or any other nation” will have to cease their activities.“Peaceful settlement will not be and should not be detrimental to any country’s national security including India. India is a country which has helped Afghanistan, contributed to Afghanistan. It is a friend of Afghanistan,” he said.There have been apprehensions in New Delhi that Pakistan might leverage its influence over the Taliban to step up cross-border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir if the militant group regains political prominance after a possible peace deal between it and the Afghan government.Abdullah arrived here on Tuesday on a five-day visit as part of his efforts to build a regional consensus and support for the historic Afghan peace process. During his stay, he briefed Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the peace talks, and held meetings with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.Asked whether he got any indication of India’s willingness to engage with the Taliban, Abdullah said, “Personally, I encourage engagement of India in the peace process. I did not make the suggestion. It is for India to decide how to engage with a group or not engage with a group. I did not pursue it.”The Taliban and the Afghan government are holding direct talks, aimed at ending decades of war that has killed tens of thousands of people and ravaged various parts of Afghanistan.Abdullah said people of Afghanistan are yearning for peace and stability and they will not allow terrorism to sustain.“If somebody thinks that because of other circumstances in Afghanistan including withdrawal of the US troops, there might be a situation where one side may take advantage of it, temporarily something might happen. But that will put the will of that side to a big test if that is the calculation. Because that is a miscalculation, that will be a miscalculation. That is not in our interest,” he said.India has also been maintaining that care should be taken to ensure that any such process does not lead to any “ungoverned spaces” where terrorists and their proxies can relocate.India has been calling upon all sections of the political spectrum in Afghanistan to work together to meet the aspirations of all people in that country including those from the minority community for a prosperous and safe future.India has been a major stakeholder in the peace and stability of Afghanistan. It has already invested USD two billion in aid and reconstruction activities in the country.The Afghan leader said he is taking back the message of support and commitment to the peace process from India.“Lot of time and energy was spent to find the best way forward,” he said on his talks with Indian leaders.India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.On September 12, an Indian delegation attended the inaugural ceremony of the intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha while S Jaishankar joined it through a video conference.On whether there is a possibility of Beijing leaning on Islamabad to protect its security and connectivity interests in Afghanistan if the Taliban becomes a key influencer in Kabul, Abdullah said his country benefits from support from different countries including China which is an important country.India has been keenly following the evolving political situation after the US signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February. The deal provided for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, effectively drawing curtains to Washington’s 18-year war with Taliban in the country. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/any-peace-deal-with-taliban-will-not-be-detrimental-to-national-security-of-india-abdullah-abdullah-153838

10-10-2020||New Delhi||Post Galwan Valley clash, a different flavour to Taiwan’s 'National Day'||The Galwan Valley killings and the continuing tensions with China on the LAC have made a rarely mentioned word “Taiwan’’, a much used currency on social media. Indian netizens have vied to post “Happy Double Ten National Day celebrations” to commemorate the island’s separation from Beijing on October 10, 1949.In addition, for the first time, a Taiwan President mentioned India in her National Day speech and BJP supporters hung pro-Taiwan hoardings for the first time outside the Chinese embassy in the highly protected diplomatic enclave. Right-wing publications, in particular, approvingly noted this act by a BJP IT cell activist.China maintains that Taiwan will ultimately join the mainland and hence won’t allow any country to have normal diplomatic relations with Taipei under its “One China Policy”, which India adheres too. Hence, the Taiwanese representation here is in the form of a “trade centre” and the envoy is rarely asked to grace official events. A furious Beijing has inflated the number of hoardings in front of its embassy to hundreds and warned via Global Times that India’s provocation on the Taiwan question will cause an “irreversible” impact on China-India ties. The first-ever pro-Taiwan gesture in a diplomatic enclave means that Chinese diplomats here will now have to keep an eye for mischief from Tibetans as well as pro-Taiwan activists.Taiwan’s unusually high visibility on social media, mainly powered by Indians, caused Pradeep Taneja, an Australia-India Institute fellow, to comment,  “I have never seen so many foreigners sending their best wishes to the people of Taiwan on the Double Ten national day celebrations as this year. What has changed? Perhaps it is time for introspection in Beijing”.Hats off to friends from around the world this year, #India🇮🇳 in particular, for celebrating #TaiwanNationalDay. With your support, #Taiwan🇹🇼 will definitely be more resilient in meeting challenges, especially those "Get Lost" types. JW pic.twitter.com/VNwcHAhOuQ  An online spat between Indians and the Chinese government has been on since October 7, which was also briefly touched upon by the Ministry of External Affairs. The Chinese embassy here had e-mailed advice to journalists on “properly” reporting Taiwan’s National Day. Asked about this Chinese counsel, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said: “India had a free media which would report on such issues as it sees fit”.The MEA’s observation has provided more ballast to the hashtags #TaiwanisACountry and #TaiwanNationalDay.India has already indicated that it will not abide by Chinese rules for developing its ties with Taiwan after tensions enveloped the LAC. India has posted an upcoming diplomat Gaurang Das, who already has prestigious stints as Americas Desk chief and in the office of the National Security Advisor, in a signal that Indo-Taiwan ties will no longer be on the backburner.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/post-galwan-valley-clash-a-different-flavour-to-taiwans-national-day-153827

It has been estimated that by 2050, about 10 million human lives could be at risk every year if drug resistance is not managed.Various aspects of antimicrobial resistance were discussed in a two-day international webinar on antibiotic resistance jointly organised by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and American Society for Microbiology.The webinar was organised by Dr Rama Chaudhry, Professor and Head of AIIMS's Department of Microbiology, International Ambassador of American Society for Microbiology to India and her team – Dr Bimal Kumar Das, Dr Sarita Mohapatra, Dr Gagandeep Singh, Dr Hitender Gautam and Dr Nishant Verma.In the webinar, the health experts talked about how the Covid-19 pandemic has jolted the entire world and significantly impacted the focus of health facilities towards antimicrobial resistance."It has been estimated that as we reach the year 2050, about 10 million human lives could be at risk every year if we do not manage the increasing drug resistance. The widespread use of hand sanitisers and antimicrobial soaps which has especially increased multifold during the Covid-19 pandemic can worsen the situation," said the experts.They went on to say that antibiotic-resistant organisms have become rigidly established in our environment with many infections failing to respond to currently available antimicrobials. The antimicrobial resistance has outpaced the development of newer antimicrobials.The health experts added that there is an urgent need to explore the alternative therapies. "The importance of these non-conventional and alternative therapeutic approaches like bacteriophages, endolysins, nanoparticles, probiotics and antimicrobial peptides are needed."Antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest challenges of modern medicine.

10-10-2020||---||Opposition parties have ‘division’ in their DNA, alleges Adityanath||Lucknow, October 10Hitting out at the Opposition, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday alleged that “division is in the DNA” of these parties and they are trying to create a rift in society on caste and community lines.Addressing a virtual meeting of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s office-bearers as part of preparations for assembly by-election to Deoria Sadar assembly constituency, he alleged that due the development activities undertaken under the BJP rule, the opposition parties were frustrated and were using “every trick” to defame his government.By-elections will be held to seven Assembly seats, including Deoria, in Uttar Pradesh on November 3. Six of the seats were held by the ruling BJP and one by the SP.“The thought process of the rival parties is dirty and their intention is dangerous. Division is in their DNA. It was due to this thought process that they first divided the country, and are now attempting to divide the society on the basis of caste, community and region. For them, the interest of their clan is of utmost importance, while everything else is secondary,” Adityanath said, targeting the Congress and other rival parties.Raising the issue of development under the BJP, he said that “the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which have ruled the state for 15 years, have only corruption and anarchy to count as their achievement.“From time-to-time, these parties have throttled democracy and the Constitution. Their development was confined only to slogans and speeches.” The BJP leader said that the “actual development” started six years ago with the formation of the government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Owing to all-round development, the popularity of BJP is continuously rising, and there is a feeling of positivity in the public.”“In this case, the unhappiness of these (opposition) parties has transformed into frustration. As a result, they are trying to resort to every trick to defame the government. However, their intentions will never be fulfilled,” he said.Referring to the problem of encephalitis, the UP chief minister said that from 1977 to 2017, the disease had claimed the lives of more than 50,000 people, most of them children.“No one had ever raised their voice. In a span of only three years, we are on the way towards eradication of encephalitis,” he asserted.Referring to Deoria, Adityanath said, “The sacred land of Devraha Baba was known as the sugar bowl. The economy of the area was based on sugarcane. Ask them why in their tenure one after  another sugar mills wee old at throwaway prices.”      Devraha Baba, who died on June 19, 1990, was a  revered ascetic who lived beside the Yamuna river in Mathura. He was known as “ageless Yogi”.Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Swatantradev Singh also addressed party workers, a statement issued by the UP BJP said.The seven Assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh where bypolls will be held on November 3 include Naugaon which fell vacant after the death of minister Chetan Chauhan.The by-election was necessitated in Ghatampur (Kanpur) as sitting MLA and minister Kamal Rani Varun died, while in Tundla (Firozabad) the sitting MLA, SP Singh Baghel, got elected to Lok Sabha.The Bangarmau (Unnao) seat fell vacant following the conviction of  Kuldeep Singh Sengar.The seats of Bulandshahr, Deoria and Malhani will have by-election due to the demise of sitting MLAs Virendra Singh Sirohi, Janmejay Singh and Parasnath Yadav (SP).

10-10-2020||Patna||Ram Vilas Paswan, a man for all seasons in Indian politics, cremated in Patna||The mortal remains of Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, a man for all seasons and one of the tallest leaders spawned by the Dalit community, were consigned to flames in Patna on Saturday with full state honours.A sea of people could be seen, besides dignitaries led by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, at the cremation site on the banks of the Ganges in the city that has been a witness to the Lok Janshakti Party founders long journey - from a young MLA of the socialist party in the late 1960s to having served under six prime ministers.A large number of supporters had come to the Digha ghat from his pocket borough Hajipur, situated right across the river, which Paswan had nurtured since his Lok Sabha debut in 1977 when he won with a record margin.He gave up the seat for his younger brother Pashupati Kumar Paras last year and chose the Rajya Sabha route for re-entering Parliament.The sight of commoners standing chock a block, teary-eyed and eager to catch the last glimpse of their leader, unmindful of the threat posed by the COVID pandemic and reprimands of security personnel anxious to enforce social distancing, bore testimony to the popularity of the man, known as an “ajaat shatru” (one with no enemies) in the vicious politics of Bihar.Many climbed atop a steamer anchored nearby while an even larger number could be seen standing, precariously, on the decrepit embankment built along the river after they were thwarted by the administration from crowding the ghat.Paswan had breathed his last at a hospital in New Delhi on Thursday evening and his body was brought here on Friday.Dignitaries offered their tributes at the airport and also, later, at the Vidhan Sabha premises.The body was brought for the last rites to Janardan Ghat in the Digha locality in a massive procession from his residence in Shri Krishna Puri, about 3 km away.The bungalow of Paswan, who famously kept his doors open for all despite the high offices he held for much part of his political career, remained teeming with visitors, many of them common citizens whom the leader had helped with getting a job, getting a critically ill relative treated at a top medical facility, or with financial help which made the marriage of their daughters possible.Many also recalled the contributions made by Paswan as a minister - Hajipur becoming a zonal headquarters of the railways, mobile phones becoming affordable, and greater efficiency in the public distribution system that was crucial during the nationwide lockdown.The last rites were performed by Paswan’s son and political heir Chirag, who has taken a big gamble by deciding to plough a lonely furrow in the assembly elections that are days away.Amid deafening roars of “Ram Vilas Paswan amar rahein”, Chirag, in knee-high dhoti and a white sheet around his shoulders, lit the funeral pyre.Reena Paswan, who like her husband Ram Vilas was always a perfect host, watched the ceremony from a distance, the grief on her face concealed with her mask and a dupatta.The LJP founders other family members, who run the party affairs along with Chirag, too stood around the pyre and helped the son in completing the rituals.Derided by his opponents for being a “mausam vaigyanik” (weathercock), which nonetheless bore testimony to his astuteness in gauging the public mood, Paswan’s entry into politics was an instance of choosing adventure over the stagnation that often comes with security.“In 1969, I was elected as an MLA around the same time I qualified for the post of a Deputy Superintendent of Police.One of my friends asked me what would you like to become, a government servant or the government itself? Thus began my political journey,” Paswan had famously said.Journalists, with whom the Union minister had been a favourite, were unanimous in the belief “there will hardly be another one like him who remained without swagger despite enjoying so much power”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ram-vilas-paswan-a-man-for-all-seasons-in-indian-politics-cremated-in-patna-153807

He feels the matter pertains to the sentiments of people, and they should wait for the court verdict."The Sushant Singh Rajput and Rhea Chakraborty matter has been projected as a national issue but it is not a national issue. It is about an actor and his girlfriend who also happens to be an actor. It is not a national security issue that should be highlighted thus, and people hit the roads to protest against it. It is a matter related to people's sentiment," Jalota told IANS, at the sidelight of a media interaction in the city.The 67-year-old singer, popular as Bhajan Samrat, who joined BJP in 2004, added: "He (Sushant Singh Rajput) was a really good actor. I used to admire his work and I have met him on a few occasions. I feel connected to him but we shouldn't make his death a national issue. People related to him are trying to get justice for him, and I feel justice should be served as early as possible, and the truth should emerge."Jalota will be sharing screen space with his "Bigg Boss 12" housemate Jasleen Matharu in Kesar Matharu's film, "Woh Meri Student Hai".Earlier this week, a photograph of Jasleen and Jalota dressed in wedding attire went viral, raising speculations if marriage was on the cards for the two, or if they had already gotten married.

Whether Pakistan is helping China or China is helping Pakistan, we have no such indication,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a passing out-cum-attestation parade at the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry Regimental Centre on the outskirts of the city here.“But because of the CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor), there is the presence of China in Pakistan. The military cooperation in terms of equipment is there, but we are not seeing any tactical help,” he said.According to the reports, the construction work for the installation of surface-to-air missile defence system is being carried out by the Pakistan army and China’s People’s Liberation Army at Pauli Pir near Lasadanna Dhok of PoK.Pakistan army personnel and dozens of civilians are working at the construction site, the reports stated. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/have-no-such-indication-army-commander-on-reports-of-china-helping-set-up-missile-sites-in-pok-153794

It was Uzma Begum's mother Asifa Begum who first attacked Sultana while Uzma joined later to thrash her mother-in-law.The incident occurred under the limits of Humayun Nagar police station on Thursday but came to light after the CCTV footage went viral. A young boy is also seen filming the incident on a mobile phone.The police have booked Uzma and her mother and took up further investigations.According to police inspector Korani Sunil, the incident occurred after electricity and water supply to Uzma's flat was stopped by her in-laws who live on the ground floor in the same house."This led to an argument. Uzma's mother also joined the altercation and started thrashing Sultana," he said.Uzma and her mother-in-law had earlier lodged police complaints against each other. The police had also conducted counselling for them.The investigations revealed Sultana's son Ubaid Ali Khan, who lives in Saudi Arabia, married Uzma last year. This was the second marriage for both.The young woman had accused her mother-in-law of ill-treatment. She told police that in-laws were neither allowing her to join her husband in Saudi nor permitting her to speak to him over phone regularly.There used to be frequent quarrels between them and on Thursday when electricity and water supply was stopped to Uzma's flat this enraged her."We have registered a case under section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) against Uzma and her mother and taken up further investigation," the police officer said.

10-10-2020||United Nations||India warns against Pakistan's attempts to disrupt Non-Aligned Movement||Calling out Pakistan's attempts to disrupt the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), India has warned that it will slide to irrelevance and be shut out of global decision-making if attempts were made to divide it by venting bilateral grievances."If we take up issues that divide rather than unite us, reducing our movement to a platform for venting bilateral grievances or for embarrassing fellow Members, we will soon become a weak and irrelevant entity, with no say at all in global decision-making," India's Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan told the virtual Ministerial Meeting of the NAM on Friday.Theme of the meeting commemorating the 65th anniversary of the adoption of the movement's founding principles was "More Relevant, United and Effective NAM against Emerging Global Challenges, including Covid-19", but Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi raised the Kashmir issue.Muraleedharan did not mention Quereshi or Pakistan by name but it was clear to whom his message against divisiveness and raising of irrelevant issues was directed."Individual members must stop and think before raising issues that are not on the agenda and which find no resonance in the wider membership. NAM was never and never can be a platform for pursuits aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of a State by another State." The second of the 10 founding principles of NAM is "respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations", he added.On the meeting's pressing issue of dealing with the Covid-19 crisis and rebuilding the world in its destructive wake, he said: "NAM's unique tradition of promoting South-South cooperation can provide a way out as societies look to rebuild and regenerate in the wake of this crisis." He recalled Prime Minister Narendra Modi's assurance at the UN General Assembly last month that "India's immense vaccine production and delivery capacity will be used to help all humanity in fighting the crisis".But the world was also facing the threat of terrorism and other imminent dangers, Muraleedharan said.Terrorism and its "enablers continue to spread their tentacles unabated", he said in a message also directed against Islamabad.Listing the other threats to the world, he said: "Misinformation and fake news are wreaking havoc on social cohesion and collective security. Climate change has become an existential threat, especially to the most vulnerable SIDS (Small Island Developing States) countries. Humanitarian emergencies are straining capacities. Cybersecurity threats and the uneven impact of frontier technologies are causing turbulence."NAM has the potential to take the lead in addressing the primary issues of our times that demand global cooperation." Friday's meeting commemorated the adoption in 1955 of NAM's founding principles known as the Bandung Declaration.It was named for the place in Indonesia where leaders of 29 countries adopted it at a meeting organised at the initiative of India's former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and President Suharto of Indonesia.Muraleedharan said: "Over the decades, these core principles have served as anchors in the political and socio-economic journeys of many of our nations. These principles have helped us overcome immense challenges such as colonialism and apartheid, and are today reflected in our steadfast support to the cause of Palestine."While Pakistan, like China, was present at the Bandung meeting, it spurned non-alignment by entering into military alliances with the US and other countries, and joined NAM only in 1979.In his speech to the Friday meeting, Qureshi "expressed concern" at what he said was the denial of the right to self-determination under UN Security Council resolutions.However, the principal Security Council resolution on the subject demands that Pakistan withdraw its forces and people from all of Kashmir.Qureshi also asserted that the "struggle of the people of Jammu and Kashmir is being brutally suppressed".

It brings peace and comfort where often there is only desperation,” the Dalai Lama said.“The Nobel Committee’s honouring of WFP is also a reminder to all of us of our responsibility to do what we can to narrow the gap between rich and poor,” he said.He also expressed his gratitude to members of the WFP for their tremendous humanitarian work.“As the current global health crisis reminds us, threats to the whole human family have to be addressed by us all, since we all want to be happy and free from suffering. Hunger and poverty can only be eliminated on the basis of international cooperation. As a firm believer in the oneness of humanity, it is my fervent hope that the award of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize to the World Food Programme will inspire an intensification of efforts to ensure that nobody is left to die of hunger anywhere,” he added.

Is this justice,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.The video shows a conversation between soldiers objecting to their transportation in a non-bullet proof vehicle while their seniors were using bullet-proof vehicles.हमारे जवानों को नॉन-बुलेट प्रूफ़ ट्रकों में शहीद होने भेजा जा रहा है और PM के लिए 8400 करोड़ के हवाई जहाज़!क्या यह न्याय है? pic.twitter.com/iu5iYWVBfE  They also complained that by doing so, their lives were being compromised and the authorities were playing with their and their families’ lives.Gandhi had earlier attacked Modi over the acquisition of the VVIP aircraft and wondered how many things could have been bought for the soldiers stationed at the Siachen-Ladakh border in the amount spent on the planes.During his campaign in Punjab against the farm reform laws, the Congress leader on Tuesday had accused the Prime Minister of “wasting” thousands of crores of rupees on the aircraft.The government has brought two VVIP planes for travel of the President, the Prime Minister and the Vice President, even as it maintained that the process for procuring the two aircraft had begun under the UPA government and the current dispensation has only brought it to a logical conclusion.

10-10-2020||New Delhi||SC agrees to hear woman's plea against probe into her legal father's marriage||The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the plea of a 20-year-old woman against a departmental inquiry ordered by the Chhattisgarh government into her legal guardian, a senior IPS officer, allegedly marrying her biological mother despite being already married.The woman claimed this “outrageous acts” of the state government is an "attempt to settle scores" with her father, the legal guardian, and disrobe her and her deceased biological mother of their dignity.After hearing senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for the woman, a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and M R Shah issued a notice and granted an ex-parte stay on the inquiry proceedings. “Application for filing the petition without disclosing the identity of the petitioner no.1 (woman) is allowed. Issue notice. In the meantime, no proceedings shall take place in pursuance of communication dated August 14, 2020,” the bench said in its order.In her plea, the woman said she was born to Dr. MM on December 9, 2000. She also said that when she was nine-month-old, her mother, a divorcee, on her deathbed, passed her custody to Mrs. UG and Mr. MG (father/legal guardian).She said this transfer of custody subsequently found validation by the order of a sub-divisional magistrate on July 30, 2003 and the order was held by a family court on October 11, 2006.She claimed that throughout her growing years, she has found immense love and affection from the entire family, including her legal guardians and she is now pursuing an MBBS course.The woman said that on the account of COVID-19 she returned to her family home in Delhi and it was during this stay that her father/legal guardian in order to mentally prepare her against possible onslaught around her identity and dignity informed her about the inquiry recommended by the state government. “What is glaring is the fact that the said inquiry is premised on speculations relating to Petitioner number 1 (woman) paternity and her natural mother's i.e Dr. MM's relationship with Mr. MG…”, her plea said, adding that such speculation is “a despicable attack” on her dignity and also of her deceased mother's.The plea said, “It is submitted that certain zones of individual's life and choices have been placed by this court beyond the interference of the state, as without such restrictions right to dignity guaranteed, which straddles across the spectrum of fundamental right shall be rendered redundant,” it said.The plea sought quashing of the enquiry emanating from the government communication dated August 14, 2020, saying it embarks upon the constitutionally proscribed questions of her paternity and her deceased mother's relationship with Mr MG.It also requested restraining the state government from speculating into such questions which are constitutionally proscribed and erodes her and her deceased mother's right to dignity and privacy. The petition also sought directions to the state government and its officials to restrain them from circulating the documents and details pertaining to the enquiry. “It is pertinent to note here that Mr. MG, a much celebrated IPS officer, has in last two years fallen foul of the political dispensation in the state and has relentlessly been persecuted through various FIRs and departmental inquiries against which the petitioner number 2 (Mr. MG) has been constrained to avail the remedies available under law,” it said.The woman's plea said that various FIRs lodged against her father/legal guardian (Mr. MG) has been stayed by the court and he is also pursuing his remedies in the Central Administrative Tribunal against his suspension. “Such is the vindictiveness of Respondent number 1 (state) that despite the order of this court having granted stay of investigation in the three FIRs registered against Mr. MG, it continued to persecute him and carried out illegal mobile interception of his family members including her and also registered a frivolous FIR against his advocate,” the plea said. It said that having met a roadblock in its entire endeavour "to persecute and humiliate" Mr. MG, the state government, “in its desperation to settle scores with him has now resorted to embark upon the proscribed terrain without considering the impact the same shall have on the modesty, and dignity of petitioner number 1 and her deceased mother”.The petition said, “It is submitted that such pursuit of vengeance as has been undertaken by the respondent State and its officials erodes the very soul of constitutional morality and denigrates the status of woman to that of a chattel”.

10-10-2020||New Delhi||Moratorium period exceeding 6 months may result in vitiating overall credit discipline: RBI to SC||A loan moratorium exceeding six months might result in “vitiating the overall credit discipline”, which will have a “debilitating impact” on the process of credit creation in the economy, the Reserve Bank of India has told the Supreme Court.In an affidavit filed in the Apex Court in the loan moratorium case, the RBI has said a long moratorium period could impact credit behaviour of borrowers and increase the risks of delinquencies post resumption of scheduled payments.The banking regulator fled the affidavit in pursuance to the Apex Court’s October 5 order asking the Centre and the RBI to place on record the KV Kamath committee recommendations on debt restructuring because of COVID-19 related stress on various sectors as well as the notifications and circulars issued so far on loan moratorium.The top court is hearing a batch of pleas, including the one which has sought a direction to declare the portion of an RBI notification, issued on March 27, “ultra vires to the extent it charges interest on the loan amount during the moratorium period...”.In its affidavit, the RBI has said any waiver of interest on interest would entail “significant economic costs” which cannot be absorbed by the banks without serious dent of their finances, and this, in turn, would have huge implications for the depositors and the broader financial stability.“The Union of India vide its affidavit dated October 2, 2020, has submitted before the court the decision of the government to bear the cost of the ‘interest on interest’ for MSME loans and personal loans up to Rs 2 crore. This decision by the government to provide additional relief to a large segment of borrowers has addressed the primary prayers of the petitioners,” the affidavit said.It said: “A long moratorium exceeding six months can also impact the credit behaviour of borrowers and increase the risks of delinquencies post resumption of scheduled payments.”“It may result in vitiating the overall credit discipline which will have a debilitating impact on the process of credit creation in the economy. It will be the small borrowers which may end up bearing the brunt of the impact as their access to formal lending channels is critically dependent on the credit culture,” the affidavit said.The RBI has said that mere continuation of the temporary moratorium would not even be in the interest of borrowers.It has also said that the Apex Court’s interim order of September 4, restraining classification of accounts into non-performing accounts in terms of the directions issued by the RBI, may kindly be vacated with immediate effect.“It is humbly submitted that this court had given an across the board stay on the classification of any account as NPA till further orders. If the stay is not lifted immediately, it shall have huge implications for the banking system, apart from undermining the regulatory mandate of the Reserve Bank of India,” the affidavit said.It said many petitioners had prayed for directions to the RBI to announce sector-specific reliefs instead of a “monolithic” resolution framework.“Such prayers deliberately obfuscate the fact that resolution framework gives complete discretion to lending institutions and borrowers to arrive at resolution plans which are tailored to the specific requirements of sector subject to the prudential boundaries specified therein,” it said.It said the RBI has announced multiple sets of guidelines since March this year to respond appropriately to the evolving situation with the primary objective of enabling all key constituents in the economy, most importantly the borrowers, to cope with the economic fallout.The affidavit said the RBI has been the “most proactive” in announcing several measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.The RBI has also placed on record the Kamath committee report and the follow-up actions taken thereon. The Apex Court is scheduled to hear the matter on October 13.The Finance Ministry had filed an additional affidavit in the Apex Court on October 2 saying it had decided to waive compound interest (interest on interest) charged on loans of up to Rs 2 crore for a six-month moratorium from individual borrowers as well as medium and small industries.The Kamath panel had made recommendations for 26 sectors that could be factored by lending institutions while finalising loan resolution plans and had said that banks could adopt a graded approach based on the severity of the coronavirus pandemic on a sector.Initially, the RBI on March 27 had issued the circular which allowed lending institutions to grant a moratorium on payment of instalments of term loans falling due between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, due to the pandemic.Later, the period of the moratorium was extended till August 31 this year.

10-10-2020||Washington||China has deployed 60,000 soldiers on India’s northern border: Pompeo||China has amassed more than 60,000 troops on India's northern border, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said as he hit out at Beijing for its "bad behaviour" and the threats it poses to the Quad countries.The foreign ministers from the Indo-Pacific nations known as the Quad group - the US, Japan, India and Australia - met in Tokyo on Tuesday in what was their first in-person talks since the coronavirus pandemic began.The meeting took place in the backdrop of China's aggressive military behaviour in the Indo-Pacific, South China Sea and along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.Also read: Time has come to accept that talks won’t make China change its aggressive stance: US NSA "The Indians are seeing 60,000 Chinese soldiers on their northern border,” Pompeo told The Guy Benson Show in an interview on Friday after his return from Tokyo wherein he attended the second Quad ministerial with his counterparts from India, Japan and Australia."I was with my foreign minister counterparts from India, Australia, and Japan – a format that we call the Quad, four big democracies, four powerful economies, four nations, each of whom has real risk associated with the threats imposed – attempting to be imposed by the Chinese Communist Party. And they see it in their home countries too," he said.Pompeo met External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in Tokyo on Tuesday and they underscored the need to work together to advance, peace, prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific and around the globe. He described his meeting with Jaishankar as "productive"."They see, the people of their (Quad) nations understanding that we all slept on this for too long. For decades, the West allowed the Chinese Communist Party to walk all over us. The previous administration bent a knee, too often allowed China to steal our intellectual properties and the millions of jobs that came along with it. They see that in their country too," he said in the interview.In another interview with Larry O'Connor, Pompeo said in his meetings with his counterparts from Japan, India and Australia, they began to develop a set of understandings and policies that can jointly take these countries to work to present a true resistance to the threats that the Chinese Communist Party poses to each of these nations."They absolutely need the United States to be their ally and partner in this fight," he said."But they've all seen it, whether it's the Indians, who are actually having a physical confrontation with the Chinese up in the Himalayas in the north-eastern part of India, the Chinese have now begun to amass huge forces against India in the north – whether it's the Australians who did the simple thing of saying the Chinese screwed this deal up with the virus, and we'd like to understand what happened and said we ought to have a full investigation, and in exchange for that, the Chinese Communist Party began to extort, coerce, bully the Australians,” Pompeo said.Every one of these countries has seen this, he said, adding that people in each of these countries now understand the Chinese Communist Party presents a threat to them. "The world has awakened. The tide's begun to turn. And the United States under President Trump's leadership has now built out a coalition that will push back against the threat and maintain good order, the rule of law, and the basic civic decency that comes from democracies controlling the world and not authoritarian regimes," Pompeo said.In his third-interview to Fox News, Pompeo said that the US under Trump administration had begun to build out all the edifice of the structure and the allies and the coalition to push back against China."We aim to protect the American people from the threat that the Chinese Communist Party poses," he said."Look, they've stacked 60,000 soldiers against the Indians in the north. When the Australians had the temerity to ask for an investigation of the Wuhan virus and where it began, something that we know a lot about, the Chinese Communist Party threatened them. They bullied them,” Pompeo told Fox News."We need partners and friends. They'll certainly try to react. But what the Chinese Communist Party had become accustomed to, frankly, for an awfully long time was watching America bend a knee, watching us turn the other cheek and appease them," he said."That only encouraged their bad behaviour, their malign activity. Our push back – they understand we're serious about it. They've watched that we're going to confront them and impose costs upon them. I am confident that this activity, over time, will change the nature of what the Chinese Communist Party tries to do to harm America,” Pompeo said.India is expanding bilateral cooperation with Japan, the US and Australia in the Indo-Pacific region.The US has been pushing for a greater role for India in the Indo-Pacific which is seen by many countries as an effort to contain China's growing clout in the region.

10-10-2020||Washington||Indian envoy underlines 5 principles to take India-US ties to next level||Ahead of the third edition of the two-plus-two dialogue between India and the US later this month, Indian Ambassador to Washington Taranjit Singh Sandhu has underlined five broad principles to take the partnership between the two nations to the “next level”.The dialogue is expected to take place on October 26 and 27 in New Delhi during which both sides are likely to carry out a comprehensive review of their strategic cooperation. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Defence Secretary Mark Esper are scheduled to visit India for the dialogue.Sandhu told a think-tank on Friday that under every administration, the partnership between the two largest democracies of the world had touched new heights.“However, given the true potential of our relations, I believe the best is yet to come. So today, I want to underline five broad principles, which I feel could take the India-US partnership to the next level,” the envoy said in his address to the prestigious The Heritage Foundation think-tank here.These five principles were ‘look ahead’, ‘look broad, look deep’, ‘strengthen each other’, ‘explore together’ and ‘shape together’, Sandhu said.“First and foremost, look ahead. While short-term gains might provide happiness and relief, we cannot afford to overlook where we want to be in the long run. This also means that we cannot be complacent, about short-term gains nor can we be, too agitated about short term losses. Look far, look ahead,” he said.“The second point is related to the first in a way. Look broad, look deep.  Both our countries need to look at the big picture. We cannot afford to see things in silos however hard the temptation may be,” he said, adding the strategic vision needs to encompass the vision from a single department or from a single stakeholder.Thirdly, the strength of the partnership came from strengthening each other, Sandhu asserted.India’s growth was not in the interest of its alone. A secure and prosperous India was in the interest of the region, and the world at large, he added.“Today, we have a very broad-based defence partnership with the United States encompassing all aspects of defence cooperation,” the ambassador said.He asserted that this cooperation was not limited to defence trade, which has grown rapidly to over $21 billion in just over a decade but covers joint exercises and training, joint research and technology collaboration, co-development, and co-production of defence platforms.“We have a robust institutional framework with several enabling agreements and understanding concluded in recent years to advance our defence collaboration,” Sandhu said.The designation of India as a Major Defence Partner by the US, and the accordance, of Strategic Trade Authorisation-1 Status, by the US is a recognition of our robust defence ties and the immense potential it holds for further expansion across different dimensions, he said in his virtual address.Observing that India also wanted to play a more active role in global rule-making, the top diplomat said New Delhi seeks reform of multilateral institutions to reflect the realities of the times.India will assume membership of the UN Security Council in January 2021. In these extraordinary times, as an important voice representing one-sixth of humanity, India seeks to play a more active role and contribute to global peace, stability and security. The democratisation of global order, can no longer remain elusive, he asserted.“Fourthly, explore together. Let the partnership, branch into areas, that have hitherto remained unexplored. We need to challenge ourselves,” Sandhu said.“Last but not the least, we all need to shape together, the world where we want to live in.  In a way this is what Gandhiji said long ago, ‘be the change you want to see in the world’. Trust and friendship have become crucial as we confront extraordinary global challenges today,” Sandhu said.

10-10-2020||Vibha Sharma||Poll dynamics may change with Ram Vilas Paswan’s death||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 9The death of 'Dalit' leader Ram Vilas Paswan has added another angle to the Bihar poll dynamics, political watchers say.With the Lok Janshakti Party's (LJP) fighting independently this time, the general mood is that the tragedy may help the party consolidate its core votes.A sizeable number of LJP candidates are seen as “proxy” BJP candidates. It remains to be seen if the sympathy factor will be strong enough to overcome the anti-incumbency against the Nitish Kumar-led government of which the BJP is also a part. If this happens, the LJP may land votes of other castes, much to the chagrin of the Mahagathbandhan.Leaders agree the passing away of Paswan has introduced an element of uncertainty tothe already-complicated poll matrix. A section also believes that voters have “become cynical” and the death is unlikely to sway the “average Bihari voter who is more politically intelligent than an average Indian voter”. Besides the “death of tall leaders sway sentiments,” said a senior BJP leader.While the goodwill Paswan earned in his more than five-decade-long political career is expected to rub off on his political heir Chirag Paswan (depending upon his ability to make the connect), for some, his ‘Bihar first, Bihari first’ slogan is “somewhat divisive and reeks of over-ambition”, especially when in the last Assembly elections, the LJP barely managed to win two seats while his father was very much around.This is why many observers say more than causing any real gain to the BJP or Chirag, the death may play heavy on prospects of the Nitish Kumar-led JD-U. Engaged in an open feud with the JD-U, Chirag, in his letter to BJP president JP Nadda, accused Kumar of “insulting” his father and talked of “wave of disaffection” against him among voters.Prez, Prime Minister pay tribute President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tributes to LJP leader Ram Vilas Paswan at his residence on Friday. Senior BJP leaders, including Amit Shah, JP Nadda, Giriraj Singh, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Rajnath Singh, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, also paid their last respects.Goyal gets addl charge of Food MinistryRailway Minister Piyush Goyal was on Friday given the additional charge of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ministry, a portfolio held by the late Ram Vilas Paswan.

10-10-2020||New Delhi||Rs1-lakh cr push for key sectors, including auto, pharma, agriculture||Keeping the benchmark interest rate unchanged, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday announced several additional measures to revive the economy, including a Rs 1 lakh crore liquidity chest for banks for lending via bonds and commercial papers in specific sectors.Addressing the media after the three-day meeting of the reconstituted Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), RBI chief Shaktikanta Das gave an insight into the government’s thinking about reviving the economy. “In my view, it is likely to be a three-speed recovery, with individual sectors showing varying paces, depending on sector-specific realities,” he said.Story HighlightsTo facilitate more convenience for online fund transfers, the RTGS system will be available round the clock from December this yearThe sectors that would “open their accounts first” are agriculture and allied activities, FMCG, two-wheelers, passenger vehicles and tractors; drugs and pharmaceuticals; and electricity generation, especially renewable.The central bank signalled more easing ahead to support an economy that it sees contracting 9.5 per cent in the current fiscal. The MPC voted unanimously to retain the repo rate at 4 per cent while keeping its policy stance accommodative, implying it could ease again.The RBI also decided to revise the differential risk weights applicable to individual housing loans, based on the size of the loan as well as the loan-to-value ratio (LTV).The central bank will maintain comfortable liquidity conditions and will conduct market operations in the form of outright and special open market operations of Rs 20,000 crore each.The RBI chief had harsh words for a section of the industry and announced steps to improve the flow of credit to specific sectors while maintaining credit discipline. He also unveiled steps to boost exports, deepen financial inclusion and provide more credit to SMEs.Inflation, according to the MPC having Ashima Goyal, Jayanth Varma and Shashanka Bhide as the new external members, will remain elevated but ease gradually towards the target by next March. Supply disruptions and associated rise in costs are the major factors driving up inflation. As supply chains are restored, these wedges should dissipate, it observed.Shaktikanta Das RBI GovernorSilver lining visibleBy all indications, deep contractions of Q1 are behind us; silver linings are visible in flattening of Covid curve.Das spoke of the Indian economy entering into a decisive phase in the fight against the pandemic as several high-frequency indicators point to the easing of contractions and the emergence of growth impulses. Kharif sowing especially had surpassed last year’s acreage while improved soil moisture conditions, along with healthy reservoir levels, have brightened the outlook for the Rabi season. Early estimates suggest that foodgrain production is set to cross another record in 2020-21.With migrant labour returning to work, factories and construction activity are coming back to life. This is reflected in the rising levels of energy consumption and population mobility. “The mood of the nation has shifted from fear and despair to confidence and hope,” he noted.— TNSSome hope in Q4Inflation likely at 4%The RBI expects inflation to ease close to targeted range of 4% (plus or minus 2%) in Q4. It says the recent pick-up in inflation was due to supply disruption during the lockdown.Sensex rallies 327 pts||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rs1-lakh-cr-push-for-key-sectors-including-auto-pharma-agriculture-153593
