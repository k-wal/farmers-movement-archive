21-10-2020||New Delhi||India’s contribution will be critical to fighting COVID-19: Vardhan||India’s contribution will be critical to fighting COVID-19, especially when it comes to making vaccines for the whole world, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Wednesday, assuring that the government has accorded top-most priority to research and manufacturing to ensure that the vaccine reaches the last person.He made the remarks while virtually addressing the World Bank-IMF annual meeting on “Unleashing the South Asian Century through Human Capital for All” and “Investing in COVID-19 Vaccines and Primary Healthcare Delivery System”.He said that the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration is working on all aspects, besides designing innovative approaches to distribute vaccines in rural and remote regions, the Health Ministry said in its statement.The health minister said the present research agenda for COVID-19 has been to provide an affordable vaccine as well as to ensure its equitable distribution.Currently, three Indian pharma companies in partnership with foreign or domestic research institutes are expediting the trials of vaccine, the statement said.The biggest benefit that India has is that it has a robust immunization program in place and it is also implementing the largest immunization program of the world, with nearly 27 million newborns targeted annually, the minister said.“We have an established infrastructure for supply, storage and delivery of vaccines to the last mile under our Universal Immunization Program as part of which we are administering around 600 million doses to children every year.   “The strength of these experiences in the vaccination landscape, our best practices and the robustness of our health delivery system will be leveraged and augmented using a strong IT backbone to ensure that this humongous national mission of vaccinating the identified priority groups with COVID-19 vaccine is achieved in a timely manner.“The Indian government will leverage an integrated IT platform e-Vin (electronic Vaccine Intelligent Network) for managing vaccine distribution,” Vardhan said.He re-affirmed the commitment of the Indian government and assured that it has accorded top-most priority to the research and manufacturing to ensure that the vaccine reaches the last person.“The India story has always been very inspiring as we have made huge strides in improving the health of our people in the last two decades. And now, India’s contribution will be critical to fighting COVID-19, especially when it comes to making vaccines at large scale for the whole world,” the minister was quoted as saying in the statement.              Emphasizing India’s role during the pandemic, Vardhan said, “The inclusiveness of India’s response has led us to manage the pandemic currently. The COVID pandemic has created disruption in normal life but has also provided a steep learning curve for all of us to be more resilient and prepared for the future. These efforts have been a result of commitment from all stakeholders.”            India has been following a pre-emptive, proactive, and graded response characterised by a “Whole of Society, Whole of Government” approach to manage the challenges posed by the global pandemic, he said.Lauding the support of private sector in India’s COVID-19 management, he stated that its innovation, ability and agility has supported the efforts to fight coronavirus in a big way.

21-10-2020||New Delhi||Theaterisation of armed forces next logical step in military reforms after appointment of CDS: Army chief||Setting up of integrated theatre commands to synergise the capabilities of the three services would be the next logical move in military reforms after the “momentous” step of appointment of the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Army Chief Gen MM Naravane said on Wednesday.Asserting that the process to set up the theatre commands will be “deliberate, thoughtful and well considered”, Gen Naravane said its fruition will take a “number of years”.                Speaking at an event at the College of Defence Management in Secunderabad, the chief of the 1.3 million-strong Indian Army said there was a need for everyone to work in a spirit of togetherness and trust with the national security interests being of paramount importance.He also added a note of caution and said that there might be a requirement for “mid course corrections,” according to a release by the Army here.The comments by the Army chief comes at a time India has been adopting a “unified” military approach in eastern Ladakh to deal with the border row with China with the Indian Air Force working in tandem with the Army to bolster the combat capability in the high-altitude region.Gen Naravane spoke on a number of issues concerning integration, theaterisation and modernisation of the armed forces in general and the Indian Army in particular.He said he was optimistic about the future of integration of the armed forces, which he said was “an inevitability” as it would lead to “tri-services synergy” and optimisation of resources.The remarks by the Army chief reflected the thinking as well as readiness of the force to support the mega theaterisation plan being undertaken by Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat to enhance combat capabilities of the armed forces.Referring to the appointment of the CDS, the army chief said it was “a momentous one” and that the services needed to “demonstrate great wisdom and statesmanship” in enabling the CDS, a long standing demand of the armed forces.“The next logical step in the process of defence reforms was the ‘formation of Integrated Theatre Commands to synergise the capabilities and combat potential of the three services during war and peace’,” the army chief was quoted as saying in the release.Gen Naravane also spoke about the current security scenario and focused on the geo-strategic implications on capability development of the Indian Army.The government appointed Gen Rawat as CDS on December 31 to bring in convergence among the three services and restructure military commands to effectively deal with future security challenges.Theaterisation means putting specific number of personnel from the three services —army, navy and air force— under a common commander for a unified military approach through rationalisation of manpower and resources.As per plan, each of the theatre commands will have units of the army, the navy and the air force, and all of them will work as a single entity looking after security challenges in a specified geographical territory under an operational commander. At present, these forces have separate commands.In February, the CDS had said that the air defence command, to be helmed by the Indian Air Force, would be rolled out by the beginning of next year.                          He had also said the proposed peninsula command, to be formed by merging the Indian Navy’s eastern and western commands, is likely to take shape by the end of 2021.During his visit to Secunderabad, Gen Naravane also visited the Bison division where he was briefed by top commanders on security and operational preparedness of the formation.The Army chief commended the formation for their high level of operational preparedness and exhorted all ranks to continue training hard with zeal and be prepared for any future operational challenges, the Army said.He also visited the TATA Boeing Aerospace Limited (TBAL) at Hyderabad which is a joint venture facility of Boeing and Tata Advanced Systems.

Why can’t there be two models of marketing farm produce in a large country like India? Article 254 of the Constitution gives that right to every state,” said Chidambaram as a constitutional face-off between the Centre and Punjab on the issue appeared imminent.Former home minister Chidambaram said in a federal system there is space for as many models as there are states.“One Country One System will lead to mediocrity and wreck federalism. Let the people of each state decide which model they want. That is a decision that the people must make, not the Governor or the President,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chidambaram-defends-punjab-farm-bills-asks-why-cant-there-be-2-models-of-agricultural-marketing-159123
21-10-2020||New Delhi||Cong urges govt to rollback raised railway fares for upcoming festive season||The Congress on Wednesday accused the railways of charging higher fares for festival special trains and urged the government to roll back the raised prices to help people during the festive season.Congress spokesperson Gaurav Vallabh said the government has approved 196 pairs or 392 trains to cater to the festival rush and they will operate from October 20 to November 30 for festivals such as Durga Puja, Dussehra, Diwali and Chhatt Puja. He said the fares being charged for these special trains are 25 to 30 per cent higher than normal.“We demand that the government roll back these increased fares immediately and subsidise them further so that rail travel becomes accessible to the common man and the festive travel doesn’t make a deep hole in his pocket,” he told reporters.The railways has always been symbolic of the common man and has been called the backbone of Indian travel landscape, he said, adding that it has the potential to help the common man travel without being a burden on the pockets.Vallabh said COVID-19 has dealt a severe blow to the earnings of many people and during the festive season people are looking forward to spread happiness and enjoy with their families.“But the government seems to be ignorant of its role of supporting people in enjoying the festivities. Instead, the fares are on average 25-30 percent higher in the festival special trains,” he alleged.Vallabh said with millions of people having lost their jobs in the last few months, the government, instead of providing festival stimulus, has decided to further pull the common man down.He said there is no reason to increase the fares in current times and on the contrary the fares should have been subsidised heavily as people are already reeling due to the lockdown and downturn in the economy.“Does the government want to push even the railways out of grasp of the common man,” he asked.The Congress leader also asked what was the rationale of the government in increasing fares to the extent of 25 to 30 per cent.“When across sectors there are massive retrenchments and salary cuts, GDP growth for Q1 FY21 is at -23.9 per cent, at this point of time, instead of giving money in the hands of the people, why is the government taxing the common man further,” he asked. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-urges-govt-to-rollback-raised-railway-fares-for-upcoming-festive-season-159122
21-10-2020||---||SC to examine whether educational institutions come under Consumer Protection Act||New Delhi, October 21Do educational institutions and universities come under the preview of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986?The Supreme Court has decided to examine the issue in view of divergent verdicts delivered by it. Admitting an appeal arising out of a judgment of the National Consumer Redressal Commission, a three-judge Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud issued notice in the case.“Since there are divergent views of this Court bearing on the subject as to whether an educational institution or University would be subject to the provisions of the Consumer Protection Act 1986, the appeal would require admission,” the Bench noted.Complainants Manu Solanki and others had accused Vinayaka Mission University of deficiency in service and unfair trade practice by inducing them to get admitted in an unrecognised offshore programme [dental course] in 2005-2006 consisting of two-year study in Thailand and two-and-a-half-year study in the University. The programme was neither affiliated with the university nor recognized by Dental Council of India, they alleged.The complainants were aggrieved by the national consumer commission’s decision that said ‘educational institutions’ didn’t impart ‘services’ and hence the consumer courts didn’t have jurisdiction to entertain complaints against them. The judgment was based on the Supreme Court’s decision in Anupama College of Engineering versus Gulshan Kumar in which it was said educational institutions didn’t render ‘service’.The University had contended that the complaint was not maintainable as the complainants were not ‘consumers’; ‘education’ was not a commodity; and ‘educational institutions’ were not providing ‘service’ – a pre-condition to be covered by the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.The University pointed out that the top court had in Maharshi Dayanand University versus Surjeet Kaur and PT Koshy and Another versus Ellen Charitable Trust ruled that ‘education’ was not a commodity and educational institutions were not engaged in providing ‘service’. The Supreme Court had held that in matters of admission, fees there cannot be a question of deficiency in service, it submitted.The complainants had relied on the Supreme Court’s decision in P Sreenivasulu and Another versus PJ Alexander and Another wherein it was said educational institutions would come within the purview of the Act as ‘education’ was a ‘service’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-examine-whether-educational-institutions-come-under-consumer-protection-act-159117

21-10-2020||---||India to host ‘2+2’ with US on Oct 27: MEA||New Delhi, October 21India will host the third India-US 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue on October 27 in New Delhi, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced on Wednesday.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper will visit India on October 26 and 27 to participate in the dialogue. From the Indian side, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will lead the delegations from the Ministries of Defence and External Affairs, respectively.The first two 2+2 Ministerial dialogues were held in New Delhi in September 2018 and in Washington DC in 2019. The agenda for the third dialogue will cover all bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest, said the MEA.However, the MEA’s announcement was preceded by Esper making the same observation while speaking at a US think-tank event on Tuesday.“India will well be the most consequential partner for us, in the Indo-Pacific for us for sure. It’s the world’s largest democracy, a very capable country with very talented people, and they face off, every day, Chinese aggression in the Himalayas,” Esper said about the purpose of his visit.With India’s acquiescence after its standoff on the line of actual control (LAC) with China remains unrelenting, the US has put its South Asia strategy in high gear.It began with the US signing a defence framework with the Maldives followed by a top US diplomat visiting India and Bangladesh. Following the two plus two in New Delhi, Pompeo will travel to Sri Lanka to mend fences, followed by a stopover in Maldives which has come in for increasing Indian attention.Esper said his visit is part of a broader US initiative to strengthen older alliances and develop new ones against Russian and Chinese efforts to build their own global power networks.While India and the US step up their engagements in the neighbourhood, both countries are also attempting to regularise the Quad grouping of India, US, Australia and Japan in an eventual move towards its formalisation and expansion. The second Quad Foreign Ministers’ meeting was held earlier this month in Tokyo where Pompeo in his opening address termed China as “the elephant in the room”.Recently, Australia said it will take part in a large-scale naval drill next month with India, the US and Japan under the Malabar series. Last November the US held its first-ever tri-services exercises with India. A bipartisan group of US Senators has also voiced its approval.The two plus two meeting, Esper said will reflect the need for a lot more close collaboration on challenges in the Indo-Pacific region, where China is building its presence. “Together these efforts will strengthen what may become one of the most consequential partnerships of the 21st century,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-host-22-with-us-on-oct-27-mea-159111
21-10-2020||New Delhi||Plea in SC seeks removal of disparity in pension benefits to armed forces||A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking removal of disparity in pension benefits to the armed forces personnel under the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Defence.       The plea filed by Humara Desh Humare Jawan­Trust contended that the new contributory pension scheme was launched by the Centre and took effect from January 1, 2004. Through a notification on January 1, 2004, government made the pension scheme contributory, to be deducted from salary of the employee.“Central government is applying a hybrid pension scheme which is a mixture of old and new pension schemes to the personnel of Armed forces which came under the MHA and who joined the service after January 1, 2004,” the petition says.“But it is specifically provided that this new contributory pension scheme is not applicable to the armed forces of Union of India,” said the plea, filed through advocate Ajay K Agrawal.The PIL stated that for the forces which come under MHA such as BSF CISF CRPF ITBP, NSG, SSB and Assam Rifles, a clarification was issued on August 6, 2004, that all these are Armed Forces of the Union under the ministry.It said that each and every personnel of Armed forces which comes under the MHA wants to get pension under the old scheme but the central government has denied it, “therefore discriminating with the armed forces under the Ministry of Defence while both the forces are Armed Forces of the Union”, the plea said.Even after several representations nothing has been done by the government, the plea said.

21-10-2020||---||Government open to further stimulus to lift economy, says DEA Secretary||New Delhi, October 21The central government is open to further stimulus measures to boost the coronavirus-hit economy, Economic Affairs Secretary Tarun Bajaj said on Wednesday.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a slew of measures to spur demand and ramp up capital expenditure earlier this month. This was the third stimulus package since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.The government had announced a Rs 1.70 lakh crore Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKP) in March to protect the poor and vulnerable sections from the impact of COVID-19 crisis.It was followed by the Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan package of Rs 20.97 lakh crore in May, largely focussed on supply side measures and long-term reforms.“So I think with all these efforts and as I said, as the finance minister said, we are seeing what all other things can be done (to boost economy),” Bajaj said while addressing a virtual event organised by CII.            Earlier this week, Sitharaman had said the option for another stimulus package has not been closed.“I have not closed the option for another stimulus package if it comes out to be, because every time we announced one, it has been after a lot of consideration of inputs which have come from various sections of society.  “Then we sit and work it out within the ministry and Prime Minister’s Office and then take a final call. So, I have not closed the option to come up with one more stimulus,” Sitharaman had said.Speaking about the capital markets, Bajaj said the government has taken lot of measures to deepen the market.      Citing an example, he said, “We have undertaken some reforms and it is an ongoing process. In the last Parliament session, the Bilateral Netting of Qualified Financial Contracts Bill was converted into an Act, after passage of both the houses and the President’s assent was received”.As per estimates, it would result in capital saving of Rs 50,000-60,000 crore for banks alone in this whole process.“I exhort the insurance companies and the regulators in that area to look at credit default swaps now that the netting bill has been passed. And if that happens, I think it should assist the bond markets as well,” he said.Bajaj also said SEBI and the finance ministry are in touch on the ‘backstop facility’.SEBI had earlier said it plans to set up a ‘backstop entity’ to buy illiquid investment-grade corporate bonds from mutual funds. On direct listing of Indian companies on overseas exchanges, Bajaj said the Companies Act amendment bill passed by Parliament recently has provisions for this.“The regulations and the other guidelines are in the process of reaching finality. I have personally held very extensive discussions with the players in this area...I think this is also another step which was waiting to happen, which will give a fillip to some of our industries and some of our so-called unicorns a chance to actually pick up capital,” he said.He also emphasised that the players should desist from defrauding investors as regulations in the capital market sector are mostly based on disclosure and ‘buyer beware’ principle.    “I think we really need to acknowledge that and honour that. Time and again, we do see that there are some issues which crop up in the market, which takes the confidence of the people away. “Obviously, because of these regulations there’s flexibility in the design of member-client agreements, especially the agreements of portfolio management, but there is information asymmetry, and we have recently come across a large number (of such cases),” he said.      He said the industry needs to look inwards and see what can be done, besides the steps taken by the stock exchanges and the regulator.For example, he said the regulator has come up with some stricter regulations on AT1 bonds.He pointed to some cases of retired citizens being cajoled to buy AT1 bonds or senior citizens being pushed for insurance products which are not conducive for their age and risk profile. “So, I think these are also issues that are important for the capital market to have a look at,” he added.

21-10-2020||New Delhi||Punjab govt cannot change laws made by Centre: Kejriwal||Delhi Chief Minister and AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said the Punjab government cannot change laws made by the Centre and asked if the farmers will get the minimum support price by the state assembly legislations.The Punjab Assembly on Tuesday adopted a resolution rejecting the Centre’s new farm laws and passed four bills it said will counter the contentious legislation enacted by Parliament.The bills were passed and the resolution adopted unanimously after over five hours of discussion on the second day of a special assembly session called by the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government.Reacting to the move, Kejriwal called it a “drama” and claimed that the Punjab government cannot change the laws made by the Centre.“Raja Sahib, you amended the laws of the Centre. Can the state change the laws of the Centre? No. You did a drama. You fooled people. The laws which you passed yesterday by them will the farmers get MSP? No. Farmers want MSP, not your fake and false laws,” Kejriwal tweeted, tagging the post of the Punjab Chief Minister Office.The CMO Punjab said, “Amazed at double standards of SAD & AAP, says @capt_amarinder Singh on their criticism of state’s bills after backing them in the House. CM asks @ArvindKejriwal to follow Punjab’s examples to bring out similar bills to save farmers.”The state bills provide for imprisonment of not less than three years for the sale or purchase of wheat or paddy below the minimum support price (MSP), exemption of farmers from attachment of land up to 2.5 acres and prevention of hoarding and black-marketing of agricultural produce.The state bills, however, need the assent of the Governor before they become laws. The Governor could withhold assent and refer them to the President.The Punjab Assembly also adopted a resolution rejecting the Centre’s new farm laws. The opposition and farmer unions claim that the new laws will lead to the dismantling of the MSP system, a suggestion repeatedly denied by the BJP-led government at the Centre. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-govt-cannot-change-laws-made-by-centre-kejriwal-159090

While upcoming joint rallies by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar are also expected to clear any remaining doubt about the relationship between the two parties, BJP and JD-U, LJP president Chirag Paswan has once again thrown a spanner in the attempts by the BJP leadership to present a picture-perfect NDA alliance.Chirag, who today launched his party’s ‘Bihar first Bihari first’ vision document, said he will continue to support Prime Minister Modi, dismissing categorically any possibility of LJP allying with the RJD-Congress, ‘mahagathbandhan’, putting at rest one of the post-poll combinations doing rounds in Bihar. Interestingly, the LJP chief, also predicted that the days of Nitish Kumar, NDA’s CM face, are over. “I am the son of a ‘mausam visheshgya’ (weather expert/ weathervane). I can tell you this is his (Nitish Kumar’s) last tenure as the CM,” Chirag said.Notably, in response to very public admonishment by BJP leaders, is questioning whether they (BJP leaders) can also specify that they will not seek LJP’s support if they fall short of numbers. Political observers, who continue to predict a tough fight, also talk of massive crowds at rallies of RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, who is also ‘mahagatbandhan’s’ CM face. This should be a cause of worry for NDA leaders, they say.Meanwhile, apart from the possibility of Chirag joining hands with Tejashwi, Rajesh Ranjan or Pappu Yadav, the president of the Jan Adhikar Party-Loktantrik who has also been named the CM face of Progressive Democratic Alliance is also making waves, dubbed as a potential “kingmaker in difficult post-poll scenario”.BJP, sources say, is leaving no stone unturned to win the elections with party president JP Nadda and state in charge Bhupendra Yadav making these elections almost a prestige issue. Party leaders, who dismiss any ‘Chirag angle’ in the BJP story, also question if the leadership would put in so much effort, including on seats BJP is not even fighting, if all it wanted was to finish Nitish Kumar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-elections-get-curioser-and-curioser-159087

Most of the assembly bypolls will be held on November 3. Bypolls to the Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha seat in Bihar and some assembly seats in Manipur will take place on November 7.The election commission's advisory comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged people to follow all COVID guidelines, including wearing of masks, especially during the festive season.With the onset of festival season, PM Modi on Tuesday made an impassioned appeal to people to follow COVID-19 guidelines, saying this is not the time to be careless as the virus is still around and even a small negligence can dampen the festive spirit.The poll panel also referred to its October 9 advisory in which it had sought the cooperation of all political parties in following instructions related to COVID-19 at all stages, especially wherever public interface in physical form is involved.The previous advisory had said the observance of preventive measures, including wearing masks, use of sanitiser and social distancing is a duty cast upon all the stakeholders in the larger interest of public health."As representatives of public, this onerous responsibility rests with the political parties to ensure that they not only cooperate with the district machinery in following the due norms of public health safety as prescribed but also instil a sense of discipline for civic behaviour in their cadre while doing ground management during campaign times," it had said.The Election Commission said it seeks the fullest cooperation from parties so that its district election machinery ensures that all the preventive measures are adhered to by every participant, including organisers.In August this year, the EC had issued broad guidelines for polls to be held amid the pandemic. According to the guidelines, a group of five people, including candidates but excluding security personnel, is allowed to take part in door-to-door campaigning.For roadshows, the commission said convoys of vehicles should be broken after every five vehicles instead of 10 (excluding security vehicles). Public gatherings and rallies can be held subject to adherence to COVID-19 guidelines.The district election officer should identify in advance dedicated grounds for public gatherings with clearly marked entry and exit points. In all such identified grounds, the district election officer should put markers in advance to ensure social distancing norms.The district election officer and district superintendent of police should ensure that the number of attendees does not exceed the limit prescribed by the State Disaster Management Authority for public gatherings, the EC had said.To ensure social distancing norms on polling days, the panel had said that there will be a maximum 1,000 electors instead of 1,500 in a polling station.In view of this, the state is creating an additional around 34,000 polling stations which are 45 per cent more and will increase the total number of polling stations to around 1,06,000.

21-10-2020||Mumbai||HC raises questions over Republic TV’s reportage in Sushant Rajput death case||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday demanded to know from the Republic TV if asking viewers who should be arrested in a case in which a probe is going on, and infringing upon a person’s rights qualified as “investigative journalism”.A Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni was referring to a hashtag campaign, and several news reports related to the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput that the channel broadcast.The court pointed to the channel’s #ArrestRhea hashtag campaign on Twitter.It also asked the channel’s lawyer Malvika Trivedi why Republic TV broadcast photos of the dead body, and speculated on whether the actor’s death was a case of suicide or homicide.“The grievance is regarding #arrestrhea. Why is this part of your channel news?” the Bench said.“When a case is under investigation and the issue is whether it’s a homicide or a suicide and a channel is saying it is murder, is all this investigative journalism?” it asked.The observations came while the Bench was hearing the final arguments on a bunch of public interest litigations, seeking that the press be restrained in its reportage on the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.The pleas had also sought that TV news channels be stopped from conducting a media trial into the case.The Bench had asked all parties to clarify if a statutory mechanism was required to regulate the content broadcast by the TV news channels.Earlier this week, it had also asked the Union government why guidelines of private bodies such as the News Broadcasters Standards Authority (NBSA) to regulate the content broadcast by TV news channels could not be ratified and enforced by the government.During the day-long hearing, Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, who appeared for the government, said that the Centre was in favour of a self-regulatory mechanism for the print and TV media.Singh also said that the Union government forwarded the complaints it received against TV channels, to the NBSA if those channels were its members.Else, it initiated action against them while ensuring that the freedom of the press was not breached.“It is not that we are not taking action against erring channels and it’s not like the mechanism is not working,” Singh said.“Maybe one or two channels may not have followed the guidelines properly, but by and large all channels have been following them regularly,” the ASG said.Singh said that if the action by the NBSA was inadequate, then the union initiated action against erring channels.“Action has been taken by the ministry against 214 channels since 2013 for violations under the Programme Code Court,” he said.The lawyers for several TV channels that are a party in the case, all submitted that the NBSA’s code of ethics and guidelines on reportage, and the authority’s powers to demand an apology and a maximum fine of rupees one lakh on erring member channels were an adequate self regulatory mechanism.Republic TV meanwhile, responding to the court’s queries said that its reportage on Rajput’s death and the subsequent probe helped “unearth” several important elements in the case.“Journalists have a right to bring public opinion on the forefront and criticise the government. It is not necessary that everyone will appreciate what is being projected by news channels. However, if a news makes a certain section uncomfortable it is the essence of a democracy,” advocate Trivedi, Republic TV’s counsel said.The court, however, said that it wasn’t asking for the media’s throat to be throttled, but that the press must recognise its boundaries.“We are referring to the basic journalism norms, where a basic etiquette has to be maintained for suicide reporting. No sensational headlines, no constant repeating. You did not even leave the deceased...forget the witnesses,” the Bench said.“You have depicted a lady in such a way that infringes on her rights. This is our prima facie view,” it said.The HC will continue the hearing on Friday.

Around 300 personnel have been deployed in the city to take any pre-emptive steps.Hyderabad is known to be a city of lakes and once upon a time had over 400 water bodies, many of which have been partially encroached, eroding the city’s water drainage system.The chief minister said 12 special teams have been formed to keep an eye on tanks in the city for all future times to take timely necessary measures to prevent any untoward incident under state’s Principal Secretary (Water Resources) Rajat Kumar in monitoring the situation.All official machinery has been put on high alert to ensure that tanks and lakes in Hyderabad city are not breached due to heavy rains and flash floods.In his statement, the chief minister said, “Hyderabad received heavy rains which were unprecedented in the last hundred years. This has resulted in heavy floodwater inflows. Besides the floodwater in the city, water from the tanks in surrounding areas also entered the city. All the tanks are overflowing with water”.As more rain has been forecast by the metrological department, there is every likely hood of the city’s lakes and tanks being breached causing more misery in Hyderabad that is still struggling to get rid of the accumulated water in various low-lying areas. He has asked for the formation of at least 15 special teams with water resources department officials and staff to examine each and every tank and lake in the city. Light to moderate rain and thunderstorms have been forecasted in parts of the city. The India Metrological Department (IMD) is anticipating that the rains will have renewed impacts on water-logging, besides making the roads slippery and accident-prone. People have been advised to stay home unless absolutely necessary.Former Telangana Governor ESL Narasimhan has expressed his deep concern over the situation arising out of heavy rains and floods in Hyderabad. He has contributed Rs 25,000 from his personal savings account to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund and hoped that the situation would soon return to normal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/special-teams-to-monitor-breach-on-city-lakes-in-hyderabad-159083
21-10-2020||Patna||No Article 370 means licence to buy property in Kashmir: Yogi at Bihar rallies||In a statement that may ruffle many feathers, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday asserted that the abrogation of Article 370 has given people of other states a “licence” to own property in Jammu and Kashmir.The firebrand BJP leader made comments to the effect at rallies he addressed in Jamui, Tarari and Paliganj assembly constituencies of Bihar.“Earlier, a person from this part of Bihar could not even think of owning property in Kashmir. The Congress had put such a system in place. But Narendra Modi and Amit Shah changed all that. Article 370 has been scrapped and the people now have a license to purchase and own property in any part of Kashmir,” he said.The remarks come at a time when there have been vociferous demands for ensuring that jobs and property in Jammu and Kashmir, downgraded from a state and split into two Union Territories, be reserved for locals.Yogi also remarked mockingly that Pakistan could no longer think of sponsoring terrorism for fear of surgical strikes.People from this part of the country, desirous of visiting Kashmir, may rest assured. Anybody who casts a malevolent glance at them will have bullets pierced between their two eyes, said the seer-politician, evoking a thunderous applause.Yogi also took potshots at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, both of whom have questioned the revocation of special status to Kashmir.The people of the country are happy over scrapping of Article 370. But these two leaders seem to be more interested in making Pakistan happy, he said.According to the new domicile law, non-permanent residents who have residency proof of at least 15 years in Jammu and Kashmir are entitled to get domicile certificates in the Union Territory.Prior to the nullification of Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution, only state subjects were allowed to buy land and apply for government jobs in Jammu and Kashmir. — PTI\||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-article-370-means-licence-to-buy-property-in-kashmir-yogi-at-bihar-rallies-159082

While its newly-created Eastern Command headquartered at Gauhati has got its first chief in the rank of Additional Director General (ADG), another officer of the same level has been posted at the force headquarters in Delhi.Amrit Mohan Prasad, a 1989-batch Indian Police Service officer of the Odisha cadre who came to ITBP on deputation from the CBI in August and was at Delhi, has been appointed as the force’s ADG in the east. He would be responsible for ITBP deployment in the border areas of Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh as well as other ITBP establishments in the eastern theatre, which has also witnessed deployment of additional Chinese forces recently across the border.Inspector General Daljit Singh Chawdhary, a 1990-batch officer of the Uttar Pradesh cadre has been promoted and posted as ADG at the ITBP headquarters. All ADGs report to the Director General.The ITBP’s Western Command based at Chandigarh, which is responsible for border areas of Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, was operationalised in June amidst the Ladakh stand-off and an officer of the rank of Inspector General at Delhi was given additional charge to head this command.The two new commands were created following a cadre review of the force that was approved by the Cabinet last year. Several additional posts across the force’s hierarchy were sanctioned.Each command controls different frontier headquarters within their geographical area of jurisdiction. Earlier the frontier headquarters were reporting directly to force headquarters in Delhi. the new commands are meant to streamline the command and control mechanism of the force.The 90,000 strong ITBP, with 56 service battalions and several other technical and specialized units, is responsible for the peacetime management of the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China, with some of its posts being located at heights of 20,000 feet.

21-10-2020||New Delhi||IIT Kharagpur's 'COVIRAP' gets ICMR certification||'COVIRAP,' the diagnostic machine developed by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur researchers, has been successfully validated for its efficacy in Covid-19 detection by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the Institute said on Wednesday.After rigorous testing with patient samples by an authorized ICMR laboratory, adhering to their strict guidelines, ICMR has now granted certification for this Covid-19 Diagnostic Test.This test has been designed to be fairly easy to conduct and affordable as well and can produce results within one hour."This is indeed one of the greatest contributions in the history of medical science, particularly in the area of virology, and is well set to replace the PCR-based tests to a large extent," Professor V.K. Tewari, Director, IIT Kharagpur, said in a statement.This new testing method implements a highly reliable and accurate molecular diagnostic procedure that can be conducted in an ultra-low-cost portable device unit developed by the research team.The test results are rendered via a custom-made mobile application for dissemination without requiring manual interpretation."This innovation has made high-quality and accurate Covid testing affordable for the common people with a testing cost of around Rs 500 which can further be reduced through government intervention," said Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Union Education Minister."This machine can be developed at a cost of less than Rs 10,000 with minimal infrastructural requirement making the technology affordable to common people. The testing process in this new machine is completed within one hour," Nishank added.While the Institute can produce the testing kit up to a certain scale, patent licensing will facilitate commercialisation opportunities for medical technology companies.Dr. Mamta Chawla Sarkar, an Internationally acclaimed virologist who oversaw the patient trials on behalf of ICMR-National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) said: "A detailed scrutiny of the testing results has clearly shown that this assay holds the capability of detecting extremely low levels of viral loads than any other method based on similar principles of testing."The novel diagnostic test has been subjected to rigorous testing protocols as per the ICMR guidelines, at ICMR-NICED, an Institute authorised by ICMR. ICMR-NICED has further certified the test to be extremely user-friendly. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iit-kharagpurs-covirap-gets-icmr-certification-159068

21-10-2020||New Delhi||Centre issues draft rules for Rashtriya Raksha University Act||The Centre has issued draft rules for the Rashtriya Raksha University Act 2020, which was enacted in Parliament’s monsoon session to set up a multi-disciplinary university for imparting education on policing, research and collaboration of various wings of policing, criminal justice system and correctional administration.According to an order of the Ministry of Home Affairs, suggestions and opinions are sought from the general public on the draft rules, which will be finalised after a month.The Rashtriya Raksha University in Gujarat will replace the Raksha Shakti University. While the Raksha Shakti University was a state university, the Rashtriya Raksha University will be a central institute, the Act states.The draft rules state the vice-chancellor will suggest a panel of not less than five names each for the post of chairperson and members of the governing body, preferably within eight weeks prior to the likely date of the vacancy.The central government may consider the panel suggested by the vice-chancellor while selecting the members of the governing body.The term of office of non ex-officio members of the governing body shall be for a period of three years or till the time they hold the position by virtue of which they are appointed, whichever is earlier.The term of office of other non ex-officio members of the governing body shall be for a period of three years.

The latest was the arrest of Jharkhand-based Stan Swamy, an octogenarian Jesuit priest.The violence had occurred on January 1, 2018. As many as 16 high profile activists have been booked, including under UPAA and sedition law.“UAPA and Sedition Law are grossly misused. They should be removed from the statute book ,” Yechury said.Responding to a question, he said that consultations among opposition parties are on to build a coalition against the BJP-led dispensation.Raja said: “The present dispensation talks of Left-wing extremism, but what about right-wing extremism.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-laws-yechury-raja-hail-punjab-govt-move-159061
21-10-2020||New Delhi||Govt replaces ‘safai karamchari’, ‘kahar’ categorisation for CAPF jawans with MTS, kitchen services||The government has done away with service categorisations like safai karamchari, kahar, farash and masalchi for the lowest ranks of paramilitary jawans and replaced them with professional designations like multi-tasking staff and kitchen services.The Union Home Ministry recently issued an order to all paramilitary or Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and directed them that all constabulary recruitments in these services be advertised and named as per the new nomenclature.The CAPFs, every recruitment cycle, hire hundreds of jawans for rendering various administrative works for the combat troops of these forces, like cooking, cleaning, gardening, washing and some other daily jobs.As per an order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the post of constable daftary (office boy), farash and safai karamchari (cleaner) and peon have been “merged” and now will be known as constable MTS or multi-tasking staff.Similarly, as per the order accessed by PTI, the posts of cook, water carrier, butcher, waiter, masalchi (kitchen helper who works with preparation of spices), table boy and kahar (helper for cleaning and other activities) have been merged and will now be known as constable for kitchen services.“These decisions have been taken by the ministry on the recommendations of a committee that was appointed by the MHA under the chairmanship of an ITBP officer. The aim is to have a professional and respectable designation for the jawans who are at the bottom of the hierarchy in these forces,” a senior ministry officer said.Also, the two broad categorisations will help in a uniform recruitment policy in these forces who engage hundreds of such personnel for a variety of administrative duties that run a combat unit of troops, he said.There are no financial implications in doing away with these archaic designations, he added.A CAPF officer said the move to re-name these categorisations “does justice to the aspirations of the personnel who apply for and undertake these jobs and does away with the age-old designations which do not evoke respect”.”A lot of these personnel do not feel it respectable to mention their service designation among their friends and family.

21-10-2020||Patna||Chirag hits out at Nitish,says he can return to CM chair only by highlighting Modi’s work||Hitting campaign trail after end of   rituals connected with his father Ram Vilas Paswan death, LJP president Chirag Paswan on Wednesday again attacked Nitish Kumar saying he has no development record to show and could return to chief ministerial chair only by highlighting work done under Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the last six years.Chirag unveiled vision document of his party “Bihar first Bihari first” promising setting up a youth commission, creating portal for providing employment and promoting dairy in Bihar on the pattern of Denmark.Continuing with his tirade against Kumar, the LJP president charged the chief minister with having “anti-youth” thinking and promoting casteism and communalism on the basis of which “development can’t be imagined.”“Since you have not done any commendable work in the past five years, you can return to the CM chair only by highlighting the developmental work of Prime Minister in the past six years,” Chirag told reporters.A day after photograph showing him touching feet of Kumar at the shradha function of his father on Tuesday which people thought ended differences between the two, Chirag who has pulled his LJP out of NDA in Bihar because of Kumar’s “haughty” behaviour towards his father, returned to hard politics resuming his scathing attacks on the JD (U) chief.About touching Kumar’s feet, Chirag has already said “it’s part of sanskaar (tradition) of touching feet of elders on such occasion.”Kumar, Chirag and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav were captured by cameras sitting together at Brahma-Bhoj function of the late Dalit leader here the previous day.The LJP has already released lists of a total of 136 candidates for all three phases of the Bihar polls, with many of its nominees crossing swords with the JD (U) candidates.In the process, the LJP has even fielded candidates against the BJP on nearly half-a-dozen constituencies that included Raghopur where saffron party’s candidate Satish Kumar is taking on Tejashwi Yadav.Releasing the vision document of his party, Chirag said in the past three decades there have been only talks of development in the state but “no real development has taken place”.“Governments have either been formed or fell only through smart social engineering of castes,” the 37-year-old leader, who is faced with a daunting task to lead his party in the Bihar polls without his father and charismatic leader Ram Vilas Paswan, said.“Sometimes I wonder seeing how you encourage casteism.No development can be imagined under a man who has been encouraging casteism and communalism,” he said taking a swipe at Kumar.“You divided Dalits by creating a sub-section of Mahadalits and divided backward castes by forming extremely backward castes,” he said to drive home his point.Criticising Kumar for not creating sufficient jobs for the youths, the LJP president trashed his argument that industries were not coming to the state as it is land-locked.“Even Punjab and Haryana are land-locked how they have progressed,” he asked.“While no new industry came in the state, those already existing have been closed,” he said.He also took a jibe at Kumar for ridiculing rivals claim of generating jobs if voted to power by dubbing it as thoughts of “inexperience” and reminded him that he himself has graduated in politics from student politics.Kumar has been ridiculing Tejashwi Yadav’s announcement of providing 10 lakh jobs if voted to power.He also trashed Kumar’s claim of substantial improvement in the healthcare facilities in the state and said there is shortage of doctors in many hospitals besides there are very few women doctors.The LJP president said that Kumar was propagating development in the state by claiming work done by the centre as his own.“There was a time when you did not want to see Modi out of jealousy towards him and today you are winning applause from people by falsely claiming the works of the centre as your own,” Chirag said.The vision doocument talked about linking rivers to end the problem of flood and drought in the state.He said that the vision document has been prepared on the basis of opinion of nearly four lakh people of Bihar which encompasses all existing problems of the state.The document promised reserving some seats in private schools for economically deprived sections of the society and creating single window system to encourage setting up of new industries.It also emphasised on encouraging religious tourism and a probe into “corruption prevalent in implementation of ‘saat nischay’ (seven resolves) under Kumar government to punish those found guilty of looting public money.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chirag-hits-out-at-nitish-says-he-can-return-to-cm-chair-only-by-highlighting-modis-work-159053

21-10-2020||New Delhi||Half of working adults worried about jobs, 2/3rd expect employers to help them retrain: WEF||More than half of the working adults globally are concerned about losing their job in the next 12 months, including 57 per cent in India, but more than two-thirds are hopeful that their employers will help them retrain for new employment opportunities, a global survey showed on Wednesday.The survey, released at the World Economic Forum’s ‘Jobs Reset Summit’ being held online, also showed wide variations between countries, while an average of three in four workers in Russia feared job losses, it was just one in four in Germany.In India, nearly 57 per cent of respondents said they are ‘concerned’ about their jobs—over 25 per cent are ‘very concerned’ and 31 per cent are ‘somewhat concerned’.Globally, 54 per cent concerned about job losses in the next 12 months, the WEF-Ipsos global survey of more than 12,000 working adults in 27 countries showed.The prevalence of job-loss concern was highest at 75 per cent in Russia, followed by 73 per cent in Spain and 71 per cent in Malaysia. Germany scored the best with 26 per cent, while it was 30 per cent in Sweden, and 36 per cent in the Netherlands and the US.However, 67 per cent of workers worldwide said they can learn skills needed for the jobs of the future through their current employer. Nearly nine in 10 workers in Spain think they can gain essential new skills on the job, whereas fewer than half in Japan, Sweden and Russia.Across the 27 countries, perceived ability to learn and develop those skills on the job was found to be the most widespread in Spain (86 per cent), Peru (84 per cent), and Mexico (83 per cent) and the least common in Japan (45 per cent), Sweden (46 per cent), and Russia (48 per cent). India also scored very high at 80 per cent.WEF Managing Director Saadia Zahidi said: “The current crisis means that the job creation rate has gone significantly down compared to two years ago but there is an optimistic scenario overall compared to the rate of job destruction”. The countries where those who can gain new skills on the job outnumber those who are concerned about losing their job by the largest margins are the US and Germany (by 40 points).In reverse, job loss concern is more prevalent than perceived ability to acquire skills in Russia (by 28 points) and, to a lesser extent in Malaysia, Poland, Japan, Turkey, and South Korea.

21-10-2020||Kahalgaon (Bihar)||BJP-JD(U) alliance as 'superhit' as opening pair of Sachin-Sehwag in cricket: Rajnath Singh at Bihar poll rally||Calling the BJP-JD(U) partnership as "superhit" as the opening pair of Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag in cricket, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said one could debate on the quantum of development done by the alliance government in Bihar, but no one could point a finger at Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on corruption.Attacking the opposition RJD, Singh said the people had witnessed its 15-year tenure and could see the difference between its "misrule" and the good governance of the Nitish Kumar-led alliance government.Addressing a rally here in Bhagalpur district ahead of the Assembly polls beginning October 28, Singh said, "The alliance of the BJP and the JD(U) is as superhit as the opening pair of Sachin and Sehwag of Indian cricket team."     He said the alliance government had provided basic facilities of electricity,  road and water, which Bihar lacked for decades."People have seen the 15-year rule of 'lalten' (RJD's poll symbol lantern) and they have also seen the development of Bihar during the BJP-JD(U) alliance government. The performance of these two governments cannot be compared. The state transformed under the NDA government," said Singh.Praising Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his deputy and BJP leader Sushil Modi, Singh said there were no charges of corruption against them."I am not making this claim that Nitish Kumar has done everything for Bihar. It could be debated whether he has done enough work or less work or more was required to be done, but there can be no debate on their integrity," said Singh.Singh said no one could point a finger at Kumar on the issue of corruption.Taking potshots at the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Singh, speaking in local Bhojpuri language, said 'lalten' has cracked and its oil has leaked and nothing would work now.He also spoke at length about various welfare schemes of the Modi government such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.Singh said welfare schemes of the Modi government not only empowered the poor and the downtrodden but also raised their standard of living.Speaking about the soldiers of the Bihar Regiment who sacrificed their lives during a violent standoff with Chinese soldiers at the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Singh said he was thankful to the people of the state for their bravery."You all know what happened at Galwan Valley, it was Bihar Regiment soldiers who saved the pride of our motherland. They sacrificed their lives and I thank all of you for their sacrifice," said Singh.Polls to the 243-member Bihar Assembly will be held in three phases – October 28, November 3 and November 7 – and the counting of votes will take place on November 10.The BJP-JD(U) combine is pitted against the grand alliance of the RJD, the Congress and Left parties. Some other smaller parties are also in the fray.

21-10-2020||Erie (Pennsylvania)||India will be most consequential partner for US in Indo-Pacific this century, says Mark Esper ahead of 2+2 Dialogue||India will be the most consequential partner for the US in the Indo-Pacific this century, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said Tuesday ahead of the 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue between the two countries next week.Esper on Tuesday told a Washington audience that he and the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would be travelling to New Delhi next week for the 2+2 Ministerial with their respective Indian counterparts Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.The exact dates of the ministerial have not been officially announced yet.“Secretary Pompeo and I will be there next week. It’s our second 2+2 with the Indians, the third ever for the United States and India. And it’s very important. India will well be the most consequential partner for us, I think, in the Indo Pacific for sure in this century,” Esper said in response to a question during a webinar organized by The Atlantic Council think-tank.To another query, he said, “India is the world’s largest democracy, a very capable country, very talented people. And they face of every day with the Chinese aggression in the Himalayas specifically along that Line of Actual Control.”      “So, like so many other countries in that region, I’ve spoken with them (Indians). I’ve travelled from Mongolia all the way down south to New Zealand and Australia, from as far as Thailand to Palau in the Pacific island countries. They’ll recognize what China is doing,” he said, adding that in some cases, it’s very overt, and in many more cases it’s very opaque, what they’re doing.“But they are putting political pressure, diplomatic pressure, and in some cases like India, military pressure on countries to bend to their way. We just can’t put up with that. We need all countries to follow those international rules-based order, to follow the norms that have served us so well,” Esper said.The issue is not about China’s rise, it’s all about how they rise, said the Defense Secretary.“That’s what we talk about in all these forums. Last week we had a Five Eyes Forum, right, the US, New Zealand, UK, Canada, and UK. Anyways, we have the Five Eyes Forum and we talked about the challenges in the Indo-Pacific and how do we cooperate together, how do we confront these challenges to sovereignty, to the international rules-based order, to freedom of navigation,” he said.The Indo-Pacific is a biogeographic region, comprising the Indian Ocean and the western and central Pacific Ocean, including the South China Sea. China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, though Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam claim parts of it.“So, you see a lot more closer collaboration come out, and this will be reflected in our meetings next week in New Delhi as well when we travel there,” Esper said, adding that there are a number of things that the US has been discussing with the Indians for some time.“We’ve made good progress on a number of them, but we’ll release information on that when it’s appropriate,” Esper said.Formed in 2018, the 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue meetings reflect the two country’s ever increasing convergence on the strategic issues.“Last year, we conducted our first ever tri-service military exercise, Tiger Triumph, with India. And in July, the USS Nimitz conducted a combined exercise with the Indian Navy as it transited the Indian Ocean. We also held our first-ever US-India defense cyber dialogue in September as we expand our collaboration into new domains. Together, these efforts will strengthen what may become one of the most consequential partnerships of the 21st century,” Esper said.

21-10-2020||New Delhi||Air pollution contributes to more than 1,16,000 infant deaths in India, reveals global study||The first-ever comprehensive analysis of air pollution's global impact on newborns finds that outdoor and household particulate matter pollution contributed to the deaths of more than 1,16,000 Indian infants in their first month of life in 2019, a new global study on Wednesday.However, the study found progress in reducing household air pollution exposures but levels stagnant for outdoor PM2.5.The report, State of Global Air 2020, said more than half of these deaths were associated with outdoor PM2.5 and others were linked to use of solid fuels such as charcoal, wood, and animal dung for cooking.Long-term exposure to outdoor and household air pollution contributed to over 1.67 million annual deaths from stroke, heart attack, diabetes, lung cancer, chronic lung diseases, and neonatal diseases in India in 2019.For the youngest infants, most deaths were related to complications from low birth weight and preterm birth.Overall, air pollution is now the largest risk factor for death among all health risks, according to the annual State of Global Air 2020 report published by the Health Effects Institute (HEI).The HEI is an independent, nonprofit research institute funded jointly by the US Environmental Protection Agency, industry, foundations, and development banks.The report highlights the ongoing challenge of high outdoor air pollution in South Asian countries.India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal feature among the top 10 countries with the highest PM2.5 exposures in 2019; all of these countries experienced increases in outdoor  PM2.5 levels between 2010 and 2019.Use of solid fuels for cooking, however, presents a pattern of moderate success. Since 2010, more than 50 million fewer people have been exposed to household air pollution.The Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana Household LPG program and other schemes have helped to dramatically expand access to clean energy, especially for rural households.More recently, the National Clean Air Programme has spurred action on major air pollution sources in cities and states around the country.This report comes as Covid-19, a disease for which people with heart and lung disease are particularly at risk of infection and death, has claimed more than 110,000  lives in India.Although the full links between air pollution and Covid-19 are not yet known, there is clear evidence linking air pollution and increased heart and lung disease creating  a growing concern that exposures to high levels of air pollution, during winter months in South Asian countries and East Asia, could exacerbate the effects of Covid-19."An infant's health is critical to the future of every society, and this newest evidence suggests an especially high risk for infants born in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa," said HEI President Dan Greenbaum."Although there has been slow and steady reduction in household reliance on poor-quality fuels, the air pollution from these fuels continues to be a key factor in the  deaths of these youngest infants," he added.Infants in the first month of life are already at a vulnerable stage. But a growing body of scientific evidence from multiple countries, including recent ICMR-supported  studies in India, indicates that particulate air pollution exposure during pregnancy is linked to low birth weight and pre-term birth.These latter conditions, both of which are associated with serious complications, already account for the vast majority of deaths in the neonatal period (4,55,000 in  2019).The new analysis reported in the State of Global Air this year estimates that nearly 21 per cent of neonatal deaths from all causes are attributable to ambient and household  air pollution."Addressing impacts of air pollution on adverse pregnancy outcomes and newborn health is really important for low- and middle-income countries, not only because of the  high prevalence of low birth weight, preterm birth, and child growth deficits but because it allows the design of strategic interventions that can be directed at these vulnerable groups," said Kalpana Balakrishnan, an air pollution and health expert who was  not involved with the study.The State of Global Air 2020 annual report and accompanying interactive website are designed and implemented by the HEI in cooperation with the Institute for Health  Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, and the University of British Columbia.Its findings are based on the Global Burden of Disease Study published in the international medical journal, The Lancet, on October 15. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-pollution-contributes-to-more-than-1-16-000-infant-deaths-in-india-reveals-global-study-159013

21-10-2020||---||Pompeo to travel to Lanka and Maldives as Indo-US partnership in region takes shape||New Delhi, October 21The India-US meeting of Foreign and Defence Ministers (Two Plus Two) will take place next week with US Defence Secretary Mark Esper and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo planning to visit New Delhi to meet their counterparts Rajnath Singh and S Jaishankar, respectively.The announcement came in a speech delivered by Esper at a US think-tank on Tuesday.“India will well be the most consequential partner for us, in the Indo-Pacific for us for sure. It’s the world's largest democracy, a very capable country with very talented people, and they face off, every day, Chinese aggression in the Himalayas,'' Esper said about the purpose of his visit.With India’s acquiescence after its standoff on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China remains unrelenting, the US has put its South Asia strategy in high gear. It began with the US signing a defence framework with the Maldives, followed by a top US diplomat visiting India and Bangladesh. Following the Two Plus Two in New Delhi, Pompeo will travel to Sri Lanka to mend fences, followed by a stopover in Maldives which has come in for increasing Indian attention.Esper said his visit is part of a broader US initiative to strengthen older alliances and develop new ones against Russian and Chinese efforts to build their own global power networks.While India and the US step up their engagements in the neighbourhood, both countries are also attempting to regularise the Quad grouping of India, the US, Australia and Japan in an eventual move towards its formalisation and expansion. The second Quad Foreign Ministers' meeting was held earlier this month in Tokyo where Pompeo in his opening address termed China as “the elephant in the room”.Recently, Australia said it would take part in a large-scale naval drill next month with India, the US and Japan under the Malabar series. Last November, the US held its first-ever tri-services exercises with India.The Two Plus Two meeting, Esper said, would reflect the need for a lot more close collaboration on challenges in the Indo-Pacific region, where China is building its presence. “Together these efforts will strengthen what may become one of the most consequential partnerships of the 21st century,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pompeo-to-travel-to-lanka-and-maldives-as-indo-us-partnership-in-region-takes-shape-158985

We appreciate the significant economic contribution that they make through their activities in the country. To this end, we will also allow visitors, in whichever category, who are coming to stay for a three-month period or more, subject to COVID-19 protocols," it said.In the first two weeks that a special desk had been set up to deal with applications for such travel, mostly from investors in agriculture, manufacturing, mining and tourism, 3,113 had been approved, according to the department."These numbers show that on an average, 335 investors a day applied to visit the Republic, sending a strong message that South Africa remains an attractive investment destination," it asserted.

21-10-2020||India said that as a former colony it had always been in the forefront of the struggle against colonialism and apartheid since its own independence over seven decades ago||'Principle of self-determination continues to be deliberately misused by particular delegation', India slams Pak at UN||United Nations, October 21In a thinly-veiled reference to Pakistan, India said the principle of self-determination continues to be "deliberately misinterpreted and misused" by a particular nation and it was not established by the UN to be used as a justification for undermining the territorial integrity of any member state."Since the principle of self-determination, as considered on the agreed agenda of this committee, continues to be deliberately misinterpreted and misused by a particular delegation, it is pertinent to highlight once again that the United Nations has established the principle as a vehicle for the worthy cause of decolonisation of the 17 Non Self-Governing Territories (NSGTs) on the agenda of this committee, and not as a justification for undermining the territorial integrity of any member state," India said in a statement on 'NSGTs and Decolonisation'.India said it strongly believes that pursuing a pragmatic approach towards decolonisation would surely lead to fulfilment of legitimate wishes of the people of NSGTs."We must also strive to enhance cooperation with international agencies and actors and channelise resources for the 17 NSGTs. This would surely enable them to build capacities in their just and noble quest towards achieving long-cherished goals," the statement said.India said that as a former colony it had always been in the forefront of the struggle against colonialism and apartheid since its own independence over seven decades ago.Since the creation of the United Nations, more than 80 former colonies have gained their independence and joined the family of United Nations. "However, the process of decolonisation that began with our own independence remains unfinished," it said on Tuesday.In 2011, the General Assembly had to proclaim the current decade, 2011-2020, as the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, a period which is coming to an end this year. India noted that there still remain 17 NSGTs, which are in various stages of the decolonisation process on the agenda of this committee."We need to step up our efforts to conclude this long-drawn process," India said.

21-10-2020||New Delhi/Beijing||Chinese soldier who strayed across LAC in Ladakh’s Demchok sector released||The Chinese soldier, who was apprehended by the Indian Army in the Demchok sector of Eastern Ladakh on Monday, has been handed over to China, official sources said on Wednesday.Corporal Wang Ya Long was handed over to the Chinese military on Tuesday night at Chushul-Moldo border point in eastern Ladakh, sources said in New Delhi.The Indian Army on Monday had said that the Chinese soldier had "strayed" across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Demchok sector.In Beijing, a statement by the Chinese Ministry of Defence said, "According to the relevant agreement between China and India, the Chinese PLA soldier, who went missing while helping local herdsmen find the lost yak near the China-India border on Sunday, had been returned to the Chinese border troops by the Indian Army early on the morning of October 21, 2020.”The incident had come amid a massive deployment of troops by the two militaries in the region following the border standoff.On Monday night, spokesperson for the Western Theatre Command of the PLA, senior colonel Zhang Shuili had said, "China hopes that India will hand over soon the Chinese soldier who got lost in China-India border areas on the evening of October 18 when helping local herdsmen retrieve a yak at their request."Both Indian and Chinese armies have deployed over 50,000 troops each along the LAC in eastern Ladakh, including in the Demchok sector following escalation of the five-month-long military standoff that began in early May.The incident occurred at a time when India and China are preparing to hold another round of Corps Commander-level military talks later this week with a focus on carrying forward their discussions on the disengagement process in eastern Ladakh. The two sides have so far held seven rounds of high-level military talks on the border faceoff.The seventh round of talks was held on October 12.There was no breakthrough on the disengagement of troops from the friction points so far.India has all along been maintaining that the onus is on China to carry forward the process of disengagement and de-escalation at the friction points in the mountainous region.Following the sixth round of military talks, the two sides had announced a slew of decisions, including not sending more troops to the frontline, refraining from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground and avoiding taking any actions that may further complicate matters.This round was held with a specific agenda of exploring ways to implement a five-point agreement reached between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at a meeting in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) conclave.The pact included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC.

21-10-2020||New Delhi||Malabar exercise and Quad: India’s key role||With Australia deciding to rejoin the Malabar exercises to make the affair a quadrilateral engagement of the navies of India, the US and Japan, this year once again rekindled the debate over militarisation of the Quad.In 2007, the navies of these four countries plus Singapore were associated in a joint exercise in the Bay of Bengal, leading to China raising the red flag over the purpose of such an engagement. Subsequently, Australia withdrew only to renew its request to be back in the fold some three years ago, at least as an observer.The decision to extend invitation by New Delhi and acceptance by Canberra comes in the backdrop of the altering geo-political landscape in the region. It acquired an urgent undertone since this summer after China and India militaries are in a state of standoff in Ladakh.It was during 2017 when leaders of all four countries decided to renew Quad, first at the level of officials and then at the ministerial level, with the latest at Tokyo earlier this month. The October 6 meeting was the first stand-alone engagement unlike the previous one held on the sidelines of a multilateral event.The broad areas of convergence arrived at are on Covid-19 response and recovery, regional security and maritime issues, counter-terrorism, supply chains, humanitarian assistance and disaster Relief, cyber security and ASEAN-led architecture in Indo-Pacific.Now with the navies of all four countries working together, it will be a demonstration of what the power of quadrupling can do in the Indo-Pacific region, a characterisation of the region that Beijing loathes. Previously Chinese strategic commentators sought to dismiss Quad as an “Asian NATO” or as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at Kuala Lumpur on October 13 as Índo-Pacific-NATO”.Wang was quoted as having said Quad pursues to “trumpet the Cold War mentality and stir up confrontation” among different groups and blocs to stir geopolitical competition and maintains dominance of the US. “In this sense, this strategy is itself a big underlying security risk. If it is forced forward, it will wind back the clock of history”.That India plays a critical role in the revival and then pushing forward the Quad architecture in military terms can be gauged by the sudden turn of attention to the news since Monday. Now with New Delhi deciding to lend its weight with other regional powers, it is Beijing’s turn to keep a close tab.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/malabar-exercise-and-quad-indias-key-role-158740

They say there is a need for clarity on the authority that can pass Bills regarding subjects on the concurrent list.“I am confident that the Acts cannot be compared. We will examine the Bills passed by Punjab and take action keeping in mind the best interest of farmers,” the minister said.Officials say whenever states pass such laws (on matters on the concurrent list), these are sent to the Home Ministry for scrutiny. “The judicial wing of the MHA then consults the Law Ministry after which these Bills are sent to the President for assent,” an official said.Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan said: “If the said Bills are covered under Entry 14 of the State List under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the state is entitled to enact the laws. However, if Punjab is claiming its legislative competence under Entry 33 of the Concurrent List, the Bills will have to be sent to the President.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-for-farmers-will-study-bills-tomar-158660
21-10-2020||New Delhi||Opinion poll gives NDA edge in Bihar||The ruling NDA in Bihar comprising the BJP, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U), Jitan Ram Manjhi’s Hindustan Awam Morcha (HAM) and Mukesh Sahni’s Vikassheel Insan Party (VIP) are set to retain power in the state if the opinion poll projections by Lokniti-CSDS are to be believed.The opinion poll agency has given the NDA a “definite edge” over the principal Opposition alliance led by the RJD and comprising the Congress and the Left parties.According to the survey, the NDA enjoys a lead of 6 per cent in vote share over the RJD coalition.The opinion poll data, released today, projected that the ruling NDA would bag 38 per cent votes in the three-phased Bihar Assembly elections beginning October 28. It put the vote share of the key Opposition front, named Mahagathbandhan or grand alliance, at 32 per cent.While the opinion poll shows the NDA ahead, it says the ruling alliance’s cumulative vote share would be down by about 5 per cent compared to the last Assembly elections.
