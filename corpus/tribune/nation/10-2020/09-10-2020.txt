However, it will not affect the government’s decision to corporatise Ordnance Factory Board, the Defence Ministry said in a statement issued late this evening.The Defence Ministry has also stated that the move to corporatise the OFB into government owned entities, which the employees’ unions had termed as unilateral and demanded its withdrawal, is not privatisation and that the interests of the existing employees would be safeguarded.Both sides also agreed that the matter required further discussions and deliberations.The Defence Ministry has also invited the representatives of the federations to meet the Secretary, Department of Defence Production, and the Empowered Group of Ministers to put forward their issues and grievances.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/defence-civilian-employees-call-off-indefinite-strike-against-move-to-corporatise-ordnance-factories-153369

Wing Commander Gajanad Yadava and Warrant Officer AK Tiwari carried out the successful skydiving jump from a C-130J Super Hercules aircraft.The landing at such an altitude is extremely challenging due to low oxygen levels combined with low air density and rough and inhospitable mountainous terrain. Both the Air Warriors have shown a high degree of professionalism, grit and determination in overcoming adverse conditions.This unique achievement once again demonstrates the capability of the IAF to scale new heights despite the challenges and remain committed to its motto of Mission, Integrity and Excellence, an official statement issued today said.The IAF has always made sustained efforts towards capacity building and promotion of adventure activities at the grass root level that motivate young Air Warriors and instill the qualities of camaraderie, team spirit, physical and mental courage.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/landing-at-17-982-feet-near-khardung-la-indian-air-force-skydivers-create-new-record-153367
09-10-2020||New Delhi||CBI books HDIL promoters Wadhawans, others for Rs 200-crore loan fraud in Yes Bank: Officials||The CBI has booked HDIL promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and Sarang Wadhawan, along with former PMC Bank chairman Waryam Singh and other directors of the firm, in an alleged Rs 200-crore loan fraud in Yes Bank involving Mack Star company, officials said Friday.It is alleged that loans taken for Mack Star were transferred to settle HDIL liabilities to Yes Bank without intimation to its majority stakeholder and investor Ocean Deity Investment Holdings Ltd (ODIL) in a conspiracy orchestrated by the HDIL promoters, directors and auditors.Sources in the agency said the role of former Yes Bank promoter Rana Kapoor and other senior executives of the bank, not named as accused in the FIR, is likely to come under scanner in the case.After registering the case, the CBI on Friday searched the residences of Rakesh Wadhawan and his son Sarang and former PMC Bank chairman Singh in Mumbai, they said.The agency also carried out searches at nine other premises in Mumbai, including two offices of HDIL, auditor company Ashok Jayesh and residences of other HDIL Directors Lakhminder Dayal Singh, Amanpreet Singh and Senior Vice President Venkatawardhan N Iyenger, all named accused in the FIR, they said.Sarang Wadhawan had reportedly denied any wrongdoing in the transactions.The CBI which received the information through “reliable sources” alleging that Mack Star had developed an office building Kaledonia in Mumbai worth Rs 1,000 crore—Rs 900 crore spent on land and remaining Rs 100 crore towards construction.                 Investor Ocean Deity Investment Holdings Ltd (ODIL) had 78.9 per cent stake in Mack Star. Former Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank chairman Singh and HDIL held remaining 21.1 per cent shares in Mack Star.The investment of Rs 1,000 crore in the building was mostly done by ODIL, the FIR said.Since HDIL had experience in developing real estate, its promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and Sarang Wadhawan were appointed as Directors in Mack Star.    Other directors of HDIL termed “Wadhawans Directors”—Lakhminder Dayal Singh, Amanpreet Singh, Venkatavarathan N Iyengar—also found place as Directors in Mack Star along with Waryam Singh, while ODIL played a passive role in the management of the company.After taking day-to-day control of Mack Star, the Wadhawans also operated bank accounts of the company—a common practice in joint venture between foreign and domestic entities—the CBI FIR said.Article of Association prevented Mack Star from selling assets, taking loans, creating mortgages or entering into contracts over Rs 20 lakh.The promoters of HDIL, which was in severe financial stress, allegedly took advantage of their management control to take six loans worth over Rs 200 crore from Yes Bank during 2011-16 in violation of Article of Association conditions, the CBI alleged.Most of the loan amounts were used to discharge liabilities of HDIL Group and the Wadhawans to Yes Bank, it alleged.While the company was disbursed loan of Rs 200.3 crore, only Rs 138 crore was credited into its current account and the remaining was directly transferred for settlement of HDIL liabilities to the bank, it alleged.Over Rs 135 crore received by Mack Star was also transferred to accounts of HDIL and its group companies on the same dates of disbursement, it alleged.HDIL and its group companies used Rs 96 crore to discharge their liabilities to Yes Bank.It was all allegedly done keeping ODIL, the majority stakeholder, in dark by colluding with the audit firm, Ashok Jayesh and Associates, whose senior partner was a director in HDIL and close to the Wadhawans and had misappropriated two offices owned by Mack Star, the agency said.The loans of Rs 140 crore were ostensibly sanctioned to Mack Star for modification, renovation and refurbishment of Kaledonia which was a new building having construction cost of Rs 100 crore making such a lending fictitious, the CBI said.Yes Bank too sanctioned the loans without fulfilling key condition which required approval from majority stakeholder ODIL, it alleged.“Unidentified officials of Yes Bank deliberately avoided alerting the investor ODIL about these fraudulent loans and disbursed them,” an official said, citing the FIR.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) FIR alleged that entire circular flow of transactions happened within Yes Bank system and accused directors of HDIL and Mack Star and auditors misappropriated the funds to their advantage causing a loss to the bank.

A low-pressure area is the first stage of any cyclone but it is not necessary that every low-pressure area intensifies into a cyclone.However, cyclones usually form in the Bay of Bengal and batter the east coast in October. Under the influence of this low-pressure area and the resultant cyclonic circulation, light-to-moderate rainfall is likely at most places with heavy (6.5-12 cm) falls at isolated places over Andaman & Nicobar Islands on Friday and Saturday.From Saturday, rainfall will also lash Odisha, coastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rayalaseema, interior Karnataka and Marathwada. It will intensify in the areas except for Rayalaseema on Sunday and Monday, the India Meteorological Department said.The sea is also expected to be rough.Fishermen are advised not to venture into the Andaman Sea and east-central Bay of Bengal on October 9-10, along and off Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts and over Gulf of Mannar from early Sunday till Monday forenoon.“Fishermen out at sea in the Bay of Bengal are advised to return to the coast,” the IMD said in a statement.

The decision was taken keeping in view the alarming concerns over the safety and security of children residing in these institutions, it said.These eight states have 1.84 lakh (or nearly 72 per cent) children in child care homes out of a total of 2.56 lakh in the country. The child rights body had directed the district magistrates and collectors of these states to ensure that the children living in these care homes return to their families, preferably within a 100-day period. Those who could not be sent back to their families must be placed for adoption or in foster homes, it had said.The maximum number of children in need of care and protection placed in these homes were in five southern states, “which paints an unsettling picture indicating a pitiable condition of children in these CCIs,” the letter stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-ncpcr-to-spell-out-stand-on-restoring-children-in-care-homes-back-to-families-153351

09-10-2020||Vibha Sharma||Ram Vilas Paswan's death adds another angle to already complicated Bihar elections||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 9The death of Dalit leader Ram Vilas Paswan may have added another angle to the already-complicated diagram of the upcoming Bihar Assembly elections, feel many political observers.With the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) fighting independently this time, the general feeling is that the sad event may help the party he founded consolidate its core votes, but there is more. A sizable number of LJP candidates are seen as BJP ‘proxies’.However, it remains to be seen if the sympathy factor will be strong enough to overcome the anti-incumbency against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led government of which the BJP is also a part. If that happens, the LJP may land votes of other castes, much to the chagrin of Opposition ‘mahagathbandhan’ and BJP ally JD-U.Leaders agree passing away of Paswan has introduced the nuance of uncertainty in the already complicated elections seen as a swansong of Nitish Kumar. Though a section also believes that voters have “become cynical” and the death is unlikely to sway the “average Bihari voter who is more politically intelligent than an average Indian voter”.Besides, “death of tall leaders sway sentiments in South or some extraordinary situations like in the case of Indira Gandhi”, says a senior BJP leader.While some of the goodwill Paswan earned in his more than five-decade-long political career is expected to rub-off on his political heir Chirag Paswan (depending upon his ability to make the connect), for some his ‘Bihar first Bihari first’ slogan is “somewhat divisive and reeks of over-ambition”, especially when in the last Assembly elections the LJP barely managed to win two seats while his father was very much around.This is why many observers say more than causing any real gain to BJP or Chirag, the death may play heavy on prospects of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led JD-U.Engaged in an open feud with the JD-U, Chirag, in his letter to BJP president JP Nadda, accused Nitish  Kumar of “insulting” his father and talked of “wave of disaffection” against him among voters in Bihar."LJP will be free to berate JD-U but Nitish Kumar no longer has the freedom," they say.So far as Chirag is concerned, he has already publicised his future prospects as the post-poll ally of BJP and admiration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.That PM Modi was also fond of late Ram Vilas Paswan is also evident, though the BJP has categorically said that it would back Nitish Kumar as the CM “whoever gets whatever numbers”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ram-vilas-paswans-death-adds-another-angle-to-already-complicated-bihar-elections-153347
09-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi Cabinet approves tree transplantation policy, ‘smog tower’ installation at Connaught Place||The Delhi Cabinet on Friday approved a tree transplantation policy to prevent felling of trees due to development works in the national capital, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, asserting that it will be a first-of-its-kind policy in the country.Addressing an online media briefing here, he said the Cabinet has also approved a proposal to install a ‘smog tower’ in Delhi’s Connaught Place to deal with air pollution.The government has sanctioned Rs 20 crore, and the tower will come up in 10 months, the chief minister said, claiming that it will also be the first of its kind in the world.Both measures have been taken as part of the Delhi government’s ongoing “Yuddh, Pradushan Ke Viruddh (Battle against pollution)” campaign in the national capital.Under the new policy, which will help preserve trees for a clean and green Delhi, agencies concerned will have to transplant 80 per cent of the trees affected by their projects to a new location, Kejriwal said.A dedicated panel of government agencies with track record and experience of tree transplantation is being formed under the policy, he said.“Any department requiring removal of a tree for some development work will seek help from any agency on the panel for transplantation,” the chief minister said.“The agency concerned will have to ensure that 80 per cent of the total transplanted trees survive. Payments for transplantation will be made after one year to ensure this, and if less than 80 per cent of the transplanted trees survive, payment will be deducted,” Kejriwal added.The government will also form local committees, which will include citizens, for checking, monitoring and certification of the tree transplantation exercise.There are old, big shady trees in the city that are like a blessing, but sometimes, due to various development works, trees have to be cut, the chief minister said.The tree transplantation policy passed by the Delhi government is the first by any state in the country, officials said. Under this, 10 saplings will be planted in addition to the whole tree being dug up with the root intact and scientifically transplanted at another location instead of being felled.The chief minister said Delhi will be the second city in the world to have smog towers. The central government is installing a smog tower in Anand Vihar, while the Delhi government will install another in Connaught Place, he said.“The technology of this tower will be different from the one in China. It will suck polluted air from the top and release clean air from the bottom part of the tower. In China, the tower releases clean air from the top,” Kejriwal said.The chief minister added that the smog tower will be installed on a pilot project basis, and if successful, more such towers will come up in Delhi.On Friday, Delhi’s air quality was recorded in the ‘poor’ category but a government agency said it could improve by Sunday because of a likely change in the wind direction.

09-10-2020||New Delhi||Yechury urges Election Commission to 'ensure level playing field'||CPI (M) head Sitaram Yechury on Friday urged Election Commission to ensure level playing field to all political parties in fray in the ensuing Assembly elections in Bihar, especially with regard expenditure on their campaigns.In a letter to Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora, Yechury urged for acceptable and common ground rules, and EC’s direction to all the political parties concerned in the Bihar election in the matter.Besides, he drew EC’s attention to the funding to political parties, particularly in light of the electoral bond scheme.Yechury raised the funding issue in the backdrop of announcement of the poll schedule, even as the validity of Union government’s electoral bond scheme is under consideration of the Supreme Court.He wondered how the EC would discharge its mandate of conducting the poll in the midst of cobweb surrounding such a vital issue.The EC had submitted to the apex court that electoral bonds will signal “serious repercussions on the transparency aspect of political funding of political parties”.In this context, it had contended that donations made through electoral bonds have been taken out of the compulsory reporting norms through changes made in the Finance Act of 2017 and subsequent changes made in the Income Tax Act as well as the Representation of People Act.Also, the CPI(M) leader expressed apprehension at BJP using mass media and social media to its advantage if principles of equanimity and equality were not enforced.“The experience in recent times clearly shows that BJP, armed with its enormous money power, enjoys a disproportionate advantage over all other political parties”, Yechury said.He dredged up the issue of the proper functioning of the EVMs in “real situation” of polling, and the susceptibilities of the VVPAT to possible rigging.The CPI(M) leaders brought them in focus even while EC had gone on a limb past to dispel apprehensions and doubts on EVMs and VVPAT in the past.“Since the VVPAT is exposed to external changes with constituency and candidate/symbol specific information, manipulation in the final EVM recording becomes that much more possible”, Yechury said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/yechury-urges-election-commission-to-ensure-level-playing-field-153341
09-10-2020||Kolkata||Bathinda man with gun arrested at BJP protest rally is a Black Cat commando||Balwinder Singh, a man arrested by Kolkata Police for carrying a gun during BJP’s protest rally in Kolkata on Thursday, is a Black Cat commando and a veteran of the Kargil war.According to “bio-data” of Balwinder (45), tweeted by BJP leader Kailash Vijaybargiya, he was with the Special Forces (6 Para) and had taken part in multiple military operations including Operation Vijay launched by the Vajpayee government to throw out intruders from Kargil.Balwinder, who is originally from Bathinda, received commando training at NSG Training Centre at Manesar. The Special Forces jawan, whose character has been described as “exemplary” in the bio-data, is an expert in handling various types of weapons including AK-47 and the Israeli Tavore.Vijaybargiya took umbrage saying that not only the soldier was roughed up by police, he was further insulted as his turban was removed.“Security personnel Balwinder Singh has been beaten up by the Kolkata Police and his turban has been removed. He is a competent soldier who has done a number of military training courses. The humiliation heaped on such a daredevil by the Mamata regime is painful. The policemen responsible for the act must be punished”, Vijaybargiya, BJP general secretary, who is in-charge of the party’s West Bengal unit, tweeted.According to police, Balwinder Singh is personal security guard of BJP leader Priyanshu Pandey. Both Balwinder and Priyanshu, who were among those taken into custody by the police for violence during the BJP’s “Nabanna Chalo Abhiyan” (March to state secretariat ‘Nabanna’) on Thursday, have been detained.BJP national secretary Arvind Menon also condemned the police action. “West Bengal police have insulted the entire Sikh community by removing the turban of Balwinder Singh. It looks like Mughal rule is back in Bengal. The insult shows that except one community, others have no right to live in Bengal with dignity,” tweeted Menon.BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga also posted a tweet criticising the alleged removal of Balwinder’s turban by police and said the act was reminiscent of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.Video grabs of the incident showed Balwinder being dragged by the police by holding his shirt collar. However, his turban had already come off by then.Brushing aside the criticism, police officials here said it was highly unusual for anyone to come to a protest rally with a loaded pistol (0.32 bore).  The pistol was having a valid licensc but allowed for use in Rajouri only.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bathinda-man-with-gun-arrested-at-bjp-protest-rally-is-a-black-cat-commando-153340

09-10-2020||London||Nirav Modi's remand extended for next extradition hearing on November 3||Fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi was on Friday further remanded in custody during a routine call-over hearing held via videolink at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London.The 49-year-old jeweller, wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, is expected to appear again via videolink from his prison in south-west London for the next scheduled hearing in his ongoing extradition trial on November 3.“I am adjourning the case for the next hearing on November 3 in the extradition case that has been part heard,” said District Judge Karim Ezzat.At the next hearing, the court will be presented with arguments to determine the admissibility of the evidence provided by the Indian authorities.There is at least one further final hearing in the case, expected either in December or early next year, for closing submissions by both sides. A judgment in the case is expected only after the closing submissions.Modi, meanwhile, remains at Wandsworth Prison, where he has been lodged since his arrest in March last year.At a five-day hearing held last month, Justice Samuel Goozee presided over arguments for and against the case for his extradition brought by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED).The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities, played videos in court in support of additional charges of Modi's disruption of the CBI's investigation by causing the disappearance of evidence and criminal intimidation of witnesses.Assurances of adequate prison conditions were also provided by the Indian government, including additional commitments of appropriate mental health care for Modi on being extradited.The defence team, led by barrister Clare Montgomery, sought to not only establish that Modi's actions related to PNB-issued letters of undertaking (LoUs) did not amount to fraud but also deposed witnesses to highlight his fragile mental health condition and a high risk of suicide.The defence has claimed that the conditions at Barrack 12 in Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai, where Modi is to be held on being extradited, do not meet the UK court's human rights criteria.The first set of hearings in the case took place in May, with the hearings last month completing the process to establish a prima facie case and determine if the jeweller has a case to answer before the Indian courts.

09-10-2020||Vibha Sharma||To tackle ‘misinformation’, print farm laws in Punjabi: senior BJP leader Avinash Rai Khanna writes to Tomar||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 9With farmers’ organisations continuing and also threatening to intensify agitation against the new farm laws, senior BJP leader from Punjab Avinash Rai Khanna has given an interesting suggestion to Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar – print the three farm Acts in local language, Punjabi, and distribute them via the government set-up in order to remove all “misconceptions”.In his letter to Tomar, Khanna wrote that “misinformation is being spread regarding the Acts by the Opposition”, the root cause of which was that only copies printed in English and Hindi were available.“It is because of this very reason that whatever the Opposition tells them, farmers believe it and participate in agitations against the laws,” wrote the former BJP vice president.“Keeping this in mind it is important that the laws are printed in Punjabi in the government press and distributed among organisations and institutions in Punjab via the government set-up so that farmers of Punjab know the truth and they are able to see through the Opposition lies,” said Khanna.This will also help the ‘sangathan’ (BJP cadres) make farmers understand the laws in a better way, Khanna added.Notably, farmers in Punjab have rejected the Centre’s offer to initiate a dialogue and resolve the issue. The unions have also warned Capt Amarinder Singh’s government in Punjab  that they would hold protests outside the houses of state Congress leaders unless the government calls a special Assembly to repeal the agriculture Laws passed by the Centre.The Opposition, primarily the Congress, is hopeful the Centre will be forced to give in under the sustained pressure just like it had in 2015 when facing backlash the Narendra Modi government agreed to drop most of the contentious amendments in the Land Acquisition Act of 2013.While that came as a victory for the Opposition, this time BJP leaders are firm that there is “no scope” of such a thing happening with the farm laws.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-tackle-misinformation-print-farm-laws-in-punjabi-senior-bjp-leader-avinash-rai-khanna-writes-to-tomar-153321
09-10-2020||Hyderabad||Boy missing from UP found in Assam after 5 years with help of Telangana Police's facial recognition software||A breakthrough was achieved on Friday when a picture was matched from the database of a missing child from Uttar Pardesh was found lodged in Assam.The facial recognition software, Darpan, developed by Telangana state police, managed to reunite the 13-year-old boy with his family.The boy was identified as Som Soni, son of Ghanshyam Soni, who went missing from Allahabad fives years ago.The Golapara Police of Assam spotted Sam, and admitted him to the local child welfare centre.A routine exercise of matching pictures in the database changed the lives of the child and his parents.According to Telangana Additional Director General of Police (ADGP), Women Safety Wing, Swati Lakra said the breakthrough came as part of routine exercise.Once the Telangana Police was sure of his identity, it informed the concerned SHO of Handia PS, Allahabad.They informed the parents of the missing child. They rushed to the child welfare centre, and identified their son."The software is used in routine to carry out the matching, and often leads to successfully uniting children with their families," said Swati Lakra.Meanwhile, Soni was eight-years-old when he went missing from his house in Allahabad on July 14, 2015. On July 23, that year, Soni was spotted by Golapara police, and taken to a local child welfare centre.Notably, at the beginning of the year, the facial recognition technology faced severe backlash during the elections in Telangana when it was used for tackling fraudulent voting, but now, it is being hailed for tacking a missing child, and uniting him with his parents.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/boy-missing-from-up-found-in-assam-after-5-years-with-help-of-telangana-polices-facial-recognition-software-153319
09-10-2020||New Delhi||No posters outside houses of isolated patients will help reduce COVID-19 stigma: Experts||The Delhi government's decision to do away with the practice of pasting cautionary posters outside the homes of people infected with COVID-19 and isolated inside, will help reduce the stigma attached to the disease, experts said on Friday. However, they also said this has some "disadvantages too".Official sources had said on Thursday that there will be no sticking of posters outside the houses of COVID-19 patients under home-isolation in the national capital. They had said the move is aimed at "minimising the stigma" resulting from affixing of such posters at the front portion of the houses of such patients.Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine at Apollo Hospitals here, termed it a very "positive move"."I think this will help in reducing the stigma people have attached to COVID-19. There is so much stigma that one patient today came to my clinic from all the way from Bihar for a check-up. He feared he had the infection, but his family never got him tested and he just isolated himself back in Bihar," he said.Chatterjee, however, cautioned that this opportunity given to people who are home isolated, "should not be misused"."The infected people should stay at home and not roam around, and show greater responsibility towards the community, by observing all the norms," he said.Chatterjee also underlined the stigma faced by doctors and other healthcare workers who got infected by COVID-19, saying, this new move will come as a relief to them too.Ajit Jain, the nodal officer for COVID-19 management at the State-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, said the decision has both its pros and cons."There is stigma attached to COVID-19. When a poster is pasted outside someone's house, the neighbours start avoiding the family. Even after they recover, people keep away from them," he said.It's because of this fear that people don't get themselves tested for the infection, Jain said.The advantage is that people will come out for testing in large numbers because even if they test positive, there will be no poster outside their homes. They won't have to face peering eyes of others, he said."The disadvantage is that without the poster, no one would know who among their neighbours is COVID-29 positive. When people see the poster declaring home quarantine nearby, they start taking precautions accordingly," he added.The national capital recorded 37 COVID-19 deaths on Thursday, taking the toll to 5,653 while 2,726 fresh cases took the tally to over three lakh, authorities said.The number of people in home isolation incresed to 12,890 on Thursday compared to 12,691 the previous day.The number of containment zones in Delhi rose to 2,734 on Thursday from 2,702 on Wednesday.

09-10-2020||---||SC refuses to cancel CLAT 2020 or stay counselling process||New Delhi, October 9The Supreme Court on Friday refused to quash the Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) 2020 or stay the counselling process for admission to five-year law courses in national law universities on the basis of the test held on September 28.A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, however, allowed a group of aspiring law students to make representations with regard to issues relating to CLAT 2020 before a grievance redressal committee headed by a retired CJI.“In the facts of the present case, we are of the view that ends of justice be served in giving liberty to the petitioners to submit a representation to the Grievance Redressal Committee with regard to their grievance within three days from today. We order accordingly,” said the Bench which also included Justice MR Shah.“We have no doubt that the petitioners’ representation be considered by the Committee at an early date,” it added.Senior counsel Gopal Sankaranarayanan, representing the petitioners, submitted that in the examination, there were technical problems, certain questions and key answers were not correct and the options given by the petitioners were not correctly recorded in the software.On behalf of the consortium of national universities, senior advocate PS Narasimha contended that a decision had been taken in this regard in which three answers were modified and three questions were deleted.“There is already a Grievance Redressal Committee where grievances can be placed. If the petitioners have any grievance, they may file a representation to the Grievance Redressal Committee,” Narasimha submitted.He said that after declaration of the results on October 3, counselling had already started and a large number of candidates had completed their counselling.Alleging technical glitches in CLAT 2020, a group of aspiring law students had on October 4 moved the Supreme Court seeking quashing the September 28 test. CLAT 2020 should be conducted afresh, they demanded, contending there were instances of answers mismatching which vitiated the exam.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-cancel-clat-2020-or-stay-counselling-process-153314

A good discussion on our bilateral cooperation and regional issues. Welcomed his insights and perspectives on recent developments. As a neighbour, India remains committed to peace, prosperity and stability in Afghanistan,” Jaishankar tweeted.On his part, Abdullah said the external affairs minister assured him of India’s “full support” for peace in Afghanistan.“As always pleased to meet HE @DrSJaishankar, the External Affairs Minister of India. We exchanged views on the #AfghanPeaceProcess, bilateral relations, & regional support for peace efforts. He assured me of India’s full support for peace in Afghanistan,” Abdullah said on Twitter.In a meeting on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi conveyed to Abdullah, the chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, that India will always support people of Afghanistan in their quest for peace and meeting their developmental aspirations.Abdullah arrived here on Tuesday on a five-day visit as part of his efforts to build a regional consensus and support for the Afghan peace process.The visit of the influential Afghan leader to India comes in the midst of peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban in Doha.The Taliban and the Afghan government are holding direct talks to end 19 years of war that has killed tens of thousands of people and ravaged various parts of the country.India has been a major stakeholder in peace and stability of Afghanistan. It has already invested USD two billion in aid and reconstruction activities in the country.India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.On September 12, an Indian delegation attended the inaugural ceremony of the intra-Afghan negotiations in Doha while S Jaishankar joined it through video conference.India has been keenly following the evolving political situation after the US signed a peace deal with the Taliban in February. The deal provided for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, effectively drawing curtains to Washington’s 18-year war in the country.The US has lost over 2,400 soldiers in Afghanistan since late 2001.India has also been maintaining that care should be taken to ensure that any such process does not lead to any “ungoverned spaces” where terrorists and their proxies can relocate.India has been calling upon all sections of the political spectrum in Afghanistan to work together to meet the aspirations of all people in that country including those from the minority community for a prosperous and safe future.

09-10-2020||Mumbai||NIA files chargesheet against eight people in Bhima Koregaon case, Father Stan Swamy remanded in judicial custody||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday filed a chargesheet against eight people, including activists Gautam Navlakha and 82-year-old Father Stan Swamy, for their alleged involvement in inciting a mob to violence in Bhima Koregaon near Pune on January 1, 2018, officials said.Swamy, who said he had never been to Bhima Koregaon, was arrested from his home in Ranchi on Thursday evening and brought to Mumbai where he was produced before a court on Friday and remanded in judicial custody till October 23.He is possibly the oldest person to be charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), officials said.Barring one person – Milind Teltumde who is absconding – all other named in the chargesheet for allegedly conspiring against the government are in judicial custody.NIA spokesperson and Deputy Inspector General of Police in the agency Sonia Narang said the chargesheet was submitted before a designated court here.Besides Navlakha and Swamy, the others named in the chargesheet are Delhi University associate professor Hany Babu, Goa Institute of Management professor Anand Teltumbde, and Jyoti Jagtap, Sagar Gorkhe and Ramesh Gaichor, activists of the Bhima Koregaon Shaurya Din Prerna Abhiyaan group.They were arrested during the course of the investigation into the violence on January 1, 2018 in which one person was killed and several injured after clashes at the 200th anniversary celebrations of the Battle of Koregaon near Pune.Navlakha and Teltumbde had surrendered before the NIA in April this year.The NIA chargesheet against the eight does not mention human rights activist Sudha Bharadwaj, who has been in jail since 2018. She was arrested by the Pune Police in the case along with Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira in August 2018.Swamy's lawyer Sharif Shaikh said his client was produced physically before the court. "The NIA did not seek his custody. He is aged. We will peruse the papers and file for a bail," he said.The cleric is the sixteenth person to be arrested in the case, in which people have been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the anti-terror law UAPA.NIA officials said investigations established he was actively involved in the activities of the CPI (Maoist).The NIA also alleged that he was in contact with "conspirators" – Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Hany Babu, Shoma Sen, Mahesh Raut, Varavara Rao, Sudha Bharadwaj, Gautam Navlakha and Anand Teltumbde – to further the group's activities.The agency alleged that Swamy had also received funds through an associate for furthering the agenda. Besides, he is convenor of the Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee (PPSC), a frontal organisation of the CPI(M), the officials claimed.They said literature, propaganda material of the CPI(M) and documents related to communications for furthering the group's programmes were seized from his possession.Ahead of his arrest in the evening, Swamy posted a video on Thursday morning saying the NIA had been interrogating him and had questioned him for 15 hours during a span of five days."Now they want me to go to Mumbai, which I have said that I won't go," he said, citing the pandemic.The video, posted on YouTube, was recorded two days before his arrest."I have never been to Bhima Koregaon for which I am being made an accused," he said.He added that he had asked for questioning through video conference and hoped that better "human sense" would prevail."...what is happening to me is not something unique happening to me alone, it is a broader process taking place all over the country. We all are aware how prominent intellectuals, lawyers, writers, poets, activists, student leaders are all put in jail because they have expressed their dissent or raised questions about the ruling powers of India," Swamy said in the video.He said he was part of "the process" and in a way happy to be so because he was not a silent spectator and was part of the game."I am ready to pay the price whatever be it," said Swamy.The Bhima Koregaon case was taken over by the NIA on January 24 this year. The Pune Police have alleged that the violence was caused following speeches given by members of the group Elgar Parishad on December 31, 2017. Violence broke out the next day.

09-10-2020||New Delhi||India successfully test-fires anti-radiation missile Rudram-1||In a major milestone, India on Friday successfully test-fired a new generation anti-radiation missile from a Su-30 MKI fighter aircraft of the Indian Air Force that can destroy a wide variety of enemy radars, air defence systems and communication networks from large stand-off ranges, officials said.The missile, Rudram-1, is India’s first indigenously developed anti-radiation weapon system and it was test-fired by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), at an integrated test range in Balasore in Odisha at around 10:30 AM, officials said.They said the missile, having a speed of Mach two or twice the speed of sound, is capable of bringing down a wide-range of enemy radar systems, communication networks and air defence systems within a range of up to 250 kilometers.In a statement, the defence ministry said Rudram hit the radiation target with “pin-point accuracy” and that the test established India’s capability to develop long range air launched anti-radiation missiles.The flight testing of the missile comes in the midst of India’s bitter border row with China in eastern Ladakh.“Rudram was successfully flight tested today onto a radiation target located on Wheeler Island off the coast of Odisha,” it said.“The missile is integrated on SU-30 MKI fighter aircraft as the launch platform, having capability of varying ranges based on launch conditions. It has INS-GPS navigation with Passive Homing Head for the final attack. The RUDRAM hit the radiation target with pin-point accuracy,” the ministry said.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh congratulated the DRDO on successful test firing of the missile, calling it a “remarkable achievement”.“New Generation Anti-Radiation Missile (Rudram-1) which is India’s first indigenous anti-radiation missile developed by @DRDO_India for Indian Air Force was tested successfully today at ITR, Balasore. Congratulations to DRDO & other stakeholders for this remarkable achievement,” he tweeted.The officials said the missile will be integrated into a batch of Su-30 MKI jets of the Indian Force once it is ready for induction.Officials said the missile picks up signals from radiation emitting platforms and systems and neutralises them.“The passive Homing Head can detect, classify and engage targets over a wide band of frequencies as programmed. The missile is a potent weapon for IAF for suppression of enemy air defence effectively from large stand-off ranges,” the ministry said.“With this, the country has established indigenous capability to develop long range air launched anti-radiation missiles for neutralising enemy radars, communication sites and other targets,” it said.In May last year, the Indian Air successfully test fired the aerial version of the BrahMos missile from a Su-30 MKI fighter aircraft.The BrahMos missile provides the IAF a much desired capability to strike from large stand-off ranges on any target at sea or on land with pinpoint accuracy by day or night and in all weather conditions.The IAF is also integrating the Brahmos supersonic cruise missile on over 40 Sukhoi fighter jets which is aimed at bolstering overall combat capability of the force.

What I hear from those involved in the process, it should not take more than 2-3 weeks to finalise that one reliable and accurate technology or a combination of more than one from amongst the four different technologies being analysed," Malka told PTI in an interview.Indian and Israeli researchers have conducted trials after collecting a large number of samples in India for four different kinds of technologies, including a breath analyser and a voice test, that have the potential to detect COVID-19 rapidly.There is also isothermal testing that enables identification of the novel coronavirus in a saliva sample and a test using poly-amino acids that seeks to isolate proteins related to COVID-19.Malka said he has been told by the scientists that tens of technologies were tested to short-list these four technologies, which have now gone through different stages as per different demands to reach the last stage."I am optimistic as all threshold conditions have already been passed," he said.The envoy said this new rapid test is going to be a game-changer and is "a shining example of how fruitful collaboration in science and technology between Israel and India can be." "It will be good news for the entire world. Until we manage to immunise the entire population, this joint operation, which we had named 'open skies', would open the skies in terms of international travel and other economic activities as this can be used at airports and other places by requiring a person just to blow into a tube and the result would be available in 30-40-50 seconds," he said.Besides, this will be very cheap cost-wise as it gives the result locally without the logistical baggage of sending the sample to laboratories, Malka said.Asked about collaboration on vaccine development, Malka said the two countries were always sharing research and technologies.Noting that India has a "very strong relative advantage in manufacturing", Malka said once the vaccine is ready, Israel is hopeful to get the advantage of that."We are helping and supporting each other," he added."We understand that once there is a reliable vaccine that is safe and effective, it will be mostly produced in India," Malka said.Israel understands that when India will manufacture a vaccine, it will also take into consideration the needs of Israel, he added.The Israeli Ambassador also thanked authorities in India for the help and assistance they provided after the virus outbreak to evacuate thousands of Israelis stranded all over India.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also spoke to each other recently on the collaboration in combating the pandemic, he noted.During their telephonic conversation earlier this month the two leaders had assessed the progress in bilateral cooperation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the fields of research, field trials of diagnostic tools and vaccine development.They agreed on the importance of close cooperation in these important areas not only for the benefit of the people of the two countries but also for the greater good of humanity.Malka said healthcare has become an immediate priority area of collaboration between India and Israel due to the pandemic.Asserting that healthcare will be one of the main pillars of collaboration between Israel and India going forward, Malka said he has also been working closely with Ayushman Bharat CEO Indu Bhushan to explore ways to collaborate on the mission.Malka said Israel has always focussed on multi-use technologies and in the case of healthcare also it has been using some technologies used in security areas.He said India was the obvious choice for collaboration when Israel's defence research organisation decided to focus on rapid COVID-19 testing technology.The rapid testing is being jointly developed in cooperation with the Defense Research and Development Directorate of the Israeli Ministry of Defence, India's Defence Research and Development Organisation, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research and Principal Scientific Advisor, India -- coordinated by the ministries of foreign affairs of Israel and India.The samples were collected when a multi-pronged mission from Israel visited India to cooperate on COVID-19 research and development around July-end and early August."The joint research (on rapid testing) is a very successful operation. It was something remarkable to analyse 25,000 samples in nine days. It shows the great potential of the collaboration, expanding the mutual commitment, chemistry and trust between the two countries. Otherwise, we could not have succeeded in such a challenging operation," Malka said.If good results are obtained on rapid testing, the manufacturing hub for such COVID test kits would be India, he said.He said that the special plane on which the Israeli research team had visited India had also brought advanced medical equipment developed especially for fighting COVID-19 in Israel.Malka said he collected the useful equipment from leading hospitals in Israel and brought them with him on board the special plane."We also brought respirators at that time, though there was an export ban on them," the Israeli envoy said.

He also alleged that unidentified men hurled stones at his car earlier as he was returning to his hometown Kannur from Thiruvananthapuram.Police said another case had also been registered on a separate complaint by Abdullakutty, a former Kannur MP, that a group of men allegedly abused him while he was having refreshments at a roadside hotel on Thursday night.The case was registered under IPC sections, including 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention)."Both the incidents were planned and a thorough investigation should be made to nab the culprits and expose the conspiracy behind them," Abdullakutty said.Malappuram Superintendent of Police U Abdul Kareem told PTI that two cases had been registered - one in Ponnani and the other at Kadampuzha police station.A two-time CPI(M) MP, Abdullakutty was expelled from the Left party in 2009 for expressing admiration for Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he was the Gujarat Chief Minister.Kutty later joined the Congress and was elected to the state assembly twice, but was expelled from the party last year, following which he joined the BJP.

Maharashtra has a system of recovering a nominal cost of property cards so it will take a month’s time.“This is the first time that such a large-scale exercise involving the most modern means of technology is being carried out to benefit millions of rural property owners,” the PMO said in a statement.The Prime Minister will also be interacting with some of the beneficiaries during the event.‘SVAMITVA’ is a Ministry of Panchayati Raj scheme which was launched by Modi on the National Panchayati Raj Day on April 24. The scheme aims to provide the ‘record of rights’ to village household owners in rural areas and issue property cards.It is being implemented across the country in a phased manner over a period of four years (2020-2024) and would eventually cover around 6.62 lakh villages, the statement said.

He also made it clear that foreign airlines would not be allowed at the expense of Indian flight operators.The minister said the domestic operations would be allowed provided the passenger number remained healthy during the next 7-10 days.On June 26, the Ministry of Civil Aviation had allowed the airlines to operate maximum 45 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic flights.The ministry had restarted domestic passenger services on May 25 after a gap of two months. But the airlines were allowed to operate not more than 33 per cent of their pre-Covid domestic flights at that time.“Our internal thinking is that we will watch it for another week or 10 days... If the figures (of passengers travelling) continue to be healthy, we will open domestic civil aviation to 75 per cent of the pre-Covid levels,” Puri told mediapersons during a press briefing.Scheduled international passenger flights have remained suspended in the country since March 23 due to the pandemic. But special international flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat Mission since May and under the bilateral air bubble pacts signed with various countries since July.On September 28, Lufthansa had to cancel its flights between India and Germany from September 30 to October 20 as the DGCA withdrew permission, saying there were restrictions on Indians who wanted to travel to that country and that puts “Indian carriers at a significant disadvantage resulting in inequitable distribution of traffic in favour of Lufthansa”.During the press briefing, Puri said, “The issue is not about allowing foreign carriers in or not. We are all for foreign carriers operating here. Make no mistake. But I think the time has come for the message to go out loud and clear that it will not be done at the expense of the Indian carriers.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-to-soon-allow-airlines-to-operate-at-75-capacity-153285

Usually a popular joint before Covid struck, the couple lost their daily income as people started avoiding roadside food.A few days back a video on social media showed Kanta Prasad break down as they could not even sell a plate of chappatis and matar paneer. His frail wife rolled out the rotis and he cooked them over the stove fire. The utensils were spotless clean, the mixed daal looked delicious, said the videographer. "But none are ready to eat them," whimpered Prasad, complaining that through the day they cannot even sell out 500 gm of "daal or sabzi".He cried ruing over their loss of livelihood. — IANS--------------Old couple’s livelihoodEighty-year-old Kanta Prasad and his wife Badami Devi had been maintaining a small food kiosk, ‘Baba ka Dhaba’, near Hanuman Temple in Delhi’s Malviya Nagar since 1988As people started avoiding roadside food due to Covi, the couple lost its daily income||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rush-at-baba-ka-dhaba-after-video-goes-viral-153284

09-10-2020||New Delhi||RBI policy overall positive, growth-oriented, say experts||Financial sector participants on Friday have said the RBI’s decision to keep the key repo rate unchanged is an accommodative approach to manage inflation while keeping growth as target amid the current economic conditions.The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) evaluated domestic and global macroeconomic and financial conditions and voted unanimously to leave the policy repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has said in his policy statement for the bi-monthly monetary policy review.“It also decided to continue with the accommodative stance of monetary policy as long as necessary – at least during the current financial year and into the next year – to revive growth on a durable basis and mitigate the impact of COVID-19, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward,” Das said.Friday’s monetary policy was as aggressively accommodative as possible without cutting the policy rate, said Abheek Barua, chief economist, HDFC Bank.“Given the stance, there is a significant probability of a rate cut in February, if not in December itself as inflation, as we expect, moderates. Has the RBI gone overboard in its effort to support growth? We think not. These are unprecedented times and the Indian economy’s revival efforts are hobbled by the lack of adequate fiscal support. If monetary policy does have to do the heavy lifting, it cannot do it within the confines of a conventional take-no-risks framework,” Barua said.Siddhartha Sanyal, chief economist and head of research, Bandhan Bank, said the RBI had strongly conveyed their commitment to support growth recovery, even when the MPC’s hands were virtually tied in the policy as regards the policy rates.“Steps such as larger quantum of OMOs and OMOs in state government securities should offer cheer for the bond market while on-tap TLTRO and rationalisation of risk weightages of housing loans are meaningful steps in the right direction. We continue to expect discussion on rate cuts to be back on the table later during the year as inflation prints start softening,” he said.The Reserve Bank in its policy statement said it was ready to conduct market operations to assuage pressures arising out of it and dispel any illiquidity in financial markets.“The monetary policy announcement is overall positive and growth-oriented. The RBI Governor has rightly mentioned that focus must be on reviving the economy. Accordingly, the accommodative stance was as expected. The RBI’s assurance on maintaining comfortable liquidity conditions will assure the markets, and at the same time, enable the government to go ahead with its borrowing programme smoothly,” said Padmaja Chunduru, MD and CEO, Indian Bank.The policy measures recognise the growth risk the economy faces and the imperativeness of providing liquidity for growth, said RK Gurumurthy, head of treasury, Lakshmi Vilas Bank.“In what is seen as a comprehensive approach to addressing both inflation and growth, the measures are a continuation of the accommodative stance we have seen over the last nine months. Once inflation, which remains a supply-side disruption currently, softens, the RBI should be willing to cut rates and we expect at least a 35-basis cut this FY. The decision to hold rates steady would also help to protect net interest margin (NIM) of banks as a majority of the loan book is linked to the repo or other floating benchmarks,” Gurumurthy said.Aditi Nayar, Principal Economist, ICRA, said the policy statement struck a confident note on the outlook for economic activity, especially the projection of a mild growth in Q4 FY2021, which appeared to be coloured by the spate of positive data for September 2020, the sustainability of which was as-yet uncertain.The RBI has expected the economic growth to return to positive in the last quarter ending in March next year.For the full year, GDP was expected to decline by 9.5 per cent, with risk tilted to the downside mainly because the external demand is still anaemic, RBI said.“We remain circumspect about generalising these early greenshoots, as they have benefitted from base effects and one-off shifts in some sectors. In our assessment, inflation may not relent appreciably below 5 per cent until December 2020, dimming hopes of a rate cut prior to the final policy meeting scheduled for this fiscal year,” Nayar said.Anshuman Magazine, chairman and CEO, CBRE India, South East Asia, Middle East and Africa, said the RBI had maintained an accommodative stance which was positive for the economy.“The RBI’s decisions to relax loan to value (LTV) guidelines and rationalise risk weights for home loans will further encourage homebuyers and their review of the co-origination model between banks and NBFCs and extension of the scheme to all NBFCs (and banks) will improve the flow of credit in the economy,” he said.“We are hopeful that these measures will strengthen recovery in residential demand and support construction activity as well,” Magazine said.The policy clearly outlines that the focus would continue on reigniting the economy’s growth engine even as inflationary pressures were seen abating in Q3 and Q4, said Nitin Aggarwal, Group CFO, Religare Enterprises Limited.“While FY21 growth is pegged at -9.5 per cent, it’s heartening to note that growth is seen turning positive from Q4. It is likely that the central bank may now go for one more round of rate cut in December to support growth momentum,” he added.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rbi-policy-overall-positive-growth-oriented-say-experts-153282

Ketogenic diet is proven as efficacious, but is restrictive and hard to comply specially in an Indian setting where high fat diets are not the norm. We studied ketogenic, modified Atkins diet and low glycemic index diet in 158 children and found the seizure burden reduced by half in 67 per cent children on ketogenic diet, 52 per cent on modified Atkins diet and 59 per cent on low glycemic index therapy diet. Side effects were the least in children on low glycemic index therapy diet, which also showed high reduction in seizures. Our study shows that disease management guidelines should be modified to include low glycemic index diet,” says Dr Sheffali Gulati of the Centre of Excellence and Advanced Research on Childhood Neuro development Disorders, AIIMS, New Delhi.In India 14 children in every 10,000 suffer from epilepsy. Experts say in 60 per cent patients, epilepsy will get controlled by two anti-seizure drugs, but the rest would need either surgery or dietary therapies.“Surgery option cannot be exercised in all patients and can lead to permanent disabilities in some. Also epilepsy surgery is available only in select centres across the country. The other option is ketogenic diet therapies, which often require the patient to get admitted to the hospital to strictly adhere to protocols in which food has to be weighed. Modified Atkins diet is less severe than ketogenic diet and the third dietary protocol is the low glycemic index therapy diet, which requires very few diet modifications and is the least restrictive,” say researchers who nowshow that low glycemic index diet can deliver well in children with intractable epilepsy.------------------'Surgery can't be exercised in all'Surgery option can't be exercised in all patients and can lead to permanent disabilities in some. The other option is ketogenic diet therapies, which require the patient to get admitted to hospital. AIIMS researchers-----------Diet therapies for drug resistant epilepsy: Key differencesKetogenic diet: Strictly calculated high fat low carbohydrates and restricted protein diet; highly restrictive as each food item has to be weighed for ratios before given to patients; can only be given in hospitals; associated with reduced seizure burden but also with adverse events like nausea, renal stones, lethargyLow glycemic index diet: Any food with glycemic index (term used to measure the speed at which carbohydrates break down in the digestive system to form glucose) less than 55 can be given in this regime which is easy to consume and comply with and is more flexible for children.

Recoveries in India had exceeded new cases for three continuous weeks, it said.“Presently, the active cases stand at 8,93,592 and comprise merely 12.94 per cent of the total positive cases of the country, demonstrating a steady falling percentage of the total cases,” the Ministry said.Also read: With 70,496 new cases, national coronavirus tally reaches 69.06 lakhThe country had 8.97 lakh active cases on September 9, it said.According to the Ministry, a total of 59,06,069 people have recovered from COVID-19 in the country so far and recoveries exceed active cases of infection by 50,12,477.The higher number of recoveries had aided the national recovery rate to further improve to 85.52 per cent, the Ministry said.A total of 78,365 patients recovered and were discharged the previous day while 70,496 fresh infections were reported, according to official data updated at 8 am.“New recoveries in India have exceeded the new cases of COVID-19 for three continuous weeks. The new cases during these three weeks have displayed a steady trend of decline,” the Ministry underlined.This is the result of collaborative action by states and union territories under the Centre’s strategy of comprehensive testing, tracking, quick hospitalisation and adherence to the standard treatment protocol, which has ensured a standardised quality of medical care across public and private hospitals and for home isolation cases.The Ministry said 78 per cent of the 70,496 new cases registered the previous day were reported from 10 states and UTs — Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Delhi.Maharashtra continues to report a very high number of new cases with more than 13,000 cases, followed by Karnataka with more than 10,000 cases, it said.Also, 964 case fatalities were reported the previous day.

Her father said that the family had caught hold of the accused when he was trying to escape, but his relatives came to his rescue.Justice Ananda Sen, while hearing a writ petition filed by the father on Thursday, said the post-mortem report has suggested that the girl sustained 100 per cent burns, her body was charred, but the investigation in the case was carried out in a "casual" manner.He also said that the shocking incident has prompted the court to say that "Hathras (like places) is not only in the State of Uttar Pradesh but also is in the State of Jharkhand.""Surprisingly, rather shockingly the swab of the victim was sent to the laboratory only on May 20. In the entire case diary there is no explanation about the delay caused," Justice Sen observed.The court cannot keep its eyes shut and ignore this type of "lacklustre and shoddy" probe, he said."This heinous incident needs immediate investigation to bring to light the correct fact and to book the accused.The way this investigation proceeded is unsatisfactory."I think this is a fit case where a special investigation team (SIT) be constituted.

He is currently facing trial in Doranda treasury case.The scam, which had come to light in 1992, involved embezzlement of Rs 950 crore from the state exchequer for the purchase of fictitious medicines and fodder for cattle.

There are several high passes and other viable ingress routes in the vicinity of the LAC.According to Army sources, there is a need to keep passes in the region under surveillance at all times and aerial platforms equipped, with day and night cameras, and thermal imagers, along with recording and transmitting facilities, are the best option. “No doubt movement in these areas becomes extremely difficult in high snow during winters and troop deployment along the LAC on both sides thins out, but this time the situation is different,” an officer said. “The possibility of some activity from the other side or even the use of special forces at some specific points cannot be ruled out,” he added.Constant surveillance of areas of interest is an operational necessity which needs to be ensured. The information gained on enemy activities and build up defines the threat perception and formulation of appropriate counter-measures, but without effective aerial surveillance it is difficult to achieve, sources said.The Army is open to the private industry developing heli-kites or mini aerostats to meet its requirements. Given the operating altitude, which may be above 20,000 feet, depth or surveillance required and other operational parameters, commercially available systems may not fit the bill. Equipment would have to be designed or modified as per the required specifications.Heli-kite is a combination of a helium balloon and a kite to form an aerodynamically sound tethered aircraft that uses both wind and helium for its lift. They have military as well as civilian applications and are used for aerial photography, lifting antennas, radio-relay, surveillance, advertising, agricultural bird-control and meteorology. An aerostat is a lighter-than-air aircraft that gains its lift through the use of a buoyant gas like helium hydrogen. Aerostats can be powered or unpowered balloons.The Army is already using small drones for local surveillance and tactical intelligence gathering. Drones, however, require active flying control by operators and their flying time, range and altitude are limited. Tethered heli-kites or aerostats, on the other hand, can be raised to greater heights, carry heavier payload and remain aloft longer, even for days at a stretch.China is known to have deployed aerostats in Tibet for surveillance. In 2007 and 2008, the Indian Air Force also procured two aerostats from Israel and later projected a requirement for up to eight more such platforms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-ladakh-stand-off-army-mulls-employing-heli-kites-aerostats-for-surveillance-of-mountain-passes-153264

09-10-2020||Washington||US strong partner in transforming India's development aspirations into reality: Envoy Sandhu||India sees the US as a very close friend and a strong partner critical to transforming the development aspirations of the country's people into reality, Ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu told Indian American leaders in the IT sector.In a roundtable with The IndUS Entrepreneurs (TiE) Global and TiE DC  on Thursday, he said the scale and size of India offers a huge opportunity to entrepreneurs, investors and corporate leaders."One thing you cannot miss about India is its size and scale. A huge domestic market of 1.3 billion people, the ability to leapfrog in technology, and a large skilled workforce. That's India for you," Sandhu said.Asserting that India would need around USD 4.5 trillion for investment in infrastructure by 2030, the envoy said, "Whatever we do is not enough, given the sheer scale. This is a challenge as well as a huge opportunity." India has launched an information repository of about 7,000 projects, identified under the National Infrastructure Pipeline. Both public and private investment would be the key to financing infrastructure investments, he said."There are immense opportunities for investment across sectors in India. Be it hydrocarbons or renewable energy, health and pharma, IT and digital services, or electronics manufacturing, food processing. You can make in India, and make for the world," Sandhu told members of TiE and entrepreneurs from across the globe.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a great believer in technology as an important tool for socio-economic empowerment."The social welfare programmes that have made an actual difference to citizens in India have been made possible, only through technology."Be it the world's largest biometric programme Aadhaar or the largest financial inclusion programme Jan Dhan Yojana or the largest health assurance programme Ayushman Bharat, all have technology and innovation, embedded in them," Sandhu said.PM Modi addressed two major virtual global summits this week and the US was a lead partner in both. One was on science and technology and the other on Artificial Intelligence for social empowerment, Sandhu said."These summits underline an important message: the spirit of collaboration and cooperation. India has always believed in sharing its resources, expertise and skills to the world. At the same time, we have also been open to new ideas from all corners," he said."We have always believed, the world is one family," Sandhu said.In the post-COVID world, a concerted and focused effort is needed to advance the remarkable business and people-to-people linkages between India and the US, he underlined."We have indeed a come a long way, but we do have a long way to go given the true potential of relations," the Indian ambassador said.

However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo mentioned after meeting External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar that he was looking forward to an India visit towards the year-end.Srivastava said in keeping with the MEA’s standard procedure, an announcement would be made closer to the event. This will also be the case for other high-level multilateral summits such as BRICS, SCO and G-20 where PM Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping will share the stage or a video-screen.Moscow has announced November 17 as the date for the BRICS virtual summit in which India will take over the chair from Russia. Saudi Arabia has announced that it will also virtually host the summit from November 21-22. India will take over the chair of G-20 as well in 2022.The Indo-US Two Plus Two is being seen as especially crucial as Washington wants India to sign a military pact that can be the precursor of more intimate military ties at a time when the Indian Army is locked in a standoff with the PLA on the LAC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indo-us-two-plus-two-by-year-end-mea-153239

09-10-2020||Ram Vilas Paswan (July 5||Leader from Bihar who became voice of Dalits||KV PrasadUnion Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, who passed away after a brief illness following a heart surgery, was a product of the socialist movement that gripped the country in general and Bihar in particular during the late seventies. A follower of Karpoori Thakur and Raj Narain, Paswan was elected to the Bihar Assembly in 1969 and in less than five years catapulted to the national stage.Drawn into the vortex of ‘sampooran kranti’’ of Jayaprakash Narayan, he spent the 1975-1977 Emergency period in jail like hundreds of political leaders in the country. He announced his arrival in Parliament winning the Hajipur Lok Sabha seat with a record margin boasting of an entry into the Guinness Book of World Records. Since then, barring 2009, Paswan was elected to the Lok Sabha for eight terms and to the RS twice.Associated with several parties — the Sampooran Samyukta Party, Janata Party, Lok Dal and Janata Dal — at the turn of the century he formed the Lok Janshakti Party. He served several PMs, including VP Singh, HD Deve Gowda, Atal Behari Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi as a Cabinet Minister, handling the Railways, Chemicals and Fertilisers, Communications, Parliamentary Affairs and Food, Civil Supplies and Public Distribution.Paswan possessed the uncanny acumen of reading the political tea leaves right and switching sides ahead of elections to ally with a party that eventually formed the government at the Centre. Of course, in 2002 Paswan quit the Vajpayee government over riots in Gujarat and worked with the Congress-led UPA, finally coming back to the BJP in 2014, a move he credited to his son Chirag.Forming the Dalit Sena in 1983, Paswan worked to consolidate his position as a leader of the Dalits at a time the Bahujan Samaj Party under Kanshi Ram and later Mayawati was emerging a strong voice for the oppressed classes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/leader-from-bihar-who-became-voice-of-dalits-153201

Weak activity, domestically and abroad, is also likely to depress both Indian imports and exports, said the World Bank’s latest South Asia Economic Focus report.‘Delhi’s response was swift’The Indian Govt’s response to the outbreak was swift and comprehensive. The lockdown was followed by a comprehensive policy package to mitigate the impact on the poorest well as liquidity and financial support for SMEs. — Hartwig Schafer, World Bank VP for South Asia regionThe overall growth in South Asia will contract by 7.7 per cent in 2020, after topping six per cent annually in the past five years.“Informal workers are not generally covered by social insurance and few have savings or access to finance, but the government reworked its social protection architecture especially for them,” said the report.“Reforms in the Indian safety nets programme will help preserve the gains against poverty as nearly half of all households are vulnerable and the majority of the workforce lacks formal social security benefits. We are also encouraged by the recent amendments to India’s social security laws that will help provide coverage to groups of people who were earlier left out from government-assisted programs,” said Junaid Ahmad, World Bank Country Director in India.The pandemic will profoundly transform South Asia and leave lasting scars in its economies. “But there is a silver lining towards resilient recovery. It could spur innovations that improve South Asia’s future participation in global value chains, as its comparative advantage in tech services and niche tourism will likely be in higher demand as the global economy becomes more digital,” said Hans Timmer, World Bank Chief Economist for the South Asia Region.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gdp-may-contract-9-6-wb-153084
