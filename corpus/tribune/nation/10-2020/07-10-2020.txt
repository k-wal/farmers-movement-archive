No domestic passenger flights operated in the country in this period.The top court had, on October 1, also passed directions about the refund and credit shell formation for the bookings and cancellations done during the other time periods around the lockdown.Based on the court order, the DGCA categorised passengers in three categories—those who booked tickets between March 25 and May 24 for travelling within the same period, those who booked tickets prior to March 25 but the travel period was till May 24, those who booked tickets anytime but for a journey post May 24.The regulator said the passengers belonging to the first category must be given a full refund by the airline concerned for the tickets cancelled.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said the airlines should “make all endeavours” to refund the passengers belonging to the second category within 15 days.“If on account of financial stress, any airline/airlines are not able to do so, they shall provide a credit shell equal to the amount of fare collected (to the passenger),” it added The passengers can then use the credit shells to book any ticket by March 31, 2021, the DGCA noted.Those belonging to the third category will be given a refund in accordance with the existing DGCA rules.The Indian aviation industry has been hit hard due to the coronavirus pandemic and as a result, all airlines in the country have opted for cost-cutting measures such as layoffs, leave without pay for the employees etc.Scheduled domestic passenger flight services resumed in the country after a gap of two months on May 25. Currently, airlines are permitted to operate only up to 60 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights.Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in the country since March 23. However, special international passenger flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat mission since May and under air bubble arrangements formed with various countries since July.

07-10-2020||New Delhi||Chinese mission asks Indian media not to call October 10 'Taiwan National Day'||Taiwan has sent a “get lost” message to the Chinese Embassy, which has cautioned Indian journalists from calling October 10 as “National Day of Taiwan’’.“India is the largest democracy on earth with a vibrant press and freedom-loving people. But it looks like communist China is hoping to march into the subcontinent by imposing censorship. Taiwan's Indian friends will have one reply: GET LOST,” tweeted Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.This was in reply to a “letter” from the Chinese embassy emailed to en masse to Indian journalists, “reminding” Indian journalists that there is “only one China in the world, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory. These facts are recognised by UN resolution and constitute the universal consensus of the international community”.“All countries that have diplomatic relations with China should firmly honor their commitment to the One-China policy, which is also the long-standing official position of the Indian government,’’ e-mail from the Chinese Embassy’s Press Section said.It then hoped the Indian media could stick to Indian government’s position on the Taiwan question and not “violate the One-China principle”.It went on to ask the Indian media not to refer to Taiwan as a “country” or “Republic of China”. Its leader should not be called President, “so as not to send the wrong signals to the general public”. Earlier in June when border tensions with China were peaking, Indians living in Taiwan had come out on the streets of Taipei for the first time to thank its government for containing the COVID epidemic. The event had Taiwan government’s indirect blessings. It had nudged companies to sponsor the rally and the top local official graced the opening ceremony.  The Galwan Valley clash occurred two days after expatriate Indians gathered New Taipei City and took out a roadshow for around 120 km. At that time, this gesture was read as a riposte to China for blocking Taiwan’s presence as an Observer at the World Health Assembly, WHO’s marquee event.

The rising nitrous oxide emissions are not compatible with the Paris Agreement climate goals,” say researchers.“Every year more than 100 million tonnes of nitrogen are spread on croplands around the world as synthetic fertiliser, and 100 million more fall onto pasturelands in manure from livestock. The biggest problem is that ever-increasing emissions driven primarily by our fertiliser use accumulate in the atmosphere faster than destruction can occur naturally,” they emphasised.While emissions from synthetic fertilisers dominate releases in China, India and the US, emissions from the application of livestock manure as fertiliser dominates releases in Africa and South America.The highest growth rates in emissions are found in emerging economies, particularly Brazil, China and India, where crop production and livestock numbers have increased, said the study.In the coming decades, N2O emissions are expected to continue to increase as a result of the growing demand for food, feed, fibre and energy, and an increase in sources from waste generation and industrial processes. Opportunities for reducing emissions do exist.There’s no simple alternative to nitrogen fertilisers without greenhouse gas emissions, unlike fossil fuel energy that can be replaced with renewable energies. Food production will always leak some nitrogen, but we can reduce the amount. Lead author Professor Hanqin Tian, director of the International Center for Climate and Global Change Research at Auburn University’s School of Forestry and Wildlife Sciences says: “The dominant driver of the increase in atmospheric nitrous oxide comes from agriculture, and the growing demand for food and feed for animals will further increase global nitrous oxide emissions. There is a conflict between the way we are feeding people and stabilising the climate.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rising-nitrogen-emissions-by-way-of-fertiliser-use-a-challenge-to-climate-goals-152381

After considering all facts and circumstances emerging due to pandemic and keeping a balance between the requirements of campaign by the political parties, (the) Commission has decided to revise the norms of star campaigners,” the letter said.The three-phased assembly elections in Bihar will be held on October 28, November 3 and November 7.Various bypolls to vacant assembly seats across states will take place on November 3 and 7.The Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha seat in Bihar will also go for bypoll on November 7.Political parties, which have already submitted a list of star campaigners, will have to resubmit a revised list with lesser number of such celebrity campaigners within the stipulated period.“Request for permission for the campaigning by star campaigners shall be submitted to the district election authorities at least 48 hours before the start of campaign so that all necessary safety measures are put in place by all concerned stakeholders well in time,” the letter said.

07-10-2020||Vibha Sharma||Rajnath Singh, Tomar hold talks with farmer leaders||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 7Amid the ongoing agitation against the three agriculture Acts, the government is touching base with leading farmer representatives to put forth its point of view. Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Narendra Singh Tomar on Tuesday interacted with farmer leaders.The meeting was moderated by Chairman of the Indian Chamber of Food and Agriculture MJ Khan. One of the key concerns expressed by them was that the MSP will go and their key demand was that there should be a law against purchase below the MSP. They wanted the two demands to be factored into the legislations, according to an official statement.Responding to issue regarding making purchase below the MSP a punishable offence, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh however said it will hamper the functioning of the market and adversely affect the farmers. “If the quality of grains is not good the buyer will turn him back. But today the farmer is at least able to sell on negotiated price,” Singh was quoted as saying.He added that “there is no reason for apprehension on this account and the MSP was never part of legislation”. Tomar added that the Centre has declared MSP after these legislations and the procurement is being done accordingly, hence there should be no confusion.According to the statement, five Padma Shri awardees participated in the meeting along with five other leading farmer leaders. “All farmer leaders expressed confidence” that the legislations will be helpful to farmers and provide extra options as the current ‘mandi’ system is not adequate to serve them.“In fact less than 20% farmers are able to access the current system of procurement by the mandi system and local traders. The current system is cumbersome and exploitative and as organised sector gets into the agri market, farmers will get more options to choose,” Padma Shri Kamal Singh Chauhan was quoted as saying. He was backed by Ram Saran and BB Tyagi from UP, Narendra Singh from Haryana and Jagdish Pareek from RajasthanPushpender Singh, president, Kisan Shakti Sangh; Harpal Singh Grewal, Organic Movement; Man Singh Yadav, Chairman, Agri Board; and Bijendra Singh Dalal, president, Haryana Pragatisheel Kisan Manch also expressed confidence in the long term benefits of these legislations. They also hoped that farmer industry partnerships will actually benefit the farmers. Pushpender Singh, however, suggested that sale-purchase of MSP crops below the support price be made cognisable offence.Agriculture Minister Tomar listed down benefits of the legislations in terms of private sector participation in procurements and partnerships for investments in infrastructure development, logistics, supply chain, processing, agribusinesses and trade, as per the statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajnath-singh-tomar-hold-talks-with-farmer-leaders-152378

So that is very clear,” Sitharaman noted.On the three farm-related laws recently enacted by the Centre, Sitharaman said the protests being carried out in various states were based only on “political motives”.“They are opposing the laws only for politics, even forgetting their own promises made in their 2019 election manifesto,” she said, referring to the Congress manifesto.“We feel they included that in their manifesto only to hoodwink the voters and grab votes.Did you tell lies then or telling them now?” she asked.Sitharaman recalled that the BJP too made the promises in its election manifesto and fulfilled them as Prime Minister Narendra Modi desired those reforms for the benefit of the farmers.The Finance Minister wondered why the opposition leaders did not speak in Parliament when the Bills were being discussed.“When the Bills came up for discussion in the Rajya Sabha, upon clearance in Lok Sabha, the opposition did not raise any questions.They did not display their leadership and merrily sat behind some fringe groups that created trouble in the Rajya Sabha, or joined the ruckus in tearing off the Bills.But they did not raise any questions,” Sitharaman lashed out.Asked if contract farmers would be brought under the Income Tax net, the Finance Minister said they had not given any such thought so far.“Please do not make any issue of it,” she said.Earlier in the day, Sitharaman interacted with farmers at a field in Jakkula Nekkalam village near Gannavaram airport and elicited feedback on various farm-related issues.She took part in a programme in the evening, organised by the BJP to educate farmers on the new farm-related laws enacted by the Centre. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/revival-of-economy-post-covid-lockdown-clearly-visible-says-sitharaman-152372
07-10-2020||New Delhi||Government ensured higher crop procurement during COVID pandemic: Jitendra Singh||Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Wednesday said the government ensured higher crop procurement during COVID-19 pandemic, which is an indication of the sensitivity with which Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the team led by him are committed to respond to the needs of farmer community during crisis times.Interacting with farmers, panchayat representatives and local activists of Jammu and Kashmir’s Basohli and Reasi areas, the minister cited figures to state that despite COVID-19, the procurement of wheat was 15 per cent higher than the last year and about 390 lakh tonnes of wheat was procured throughout the country.“Despite lockdown measures in place, the Centre has ensured procurement from the doorsteps of farmers,” said the Minister of State for Personnel.He cautioned that some vested interests were spreading myths about farm legislations, which need to be countered at all levels.Referring to suicides by farmers, the Jitendra Singh reiterated that with the pro-farm measures and new farm laws in place, the farmers would have a window of relief and it would lead to farm prosperity.He said the new measures would usher in a new revolution in the farm sector and the young generations will take up this vocation as a new and profitable business.Singh said the farm reforms introduced by Prime Minister Modi allow liberty to choose the crop cost and give the farmers the freedom to have more buyers and flexibility in choosing the price at which they sell their produce.He categorically stated that a contract agreement would guarantee the farmers to get the fixed price.Moreover, the new legislation clearly prohibits sale, lease or mortgage of farmers' land, said the minister.Singh appealed to all activists to reach out to each and every farmer in every village and explain to them the big conspiracy being hatched against farmers.This, he said, would enable the agricultural community to avail of the enormous welfare initiatives introduced by the Prime Minister.Referring to government initiatives during the pandemic for agricultural sector, the minister noted that the Centre had distributed Rs 75,000 crore for procurement and other welfare measures for farmers.He said even the wheat procurement centres increased threefold during the coronavirus crisis and similarly procurement centres for pulses and oilseeds also increased nearly threefold during the pandemic.Singh reiterated that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and Agricultural Produce and Livestock Market Committee (APMC) will continue and will never be removed at any cost.

To prevent spread of COVID-19 infection, it is important that necessary preventive measures are followed for such events,” said the Centre in the SOPs which require states to identify spatial boundaries and prepare detailed site plans to facilitate compliance with thermal screening, physical distancing and sanitisation to venues.“In case of events that run for days or weeks, the crowd density doesn’t remain the same and usually peaks around certain hours and previously known auspicious days. Planning for the event should specifically factor this so that crowds are regulated and managed to ensure physical distance and frequent sanitisation,” the Centre said.The guidance adds that in case of rallies and immersion processions the number of people should not exceed a prescribed limit and physical distancing and wearing of masks must be ensured.Visitors to venues are to be allowed only after thermal screening.Among generic preventive measures the guidelines require everyone to maintain a minimum distance of 6 feet in public places; wear masks; practice frequent hand washing with soap and follow respiratory etiquette.The guidelines bar touching of statues, idols and holy books in religious venues and add that, “In view of potential threat of spread of infection, as far as feasible recorded devotional music and songs may be played and choir or singing groups should not be allowed.”The guidelines come at a time when Kerala has suddenly reported a massive surge in new cases linked to Onam festivities.Of the over 72,000 new cases reported today, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala accounted for more than half.India’s total cases neared 6.8 million today with 1.05 lakh deaths.Although recovery rate has surged to 85 pc, much of the recent gains in keeping active infections below 10 lakh for 16 straight days would depend on how India fares during festivals and if people exercise precautions.Of the 6.7 million cases as of today, over 5.7 million have recovered.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/masks-6-ft-distance-in-public-places-centre-issues-guidance-for-covid-time-festivities-152369

He was aided by orphanage owner Chielukuri Vijaya and her brother, Surapaneni Jayadeep, the police have revealed.The victim had confided in her aunt on July 31, who in turn has lodged a complaint with the police. After the death of the girl, her body had been sent for the chemical examination that ruled out poisoning. After a committee was formed to investigate the case, the police said they were in the process of filing a charge-sheet.Swathi Lakra, a senior officer investigating the case told the media that the police were talking to the four girls who have come forward and given their statement to a magistrate. Now we have enough material for prosecution.After the girl was enrolled in the orphanage in 2015, her abuse started in 2019. The girl had told the police that the warden, Vijaya, allegedly took the girl to a room on the fifth floor where the accused Venugopal gave her a juice laced with sedatives and raped her.When she reported the matter to the warden, he threatened her and asked her not to reveal the incident to anyone. The abuse allegedly continued several times for several months. Other girls in the institution have alleged that there had been a similar sexual assault on another girl at the orphanage.The police propose to bring all this into the charge-sheet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hyderabad-four-inmates-record-statement-saying-girl-in-the-orphanage-was-raped-152362

We have seen a 27 per cent month-on month increase in search queries for popular destinations and getaways such as Goa, Jaipur, Shimla, Udaipur and Uttarakhand,” ixigo co-founder and CEO Aloke Bajpai observed.He added that most of the travellers have opted for home rentals, service apartments and villas as their preferred choice of workation accommodation followed by resorts and eco-friendly properties with distant cottages.Due to the current uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, travellers are also booking closer to the actual trip date than usual, with less advanced planning, the survey found.Ixigo has also seen an increase in searches to travel within a week this year compared to last year. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/42-pc-recent-travellers-ready-for-a-trip-again-survey-152361

07-10-2020||New Delhi||AIIMS forensic team report lacks credibility, says Rajput’s family lawyer||Actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s family lawyer Vikas Singh on Wednesday claimed that the report submitted by the AIIMS forensic team “lacks credibility” and they have written to the CBI to constitute a fresh medical team to look into the case.Demanding that the CBI investigate the conduct of the AIIMS team and probe “who all they have met in recent time”, the senior advocate said Rajput’s family will approach the court if a new forensic panel is not formed.The lawyer said only the CBI can ascertain whether Rajput’s death was a case of suicide and that AIIMS has “no right” to say if it was suicide or hanging.“We want to take all steps to ensure that a fair probe is conducted and we will even go to the court for formation of a new panel and get justice,” he said.Rajput’s family wrote to the CBI on Wednesday alleging “unprofessional conduct” by AIIMS director Sudhir Gupta in leaking a forensic report of the late actor and sought a new panel for fair and proper assessment of his death.The letter, sent through advocate Varun Singh and settled by senior advocate Singh, claimed that the leaked report, if correct, amounts to drawing a “biased and boastful” conclusion from insufficient evidence.It stated that despite repeated efforts to get a copy of the report, there has been no response from Gupta.The family has objected to the AIIMS report saying Gupta-headed forensic team was not submitting a post-mortem report but was only expressing its opinion on the findings of Cooper Hospital in Mumbai, where the actor’s body was taken after he was found hanging.“Gupta has been giving media interviews about the sensitive case right from day one, questioning the doctors of Cooper Hospital for dubious autopsy and Maharashtra Police for hurried post-mortem and contamination and non-preservation of scene of crime,” the letter said, adding that there were several infirmities in the post-mortem report done at the Cooper Hospital.Pointing infirmities, the letter said the post-mortem was done at night without there being any order of the Magistrate and the protocol was not followed as opined by several experts of forensic departments from all over the world.“The videography of the post-mortem was not done. Sufficient viscera was not retained for future examination. The time of the death was not mentioned in the post-mortem report. The injuries on the body were not specified and thus there was no opinion expressed of the cause of such injuries.“The leg which was fractured was not mentioned in the report. There were several other infirmities which could be pointed out by a genuine forensic examination but somehow the same have been left out by the AIIMS team as expressed by one of the doctors in his interview telecast by a TV channel,” the letter alleged.It contended that Gupta recently got the incriminating content of the report, submitted to the CBI, leaked selectively to a couple of media houses, and irresponsibly commenting that Sushant’s death is “conclusively” a case of suicide and there is no foul play.      “Clearly the said leak is aimed at creating doubts in the mind of people, bailing out agencies who have not done their job as per rules and standard protocols, benefitting the culprits and derailing the course of ongoing investigation.“The conduct of Dr Sudhir Gupta is unethical, unprofessional, in contravention of government service conduct rules and MCI guidelines. This criminal misadventure on his part has undermined public trust in a premier institution like AIIMS. It has created doubts in the minds of millions of people about the fairness of investigation,” the letter said.It said the forensic team of AIIMS has not given a categorical opinion on the flaws of the post-mortem done at the Cooper Hospital and have given a report which they were not supposed to do.Therefore, the matter needs to be referred to another forensic team to be constituted by CBI by picking up some of the best names in the field from different hospital so that a fair and proper assessment takes place, the letter said.“The AIIMS report, if at all, could have only specified the cause of death i.e. by hanging and could not have gone to say that it is a case of suicide because that is something which only the CBI can decide after a complete investigation in the matter.The letter said CBI may also inquire into the circumstances that led Gupta to indulge in such unprofessional conduct that threatens to jeopardise the course of investigation and help wrong-doers escape the clutches of law.The AIIMS medical board has ruled out murder in the case of Rajput’s death and termed it “a case of hanging and death by suicide,” the premier institute’s forensic chief Gupta said on Saturday.At the press conference, Singh claimed Gupta had earlier told him that Rajput’s death was “200 per cent a case of strangulation” after seeing the pictures of his body which his sister had clicked. Commenting on the bail granted to actress Rhea Chakraborty by the Bombay High Court, he told mediapersons bail has been given to her on the premise of a narcotics case against her, which is “very weak”.“The real question is whether or not she administered the drugs to Sushant without his knowledge. Did she tell doctors, to whom she took him for treatment, about his usage,” he said.Rajput, 34, who made his silver screen debut in the critically acclaimed “Kai Po Che” seven years ago, was found dead in his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14.

07-10-2020||New Delhi||Action initiated against policemen in Palghar lynching case, Maharashtra tells SC||Maharashtra government informed the Supreme Court on Wednesday that action has been initiated against some policemen in connection with the alleged lynching of three people, including two seers, in Palghar district in April this year.The state government told a bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan that it has filed an affidavit last month in which it has given various details, including action taken against policemen for alleged dereliction of duties in the case.“We have placed on record all the actions taken by the state,” the counsel appearing for Maharashtra told the bench, also comprising Justices R S Reddy and M R Shah.Maharashtra Police had last month filed the affidavit in the top court saying that action has been taken against 18 personnel, ranging from dismissal from service to salary cuts.The apex court was hearing the pleas, including those seeking separate probes by the CBI and the NIA into the alleged lynching.The three victims from Kandivali in Mumbai were travelling in a car to attend a funeral at Surat in Gujarat amid the COVID-19 nationwide lockdown when their vehicle was stopped and they were attacked and killed by a mob in Gadchinchile village on the night of April 16 in the presence of police.The victims were identified as Chikne Maharaj Kalpavrukshagiri, 70, Sushil Giri Maharaj, 35, and Nilesh Telgade, 30, who was driving the vehicle.During the hearing, conducted through video-conferencing, one of the petitioners claimed they have got the around 1000-page affidavit filed by the state on Tuesday night only. “Why is everybody filing reply at the last moment,” the bench said, adding that it would grant time to the petitioners to file their reply.A lawyer representing another petitioner argued that one wing of the state machinery is investigating the other wing in the case and this would not inspire confidence.“We will consider it. We have not read the affidavit. How can we decide it today? Let the petitioners file their reply then we will take it up,” the bench said.The bench referred to the earlier order passed by it asking the state to bring on record the details of enquiry, including action taken against the police personnel, in the case.The state’s counsel said these details have already been placed on record.“Action has been initiated against policemen. One policeman has been dismissed, some of them have been compulsorily retired,” the state’s counsel said, adding that charge sheet has been filed in the case.The bench has posted the matter for hearing in the week commencing November 16.“An affidavit has been filed by the state. Let the petitioners file a reply to the affidavit within two weeks,” the bench said in its order.In an affidavit filed in the top court, the state police said it has punished “delinquent” policemen for their dereliction of duties in the alleged lynching of three people in Palghar district.The affidavit said as many as 18 delinquent police personnel have been awarded varying punishments and some of them have been dismissed from service and some of them have been compulsorily retired.Some delinquent cops have also been punished with the salary cuts, it said.It said that state’s criminal investigation department has so far filed two charge sheets in the case.Some of the pleas filed in the apex court have alleged that investigation by state police was being conducted in a biased manner.

07-10-2020||New Delhi||Mere inclusion in merit list does not confer right to appointment, says SC||Mere inclusion of candidates in a selection list is not a “vested right to appointment”, the Supreme Court said on Wednesday, setting aside the Delhi High Court order which directed Delhi Police to appoint two persons as constables even though they failed to make it to the final merit list.The apex court was very critical of the Delhi Police appointment process for recruiting 523 constables, wherein the notice was published in 2013 but hiring happened in 2016---that too, after various rounds of cancellations and revision of merit list following litigations.“Such irregularities have become a bane of the public recruitment process at various levels resulting in litigation across the country before the Tribunals, the High Courts and ultimately this Court as well. Much of the litigation and delay in carrying out public recruitment would be obviated if those entrusted with the duty to do so carry it out with a sense of diligence and responsibility,” said a Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Indira Banerjee.The court, in its judgement, referred to the sequence of events in the recruitment process which led to the delay.After the physical endurance and measurement test in October 2013, over 39,000 candidates appeared in written examination on March 8, 2014 which got cancelled.A fresh written examination was conducted on May 25, 2014 and it was cancelled as well. Finally the test took place in November 2014 and after evaluation of OMR sheets, 514 candidates were provisionally selected on July 13, 2015.       The appointment process again got stuck and the merit list was redrawn as it was pointed out that an extra bonus mark could not be allotted inadvertently to those candidates whose height was measured at 178 centimeters or above at the time of the physical endurance and measurement test.In the redrawn merit list, declared on July 17, 2015, 32 new candidates came within the selection zone and 34 candidates were ousted.Some students then moved the Central Administrative Tribunal alleging that answer keys to certain questions were wrong.An expert committee was set up and then the final result was declared again on February 22, 2016 in which 129 new candidates came into the selection zone and 123 candidates who had been declared selected earlier in the result were ousted.Umesh Kumar and Satyendra Singh, who were selected earlier under the OBC category and later dropped from the merit list, got the relief from the Delhi High Court. which asked the city police to appoint them as constables.Referring to its earlier judgement, the apex court said: “The real issue, however, is whether the respondents were entitled to a writ of mandamus. This would depend on whether they have a vested right of appointment. Clearly the answer to this must be in the negative”.“This court held that the mere inclusion of candidate in a selection list does not confer upon them a vested right to appointment”.   It further said: “We are of the view that the judgements delivered by the Delhi High Court on 6 December 2018…do not comport with law. The High Court has been manifestly in error in issuing a mandamus to the appellants to appoint the respondents on the post of Constable (Executive) in Delhi Police”.“The direction was clearly contrary to law. The respondents have participated in the selection process and upon the declaration of the revised result, it has emerged before the Court that they have failed to obtain marks above the cut-off for the OBC category to which they belong”.The court was also not impressed with the argument that Umesh Kumar, who finally did not make to the list of successful candidates, had resigned from the RPF after being selected in Delhi Police.“Evidently, the respondent tendered his resignation without any justification when the recruitment process had not been concluded and even before an offer of appointment was made to him. In any event, it would have been open to him seek re-enlistment in the RPF at the material time which he chose to not do,” the top court said.

India’s continuously rising recovery rate and progressively falling active cases have proven the success of the Centre-led COVID-19 containment strategy.“We have successfully ramped up our testing capacity which has crossed more than 8 cr milestone in terms of total tests,” he was quoted as saying in a statement.From one laboratory in January, the country now has 1,889 labs spread across the country, he said.“I have confidence in the scientific developments taking place in the field of treatment and vaccines for COVID-19 and soon India will achieve more success in our fight against COVID-19,” he added.India’s COVID-19 tally of cases climbed to 67.57 lakh on Wednesday with 72,049 new cases in a day, while 57,44,693 people have recuperated so far, pushing the national recovery rate to 85.02 per cent.There are 9,07,883 active cases of coronavirus infection in the country, according to the Union Health Ministry data.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), a cumulative total of 8,22,71,654 samples have been tested up to October 6.Vardhan also urged the people to follow COVID appropriate behaviour.He reminded people about the “social vaccine” of wearing masks and face covers while in public, following hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, and maintaining physical distancing or ‘Do gaz ki doori’ to curb the spread of the infection. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rising-recovery-rate-falling-active-cases-prove-success-of-centre-led-covid-19-strategy-harsh-vardhan-152345
07-10-2020||London||UK school removes workbook after objections to portrayal of Hinduism||A school in England has apologised and removed a workbook from its website following protests from several parents and British Hindu organisations over a reference to terrorism within a section on Hinduism.Langley School in Solihull, in the West Midlands region of England, said on Wednesday that the document, ‘GCSE Religious Studies: Religion Peace and Conflict Workbook', was purchased externally a few years ago and has now been removed from circulation.“Unfortunately, this document was purchased externally several years ago and not produced by our staff at our school. We can assure you that it is not used in school,” Langley School said in a statement.“The resource was immediately removed from our website. We apologise for any offence caused,” it said.The workbook, which falls under the Religious Studies module for GCSE Year 10-11 stage pupils aged around 15, had a stamp that reflected an official clearance by the examinations authority for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, AQA.“We didn't produce the workbook that's been shared on social media and our logo was used on it without our permission,” said an AQA spokesperson.“Some of the material in it seems to have come from a textbook – we've spoken to the publisher, which has withdrawn the book from sale while it addresses the issue,” said the spokesperson.Angry parents and Hindu groups had taken to social media and highlighted segments of the text, which made references to the ‘Mahabharata’ and war being justified in order to “preserve dharma”.Hindu Council UK said it had received a complaint from a father, who sent screenshots from a book his son was using in Cumbria in north-west England, and written to the school authorities urging an investigation.“Happy to see action being taken. However, sadly this workbook is in use by many schools in England and now will create false image of Hinduism in young minds,” Hindu Council UK said in a statement.Hindu Forum of Britain (HFB), another umbrella organisation, issued a letter to AQA and called for action.“The statement regarding Hinduism in the section on ‘Religious beliefs, teachings, and attitudes about the meaning and significance of justice’ on page 4 is completely misrepresented, vexatious, inaccurate and meant to teach wrong beliefs about Hindus to impressionable children,” read the letter by HFB Chair of Religious Education Dr Ramesh Pattni, addressed to the AQA Board.“We suspect that there may be a political agenda behind how Hindu beliefs and practices have been portrayed in your workbook, especially in relation to another religion,” the letter added.The controversial text used within the workbook seems to have been copied from a textbook published by Hodder, which has since been withdrawn from sale.

07-10-2020||London||Tamil-origin couple, son found dead in suspected murder-suicide in UK||Scotland Yard has launched a murder investigation after three members of a Tamil-origin family were found dead in their flat in west London.Officers from the Metropolitan Police forced entry into a block of flats in Brentford on Tuesday after concerns were raised for the well-being of Poorna Kaameshwari Sivaraj.Inside, they discovered the body of the 36-year-old woman and her three-year-old son, Kailash Kuha Raj. Her husband, Kuha Raj Sithamparanathan, was found with severe stab injuries and died at the scene soon after.The police believe the 42-year-old fatally injured himself when officers entered the property. While the police are yet to confirm their line of inquiry and a post-mortem on the bodies is scheduled for Thursday, it is suspected to be a case of murder-suicide.“Although we are in the infancy of this investigation, it appears that Poorna and Kailash had been dead for some time. This is a murder investigation and my team will work diligently to establish the sequence of events that led to their murders and the death of Kuha Raj Sithamparanathan,” said Detective Chief Inspector Simon Harding from the Met’s Specialist Crime Command, who is leading the investigation.He said their initial enquiries had established that Poorna and Kailash had not been seen or heard from for some days, perhaps since around the September 21.“We know the family often walked their dog, a poodle cross breed, in and around the local area and I would ask anyone who saw them at any time in the last month to contact police so we can begin to build a full picture of their lives,” said Harding.“I know I speak on behalf of all the officers in my team that words cannot sufficiently sum up the devastation that this horrific incident will have on the families of those involved. However, I can reassure them that we will do all we can to provide them with the answers they need about what has happened here,” he said.The police force also sought to reassure the neighbourhood following the deaths of family, from Malaysia and of Sri Lankan and Tamil heritage.“This horrific incident has understandably caused enormous shock and concern among local residents and across the borough; all our thoughts are with the family and friends of those affected,” said Peter Gardner, the local area commander for the Met Police.He praised the London Ambulance Service (LAS) paramedics who rushed to the scene and worked “tirelessly and professionally under extremely traumatic circumstances” as they tried to save the life of Sithamparanathan.“Our officers in the West Area Command Unit are doing everything they can to support colleagues in Specialist Crime as we work to understand what has led to this terrible incident. Local residents can expect to see officers at the scene and patrolling the local area to provide reassurance, and if they have any concerns, I would urge them to speak to our officers,” said Gardner.The Met Police said it initially received a call late on Sunday from a family member raising concerns about the welfare of Poorna. Officers attended the flat several times in the early hours of Monday but received no reply.“From talking to neighbours as the day progressed, concerns heightened and a decision was made to force entry,” the Met Police said.The Directorate of Professional Standards has made a referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) as Sithamparanathan’s self-inflicted fatal injury meets the criteria of a mandatory referral. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tamil-origin-couple-son-found-dead-in-suspected-murder-suicide-in-uk-152341

07-10-2020||New Delhi||BJP leaders, Cabinet members laud Modi as he enters 20th year as elected govt head||BJP leaders on Wednesday heaped praise on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his leadership as he entered his 20th year without a break as the head of an elected government, including close to 13 years as chief minister of Gujarat.Members of the Union Cabinet also congratulated the prime minister.Party president J P Nadda said October 7, 2001, when Modi was sworn in as Gujarat chief minister for the first time, is a “milestone” in India’s political history.Modi has since been notching up bigger victories and his popularity has only gone up, Nadda said on Twitter.The party also tweeted details of many of Modi’s key schemes during his 19 years as the head of a government.Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri lauded Modi for “20 years in service of humanity & Maa Bharati with dedication, vision & selflessness”.“Heartiest congratulations to PM @narendramodi Ji for becoming the only democratically elected world leader to serve the people continuously for 20 years since 2001,” Puri said.Be it as chief minister of Gujarat or as prime minister of the world’s largest democracy, Modi has always been a crusader for people’s welfare, the party said.“PM Sri @narendramodi Ji has completed 6941 successful days in total as CM of Gujarat & PM of India. One of the unblemished tenures ever seen. Kept public welfare as a priority and never worried about himself. Always kept sovereignty & pride of India intact,” its spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi tweeted.Modi, who turned 70 last month, started as a volunteer of the RSS and then served in the BJP’s organisation for many years before the party leadership sent him to Gujarat, his home state, as its chief minister in 2001.Since then, he has never tasted electoral defeat and led the BJP to power in the state three straight times before steering the party to its biggest, until then, Lok Sabha poll win in 2014 and then scripting an even bigger win in the 2019 general elections.Briefing reporters on the decisions taken by the Union Cabinet on Wednesday, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said as soon as the meeting of the Union Cabinet began this morning, ministers congratulated Modi.He said the prime minister has brought reforms in governance and major sectors.The prime minister, Javadekar said, has given a government free of corruption and has completed various projects that had been languishing for many years.He said the prime minister was also congratulated for the way he has raised the standards of living of the poor and the deprived. “That is a noteworthy work he has done,” the Union minister said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-leaders-cabinet-members-laud-modi-as-he-enters-20th-year-as-elected-govt-head-152337
07-10-2020||---||Cabinet ratifies ban on 7 hazardous chemicals listed under Stockholm Convention||New Delhi, October 7The Union Cabinet on Wednesday ratified ban on seven Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP’s) listed under Stockholm Convention and hazardous to health and environment.“With today’s decision India is sending out a positive message to the world that we are active in this area and we do not tolerate health and environmental hazard,” Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said.The Stockholm Convention is a global treaty to protect human health and environment from POPs, which are identified chemical substances that persist in the environment, bio-accumulate in living organisms, adversely affect human health/ environment and have the property of long-range environmental transport (LRET).Exposure to POPs can lead to cancer, damage to central and peripheral nervous systems, diseases of immune system, reproductive disorders and interference with normal infant and child development. POPs are listed in various Annexes to the Stockholm Convention after thorough scientific research, deliberations and negotiations among member countries.Considering its commitment towards providing safe environment and addressing human health risks, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) had notified the ‘Regulation of Persistent Organic Pollutants Rules, on March 5, 2018 under the provisions of Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The regulation inter alia prohibited the manufacture, trade, use, import and export seven chemicals namely (i) Chlordecone, (ii) Hexabromobiphenyl, (iii) Hexabromodiphenyl ether and Heptabromodiphenylether (Commercial octa-BDE), (iv) Tetrabromodiphenyl ether and Pentabromodiphenyl ether (Commercial penta-BDE), (v) Pentachlorobenzene, (vi) Hexabromocyclododecane, and (vii) Hexachlorobutadiene, which were already listed as POPs under Stockholm Convention.The Cabinet’s approval for ratification of POPs demonstrates India’s commitment to meet its international obligations with regard to protection of environment and human health. It also indicates the resolve of the government to take action on POPs by implementing control measures, develop and implement action plans for unintentionally produced chemicals, develop inventories of the chemicals’ stockpiles and review as well as update its National Implementation Plan (NIP).The ratification process would enable India to access Global Environment Facility (GEF) financial resources in updating the NIP.The Cabinet further delegated its powers to ratify chemicals under the Stockholm Convention to Union Ministers of External Affairs (MEA) and Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MEFCC) in respect of POPs already regulated under the domestic regulations thereby streamlining the procedure.India had ratified the Stockholm Convention on January 13, 2006 as per Article 25(4), which enabled it to keep itself in a default “opt-out” position such that amendments in various Annexes of the convention cannot be enforced on it unless an instrument of ratification/ acceptance/ approval or accession is explicitly deposited with UN depositary, according to an official statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cabinet-ratifies-ban-on-7-hazardous-chemicals-listed-under-stockholm-convention-152335

07-10-2020||Mumbai||Payal Ghosh tenders unconditional apology to Richa Chadha||Actor Payal Ghosh, who has accused filmmaker Anurag Kashyap of raping her, on Wednesday told the Bombay High Court that she regrets her statement about Richa Chadha, and tendered an unconditional apology.Chadha’s lawyers said she was ready to accept the apology.Earlier this week, Chadha filed a defamation suit before the high court against Ghosh for making a “false, baseless, indecent and derogatory” statement and sought damages.Ghosh, while making allegations against Kashyap, had also dragged Chadha and two other woman actors into the controversy.Chadha also named actor Kamaal R Khan as a defendant in the suit.On Wednesday, Ghosh’s lawyer Nitin Satpute told Justice A K Menon that Ghosh regrets her statement, and it was not intended to defame Chadha.“She (Ghosh) said it innocently. She is a big follower of the plaintiff (Chadha) and respects her. She is ready to withdraw the statement and tender apology,” he said.“She regrets whatever she said and her intention was never to defame any woman,” advocate Satpute told the court.Chadha’s lawyers Veerendra Tulzapurkar and Saveena Bedi Sachar told the court that they are willing to accept the apology and would not claim damages.The court then posted the plea for further hearing on October 12 when the parties will have to submit their ‘consent terms’ settling the matter.Advocate Manoj Gadkari who appeared for Kamaal R Khan told the court that Khan was willing to assure that he will not post anything against Chadha on social media.The court accepted the statement.Justice Menon also passed an interim order restraining any person from making similar comments against Chadha, after observing that a “prima facie case was made out”.Ghosh on September 23 registered a First Information Report at suburban Versova police station, accusing Kashyap of raping her in 2013.Kashyap, who was last week questioned by the police, denied the allegations and provided documentary evidence to show that he was shooting for a film in Sri Lanka when the alleged incident was said to have taken place.

07-10-2020||Kolkata||Stimulus to revive economy should continue for three years: Pranob Sen||The government should continue with the stimulus to revive the economy for three years and it should not be one off, Pranob Sen, the chairman of the Standing Committee on Statistics, ministry of statistics and programme implementation, said on Wednesday.The improvement in economic activity at the moment is due to the pent up demand, he said at a webinar organised by Bharat Chamber of Commerce.“What is happening at the moment is due to the pent up demand which has come to the market and has led to certain increase in economic activity,” Sen, the former chief statistician of India, said.According to him, “The government gameplan should be to continue with the stimulus for three years and not be one off”.He said when COVID-19 struck India and the lockdown began, there was already a negative momentum in the economy and capacity utilisation had gone down.The government should immediately pay off the dues of the states, beneficiaries of social sector schemes and clean its budget, he said.On monetization of deficit, he said according to the RBI the central bank is not in a position to do that.A clause was inserted in the RBI Act on monetisation of deficit and the government can only come out with an ordinance to change it.“This (ordinance) will allow RBI to monetize the deficit for a limited period of time. But then there is a fear of rise in inflation,” he said.Sen said, “When we talk about inflation we talk about consumer price index (CPI). But the relevant index to track is wholesale price index (WPI) which is in the negative territory for the last five months”.

07-10-2020||Gurugram||Delhi riots were 'big conspiracy' to disturb country, says minister Nityanand Rai||The riots in Delhi this year were a "big conspiracy" to disturb the country but security forces like the Rapid Action Force (RAF) played an important role in "suppressing the elements that spread anarchy" during the time, Union minister Nityanand Rai said on Wednesday.The minister of state for home was addressing RAF troops on the occasion of the force's 28th anniversary, or raising day, at a Central Reserve Police Force camp here.The RAF is a special anti-riot wing of the CRPF and was raised in 1992."A big conspiracy was deployed to disturb the country through the Delhi riots that took place this year. The RAF played an important role in suppressing the elements that spread anarchy and ensured peace," Rai said in his address to the troops.He added that RAF personnel had "completely defeated" the nefarious designs of the rioters."You suffer damage and injury during riots and protests...but you use force only when violent groups start troubling the peace of society," the minister added.The RAF was deployed during the communal violence that broke out in northeast Delhi in February, killing 53 people and injuring about 200.Delhi Police has filed multiple chargesheets before a Delhi court in these cases.The RAF has 15 battalions (over 15,000 personnel) based in various parts of the country.Union Home Minister Amit Shah also greeted RAF personnel on the occasion. "Greetings to RAF personnel and their families on their 28th anniversary. RAF has distinguished itself in dealing with the challenges relating to law and order," the minister said on Twitter."Time and again, their commitment in several humanitarian works and UN peacekeeping missions has made India proud," he added.Rai, who reviewed a parade of the RAF personnel at the CRPF academy here, said maintaining internal security and peace are "two very important" factors for the development of a country.He lauded CRPF personnel for killing top commanders of terror groups operating in the Kashmir Valley and said the force had worked to defeat "Pakistan-sponsored" terrorist activities in that region."These are big achievements made by you," he said.CRPF Director General AP Maheshwari also addressed his troops and said security forces and special units like the RAF now had a new challenge in the form of fake and inciting messages spread through social media."Earlier, the protests were supposed to be countered in the physical space but now we see radicalisation being spread through cyber space," Maheshwari said.He added that his force is prepared to tackle these new challenges.Maheshwari said the CRPF would undertake a mega awareness campaign on COVID-19-related protocols in the country. The aim, he added, is to reach about 12 crore citizens."A meeting was held in the home ministry yesterday...it was decided that a campaign underlining three things, wearing a mask, washing hands and ensuring social or physical distancing, should be ensured by everyone to check the coronavirus spread.""All the security forces, including the CRPF, will undertake this campaign in their respective areas. We aim to get in touch with 12 crore people through our 1,600 bases in the country over the next 100 days," the DG said.

07-10-2020||New Delhi||Employees in India face increased burnout at work during pandemic: Report||Employees in India are facing increased burnout due to lack of separation between work and personal life as well as concerns of contracting COVID-19, a report said on Wednesday.According to Microsoft's latest Work Trend Index, that surveyed over 6,000 information and first-line workers across eight countries globally, India had the second-highest percentage of workers facing increased burnout in Asia at 29 per cent.Moreover, India came out top with over 41 per cent of workers citing the lack of separation between work and personal life as negatively impacting their wellbeing, resulting in increased stress levels, the report said."In the last six months, we have seen how COVID-19 has created an era of remote anywhere. It has led to the evolution of a new workplace – from a physical space to one residing in a virtual world," said Samik Roy, Country Head, Modern Work, Microsoft India.Roy further noted that "as businesses adapt to a new way of working, it is important to examine the multifaceted impact that the new working conditions are having on employees. This is helping us provide relevant and timely solutions to all our customers and users".The pandemic increased burnout at work, in some countries more than others. In India, 29 per cent of workers are experiencing increased burnout at work, owing to its increase in workday span by 1 hour. While workers in Germany saw very little change to workday span or feelings of burnout, the report said.Data showed that, globally, even six months past the first work-from-home orders, people are in significantly more meetings, taking more ad hoc calls and managing more incoming chats than they did before the pandemic."As people adjusted to remote working, after-hours chats, or chats between 5 pm and midnight, have also increased," the report said.Further, for remote workers in Asia, no commute is hurting and not helping productivity, the report said adding that for years, Microsoft's research group has been studying how commute has helped maintain work-life boundaries — and worker's productivity and wellbeing.Microsoft said a series of updates have been launched within Microsoft Teams to support employee wellbeing. These include a virtual commute experience that helps users prepare for the day and mindfully disconnect in the evening.Microsoft has also partnered with Headspace to bring a curated set of mindfulness and meditation experiences into the Teams platform and launched new Teams experiences for first-line workers to support them with the tools they need to work more safely.This Work Trend Index report looks at how the pandemic has impacted wellbeing at work globally. It studied how productivity patterns in Microsoft Teams have shifted since early this year and surveyed over 6,000 information and first-line workers in eight countries including Australia, Brazil, Germany, Japan, India, Singapore, the UK, and the US.

07-10-2020||New Delhi||Shaheen Bagh: No one has right to block roads, public spaces indefinitely, rules SC||Maintaining that “democracy and dissent go hand in hand”, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that roads and public spaces can’t be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone.Deciding petitions seeking removal of protesters against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) from Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, a three-judge Bench headed by Justice SK Kaul said, “We have…no hesitation in concluding that such kind of occupation of public ways, whether at the site in question or anywhere else for protests is not acceptable and the administration ought to take action to keep the areas clear of encroachments or obstructions.”Notified on January 10, the CAA relaxed norms for grant of Indian citizenship by naturalization to Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist and Jain and Parsi victims of religious persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who came to India before December 31, 2014. The top court had on January 22 refused to stay the operation of CAA and NPR.Though the protesters blocking the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch, including the Okhla underpass since December 15, 2019 -- were removed on March 24 after COVID-19 lockdown was enforced, the top court had chosen to keep the matter pending to clarify the legal position on the issue.The court faulted the authorities for not taking any decision, saying, “Unfortunately, despite a lapse of a considerable period of time, there was neither any negotiation nor any action by the administration, thus warranting our intervention.”The top court said, “In what manner the administration should act is their responsibility and they should not hide behind the court orders or seek support thereupon for carrying out their administrative functions. The courts adjudicate the legality of the actions and are not meant to give shoulder to the administration to fire their guns from.”To emphasise the importance of right to peaceful protest, a Bench headed by Justice SK Kaul quoted Pulitzer Prize winner Walter Lippmann, who said, “In a democracy, the opposition is not only tolerated as constitutional, but must be maintained because it is indispensable.”However, it said, “while appreciating the existence of the right to peaceful protest against a legislation, we have to make it unequivocally clear that public ways and public spaces cannot be occupied in such a manner and that too indefinitely. Democracy and dissent go hand in hand, but then the demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone.”Rejecting the contention of the protesters against the CAA, the Bench said, “The present case was not even one of protests taking place in an undesignated area, but was a blockage of a public way which caused grave inconvenience to commuters. We cannot accept the plea of the applicants that an indeterminable number of people can assemble whenever they choose to protest.”Noting that the use of digital infrastructure has empowered movements to embrace their often-leaderless aspirations and evade usual restrictions of censorship, the top court said, “the flip side to this is that social media channels are often fraught with danger and can lead to the creation of highly polarised environments, which often see parallel conversations running with no constructive outcome evident.”The court said it must be kept in mind that the erstwhile mode and manner of dissent against colonial rule cannot be equated with dissent in a self-ruled democracy as “our Constitutional scheme comes with the right to protest and express dissent, but with an obligation towards certain duties”.It sought to emphasise that right to free speech and right to assemble peacefully under Article 19(1)(a) and Article 19(1)(b) of the Constitution are subject to reasonable restrictions, including those in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India and public order, and to the regulation by the concerned police authorities in this regard.“Each fundamental right, be it of an individual or of a class, does not exist in isolation and has to be balanced with every other contrasting right, it noted.”The petition was originally filed before the Delhi High Court, which had refused to issue any specific writ. However, it had said the authorities had all the powers, jurisdiction and authority to control traffic wherever protests or agitations were going on, in the larger public interest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shaheen-bagh-no-one-has-right-to-block-roads-public-spaces-indefinitely-rules-sc-152279
07-10-2020||Vijay Mohan||10 years in making, longest bridge on Manali–Leh highway complete||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, October 7 The longest bridge on the strategic Manali – Leh highway, located in Himachal Pradesh, is complete and will be opened for traffic this month.While easing the flow of traffic, the new structure had greatly increased load carrying capacity. Known as Barsi Bridge, it is the second longest bridge of its kind in the country after the Col Chewang Rinchen Setu across Shyok river on route to the world’s highest landing ground at Daulat Beg Oldie in Ladakh. The 360-meter long bridge over the Bhaga river at Darcha took about 10 years to construct owing to the difficult terrain, inclement weather and limited working season due to long snow bound winters, BRO sources said.It is a steel-truss structure in which the load bearing super structure is constructed of a rigid assembly of steel beams. In addition to the abutments on either end, the length is supported by five piers arising from the river bed.The project was executed by 70 Road Construction Company of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO). The same unit had also constructed the 100-meter steel truss bridge connecting the north portal of Atal Tunnel under the Rohtang Pass that was inaugurated this month, with the Manali – Leh Highway at Sissu near Keylong.Located in Lahaul region about 33 kms ahead of Keylong, Darcha is at an altitude of 11,020 feet, higher than Leh, and is the last permanent settlement on this route in Himachal. It is also here that the alternate route to Kargil-via Padum branches off from the highway.According to BRO officials, barring a small old bridge over the main water channel, most of the existing route between the two banks was an unpaved track laying across the wide river bed which was prone to floods, rock hazards or high-water levels, especially during rains, thereby disrupting traffic.The Bhaga River is a tributary of Chenab River and originates from the Suraj Tal, a few kilometers south of the Baralacha Pass. The only way to overcome the problem was to build a permanent bridge well above the riverbed.According to BRO sources, work on the bridge had also remained suspended for some time in the past due to administrative reasons. It was only about four years ago that it resumed and picked up speed recently.The Manali – Leh route, known as National Highway – 3, provides the vital alternate road axis to Ladakh, the other being the Srinagar – Leh axis. BRO has been engaged in upgrading the Manali – Leh axis, which lies across some of the highest motorable passes in the world such as Baralacha La, Tanglang La, Nakee La and Lachung La, touching heights of 17,500 feet, to double lane specifications.About 90 per cent of the work on this route, which remains closed to traffic during winters because of snow, is reportedly complete. Proposed tunnels under these passes, similar to the Atal Tunnel that took 10 years, would make the route all weather.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/10-years-in-making-longest-bridge-on-manali%E2%80%93leh-highway-complete-152278
07-10-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||US cites PLA coercion in Ladakh for Pompeo's tough comments in Tokyo||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 7US Administration officials have cited India’s tensions with China in eastern Ladakh as one of the reasons for US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s tough words on China in Tokyo on Tuesday.Speaking at other engagements before the four Foreign Ministers of Quad countries met for three hours, Pompeo attacked China and the Chinese Communist Party on grounds ranging from coercion to corruption. Though a US read-out of Pompeo’s account about the Quad Ministerial meeting did not target China, he was the only one of the four Foreign Ministers to do so in his earlier observations such as during an interview and in his opening address.The essence that came out of the meeting was to undertake joint initiative or cooperate in critical technologies and materials, maritime and cyber security and quality infrastructure building. Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne referred to positivity as the main force behind the deliberations, which was at odds with what Pompeo had advocated. The other two participants, S Jaishankar and Toshimitsu Motegi, also kept off China from their addresses.A senior US State Department official, briefing the media, however, said Pompeo was right in explicitly criticising China because of Beijing’s “sudden turn towards gross aggression in its entire periphery’’. This included the conflict in the Himalayas where something that was handled according to unspoken or unwritten rules in the past has now turned to “people beating each other to death”.“You take it [the sudden Chinese aggression] all the way around the Indo-Pacific and its western borders; you’re seeing things that you haven’t seen before, and these are responding to that,’’ added the official.Another official said if China thought it was a great power it should participate in arms control talks as well as use WTO in ways that are acceptable to everybody.The officials also played down China’s claim of assisting the WHO to fight the pandemic. While the US has put $ 20.5 billion towards a vaccine, China volunteered $ 2 billion in April, and “as far as I can tell, we haven’t seen any of that money’’. “China promises a lot, but they don’t necessarily deliver unless you force them. And that’s an area that this group can help ensure that they live up to,’’ added the official.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-cites-pla-coercion-in-ladakh-for-pompeos-tough-comments-in-tokyo-152276
07-10-2020||Mumbai||Rhea Chakraborty gets bail in drugs case, walks out of jail after 28 days||Actor Rhea Chakraborty was released from Byculla jail after 28 days on Wednesday as the Bombay High Court granted her bail in drugs case. The HC directed her to deposit a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh.Rhea Chakraborty was arrested over drugs-related charges in actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death.A bench of Justice Sarang Kotwal also granted bail to Rajput's aides Dipesh Sawant and Samuel Miranda, but rejected the bail plea of Rhea Chakraborty's brother Showik Chakraborty, who is also an accused in the case.The court also rejected the bail plea of alleged drug peddler Abdel Basit Parihar.Rhea Chakraborty, her brother and the other accused were arrested last month by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in connection with its probe into the drugs angle related to the case of Rajput's death.The HC, while granting bail to Rhea Chakraborty and two others, directed them to deposit their passports with the NCB and not to leave the country without permission of the special NDPS court.The HC asked Rhea to deposit a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh and said she must visit the nearest police station at 11 am for the first 10 days after being released from judicial custody.It directed her not to leave Mumbai without the NCB's permission and to not tamper with evidence while out on bail.The HC also directed Rhea to visit the NCB office at 11 am on the first day of every month for next six months.All those who have been granted bail, including Rhea, will also have to seek permission of the NCB's investigating officer to go out of Mumbai, the court said.Rhea and her brother had approached the HC after their bail pleas were rejected by a special NDPS court here last month.Justice Sarang Kotwal said in his judgement that he had dealt with extensive questions on law vis-a-vis the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act during the arguments.He also refused to accept the NCB's request for a stay on his order to allow the agency to challenge the order."I have already imposed very stringent conditions in the bail. If your appeal is accepted and the bail order is stayed then what prejudice willbe caused to you?" the judge asked the NCB.Rhea Chakraborty's lawyer Satish Maneshinde said they were are delighted by the high court order."Truth and justice have prevailed and ultimately the submissions on facts and law have been accepted by Justice Sarang V Kotwal," he said.The arrest and custody of Rhea was "totally unwarranted and beyond the reach of law", Maneshinde said."The hounding and witch-hunt by three central agencies--the CBI, ED and NCB --of Rhea should come to an end.We remain committed to truth," he said.Rajput, 34, was found hanging at his apartment in suburban Bandra on June 14 this year.Following extensive hearings last week, the HC had closed all arguments and reserved its verdict on the pleas.The NCB, through Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh, had opposed the bail pleas in the HC.Singh had told the high court that a strong message needed to be sent out to the society, particularly youngsters, to ensure they did not consume drugs.The NCB had said there existed ample material to show that Rhea Chakraborty, her brother and others arrested in the case represented a "chain," and an "active syndicate" that was involved in procuring, financing, harbouring and abetting drugs and its consumption.Singh said Rhea had knowingly paid for Rajputs drugs, and concealed the information regarding his drug habit. These qualified as stringent charges of financing and harbouring drug consumption, as defined under the NDPS Act.The court had posed a query to all parties on the application of the stringent section 27-A of the NDPS Act in the case.The section deals with financing and harbouring drugs and its consumers, and entails a punishment of up to 10 years.It also carries a bar on grant of bail.All the accused had opposed the application of the above section in the present case.Rhea Chakraborty's counsel Maneshinde argued that the actress had only occasionally paid for Rajputs drugs and this did not amount to financing.All accused had also argued that the drugs seized by NCB in the case were in small quantity, and did not qualify as commercial quantity that could attract stringent sections under the NDPS Act.Meanwhile, Mumbai Police asked mediapersons not to chase, intervene or stop the vehicle of Rhea Chakraborty or any other person after their release from jail. "It is a danger to the safety and security of the person himself, the person whom he or she is following and people who are driving vehicles on road," an official said.DCP (Zone-I) Sangramsingh Nishandar told reporters that stern action will be taken against those who instigate their drivers to chase or stop the vehicles of the accused.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rhea-chakraborty-gets-bail-in-drugs-case-walks-out-of-jail-after-28-days-152274

07-10-2020||Lucknow||UP govt extends time given to Hathras SIT by 10 days||The UP government has given an additional 10 days to the three-member SIT investigating the alleged gang rape and killing of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras as the "probe is not complete", a senior official said Wednesday.The special investigation team, constituted on September 30 and led by Home Secretary Bhagwan Swarup, was initially given seven days to submit its report.But the UP government later sought a CBI probe into the case and the criminal conspiracy to spread caste conflict it has suspected. On Tuesday, it told the Supreme Court it wanted an apex court-monitored CBI inquiry into the incident to ensure "no vested interests will be able to create fake, false narrative with oblique motives"."Yes...the time for submitting report for the SIT has been extended by 10 days," Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi told PTI.Asked about the reasons for the extension, he added, "The reason is one. The probe is not complete." The Yogi Adityanath government is fighting severe criticism for its handling of the case, particularly after the local police burnt the woman's body at night without the family's approval. However, officials said the cremation was done "as per the wishes of the family".The government has claimed that some people were trying to foment caste tensions in the aftermath of the alleged rape of the woman by four "upper caste" men on September 14. Quoting an FSL report, it has denied the rape charge.Referring to "recent incidents”, Chief Minister Adityanath has said that “anarchist elements” were trying to trigger communal and caste violence in the state.In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court in response to a PIL, the government said there have been "orchestrated efforts to malign the image of government on social media by attributing baseless comments and building up a distorted narrative on the Hathras case”.The woman died on September 29 of the grievous injuries she suffered during the assault.

But in the end, all Quad Foreign Ministers — S Jaishankar, Marise Payne, Toshimitsu Motegi and Pompeo — kept off China from their readouts or opening addresses.Jaishankar focused on the need for “like-minded countries to coordinate responses to various challenges” and advance their security and economic interests.The ministers sought to bring a quiet focus on advancing cooperation in maritime security and anti-terrorism, critical technologies and education. The strategic goal was to ensure a “free and open Indo-Pacific”, an indication towards not letting China have a free run through a debt-fuelled infrastructure building spree and unilateral claims to maritime territory.The Quad’s broader reading of security was explained by Pompeo. “Remember, when one talks about security, one's talking about economic capacity, the ability to protect intellectual property, trade agreements, diplomatic relationships, all of the elements that form a security framework. It’s not just military,” he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/eying-china-quad-nations-to-step-up-ties-152035

It has also been exposed that the NYPD will film at every rally and protest. Stay aware and stay safe.”Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate today termed the affidavit “fabricated” and a poor “cut and paste job from the Black Lives Matter literature”.Another statement attributed as protestor literature in the affidavit reads, “Throw a hat and bend the brim to keep it low.”“Who wears hats in UP? Who uses ski masks? As far as we know NYPD is an American force and San Diego is in the US not in UP!” Shrinate said.UP’s affidavit says the victim was cremated in the wee hours of September 30 to avoid a law and order situation in the village in the morning.“There was intelligence regarding the presence of massive crowds in the village on September 30 and the administration took the decision to convince the family to cremate the body with full religious rituals at night. Once the post-mortem was done by Safdarjung Hospital Delhi there could be no bad intention on anyone’s part to expedite the cremation except to obviate a potential violent situation resulting from planned caste divide by certain vested interests,” the state said about the cremation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ups-hathras-affidavit-cites-nypd-black-men-san-diego-oppn-wants-cm-dismissed-152040

The plan is to have at least 125 planes of the AMCA with two versions powered by separate engines.During a press conference on Monday, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria said the force was looking for seven squadrons (some 125 jets) with two separate engines.Sources said the first two squadrons of the fighters would be powered by an imported engine, the General Electric 414 with 90 KN thrust, same as the one used by US-made fighter jets made by Boeing.The remaining five squadrons are likely to get an indigenous power plant with a greater thrust of 125 KN. A joint venture is being worked out with a foreign engine maker to jointly develop a new engine. A powerful engine will allow greater weapons carrying capacity and faster speed.According to the existing plan, the AMCA’s first flight will be in 2027 and full production by 2029. The IAF, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) and Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) are working on the AMCA.The DRDO has tasked various labs for doing R&D on material, paint and structure. Separate studies are under way on flight control, avionics, aerodynamics, composite structure and general systems like brakes, hydraulics and fuel systems.A super-cruise ability, which gives an aircraft capability to fly at supersonic speed, is being developed. The AMCA team is using geometric drawing for stealth by shaping the aircraft and designing it at such angles so as to deflect away maximum radar waves. It will use radar-absorbing material. The AMCA will be a single-seat, twin-engine, stealth all-weather multirole fighter aircraft.AMCA: all-weather fighter aircraft||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iaf-plans-to-have-125-advanced-combat-jets-152029
