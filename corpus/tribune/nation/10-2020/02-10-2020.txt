He says the then army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf had attacked Kargil without informing him.“I would have sacked the army chief if Kargil operation was conducted without informing me,” Khan said in an interview to private news channel Samaa TV on Thursday.Khan also said that he would sack the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) chief if the latter asked him to resign. The comment was made in the context of three-time prime minister Sharif’s claim that the ISI chief asked him to step down in 2014 when Khan had unleashed a big protest sit-in the national capital.He said the army was keeping the country united and slammed Sharif for targeting the military establishment.“Look at Libya, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen; the entire Muslim world is ablaze [so] why are we safe? If it weren’t for our army, our country would’ve been in three pieces…” Khan said.Sharif recently made two speeches from London, where he has been staying since November 2019 on medical grounds, directly attacking the army for interference in politics and claimed that Khan came to power through its support.The powerful Army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy.Khan also said that it was not the army’s job to run the government and failure of a democratically elected government should not be used to impose a martial law.“If a judge gives a wrong decision it means the judiciary has to evolve. The army has evolved as well. Contemporary civil-military relations are the best in history because they are all working in their spheres,” he said.He also claimed that the army was standing by the government in all matters including relations with India, opening of the Kartarpur Corridor and the coronavirus pandemic.

After her condition deteriorated, she was referred to the Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital where she breathed her last on Tuesday.She was cremated in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night.Gandhi who has been at the forefront of the attack on the Uttar Pradesh government over the incident said cremation is not done after sunset.“It was wrong to do so without the consent of the family. We need to put pressure on the government to ensure justice for the young Dalit woman,” she said.“Our country does not have a tradition where the father, brother and the family of the victim are not allowed to light the pyre,” Priyanka Gandhi said.She also paid obeisance at the temple of Lord Valmiki. The temple hosted Mahatma Gandhi for 214 days between April 1946 and June 1947.“Whatever has happened with the woman, her family faced it alone as they did not get any support from the government. Her family felt like they were alone. I came here to express solidarity with you and her family so that you all don’t feel you are alone,” Priyanka Gandhi said.She urged the gathering to raise their voice against the incident.“What has happened with you all we will fight against it. I urge you all to raise your voice and we will put political pressure on the government,” the Congress leader said.Every woman of the country should exert moral pressure on the government to get justice for their sister, she added.

They are not sending infiltrators with weapons and do not fire when intruders make an attempt to cross over the LOC. Weapons are being send separately either by drones or other means to minimise the risk of terrorists getting killed.The officials said in their report to the MHA that the intelligence agencies had also warned that local recruitment of terrorists was on the rise in the Valley.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-pushing-isi-to-flood-jk-with-arms-ahead-of-winter-intel-report-150001

What is more, the furry creature has been photographed too. This happens to be the first time a red panda has been photographed in this particular area of the border state.“Photographs of the Red Panda in the wild are very rare because they live in high altitude regions which are not easily accessible to humans. The photographs will conclusively prove their existence in the area,” Roopak Gowsami, a Guwahati-based journalist who specialises in wildlife and environment related matters, told The Tribune.“The elusive Red Panda has been spotted and photo captured for the first time in the forests of Chug Valley of Arunachal Pradesh,” Arunachal Chief Minister Pema Khandu on Friday proudly retweeted a tweet originating from the state government headed by him .“The community of Chug valley has declared the area community conserved area to secure and preserve the pristine habitat of wildlife & ecosystem,” added the tweet by @MyGovArunachal.Two pictures of the member of the mammal species native to eastern Himalayas and southwestern China shows the animal sitting on a moss-laden tree deep inside the jungle and gorging on the barks of a thin branch.According to Goswami, local communities in Arunachal Pradesh have voluntarily declared nine community conserved areas over 15 years which cover roughly 1500 sq km of forests.“These cover significant habitats which are home to the red panda, Himalayan goral, serow, takin, small cats and contains high altitude lakes. WWF-India had introduced the concept of community conserved area in 2004,” he said.A WWF official said that last time a Red Panda was visually captured in Arunachal Pradesh was back in 2012.“Degin Dorjee, Community Mobiliser, WWF-India, photographed and shot video footage of the animal at Zemithang valley. Due to their extremely shy nature, it is extremely difficult to sight a red panda in the wild and therefore this sighting and the resultant documentation was a significant occasion,” the official said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/red-panda-photographed-for-first-time-at-arunchals-chug-valley-149997

02-10-2020||New Delhi||Hathras case: Massive protest in Delhi as hundreds gather at Jantar Mantar||A massive protest erupted in Delhi on Friday evening as hundreds of civil society activists, students, women and political leaders gathered at Jantar Mantar against the alleged gangrape of a young woman in Hathras district and the UP Government’s response to it.Wearing masks and raising slogans against the UP administration, they demanded justice for the 19-year-old victim and asked Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to resign.The protest was to be held at India Gate initially but had to be shifted to Jantar Mantar owing to the prohibitory orders in place in the Rajpath area.The protest site had been barricaded by the police to restrict the movement of protesters, an official said.Besides ground force, senior police officers and paramilitary personnel had been deployed manage the crowd.Several political leaders, including from the Aam Aadmi Party and the Left, joined the protest.Most of them said they were outraged over the way UP Police cremated the body of the victim, who died at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, a fortnight after she was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men.The woman’s family has alleged that the police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. But local police officers have said the cremation was carried out “as per the wishes of the family”.“What is happening in UP is goondaraj,” lawyer-activist Prashant Bhushan said.                “The police have surrounded the village, are not allowing opposition leaders and mediapersons to enter it and have taken away the mobile phones of the family members of the victim.”  Kejriwal demands strictest punishment for accusedDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who joined the protest for the first time since he became chief minister for the third time, said this is a fight for justice for the victim’s family.“There should be no politics over this issue. Such a crime should not have happened in any state of the country. No matter where it happens, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, West Bengal, or any city, Bangalore, Kolkata, or Delhi, the victim will always be one of India’s daughters,” he said while addressing the protesters.Kejriwal said the entire country wants that the accused should get the strictest punishment.“Few people feel that attempts are being made to shield the accused. That should not happen. They should get strict punishment. The family needs help and sympathy..  The family should not be troubled,” he added.Kejriwal was joined by party MLAs Atishi and Somnath Bharti and AAP functionary Durgesh Pathak and minister Rajender Pal Gautam at the protest, attended by civil society activists, students, women and members of various political organisations.“Media and the BJP are repeatedly asking why are the people protesting against the Hathras rape case. Lakhs of people gathered at India Gate to demand justice for Nirbhaya, while there were many rape incidents even before Nirbhaya and even after Nirbhaya,” AAP’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said.“The reason that the people have joined today in huge numbers is that in this rape case of Hathras, every officer of the administration, whether it was SHO, DM, DSP, ADG, or chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, everybody is trying to save the accused starting right from September 14 till today,” he added.His views were echoed by Delhi WCD Minister Rajender Pal Gautam.“The atrocities against Dalit did not stop in Hathras, they again happened in Bhadohi, Azamgarh, Baghpat and Bulandshahar. Dalits are facing atrocities every 13 minutes. It seems like Dalits are not treated as humans in this country. In the Hathras case, police tried to destroy evidence by cremating the victim’s body and the family is held captive and their phones have been snatched,” he said.Bollywood actor Swara Bhasker, Bhim Army chief Chandrasekhar Azad, and Left leaders Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury also attended the protest.Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav said the Hathras incident “brings out the complete breakdown of anything called rule of law”.“It’s not just that a rape happened, or that she was killed which is worse. There is a political patronage right from the beginning... The Uttar Pradesh administration is out there to ensure that this news doesn’t come out.”                Yadav alleged that the family was denied even a decent cremation for the victim, which even criminals are entitled to.Calling what happened a “shutdown of democracy”, he said, “The UP government has no basis to exist anymore”.Azad demanded that a fast-track court be set up to hear the case daily.“The culprits should be punished as soon as possible so that others get scared before committing such crimes. We will go to Hathras and till the time the matter doesn’t come to Delhi, there is no chance of getting justice,” he said.Bhasker said people from different groups have gathered at Jantar Mantar, which shows how enraged people are. “It is time we start fighting against the rape epidemic. Today, we are standing against it here and we have to win,” she added.Left leaders questioned the silence of the Central Government over the issue.“The silence of the central government and the top leadership of the BJP on such a heinous crime and the UP government’s response thereafter speaks volumes about the authoritarian and anti-democratic ‘chehra’, ‘chaal’, ‘charitra’, and ‘chintan’ of the ruling party,” Yechury said.“The Uttar Pradesh government has no right to stay in power. Our demand is that justice should be served,” he said.Karat said the lawlessness in Uttar Pradesh is “a caste code in operation, not the Constitution of India”.“We fought for the primacy of rape victim’s statement in law, but now, they have brought a false report to save the criminals, saying there was no rape. I want to ask Modiji. Is this your culture? Your UP government has put the family under house arrest. You are punishing them and not the government responsible for her death,” she said.“Is it your culture not to allow people to console the grieving family? Shame on you Modiji. Your government denied her proper medical attention, your government did not allow her family to give her a dignified funeral, and now, you are denying them solace. The UP chief minister should be sacked,” Karat added. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hathras-case-massive-protest-in-delhi-as-hundreds-gather-at-jantar-mantar-149987
02-10-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||Children taking private tuitions in AP found Covid-19 positive||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, October 2 Bhatluru village in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh is in a shock after the residents discovered that a large number of children who were attending private tuitions during the lockdown have tested positive for Covid-19.  According to locals, the tests were conducted on a large number of people after deaths were reported from the village. To the dismay of many parents at least 13 children tested positive for coronavirus after attending classes at a local tutor’s home. The incident came to light when a COVID-19 death was reported from the village on September 25 and the administration decided to test the entire village population. It is now known that the tuition classes were being conducted at the home of a local tutor daily in the evenings and children sat in close proximity. These children are aged between 8 and 12. Besides students, the tuition teacher, his pregnant wife and other family members also reportedly tested positive for the coronavirus.  However, it is still not clear as to who was the source of the infection. The Guntur district health officials said they were verifying the contact list and would arrive at a conclusion soon. Out of the 500 tests results, 45 have come out to be positive and many among them have comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension and asthma, Dr Sheshu Yadav, a Guntur district health official told the media. All the coronavirus infected people have been isolated in the local government hospital, Dr Yadav added.  The administration has also issued a notice under the Disaster Management Act against the tutor for violating the COVID-19 protocol.  Andhra Pradesh has so registered 7,00,235 Covid-19 cases, out of which 57,858 are active – including 6,751 new cases. The death toll in the state stands at 5,869.The silver lining though is that recoveries continue to outnumber fresh infections. In neighbouring Telangana too, the recoveries are more than the fresh cases.Total caseload in Telangana jumped to 1,65,844 with 2,009 new cases reported in the last 24 hours. However, the state has registered 2,437 in the same period.So far 1,145 people have succumbed to coronavirus in Telangana.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/children-taking-private-tuitions-in-ap-found-covid-19-positive-149986
02-10-2020||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||Uma Bharti appeals to CM Yogi to let media and opposition leaders meet Hathras victim’s family||BJP leader and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Uma Bharti on Friday appealed to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to allow media persons and opposition party leaders to meet the aggrieved family of Hathras gangrape victim.Taking to Twitter, she said she was admitted to AIIMS Rishikesh currently and today was her seventh day in the hospital and hence she couldn’t appear in the special CBI court on Ayodhya case.1. मेरे कोरोना पॉजिटिव होने की खबर के बाद मेरे सभी आत्मीयजन बहुत चिंता कर रहे हैं। मैं यहां हिमालय की तलहटी में चारों तरफ गंगा की धारा से घिरे हुए वंदे मातरम कुंज में हूं।She expressed apprehension at the manner in which the police have laid siege to the village and the victim’s family.“She was a daughter of a Dalit family. She was cremated by the police in a hurry and now the family are under siege,” she said in Hindi.Bharti said that there was no such rule that the family could not meet anyone in the SIT investigation.She said we have just laid the foundation stone of Ram temple and have claimed to bring Ram Rajya to the country.“I request you to allow media persons and other political parties to meet the aggrieved family,” she added.She said she was very nervous in the corona ward. If she had not been corona positive, she would have been sitting with that family in that village.“When I leave AIIMS Rishikesh, I will definitely meet the victim’s family in Hathras,” she wrote.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uma-bharti-appeals-to-cm-yogi-to-let-media-and-opposition-leaders-meet-hathras-victims-family-149985
02-10-2020||New Delhi||Hathras case: BJP worries mount, party treads carefully||As Opposition parties escalate offensive against Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath, worries of the ruling BJP at the Centre are mounting. Chief Minister Adityanath may have promised strict action but political observers believe the Hathras incident has the potential to affect saffron party’s prospects not just in Uttar Pradesh but upcoming elections in neighbouring Bihar and also by-polls to 56 crucial Assembly seats across the country, including Madhya Pradesh. “It is difficult to quantify the damage but Hathras has exposed the fault lines in Hindu consolidation which helped BJP garner more than 50 percent votes in several States in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Assemblies are contested on local issues but its fallout in other States cannot be ruled out,” says political analyst Prof Sudhir Panwar from the Lucknow University. Sources in the BJP say the leadership is “keeping a close watch” and that the election results in November may decide their future course of action, including in UP where Chief Minister Adityanath is currently battling strong perceptions of being a “pro-thakur/upper caste” government.  Though senior BJP leaders like Ravi Shankar Prasad have accused the Congress of “double standards on rape incidents and playing the caste card etc”, observers point towards “this rather low-key support” for Adityanath from the top leadership.Caste is the main driver of polls in most States, including Bihar where a smart mix of SC/ST and Upper Castes votes earned 53.3 percent vote share  for the BJP-JD(U)-LJP combination in 2019 General elections. It is also a State where a statement by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on the reservation issue turned the situation in favour of BJP’s rivals in the 2015 Assembly elections. This is enough reason for observers to believe that perceptions about “law and order and atrocities against dalits in UP can go against the NDA alliance in Bihar”. It will be interesting to see what the LJP, a party that goes with the tag name of ‘dalits’, decides tomorrow regarding alliance with the NDA    Besides, a significant number of 56 by-poll seats (as many as 28) are in Madhya Pradesh, primarily the Chambal- Gwalior ‘sambhag’ where atrocities by upper castes are seen as the main reason for the rise of ‘baaghis’ (dacoits) in the region. The era may have ended but if Harthras manages to dent, Shivraj Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan may find himself in trouble. Apart from 28 in MP, eight constituencies are in Gujarat, seven UP, two each in Jharkhand, Nagaland, Karnataka, Manipur, Nagaland, and Odisha and one each in Chhattisgarh, Telangana, and Haryana. The result for by-polls will be announced along with Bihar on November 10.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hathras-case-bjp-worries-mount-party-treads-carefully-149973

02-10-2020||Chandigarh||UP govt ‘conspiring’ to prove Hathras woman a ‘liar’: Surjewala||A day after a senior UP Police officer claimed that the Hathras Dalit woman was not raped, senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala accused the state BJP government of “conspiring” to prove her a “liar”.He alleged that the UP authorities tried to “hush up things and forcibly cremated the victim” in the dead of night against Hindu rituals. “This in itself was a painful incident,” he said, adding that the Yogi Adityanath government should “hang its head in shame”.“Adityanath’s DIG, Law and Order, now says no rape took place. If you had a daughter Adityanathji, you would understand the pain. If any untoward incident takes place with a daughter or a son, how much pain one faces,” the Congress leader said.The former Haryana minister said the victim in her dying declaration had confirmed gang rape.“After she died you are conspiring to prove her a liar. God will never forgive you, Adityanath, for such acts. You must resign and go to the people of Uttar Pradesh, who will tell you what is the reality of the BJP government,” Surjewala said in Kaithal during a protest against the Centre’s farm laws.Citing forensic examination, Uttar Pradesh Police Additional Director General (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar had said the forensic examination on the woman who died at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on Tuesday did not indicate rape.But legal experts debunked the theory, telling PTI that the presence of sperm on the victim’s body cannot be an essential ingredient to prove the crime.Earlier officials had said the rape charge was added to the FIR after the victim told police that she was sexually assaulted.

02-10-2020||Lucknow||Committed to women’s safety: Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||Facing criticism in the wake of alleged rape incidents in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday said those who even think of harming the women’s self-respect will face total destruction.Stressing that his government is committed to women’s safety, Adityanath said such people will get an exemplary punishment.                       The warning has come days after a 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly gangraped in UP’s Hathras by four men. She died at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital on Tuesday morning.Similarly, another case of a Dalit woman’s death after alleged rape surfaced in the state. The woman died in Balrampur on her way to hospital.Taking to the Twitter on Friday, Adityanath said, “Total destruction of those who even think of harming the self-respect of women in UP is inevitable.”         “They will get such a punishment that will set an example for future. The UP government is committed to the safety and development of mothers and daughters,” he said, adding that this is his government’s “resolve and promise”.                   The Hathras woman had succumbed to severe injuries she suffered when she was allegedly assaulted by four upper caste men in the fields at her village in Hathras district on September 14.She was cremated in Hathras in the dead of night with family members saying they were not allowed to bring the body home one last time. But police claimed they had the family’s consent for the cremation.The hurried funeral triggered outrage with opposition parties and other groups attacking the BJP government in UP over the state of law and order.                           Referring to the two cases, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati demanded that UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath should be replaced or President’s rule imposed in the state. The Allahabad High Court too sent out summons to top Uttar Pradesh officials over the Hathras incident. The Congress staged a dramatic protest, leading to the detention of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.The two leaders were detained by UP police in Greater Noida, just outside Delhi, when they insisted on marching to Hathras to meet the family of the 19-year-old woman.

Her family was not even allowed to have a last glimpse (darshan) of her,” Kejriwal said.“On one hand, she was raped by the savages, on the other, the way in which the ruling dispensation treated her, it is not a good thing. We live in a democracy and those in power should not forget that they are not owners but Sevak (one who serves)” he said.The body of the 19-year-old Dalit woman, who died in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, a fortnight after she was gang-raped, was cremated in Hathras in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family alleging that the local police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night.Local police officers, however, had said the cremation was carried out “as per the wishes of the family”.Earlier, Kejriwal had termed the death of the 19-year-old-victim as a matter of shame for the whole society, country and all the governments, and had demanded death punishment for the culprits.

02-10-2020||New Delhi||Congress prepares draft model law to annul central farm laws||Congress has prepared a draft model law that will be legislated by party-ruled states in order to annul the central farm laws.Sources said on Friday the model law had been drafted and will soon be sent to Congress-ruled states to replicate it in their state assemblies.The move comes days after Congress chief Sonia Gandhi asked states under the party’s rule to enact legislations to bypass Centre’s three farm-related laws that have triggered protests by farmers.The move also comes ahead of the tractor rallies to be taken out by the Congress in Punjab and Haryana from October 4, in which party leader Rahul Gandhi will participate. The rallies are part of Congress agitations against the farm legislations.The Congress is strongly opposing the three legislations and it has launched countrywide protests in each district and the Vidhan Sabha on Gandhi Jayanti.The Congress president had advised the Congress-ruled states to pass laws in their respective states under Article 254(2) of the Constitution which allows the state legislatures to pass a law to “negate anti-agriculture central laws” that “encroach” upon the state’s jurisdiction under the Constitution.The Congress claims that rules under Article 245(2) allow a state legislature to enforce laws “repugnant to the parliament law” a provision used by the BJP earlier against the central land acquisition act.The sources said while Congress-ruled states were set to pass the law, some of the non-NDA ruled states were also likely to pass it as they were opposed to the central farm legislations.Parliament had passed The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 during the Monsoon Session and the president granted his assent for them.The laws seek to liberalise the agriculture sector and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country they want at a better price.The model law brought by the Congress will be called the Protection of Farmers Interest and Farm Produce (Special Provisions) Bill that has been cleared by party MP and legal expert Abhishek Singhvi.The model law shall declare “null, void and inoperative” anything that is inconsistent in the three central legislations with the state law. It will also include a provision to ensure that no farmer shall be paid below the minimum support price for the price of the produce.The draft model bill seeks to ensure safeguards for farmers including the minimum support price regime and the framework under the APMC Act to protect their interests.

02-10-2020||New Delhi||Reliance develops RT-PCR kit that can give COVID-19 results in 2 hrs||Reliance Life Sciences has developed an RT-PCR kit that promises diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in about two hours, company sources said.At present, COVID-19 RT-PCR test, which is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2, takes up to 24 hours to give a diagnosis.The sources said computational biologists at Reliance Life Sciences, a subsidiary of billionaire Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries Limited, analysed more than 100 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 sequenced in India and designed unique RT-PCR primers for developing quantitative-Real Time PCR (RT-PCR) kit for COVID-19 detection.RT-PCR kit is so far considered as Gold standard.The kit, developed by scientists at Reliance Life Sciences, is named R-Green Kit (SARS COV2-real-time PCR) and has been technically validated by ICMR for satisfactory performance, the sources said.ICMR’s validation process does not approve/disapprove the kit design as well as it does not certify user-friendliness.The sources said the kit could detect the presence of E-gene, R-gene, RdRp gene of SARS COV2 virus with Actin as an internal control.As per ICMR results, the kit shows 98.7 per cent sensitivity and 98.8 per cent specificity.This kit is a complete indigenous development by the R&D scientists working at the firm, they said, adding one biggest advantage of this kit is that it is simple to use and uses readily available simple reagents and primers which can be synthesised in India.The diagnosis time was approximately two hours, they added.A separate study by Reliance Life Sciences has indicated that the death rate for COVID-19 pandemic may significantly reduce by the end of 2020.The study showed mutation occurrence of structural and non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 form more than 7,000 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 virus from 49 countries.Statistical analysis showed an inverse correlation between the mutation rates of two proteins NSP6 and Surface glycoprotein (S) with the death rate, according to the study published in the Scientific Journal of Biology.It has been predicted that mutations of these two proteins will grow constantly, while the death rate would drop below 0.5 per cent by end of 2020 in cluster I countries (India and Bangladesh).In the study, it has been observed that the cluster II country (USA) mutation rate of NSP6 and S proteins are lower than cluster I and cluster III (Australia and NZ) countries.Therefore, it has been proposed that in cluster II country the death rate of COVID-19 pandemic will weaken later than cluster I and III countries, the study says.Reliance also got a US patent for genetically modified microalgae that is said to defend/delay death. The United States Patent on September 8 issued the patent. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reliance-develops-rt-pcr-kit-that-can-give-covid-19-results-in-2-hrs-149930

02-10-2020||Mumbai||UP police’s treatment to Rahul ‘gang-rape of democracy’: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Friday condemned the treatment meted out by Uttar Pradesh police to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi when he was on his way to meet Hathras victim’s family and termed it as “gang-rape of democracy”.Talking to reporters, Raut said Gandhi was a leader of a prominent political party and nobody would support the way he was “manhandled” by the police.“We may have differences with the Congress party. He (Rahul Gandhi) can be stopped from going to Hathras citing imposition of Section 144 but the way police behaved with him holding his collar...the way he was pushed and then thrown on the ground was highly condemnable,” he said.“This is ‘gangrape of democracy’ and the incident should be probed. Is this the way opposition leaders should be treated so that nobody asks questions? You can ridicule him politically as is always being done. But the way police manhandled him is an act nobody will support,” he said.Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and several Congress workers were briefly detained in Greater Noida on Thursday for alleged violation of prohibitory orders while walking towards Hathras to meet the family of the 19-year-old Dalit woman, who died on Tuesday, a fortnight after she was allegedly gang-raped near her village in western Uttar Pradesh.Rahul Gandhi also fell down in the scuffle after police tried to stop him and his supporters from proceeding on the Yamuna Expressway.Raut also questioned the silence of those who targeted the Maharashtra government “as if heavens had fallen” when the illegal construction of an actress was demolished.He was referring to Kangana Ranaut, whose bungalow in suburban Bandra was partially pulled down by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) recently following her war of words with the ruling Shiv Sena over her remarks on Mumbai.When asked about reports that the Hathras victim was not raped as claimed by the Uttar Pradesh police, Raut asked if the victim had lied in her dying declaration.The Sena MP also said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should break his silence over the Hathras incident. He also criticised the curbs on media reportage of the incident.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena workers held a protest outside the Churchgate railway station in south Mumbai demanding justice for Hathras victim. They waved black flags and held placards. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-polices-treatment-to-rahul-gang-rape-of-democracy-sanjay-raut-149928

02-10-2020||New Delhi||Nirav Modi case: Fresh CBI charge sheet against retired PNB official for disproportionate assets||The CBI has filed a fresh charge sheet against Gokulnath Shetty, the Punjab National Bank Deputy Manager, who allegedly helped Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi perpetrate Rs 13,000-crore fraud, and his wife for amassing disproportionate assets worth Rs 2.63 crore, officials said Friday.The agency has charged Shetty and his wife Asha Latha Shetty, a clerk in Indian Bank, under corruption charges for amassing assets worth over Rs 4.28 crore during the period 2011-17 when the scam was being perpetrated at the Brady House branch of PNB in Mumbai, where he was posted, they said.Of the total assets, the CBI alleged they could not provide satisfactory explanation for assets worth Rs 2.63 crore, which were 2.38 times disproportionate to their known sources of income.The CBI looked into the relationship between Shetty and Modi-Choksi during which it dug into the assets amassed by the retired deputy manager, they said.The agency has registered a separate FIR in November 2018 against Shetty and his wife to look into their assets.It emerged that against a genuine income of Rs 72.52 lakh during a six-year period, Shetty couple had assets in their as well as family members’ names primarily in the form of flats in Mumbai, the CBI alleged.In its charge sheet filed before a Mumbai special court recently, the agency has said that they had purchased a flat worth Rs 46.62 lakh in Goregaon while paid advance booking amount for three more flats in various localities of Mumbai and neighbouring areas.In addition, the agency also detected fixed deposits, bank balance and recurring accounts of over Rs 75 lakh.After computing investments, income and expenditure, the CBI concluded that Shetty and his wife allegedly amassed disproportionate assets to the tune of Rs 2.63 crore during 2011-17, they said.The CBI has already filed charge sheets against Modi and Choksi in which role of Shetty, presently in judicial custody, was given, they said. Shetty, who is alleged to have played a key role in the Rs 13,700-crore loan fraud while working as the deputy manager at PNB’s Brady House branch in Mumbai, was arrested in March 2018.The scam surfaced when the companies owned by Modi and Choksi approached the Brady Road branch in January 2018 after the retirement of Shetty in 2017 seeking renewal of Letter of Undertaking (LoU) for payments to suppliers.Shetty, the then Deputy Manager at Brady House branch of the PNB, had continued in the same seat for seven years and issued fraudulent LoUs with “impunity”, the CBI has alleged.It is alleged that Shetty albeit a junior officer enjoyed clearance level much higher than his post which gave him full powers in Finacle, internal software used by PNB for verifying large transactions.It was alleged Shetty bypassed PNB’s core banking system Finacle and issued LoUs fraudulently, they said.The investigations revealed that messages for fraudulent LoUs were sent to overseas banks by misusing international messaging system for banking called SWIFT platform and without making their subsequent entries in Finacle thus bypassing any scrutiny of such funds in the bank, they said.An LoU is a guarantee which is given by an issuing bank to Indian banks having branches abroad to grant a short-term credit to the applicant.In case of default, the bank issuing the LoU has to pay the liability to the credit-giving bank along with accruing interest.The companies of Modi and Choksi took loans from banks abroad on the basis of these LoUs but did not repay them transferring the liability on PNB.It is alleged that senior officials of the PNB, including the then CEO and MD, did not implement the circulars and caution notices issued by the Reserve Bank of India regarding safeguarding SWIFT operation and misrepresented the factual position to the RBI.Reconciliation of CBS and SWIFT messages was not done despite repeated RBI circulars caution notices and questionnaires, the CBI has alleged.

The meeting will hold discussions on all the 143 seats, they addedLJP president Chirag Paswan on Thursday flagged issues with JD-U supremo and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar at a meeting with top BJP leaders, including Home Minister Amit Shah and party president J P Nadda.Sources said the meeting aimed to resolve the seat-sharing arrangement among NDA allies for the upcoming Bihar assembly polls.Chirag Paswan, they added, listed his issues with Nitish Kumar and also spoke of pressure from within his party to contest at least 143 seats in the polls to the 243-member Bihar Assembly.While no seat-sharing deal has been finalised so far, Shah is believed to have told Chirag Paswan that he has no issues with the LJP.Shah's presence at a meeting of BJP leaders regarding Bihar polls with Chirag Paswan highlights an effort by top leadership to "amicably differences within the ruling National Democratic Alliance" in Bihar, said the sources.Chirag Paswan-headed LJP has indicated it will fight on 143 seats if it does not get an "honourable" deal within the NDA.At the same time, he has also assured he will not contest on seats where the BJP will fight.In 2015, LJP contested 42 seats and won two.The JD(U) was then with the opposition alliance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-janshakti-party-calls-for-meeting-on-october-3-149912
02-10-2020||Vibha Sharma||BJP worries mount; situation in UP may affect Bihar, by-elections in 56 Assembly segments||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 2As the Opposition escalates the ante against the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh, the worries of the ruling BJP at the Centre are also mounting.Political observers say the current situation in Uttar Pradesh not only has the potential to affect saffron prospects in the state but also neighbouring Bihar, where polls are due shortly along with the outcome of by-elections in 56 Assembly segments across the country which also poll in November.Caste is the main driver of polls in most states, especially Bihar, where the balance between the SC/ST and upper castes votes decides the vote share against the Muslim-Yadav combo that mostly works in favour of BJP’s rivals.While in 2015 elections RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s statement over reservation resulted in political gains for the RJD- JD-U etc, observers say perceptions generated by “law and order situation and rapes of Dalit girls in pro-Thakur or upper caste government of Adityanath” can work against the NDA alliance. The JD-U is with the NDA this time but moves of the blow-hot-blow-cold ally LJP, a party that goes by the tag name of SCs, have the potential to change the game in Bihar.Meanwhile, a big number of bypoll seats are in Madhya Pradesh, primarily the Chambal- Gwalior ‘sambhag’ where atrocities by upper castes are the reason for the rise of ‘baaghis’ (dacoits) in the region. The era of ‘baghis’ may have gone but this area adjoining Uttar Pradesh again is dependent on delicate caste combinations, the tipping of which may result in unexpected results for the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government, which needs these seats to remain in power in Madhya Pradesh.Sources in the BJP say the leadership is keeping a close watch and the results in November may decide its future course, including in Uttar Pradesh where Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is battling his most difficult political battle.As many as 56 assembly By-elections across the country and one Valmiki Nagar parliamentary constituency of Bihar, will poll on November 3.The seats include 28 from Madhya Pradesh, eight from Gujarat, seven from Uttar Pradesh, two each from Jharkhand, Nagaland, Karnataka, Manipur, Nagaland, and Odisha. One each assembly constituency from Chhattisgarh, Telangana, and Haryana will also go on polls on November 3.The result for these bypolls will be announced along with Bihar Assembly Election 2020 on November 10.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp%C2%A0worries-mount-situation-in-up-may-affect-bihar-by-elections-in-56-assembly-segments-149911
02-10-2020||New Delhi||Covid vaccine rollout unlikely before fall 2021, say experts||An effective vaccine is not likely to be available for the general public before the fall of 2021, according to experts working in the field of vaccine development.Researchers at McGill University in Canada carried out a survey of 28 experts working in vaccinology in late June 2020.The majority of those surveyed were mostly Canadian or American academics with an average of 25 years of experience working in the field."Experts in our survey offered forecasts on vaccine development that were generally less optimistic than the timeline of early 2021 offered by US public officials," Jonathan Kimmelman, a professor at McGill University, said in a statement."In general they seem to believe that a publicly available vaccine next summer is the best-case scenario with the possibility that it may take until 2022," said Kimmelman, the senior author on the paper published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.Many experts also believe that there may be some false starts before an effective vaccine is available."The experts we surveyed believe that there is a one in three chance that the vaccine will receive a safety warning label after approval, and a four in 10 chance that the first large field study will not report efficacy," added Patrick Kane, the lead author of the paper, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University.The study also showed that about one-third of those surveyed believe that vaccine development is likely to face two main setbacks.The first vaccine widely deployed in the US and/or Canada will receive a boxed warning from the FDA to highlight serious or life-threatening adverse reactions, the researchers said.Also, the first large field trial in the US and/or Canada would report a null or negative result in terms of efficacy, they said."Our study finds that experts are largely in agreement about the timeline for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine," said Stephen Broomell, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the US."While this does not track with many overly optimistic government projections, it reflects a belief that researchers are indeed on a faster pace to development compared to previous vaccines," Broomell said in a statement.

02-10-2020||New Delhi||Farmers’ agitation on path shown by Mahatma Gandhi will be successful: Sonia Gandhi||Calling Mahatma Gandhi the "biggest sympathiser" of farmers, labourers and the working class, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday expressed confidence that the agitation against three recently enacted "black laws" in the agriculture sector would become successful and the peasants would emerge victorious.Paying rich tributes to Mahatma Gandhi and former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri on their birth anniversary, she said while the Mahatma was the biggest sympathiser of farmers, labourers and the working class, Shastri gave the slogan of 'Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan'.The Congress president's remarks came in the form of a video message on a day her party is staging dharnas in every district across the country in favour of farmers and against the three farm laws.Noting that Mahatma Gandhi used to say that the soul of India resides in India's villages, fields and barns, she said the country's farmers and farm labourers are agitating on the streets against the three "anti-farmer black laws"."The Modi government is making the farmers cry tears of blood, even though they grow food grains for the country with their sweat," she said.Sonia said the Congress party had always made laws with public consent and had kept the interests of people foremost before enacting laws, as democracy also meant that every decision of the country had the consent of countrymen."But does the Modi government believe in this? Perhaps the Modi government does not remember that it was not able to change the 'Right to Adequate Compensation Law' for rights of farmers through an ordinance."The Congress party will continue to fight against the three black laws. Today, our workers are agitating in favour of farmers and labourers in every assembly constituency. I want to say with confidence that this agitation of farmers and the Congress will be successful and the farmers will win," she said in her video message.The Congress chief said that during the coronavirus pandemic, all had demanded from the government that every needy countryman should get free food grains."Was it possible that without our farmer brothers, we could manage two meals for crores of our people?" she asked."Today, the country's prime minister is doing gross injustice to our 'annadata' farmers. The laws were made for the farmers, but they were not even consulted. The issue was not even discussed...their interests were set aside by talking to their select friends before framing the three black laws," she said.Gandhi said when the voice of the farmer was not even heard while framing the laws in Parliament, they were compelled to take to the streets to express their voice peacefully on the path shown by Mahatma Gandhi."Far from listening to their voice, the anti-democratic, anti-people government rained lathis on them. What do our farmers and farm labourers want? They only want the right price for their hard-earned produce in these laws and this is their basic right," she noted.The Congress chief said when grain markets would be abolished, hoarders would be given a free hand to hoard food grains and the farmers' land would be handed over to capitalists for farming. "Then who will protect the crores of small farmers?" she asked.Observing that the future of farm labourers and others is linked to the farmers, she asked, "What will happen to small shopkeepers and labourers working in grain markets? Who will protect their rights? Has the Modi government thought about this?"She said the Modi government should remember that it was not able to change the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act through an ordinance.Party leader Rahul Gandhi while greeting fellow citizens on Gandhi Jayanti quoted Mahatma Gandhi's lines in his message, saying, "I will not fear anyone in the world...I will not bow down to anyone's injustice, I will win over untruth with truth and I can bear all the sufferings while opposing the untruth."Sharing a quote of Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said in a tweet in Hindi, "...it is our duty to stand with the weak through our politics."Congress leader Randeep Surjewala also quoted Mahatma Gandhi's words to say: "The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.""On Gandhiji's 151st Birth Anniversary, let each one of us remember it again," he tweeted.

02-10-2020||Mumbai||27 pc Mumbai health workers have COVID-19 antibodies: Survey||The second sero-survey of SARS-CoV2 in Mumbai has found that only 27 per cent health workers have developed antibodies despite being in constant contact with COVID-19 patients, the city civic body said on Friday.According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), in the first and as well as in the second round of sero-survey, approximately 27 per cent health workers, who are more exposed to the virus than ordinary citizens, were found to have developed antibodies against the infection.Presence of antibodies in the blood indicates that the person has been exposed to an infection — in this case, coronavirus.The BMC had conducted the second round of sero-survey along with other organisations in the second half of August, while the first one was done in June.Civic officials said the sero-survey has important lessons for citizens, who are not following COVID-19 safety protocols of wearing face masks, maintaining social distance and hand hygiene.“Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) has pointed out that healthcare workers have developed fewer antibodies though they are more exposed to the coronavirus. It is because they took adequate precautions like wearing masks and PPE kits, maintaining social distance and sanitising themselves properly,” Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of BMC, told PTI.Kakani appealed to citizens to earnestly follow COVID-19 safety protocols to curb the spread of the virus in the city and keep themselves protected from the infection.The survey had been commissioned by the BMC, NITI- Aayog and TIFR.Kasturba Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), ATE Chandra Foundation and IDFC Institute had also partnered in the survey.Mumbai is one of the worst-affected COVID-19 hotspots in the country with over two lakh cases and nearly 9,000 deaths so far.

Lawmakers have 30 days to review the proposed sale. The sale would be executed by defence major Lockheed-Martin.India is one of the 17 countries to whom the US has sold its C-130J Super Hercules aircraft. The Indian Air Force currently operates a fleet of five C-130J-30s. India has placed order for additional six C-130J-30s Super Hercules aircraft.“From the highest landing strip in the world to austere runways almost destroyed by natural disasters, the C-130J goes where other airlifters can't, won't or don't go. It's a workhorse that's in operation around the world, flying in every environment and mission scenario required every day and everywhere,” Lockheed says on its website.In the summer of 2013, Indian Air Force performed the highest landing of a C-130J at the Daulat Beg Oldi airstrip in Ladakh at the height of 16,614 ft. The aircraft was used extensively by the US in Afghanistan and Iraq.

In India, we recognise the centrality of gender equality and women's empowerment in all aspects of our developmental journey,” Irani said in her address to the high-level meeting on the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women on Thursday.As coronavirus hit, Irani said the “Government of India took a series of measures for ensuring safety, security and wellbeing of women during the COVID-19 pandemic”. These included ‘One Stop Crisis Centres’ providing medical, psychological, legal, police and shelter facilities to women under a common roof.Additionally, during the pandemic all efforts were being made to ensure continuity of care for women, especially pregnant and lactating women and women in vulnerable situations, she said.She further added that the ‘National Nutritional Mission’ launched to improve nutritional status of children, adolescent girls, pregnant women and lactating mothers seeks to make India malnutrition free by 2022.At Beijing+25 High-level meeting of the @UN General Assembly on Accelerating the Realization of Gender Equality and the Empowerment of All Women & Girls, highlighted measures undertaken by PM @narendramodi Ji led Government for all-development & welfare of women. @IndiaUNNewYork pic.twitter.com/xvg1eJqYCk  Irani reiterated India’s commitment to the full and effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.“What we achieved 25 years ago at the Fourth World Conference on Women still remains our guiding light and source of inspiration,” she said adding that “India remains committed to building a just and equal post-COVlD-19 world for us and our daughters”.During the 75th session of the UN General Assembly, the high-level meeting was convened with the overall theme of “Accelerating the realisation of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls”.Twenty-five years after its adoption, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action remains the most comprehensive and transformative global agenda for the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls.Its 2020 progress review for the first time takes place in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).The 2030 Agenda, including SDG 5 on achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls, highlight the centrality of gender equality to progress across all the Goals and targets.The Decade of Action and Delivery to implement the Sustainable Development Goals, launched by world leaders in September 2019, contributes to the mobilisation of stakeholders to tackle both emerging and existing gaps in the realisation of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls.Irani said India was now focused on inclusive growth and deep reforms that together were bringing about transformational changes.Heralding these changes under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has moved from a “paradigm of women’s development to women-led development”, she said.She noted that reservation of seats for women in local government has ensured that more than 1.3 million elected women representatives provide leadership in formulating and implementing gender sensitive public policies at the community level.More than 200 million Indian women have been brought into the formal banking system through the Government’s Financial Inclusion Initiative.Innovative use of digital technologies has provided equal opportunity for women to access insurance, loans, and social assistance.Further, ‘Celebrating Girl Child and Enabling her Education’ is a multi-sectoral package of interventions and awareness campaigns that challenge gender stereotypes and realize girls’ right to education, she said.“India today is attaching the highest priority to ensuring gender parity in all spheres of life and elimination of all forms of gender-based discrimination,” Irani said adding that several of the legislations in India such as those pertaining to sexual harassment of women at workplace, protection of women from domestic violence, protection of children from sexual offenses, and criminal laws’ amendments have been strong enablers of women empowerment and protection of children especially girls, over the past six years.

02-10-2020||Washington||Donald Trump, wife Melania test positive for coronavirus; Modi wishes them quick recovery||US President Donald Trump said on Friday that he and first lady Melania Trump have tested positive for the coronavirus, a development that is likely to affect his hectic election campaign just weeks before the presidential polls.“Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!” 74-year-old Trump tweeted.In a statement, Trump’s physician Dr. Sean Conley said the president and the first lady “are both well at this time”, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.“Rest assured I expect the President to continue carrying out his duties without disruption while recovering,” Conley added.Also read: Messages for sick Trump split between ‘get well’ and ‘told you so’Prime Minister Narendra Modi wished Trump and the first lady a quick recovery. “Wishing my friend @POTUS @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS a quick recovery and good health,” Modi tweeted.Trump’s physician said he received confirmation of the positive tests on Thursday evening.“The White House medical team and I will maintain a vigilant watch, and I appreciate the support provided by some of our country’s greatest medical professionals and institutions,” Conley said.Trump’s all engagements outside of the White House were cancelled. He was last seen in public on Thursday afternoon returning to the White House after a fundraising trip to New Jersey.“As too many Americans have done this year, @potus & I are quarantining at home after testing positive for COVID-19. We are feeling good & I have postponed all upcoming engagements. Please be sure you are staying safe & we will all get through this together,” Melania, who is 50,  tweeted.Trump’s “diagnosis amounts to the most serious known health threat to a sitting American president in decades,” the CNN said. “At 74 years old, Trump falls into the highest risk category for serious complications from the disease.”         “His infection with the disease could prove destabilizing in an already fraught political climate, and stock market futures tumbled on news of Trump’s infection,” it said.Vice-President Mike Pence said millions across America were praying for the full and swift recovery of the president and his wife.“Karen and I send our love and prayers to our dear friends President @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS Melania Trump. We join millions across America praying for their full and swift recovery. God bless you President Trump & our wonderful First Lady Melania,” Pence tweeted.White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that the strength of the entire country is with President Trump and the first lady.“America stands united. Our country stands strong. Your President will continue to put the People first!” McEnany tweeted.The White House issued a new schedule to reflect several cancelled events, including a campaign rally in Florida.“The President hosts a phone call on COVID19 support to vulnerable seniors,” said the new daily guidance from the White House.In the middle of the election campaign, Trump has been travelling a lot in particular in the battleground States. The development is likely to bring to standstill his hectic campaign for the November 3 presidential election.On Tuesday night, Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden had their first presidential debate. The second presidential debate is scheduled for October 15, which falls immediately after the mandatory quarantine period. The third and final debate is scheduled for October 22.During the first presidential debate, Biden attacked Trump over the handling of the coronavirus crisis and said the president lied to Americans on the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed more than 200,000 people and infected over seven million others in the country.Trump had mocked Biden for regularly wearing a face mask in public. “I don’t wear masks like him,” Trump said, referring to the 77-year-old former vice president.Biden, who shared the debate stage with Trump, is expected to get tested for coronavirus, CNN reported, citing a source familiar with his plans.The channel quoted former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security Miles Taylor as saying that President Trump having coronavirus sparks national security concerns.“We have to consider the possibility that this may affect, again, his ability to carry out the duties of his office. That’s a big concern. It’s something that this White House wasn’t preparing for, in my view,” Taylor said.Trump and Melania were tested for COVID19 hours after one of their close aides, Hope Hicks, tested positive for the coronavirus.“Hope Hicks, who has been working so hard without even taking a small break, has just tested positive for COVID-19. Terrible!” Trump said in an earlier tweet.Hicks, 31, is the closest aid of the president to have tested positive with coronavirus. She had travelled with the president on Air Force One early this week.Trump, in an interview to Fox News on Thursday night, said he and the first lady spend a lot of time with her.“She wears masks a lot. But she tested positive,” Trump said.In a statement, Deputy White House Press Secretary Judd Deere said that the President takes the health and safety of himself and everyone who works in support of him and the American people very seriously.Several White House staffers have tested positive with COVID-19 in recent months, including the National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien and Katie Miller, Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary.

02-10-2020||Vibha Sharma||Caste tensions rising, BJP Dalit leaders a worried lot||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 1Though the Yogi Adityanath government has set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the Hathras gangrape, the incident has dented the image of the saffron party in Uttar Pradesh, claim several BJP Dalit leaders. Some of them have even warned the leadership regarding the likely political repercussions in UP, say sources. Not just the Dalit MPs, but Brahmins too have been alleging “selective targeting” ever since the death of gangster Vikas Dubey in a police “encounter” in July. The Brahmins were taken by surprise after the BJP picked Yogi as CM. Though a ‘mahant’ of the Gorakhnath sect, they do not see Yogi as one of their own. Dubey’s killing has only strengthened the perception that the Yogi government is ‘anti-Brahmin’.Amid the rising caste tensions, the BJP today accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of resorting to “theatrics” over the death of a Dalit woman to “resurrect” his political career.“Crime against women, Dalits in particular, is rampant in Rajasthan, but politics takes them to UP,” remarked BJP IT cell in charge Amit Malviya.“When your sympathy for the victim depends on the social and religious identity of the violator or the state in which the crime happens, then you are part of the problem. Those obsessing about the identity of the accused in Hathras are silent on Balrampur and Bulandshahr….” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/caste-tensions-rising-bjp-dalit-leaders-a-worried-lot-149727
