15-10-2020||Islamabad||Pak to celebrate Guru Nanak’s 551th birth anniversary from November 28-30||Pakistan will celebrate the 551th birth anniversary of Sikh faith’s founder Guru Nanak Dev from November 28 to 30, the Foreign Office said on Thursday.Every year, a large number of Sikh pilgrims from India and different parts of the world gather at the Gurdwara Janamasthan Nankana Sahib, the birth place of Guru Nanak, in Pakistan’s Punjab province to mark his birth anniversary. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to affect festivities this year.Addressing a media briefing here, Foreign Office Spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri said that the 551th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak would be celebrated from November 28 to 30.He said that Pakistan reopened the Kartarpur corridor on July 29, but India has not yet opened from its side.The corridor – which allows Indian pilgrims to undertake visa-free travel to the historic Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara - was closed on March 16 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.India has said a decision to re-open the Kartarpur corridor would be taken in accordance with the protocols relating COVID-19 and easing of restrictions. Chaudhri expressed the hope that India will review its decision in view of the upcoming 551th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.The corridor links Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Gurdaspur in India to Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan — the final resting place of Guru Nanak.      In response to a question about the construction of a bridge on the Ravi river, Chaudhri said that Pakistan has already started the construction work on its side of the bridge, but “India has not yet provided engineering design of its side of the bridge”.Kartarpur Sahib Gurdwara is located in Pakistan’s Narowal district across the river Ravi, about four kilometres from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine.In November last year, the two countries threw open the corridor linking Dera Baba Sahib in Gurdaspur in India and Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan, in a historic people-to-people initiative.

They allegedly held him by the collar and beat him up, the prosecution said.Raurale lodged a complaint with the Rajapeth police station against Thakur, her driver and two others.A case was registered under IPC sections 353 (assault on or use of criminal force against a public servant in order to deter him from discharging his duty), 332 (causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty), 186 (obstructing any public servant in discharge of his public functions and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) against the four.A chargesheet was filed in the court after investigation.Judge Joshi examined five witnesses in the case and one of them, a cop, turned hostile during trial.Accepting the deposition of the witnesses and arguments of the prosecution, the judge found all the four accused guilty.The court also directed the city police commissioner to take action against the cop who turned hostile.Reacting to the verdict, Thakur said, “I have always respected the judiciary as I am myself a lawyer. As such, it will not be proper for me to comment upon the judgment.“But we are going to move to the High Court for justice. I can only say at this moment that truth shall prevail.”On the possible demand for her resignation, Thakur said she was aware the opposition BJP would seek her ouster from the Cabinet.“They only have this much work. My fight with the BJP is a battle of ideas. It (BJP) is out to end my political career, but I shall continue my fight against the BJP,” she said.

The state doesn’t have its religion. UP government spent Rs 4,200 crore in organising the Kumbh Mela in Allahabad and that too was wrong,” Raj said in a tweet adding that this was his personal opinion and not of the Congress.Raj said his statement was in respect of Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma’s remarks that the state should not fund religious education.BJP attacked Raj saying he was mirroring Congress’ mindset.BJP spokesman Sambit Patra hit back tweeting, “Friends, this is the truth of the Gandhi family. First they gave an affidavit in the Supreme Court saying Lord Rama is an imagination and now Priyanka Vadra ji says that Kumbh mela should also be closed. That’s why the world says Rahul and Priyanka are opportunistic Hindus.”Raj said he never argued for Kumbh to be closed and only questioned its state funding.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-govt-wrong-in-spending-to-hold-kumbh-cong-leader-udit-raj-bjp-hits-back-156252

However, since its collapse in April 2019, the destination remains untapped from India.Besides flying passengers, Virgin Atlantic will also offer a fast cargo service presenting new opportunities for companies looking to export and import goods such as fresh produce, pharmaceuticals and textiles between prime markets in the UK, US and India, the airline stated in the release.“We’re delighted to launch new flying from our home in the north in Manchester. India boasts the largest foreign-born population in the UK and we’re anticipating that post COVID-19, the demand to travel home to visit loved ones will increase,” Virgin Atlantic Chief Commercial Officer Juha Jarvinen said.Following the re-launch of services from Heathrow to Mumbai and Delhi in September, these new services from Manchester represent Virgin Atlantic’s continued investment in India, he added.With over 16 million Indians living outside the country and 5,00,000 living across the north of England, India has the world’s largest diaspora, Virgin Atlantic said.“We are excited to welcome passengers onboard Virgin Atlantic services from Delhi and Mumbai to Manchester for the very first time. Manchester is our home in the north of England and is positioned as a fantastic hub for onward travel,” said Alex McEwan, Country Manager for India at Virgin Atlantic.These new services will open up over 1,30,000 seats between India and Manchester and the airline aims to respond to the large, fast-growing demand to visit friends and relatives as well as capturing demand for business and leisure travel to the region as global economies gradually recover from the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, Virgin Atlantic said.

He said the victim’s family had engaged advocate Seema Kushwaha to represent them.As some of the petitioners and intervenors demanded deployment of CRPF, instead of state police, senior advocate Harish Salve, representing the UP DGP, said the court should record that it was not a reflection on the state police.Mehta wanted the top court to monitor the probe but the court hinted that the High Court should do it.As advocate Aparna Bhat, representing activist Teesta Setalvad, tried to make submissions, Mehta said, "No one should be allowed to collect funds in the name of the victim."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hathras-rape-case-sc-reserves-order-on-protection-for-victims-family-monitoring-probe-and-shifting-of-trial-156244

Similar reports of devastation have been received from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR), who assessed the situation at a special meeting, said that the state had suffered losses to the tune of Rs 5,000 crore. This includes many lakh acres of cotton and paddy crops that have been damaged.The state capital Hyderabad registered 19.2 cm rain, breaking a 117-year-old record of 11.7 cm rainfall.After getting a first-hand account of the devastation, KCR has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging him to immediately release Rs 1,350 crore for rehabilitation and relief works. The PM had spoken to the Chief Minister and offered help.Heavy rains and floods in the last three days have wreaked havoc in various parts of the state, especially Hyderabad. Vehicles were seen floating like boats, houses collapsed and roads and building submerged under as much as twelve feet water at many places.A large portion of the historic Shahpur fort in Telangana's Jangaon district also collapsed.Three houses were damaged under the debris of the historic fort built in 1690 by Sardar Sarvai Papanna Goud, who along with nearly 4,000 men had attacked Warangal in 1708 after the death of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. However, no one was injured.Though the state government is yet to release an official estimation of the extent of crop damage in Telangana, it is estimated to be several lakhs. The cotton crop has been completely ruined as it was almost ready for plucking. The unprecedented rain is a result of a deep depression that has formed over the Bay of Bengal, affecting Andhra Pradesh and Telangana the most.Life continues to be out of gear, even though the state had announced two days holiday on October 14 and 15.Several areas in Hyderabad, including Somajiguda, Abids and Serilingampally, continued to suffer power outages for the third consecutive day as many electric poles have been uprooted and water logging has affected the substations.Andhra Pradesh announced that the rains caused 11 deaths and initial estimates have put damage to agricultural and horticultural crops at around 55,169 hectares.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-yet-to-come-to-terms-with-large-scale-devastation-156231
15-10-2020||New Delhi||Corporates and business houses donated Rs 876 crore to national political parties in 2018-19: ADR||Corporates and business houses donated at least Rs 876 crore to various national political parties in the fiscal year 2018-19 and the BJP was the biggest recipient of such funds, followed by the Congress, a study conducted by poll rights group ADR (Association for Democratic Reforms) showed on Thursday.While the BJP got Rs 698 crore, the Congress came a distant second with a total amount of Rs 122.5 crore, ADR said, citing data made public by the Election Commission of India, to which all parties are required to disclose details about donors and donations above Rs 20,000 in a financial year.The collective donations totalling Rs 876.10 crore, made by corporates and business houses, accounted for nearly 92 per cent of overall donations received by various national parties during the financial year 2018-19, the report said.“Out of five national parties, the BJP received maximum donations of Rs 698.082 crore from 1,573 corporate donors followed by Congress which received a total contribution of Rs 122.5 crore from 122 corporate donors, and NCP with Rs 11.345 crore from 17 corporate donors,” it said.“Out of the total of Rs 876.10 crore donated by the corporate/ business houses to the 5 national parties in FY 2018-19, Rs 20.54 crore was received from the unsegregated category, which includes companies with no details available online or whose nature of work is unclear,” the report said.The report said that a total of 319 donations through which national parties received Rs 31.42 crore do not have address details in the contribution form.“National parties have received Rs 13.57 crore from 34 donations which do not have PAN details in the contribution form. Rs 13.33 crore or 99.75 per cent of such donations without PAN as well as address details worth Rs 13.364 crore belong to the BJP,” the report said.In its recommendations, the ADR said all donors who have donated a minimum of Rs 20,000 as a single or multiple donations should provide their PAN details.“A total of Rs 13.364 crore was collected by the national parties from 274 corporate donors without obtaining their PAN and address details. Such incomplete contributions reports must be returned to the parties by the ECI, to deter them from providing incomplete information,” it said.The report further recommended that corporates should make details of their political contributions available in public domain through their websites (in annual reports or in a dedicated page) for increasing transparency in political financing.“Annual scrutiny of donations reports of National, Regional and unrecognized parties should be initiated by a dedicated department of the CBDT, to discourage donations from shell companies or illegal entities,” it said.

15-10-2020||---||LAC tensions due to China's failure to honour pacts: Jaishankar||New Delhi, October 15The ongoing border tensions with China were “tactical” rather than an existentialist issue and have arisen from dishonouring of agreements. “That is the primary cause of disruption (in Sino-Indian ties),” says External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar.Speaking at a webinar hosted by a western media conglomerate, Jaishankar was initially sharp in his responses. “We can keep going round and round and my response will be the same… These are ongoing discussions and there is not very much I want to say in public,” he said while refusing to talk on the talks with China or whether the Indian Army will be deployed permanently in eastern Ladakh even during the winters.“First of all we regularly patrol the LAC. It is not a question of temporary or permanent army presence. The discussions are going on and the first rule of my business is not to predict what is still going on,” he said.“There is something confidential between us and China. Wait and see how it plays out…What is my thinking, I will keep it to myself,” Jaishankar said on being asked a similar question.He later observed that the options given to him were tactical. “I am not minimising the seriousness of the border situation. The gravity is there. Rather than say it is the biggest challenge, in a sense it is a tactical issue and an expression of the larger structural challenges we face. “I would put it slightly differently. Can a rising China and rising India find equilibrium? What you are seeing on the border is an expression of the inability to meet that challenge,” said the Minister.“The Pakistan issue is again bigger than a tensions issue. There has been for decades cross-border terrorism by Pakistan. There is an underlying issue about what is Pakistan about, how does it see India. Is the use of terrorism, in this day and age, as an instrument of statecraft legitimate and permissible?” he asked.China-US trade tension too was a tactical issue. “The overarching context is that it is harder to find common ground. It makes it much more difficult to conduct diplomacy. These are my priorities (India-China, Pakistan-India, US-China tensions) but are a larger reflection of geopolitical realities,” he observed.Jaishankar also found no relationship between the presence of the Dalai Lama in India or the change in status of Ladakh and the border tensions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-tensions-due-to-chinas-failure-to-honour-pacts-jaishankar-156228

The suicide note, wrapped in polythene, was recovered from his abdomen during autopsy, the official said.He was nearing the completion of his term and was given the responsibility of warder to assist prison staff.As per the suicide note, he was being harassed by the prison staff and not allowed to work as a warder in the last few days."We are conducting enquiry into the allegations," the police official said.Mansoori could not read and write, so somebody must have helped him write the note, the official said. Prison officials denied the allegations in the note, he added.After Mansoori's death, other inmates wrote a letter to higher authorities, seeking FIR for abetment of suicide against the staff named in the suicide note, he said, adding that further probe was on.

15-10-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Stick to pacts, don’t blame India’s infra development for LAC tensions: MEA to China||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 14India on Thursday responded strongly to China blaming its border infrastructure development for tensions at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The MEA suggested at a media briefing that China was misplaced in blaming development of infrastructure. “The restoration of peace and tranquillity can be best done by scrupulously adhering in entirety to the various agreements,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.“The Government was focused on creating infrastructure for its people to facilitate economic development and also meet Indian strategic and security requirements,” he added.“Our position on this has always been clear and consistent. J&K and Ladakh have been, are, and would remain an integral part of India. China has no locus standi to comment on India’s internal matters. We hope that countries will not comment on India’s internal matters, as much as they expect the same of others,” he said to a question on China doubting the status of both UTs.On Arunachal Pradesh too, Srivastava said China has been told several times, “including at the highest level”, that the state is an integral and inalienable part of India.Dwelling on the India-China Army Senior Commanders talks on October 12, Srivastava underlined that for the second successive time, a joint press release was issued. “As indicated in the press release, the talks were positive and constructive. The two sides have a better understanding of each other’s positions,” he said while repeating the earlier formulation that disengagement is a complex process that requires redeployment of troops by each side towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the LAC.To achieve disengagement, he said the two sides plan to maintain the current momentum of communications towards complete disengagement in all the friction areas along the LAC and restoration of peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas.Submarine for MyanmarAt the same time, India has been moving quickly to consolidate its relationships in the neighbourhood. As part of this attempt, India will deliver a submarine INS Sindhuvir to Myanmar which will give the country its first-ever underwater capabilities, Srivastava said.The recent joint trip to Myanmar by Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and Chief of the Army Staff Gen. M M Naravane, the MEA spokesperson said led to several other outcomes besides the delivery of the submarine. Bought originally from Russia, it was refitted by an Indian shipyard for handing over to Myanmar, originally in March. The submarine is likely to be used for training purposes and should keep away similar offers from China.Srivastava described cooperation in the maritime domain as part of “our diverse and enhanced engagement with Myanmar”. India has already helped strengthen Myanmar’s aerial surveillance and counter-terrorism abilities.Myanmar approved Indian plans to set up an embassy liaison office in the new capital of Nay Pyi Taw while New Delhi has contracted for the import of 1.5 lakh tonnes or urad dal by March next year.“In overall terms, the visit reflected the high priority by India to sustain the momentum in bilateral ties,” said Srivastava.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stick-to-pacts-dont-blame-indias-infra-development-for-lac-tensions-mea-to-china-156219

15-10-2020||New Delhi||HC suggests Centre, Dharma Production, Karan Johar to sort out issues on movie 'Gunjan Saxena'||The Delhi High Court Thursday refused to pass any interim order to restrain the release of movie 'Gunjan Saxena - The Kargil Girl'—in theatres and asked the Centre which alleged that the film depicts the Indian Air Force in poor light, to sort out issues relating to its content with the producer and director.The movie was released on Netflix on August 12 and was likely to hit theatres which have opened from Thursday after being shut due to coronavirus pandemic for over six months.According to the Centre, the film which was streaming on Netflix, depicts the Indian Air Force (IAF) in poor light and dents its image.Justice Rajiv Shakdher asked Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, who was representing the Centre, to sit with counsel for other parties including senior advocate Harish Salve for Dharma Productions, senior advocate Rajiv Nayar for director Karan Yash Johar and senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul for Netflix and try to sort out the issue.The judge, who refused at this stage on the Centre's plea to restrain release of the movie in theatres, said those who wanted to watch the film have already seen it on over the top (OTT) platform.“Who will go and watch a movie in the theatre at the time of COVID-19 pandemic. Those who wanted to see the movie have already watched it on the OTT platform,” the high court said.It listed the suit for further hearing on January 18, next year after the counsel for all the parties suggested the judge to first watch the movie so that their arguments can be more clear.During the hearing, Salve maintained that IAF was not shown in bad light in the movie and urged the court to watch the movie.Jain, along with central government standing counsel Gaurang Kanth, submitted that IAF is an integral part of every Indian's day to day life and the film has distorted the image of the force in the name of cinematic work which cannot be appreciated.“We do not have quarrel with the artistic work of Dharma Productions vis- a-vis it shows the personal life of former Flight Lieutenant Gunjan Saxena. Our concern is her interface with IAF, as shown in the movie,” he said.Nayar showed the disclaimer mentioned in the movie which states that it is inspired by the events based on the life of Gunjan Saxena.The court asked the Centre to make a clip of the scenes with which it has a problem.The high court had earlier issued notices and sought response of Dharma Productions Private Limited, which produced the film, its directors Karan Yash Johar and Hiroo Yash Johar, CEO Apporva Mehta, Zee Entertainment, director of the movie Sharan Sharma, Netflix Entertainment Services India LLP, M/s Netflix and Gunjan Saxena on the Centre's suit to remove the movie from all OTT platforms.The court has also sought response of the parties on the interim application seeking interim injunction to remove the movie from all OTT platforms.The Centre had said the movie has dented the image of the IAF as it showed that the force is gender biased, which is not correct.The government has sought a decree of permanent injunction against the defendants from broadcasting or releasing in theatres or any other digital platform the film ‘Gunjan Saxena', without grant of no-objection certificate (NOC) from it.The Centre, in the suit, said the IAF believes in gender equality and has always ensured a healthy working environment for all its officials, uninfluenced by their gender, caste, region, and religion and it has always provided equal opportunities to the meritorious officers.The suit submitted that by changing the name of the movie from 'Kargil Girl' to 'Gunjan Saxena-The Kargil Girl', the nature of the film also got changed and transformed to a historical film on the Indian Air Force and a biopic on Flight Lieutenant Gunjan Saxena, who participated in the Kargil war.It said a historical film made on the Indian Armed Forces based on the life story of a war hero has to be based on the true incidents/instances and the audience watching such a biopic film assumes that the events shown are actual and true.The suit said it cannot be fictionalised or dramatised to such an extent where an entirely different perspective is created based on false and misleading facts/ events which leaves an adverse impression in the minds of the viewers thereby tarnishing the image of the true characters and the organization which is shown in a historical and biopic film.It said as per the 2013 Guidelines, in case of biopics, the approval of the History Division of the Ministry of Defence is a mandatory condition. However, here the defendants changed the title of the film to project it as a historical and biopic film without authorities' approval.

It may be reiterated that these reports are speculative and erroneous," CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said in a statement.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is probing a case of abetment to suicide against Rajput's girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and her family members.The agency had taken over the FIR filed on the complaint of K K Singh, Rajput's father, at a Patna police station alleging criminal conspiracy, abetment to suicide, wrongful confinement, criminal breach of trust, theft and criminal intimidation, which was forwarded to the Centre for a CBI probe.Rajput, aged 34, was found hanging from the ceiling of his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14 and since then, the Mumbai Police has been probing the case taking into account various angles.AIIMS forensic medicine experts had ruled out any foul play in the actor's death.In its conclusive medico-legal opinion to the CBI, the six-member team of forensic doctors had dismissed the claims of "poisoning and strangling" made in the case."It is a case of hanging and death by suicide. We have submitted our conclusive report to the Central Bureau of Investigation," Sudhir Gupta, chairman of the forensic medical board, said.There was no injury on the body other than that of hanging. Also, there was no mark of struggle and scuffle, he said, but refused to divulge any further details stating the case was sub judice.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-terms-erroneous-media-reports-claiming-agency-concluded-probe-in-sushant-rajput-death-case-probe-still-on-156215

15-10-2020||---||Civil society must battle corruption during pandemic: UN Secretary General||New Delhi, October 15UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Thursday sounded the alarm about corruption through €spurious or inferior health products during the Covid pandemic.Guterres said he thought it necessary to flag this issue because corruption during Covid has the potential to seriously undermine good governance around the world.“Corruption is criminal, immoral and the ultimate betrayal of public trust. It is even more damaging in times of crisis – as the world is experiencing now with the Covid pandemic,” said the UN Secretary-General in a statement.The response to the virus, he said, is creating new opportunities to exploit weak oversight and inadequate transparency, diverting funds away from people in their hour of greatest need. Governments too may act in haste without verifying suppliers or determine fair prices. As a result, unscrupulous merchants peddle faulty products such as defective ventilators, poorly manufactured tests or counterfeit medicines. And collusion among those who control supply chains has led to outrageous costs of much-needed goods, skewing the market and denying many people life-saving treatment.“We must work together to stop such thievery and exploitation by clamping down on illicit financial flows and tax havens; tackling the vested interests that benefit from secrecy and corruption; and exercising utmost vigilance over how resources are spent nationally,” said Guterres.He called upon the people to hold leaders to account and to create more robust systems for accountability, transparency and integrity without delay.While there is a need for businesspeople to act responsibly, a vibrant civic space and open access to information are essential. “And we must protect the rights and recognise the courage of whistle-blowers who expose wrongdoing,” he suggested.Technological advances can help increase transparency and better monitor procurement of medical supplies but anti-corruption bodies also need greater support and empowerment.“For many people in all regions, corruption has been a long-standing source of distrust and anger against their leaders and governments.Besides battling Covid, Guterres thought it equally vital to stop corruption exploitation by clamping down on illicit financial flows and tax havens, and by exercising vigilance over how resources are spent nationally.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/civil-society-must-battle-corruption-during-pandemic-un-secretary-general-156213

Nearly 50 per cent of urban Bangladeshis, or 29 million people; and 20 per cent of urban Indians or 91 million, lack basic handwashing facilities at home," it said.Dr Yasmin Ali Haque, UNICEF India Representative said as the pandemic continues to spread, it is important to remember that handwashing is no longer just an individual choice, it is a societal imperative."It is one of the most low-cost and highly effective measures you can take to protect yourself and others against coronavirus, and many other infections," she said."As schools consider the new parameters for reopening, we need to make sure that they continue to prioritize access to handwashing with soap, clean drinking water and safe sanitation for every child," she added.  According to data provided by the child rights body only three out of five people worldwide have access to basic handwashing facilities."Forty per cent of the world's population, or three billion people, do not have a handwashing facility with water and soap at home. Nearly three-quarters of the people in the least developed countries lack basic handwashing facilities at home," UNICEF said."Forty-three per cent of schools lacked handwashing facility with water and soap affecting 818 million school-age children. In the least developed countries, seven out of 10 schools have no place for children to wash their hands with water and soap," it said.The global child rights body further said that according to the Joint Monitoring Programme 2019, approximately 60 per cent of households in India have handwashing facilities with soap while the coverage in rural communities is lower.Meanwhile, the National Sample Survey, 2019, reported that only 36 per cent of households in India washed their hands before eating and only 74 per cent cleaned their hands with soap after defecation, it added.

Her landlady was also at the spot. Soon a heated argument broke out between both the parties, police said.“We received a PCR call regarding a theft in a woman’s house. On reaching the spot, it was revealed that the house was rented to two sisters. Both are natives of Srinagar. The PCR call was made by their landlady,” a senior police officer said.The officer said the tenant alleged that her landlady had broken the locks of house and removed furniture and also stolen clothes and Rs 20,000.During enquiry, it was found that a quarrel had taken place earlier between them over paying house rent and electricity bills. The electricity connection was also disconnected by the BSES, the officer added.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) RP Meena said, “Based on a written complaint given by the tenant, a case has been registered under section 448 (punishment for house trespass), 380 (Theft in dwelling house), 457 (lurking house-trespass), 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of Indian Penal Code at Amar Colony police station and the matter is being investigated.”          A written complaint has also been given by the landlady in this regard and it is also being examined, he said.“So my landlady enters my house along with a man , that i have never seen in my whole life and starts to call me and my friends ‘TERRORISTS’ just because we are from KASHMIR that too, in front of a police official. They trespassed, broke in and our money, furniture,” she alleged in her tweet.She claimed her landlady also abused them.“Then she framed us for stealing the furniture, which she herself took from here in our absence . She is calling us names, abusing us and provoking us. The man literally pushed me and the landlady as well tried to attack me , all in front of DELHI POLICE,” she alleged in her tweet.However, police, said they are probing about the man who was allegedly accompanying the landlady.Responding to her tweet, Delhi Commission for Women Chief Swati Maliwal said “This is shocking & shameful. DCW team is in touch. We”ll ensure action!”                   The DCW also issued a notice to the police in this connection and sought an action taken report, copy of the FIR and whether any arrests have been made in the case.It has also sought details whether any complaints were filed previously, details of any police personnel being present at the spot and steps taken to ensure the safety of the Kashmiri woman.It has sought this information by October 19.

This year it marks a critical reminder for the world that this simple, cost-effective practice can save lives, said the WHO."Handwashing has always been one of the most effective ways of keeping diseases at bay. It is a simple act that pays in dividends when it comes to keeping ourselves healthy and safe. Handwashing is also one of the key cornerstones of COVID-19 prevention."Now more than ever as we embrace the new normal and live with COVID-19, hand hygiene needs to become an integral part of our daily routine and our lives as we live through this pandemic and beyond to protect us from diseases," said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, the regional director of the WHO South-East Asia Region.The world health body said with COVID-19 transmission mainly spreading between people through direct, indirect – through contaminated objects or surfaces – or close contact with infected people via mouth and nose secretions, washing hands with soap and running water was of critical importance."To stop the spread of COVID-19, along with other COVID appropriate behaviours, the practice of handwashing at regular intervals is a must, after coughing or sneezing, when caring for the sick, after using the toilet, before eating, while preparing food and after handling animals or animal waste.“Handwashing after touching common surfaces such as doorknobs or handles, or after one comes back home from visiting a public place will keep ourselves and others around us safe," it said.

15-10-2020||New Delhi||Forwarded Rakul Preet Singh's grievances to NBA, issued advisory to TV channels: Centre to HC||The Centre on Thursday told the Delhi High Court that it has forwarded grievances of actor Rakul Preet Singh, regarding media reports connecting her with the Rhea Chakraborty drug case, to the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) and sought a report from it on the issue.The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) also told Justice Navin Chawla that on October 9 it issued an advisory to all private satellite TV channels to adhere to the programme code provided under the Cable Television Networks Rules.The submissions by the ministry were made in its status report filed through central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul.The status report was filed pursuant to the court's order of September 29 asking the ministry about the steps it has taken after an earlier direction of September 17 to treat the actor's plea as a representation.Advocate Aman Hingorani, representing the actor, said he was not satisfied by the steps taken by the ministry as instead of taking any action it has merely forwarded the matter to the NBA.Hingorani said that the court had asked the ministry, NBA and Press Council of India to treat the plea as a representation and pass separate orders.The counsel for NBA said that it heard the actor on October 3 and then again on October 12 and also 10 media channels.He sought three more weeks to file a report with regard to the outcome of the hearings.The court, however, directed the NBA to take a decision within two weeks and file a status report regarding the same.The PCI, represented by advocate Shreya Sinha, said the authority governs only print media and has no control over electronic or digital media like e-papers.Hingorani, opposed the submission, saying PCI has issued an advisory in August to adhere to journalistic standards when reporting the Sushant Singh Rajput case and the same was not being adhered to by many media houses which have TV channels, newspapers and also epapers.The court, after hearing the arguments, listed the matter for further hearing on December 11.The actor in an application filed earlier has sought an interim order against the media till the time the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Mumbai, completes the investigation in the drug case and files an appropriate report before the competent court.The high court on September 17 had said that the leaks to the media need to be investigated as "someone's reputation is totally destroyed by this".It had also expressed the hope that "media houses would show restraint in their reports and would abide by the cable TV regulations, programme code and various guidelines, statutory and self-regulatory, while making any reports with regard to the petitioner".In her main petition, the actor has sought directions to the authorities to stop media reports from connecting her with the Rhea Chakraborty drug case.She has claimed, in her petition, that Chakraborty had already retracted the statement in which she was allegedly named and yet the media reports were connecting her to the drug case.The NCB probe has stemmed from the investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death case.She has contended that based on unsubstantiated allegations defamatory programmes were being run in the media against her which was causing irreparable harm and injury to her.The petition had also alleged that the ministry, PCI and NBA "have failed to discharge their statutory functions of ensuring compliance of their own directives, which has resulted in the flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioner".

15-10-2020||---||Nitish insulted my father, worked against LJP candidates in 2019 LS polls: Chirag||Patna, October 15 Lok Janshakti Party president Chirag Paswan Thursday made it clear that his parting of ways with Chief Minister Nitish Kumars JD(U) had "nothing to do" with sharing of seats for the assembly elections in Bihar, whose politics his party has "always been opposed to".Paswan said his party had fought the Lok Sabha polls last year in alliance with the JD(U) because of the "compulsions" brought by the return to the NDA of Kumar, whose party he accused of working against LJP candidates in the general elections in violation of the coalition dharma.The 37-year-old, who recently lost his father Ram Vilas Paswan, the LJP founder, also alleged that the Bihar Chief Minister had behaved in a haughty manner when the former Union minister had called on the JD(U) chief last year with the request to accompany him for filing of nomination papers for the Rajya Sabha."Nitish Kumar recently remarked mockingly that my father could not have got elected to the Rajya Sabha without the JD (U)s support, since we had only two MLAs. He should remember that my father was promised a Rajya Sabha berth by the then BJP chief Amit Shah himself", Paswan told PTI-Bhasha in an interview."And I felt so belittled when Nitish behaved in a haughty manner when my father called on him with the request that he accompany us for filing of nomination papers. He came only after the mahurat (auspicious timing) decided for the occasion had passed. No son could have taken such a treatment lying down", Paswan alleged.The LJP chief also dismissed suggestions that he raised a banner of revolt against the JD(U) after the latter tried to deny the junior alliance partner a fair share of seats and asserted "I met Union minister Amit Shah and BJP chief J P Nadda so many times in the recent times. Not once did the issue of seat-sharing crop up"."It must be kept in mind that the LJP has never been a fan of Nitish Kumars style of politics. He has harmed the Dalits by creating a sub-group of Mahadalits for his own political gains", Paswan said.The LJP chief also rubbished the Bihar Chief Ministers much touted saat nishchay (seven resolves) and remarked that the rest of the country was making so much progress and here he was talking about piped water and concrete roads to alleys."The Chief Minister never tires of proclaiming zero tolerance for corruption, crime and communalism. This flies in the face of the fact that graft has hit the implementation of every government scheme in the state. Horrific incidents like recent burning alive of a woman after rape took place in Buxar district."And communalism? What does he has to say about the comments of Nityanand Rai? He owes an answer. Unlike us, he is still a part of the NDA in Bihar", Paswan said.Rai, the union minister of state for Home and a senior BJP leader, has kicked up a storm by stating at one of his recent rallies that the victory of the RJD-led opposition in elections could make Bihar a safe haven for terrorists based in Kashmir.The averment has been criticised by opposition parties as an attempt to polarise voters against the minorities.

If stubble burning causes only 4% pollution, then why has pollution suddenly increased last fortnite? Air was clean before that. Same story every yr.“There’s no massive jump in any local source of pollution in last few days to cause this spike?,” Kejriwal said in tweet.Earlier in the day, Javadekar said that stubble burning is not a major factor for air pollution in Delhi-NCR.“Only 4 percent pollution is due to stubble burning. Ninety-six per cent of it is due to local factors like biomass burning, garbage dumping, unpaved roads, dust, construction and demolition activities etc,” he said.Aam Aadmi Party MLA Raghav Chadha said that the CPCB’s own estimate of 2019 suggest stubble burning contributed up to 44 per cent to the National Capital’s air pollution.“Central Pollution Control Board’s own estimate of 2019 suggest stubble burning contributed up to 44% to Delhi’s air pollution.“Ministry of Earth Sciences’ SAFAR said at peak of stubble burning in Punjab & Haryana account for 44% of Delhi’s pollution. What is Mr.Javadekar smoking?,” Chadha said in a tweet.On Thursday, a layer of smoky haze lingered over Delhi-NCR with the air quality in the region hitting ‘very poor’ levels, even as stricter anti-air pollution measures, including a ban on electricity generators, came into force under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large cluster of farm fires near Amritsar, Patiala, Tarn Taran, and Firozpur in Punjab, and Ambala and Rajpura in Haryana.However, the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said its impact on the capital’s air quality was marginal.

A case under sections 186, 353, 279, and 337 of the Indian Penal Code was also registered against him at the Delhi Cantonment police station.The student was driving the car rashly and zigzagging across lanes in the Delhi Cantonment area on Monday evening. The car also had a fancy number plate."When the driver was stopped by the constable, the driver who was not even having a licence tried to run over him and dragged the policeman on the bonnet of his car. Had any speeding vehicle been coming from behind, the constable would have suffered serious injuries," said a senior police officer.The constable, Mahipal Singh Yadav, suffered injuries after he fell off the bonnet.  The driver tried to flee, but was caught by public and other traffic police personnel who had to chase him for nearly a kilometer.

15-10-2020||New Delhi||Smoky haze shrouds Delhi-NCR; air quality enters ‘very poor’ zone||A layer of smoky haze lingered over Delhi-NCR on Thursday with air quality in the region hitting ‘very poor’ levels, even as stricter anti-air pollution measures, including a ban on electricity generators, came into force under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large cluster of farm fires near Amritsar, Firozpur and Faridkot in Punjab and Patiala, Ambala and Rajpura in Haryana.However, the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said its impact on the Capital’s air quality was marginal.The City recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 315 at 11:10 am. The last time the air quality hit such a poor level was in February.The 24-hour average AQI was 276 on Wednesday, which falls in the ‘poor’ category. It was 300 on Tuesday, 261 on Monday, 216 on Sunday and 221 on Saturday.ITO (AQI 372), Vivek Vihar (AQI 370), and Shadipur (AQI 359) recorded the highest pollution levels on Thursday morning.The air quality in the neighbouring cities of Faridabad (317), Ghaziabad (326), Greater Noida (344) and Noida (314) was also in the red zone.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department said the dip in the air quality can be attributed to low wind speed which allowed accumulation of pollutants.PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR rose to 300 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 9:30 am—the highest this season so far. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.The levels of PM2.5 – finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream – were 151 µg/m3. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.GRAP—a set of anti-pollution measures followed in Delhi and its vicinity towns according to the severity of the situation—comes into force on Thursday.It was notified by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2017 for implementation through the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority.                  The measures under GRAP include increasing bus and metro services, hiking parking fees and stopping use of diesel generator sets when the air quality turns poor.                When the situation turns “severe”, GRAP recommends closure of brick kilns, stone crushers and hot mix plants, sprinkling of water, frequent mechanised cleaning of roads and maximising power generation from natural gas.The measures to be followed in the “emergency” situation include stopping entry of trucks in Delhi, ban on construction activities and introduction of the odd-even car rationing scheme.EPCA, however, had earlier told Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh that they “should try and avert the need to take other emergency measures for pollution control as the economy is already under stress post-lockdown. Therefore, our combined effort is to ensure that there is no further disruption”.With Delhi-NCR bracing for months of poor air quality, experts have warned that high levels of air pollution can aggravate the COVID-19 pandemic.Severe air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most -- 18 to 39 percent—to Delhi’s air pollution.Road dust is the second largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 percent), followed by industries (2 to 29 percent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 percent) and construction (8 percent).

Hence, the petition under Article 32 of the Constitution is not entertained," said a Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud."One must have faith in the Bombay High Court," said the Bench pointing out that Republic TV has an office at Worli which is close to Flora Fountain where the Bombay High Court is located.“Better, you move HC for relief,” the top court told petitioner Arg Outlier Media Private Ltd which owns the Republic Media Network.Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing the petitioner, chose to withdraw the plea following the court's refusal and the petition was accordingly "dismissed as withdrawn".The Bench took exception to the Mumbai Police chief making statements in the media."The way the Mumbai Police Commissioner has been giving statements in the press is not appropriate," it noted.In their affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, the Mumbai Police opposed Republic TV's demand for a CBI probe, saying the news channel can't decide which agency should investigate the matter.Maintaining that an investigation into a crime can't be a matter of free speech, the affidavit accused Goswami of threatening and intimidating witnesses by his programmes.Alleging that Republic TV was attempting to turn the FIR in the TRP scam case into a “media spectacle”, Mumbai Police said rights under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution can't be used as a shield against a crime and "used to side-step, thwart, or prevent any investigation by a competent agency into the alleged fudging of the TRP ratings.""Such a media trial is antithetic to the process of free and fair investigation as also administration of justice," the affidavit submitted.The Mumbai police had registered a case in the TRP scam and summoned Republic TV's chief financial officer S Sundaram. They had arrested owners of two Marathi channel in the case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trp-scam-sc-asks-republic-tv-to-move-bombay-high-court-156139

Almost every sector, barring a few, have been opened for FDI under the automatic route, and with limits above 51 per cent,” he said.Sandhu during his address also highlighted the National Education Policy and various path-breaking reforms taken in India.  “We have brought in new National Education Policy and path-breaking reforms in labour, space, and agriculture sectors. Our aim is to create virtuous cycles of investment, growth and employment through these focused and people-centric reforms,” he said during the round table that was attended by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam.Sandhu said that during the pandemic there has also been expanded collaboration between the two countries in areas such as health, vaccine development, science, and technology and innovation.  “We are learning from each other's best practices. The free and open exchange of ideas and information has been one of the biggest strengths of our partnership,” he said.He said in Virginia in particular 14 Indian companies have invested around USD 80 million. These investments support over 1,300 jobs. With the majority of the investment in IT sector, Indian companies are adding to Virginia's competitive edge, in tech innovation.Noting that Northam has been focused on developing an education system underlining innovation, he said technology and innovation after all hold the key to the future.Sandhu mentioned three Indian companies, among others, who have a significant presence in Virginia. Wipro – one of the leading IT companies of India – in 2019 selected Richmond in Virginia to establish their latest engineering and innovation centre.Apart from IT, Indian companies are moving to Virginia for opportunities in other sectors as well. Granules India - an Indian pharmaceutical manufacturing company based in Hyderabad – found its way to Fairfax County, Virginia.Similarly, Mumbai-based speciality packaging company, Essel Propack's, has a manufacturing facility, in the city of Danville, he said.“It is indeed praiseworthy that besides bringing in the FDI our companies through their CSR initiatives, have been giving back to the local communities. They are supporting students particularly in STEM fields by collaborating with the US educational institutions and are focusing on upskilling and reskilling of workers,” he said.Indian companies have also been funding research and innovation activities in the US strengthening further the US knowledge economy, he said.

15-10-2020||Washington||Focusing on protecting people, health of population remain a priority for India: IMF||India's priorities should be to protect the most vulnerable people, well-targeted support and protecting small- and medium-sized enterprises so that they do not collapse as the country battles the COVID-19 pandemic, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva has said.Speaking at a news conference here during the ongoing annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank, Georgieva said on Wednesday that focusing on protecting people and on the health of the population remained a priority for India."What needs to be done?…Well, clearly protecting the most vulnerable people, well-targeted support, protecting small- and medium-sized enterprises/firms so they do not collapse, and using what the government is now aiming to do, a further injection of support in a way that gives a better chance to turn a corner," Georgieva said."Like everywhere else, until we have a durable exit from the health crisis, we will be faced with difficulties, uncertainty, and uneven recovery," she said.Describing COVID-19 as a human crisis everywhere, and especially in countries where the loss of life has climbed up so much, she said in India, 100,000 people had died."Therefore, focusing on protecting people and on the health of the population remains a priority," she said."India has taken measures within the capacity of the country, two per cent fiscal measures, plus four per cent in forms of guarantees, not direct fiscal measures,” Georgieva said."This helps, but if you compare what advanced economies have been able to do, what some of the other emerging markets with very strong fundamentals could do, clearly is somewhat constrained. What we see in India is a very dramatic shrinkage of GDP this year by over 10 per cent, according to our just released forecast," she said.Georgieva said that India had a vibrant economy."Let's remember that it stepped into this crisis as one of the fastest growing economies in the world. For next year, our projection in baseline scenario is return to growth of 8.8 per cent,” she said.A day earlier, the IMF in its annual World Economic Report said that the forecast are particularly large for India, where Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted much more severely than expected in the second quarter."As a result, the economy is projected to contract by 10.3 per cent in 2020, before rebounding by 8.8 per cent in 2021," it said.In 2019, India's growth rate was 4.2 per cent. Last week, the World bank said India's GDP this fiscal is expected to contract by 9.6 per cent."India's GDP is expected to contract 9.6 per cent in the fiscal year that started in March," the World Bank said in its latest issue of the South Asia Economic Focus report.

In the letter, the veterans have asked the government to issue a warning to Facebook and Twitter.These posts against the “Muslim Regiment” are false as the Army did not have any such regiment in 1965 or since, the letter stated.Social media posts saying Muslim soldiers of this so-called “Muslim Regiment” refused to fight the war against Pakistan in 1965 question the loyalty of all serving and retired Muslim soldiers.“Such social media posts are an insidious attack on the morale of our armed forces,” the letter read.The letter cites how Lt Gen SA Hasnain (retd), in November 2017, pointed out that these were possibly part of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) disinformation campaign.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ex-servicemen-for-action-against-fake-posts-155892
15-10-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Beijing’s Ladakh assertion at odds with historical facts||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 14Beijing’s questions on the status of Union Territory of Ladakh are in divergence to documented history. These include records from Tibet, the Sikh rule over Ladakh, and British documentation. All show Ladakh was never under Chinese control. “The claims of China are far-fetched and erroneous,” said a functionary.Besides, separate boundaries unilaterally proposed by China in 1954 and 1960 did not question the status of Ladakh and India’s control over it. New Delhi had rejected the boundaries proposed by China.What Peace Treaty saysIn Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Tuesday had said, “China doesn’t recognise the so-called ‘Ladakh Union Territory’ illegally set up by India.”Experts on the India-China dispute point out how these claims defy available records. The Peace Treaty between Ladakh and Tibet signed at Tingmosgang in 1684 mentions it clearly that Ladakh and Tibet were separate entities.“The boundaries fixed in the beginning, when king Skyed-Ida-ngeema-gon (of Ladakh) gave a kingdom to each of his three sons, shall still be maintained,” the first clause in the treaty reads. The treaty is about the relationship of Ladakh and the Dalai Lama.The history of Ladakh took another turn in 1834 when General Zorawar Singh, at the head of the large Sikh Army, merged the Buddhist-dominated kingdom of Ladakh with Ranjit Singh’s empire, which had its capital in Lahore. The local king was made a vassal of the Sikh empire paying an annual tribute of Rs 20,000. Barring a brief period of the Mughal rule, Ladakh did not pay tribute to Kashmir.Raja of Jammu Gulab Singh after Ranjit Singh’s death chartered his own course and entered into a fresh agreement with Ladakh in 1842 — “Ladakhi letter of agreement”.The subsequent collapse of the Sikh empire in 1846 brought the British at the helm. The British made five attempts to settle the boundary of Ladakh with Tibet and China between 1846-47, 1865, 1873, 1899 and 1914.While all these attempts failed, Ladakh was included with the British Empire on each occasion. The British boundaries were proposed as: The 1865 line was proposed by WH Johnson and Maj Gen John Ardagh, the then Director-General of Military Intelligence of British India. In 1873, the British foreign office drew a boundary different from Johnson-Ardagh Line. In 1899, Sir Claude MacDonald proposed a line to China. Known as the Macartney-MacDonald Line, it had different alignment than the other. In 1914, the Simla Conference too proposed a boundary.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/beijings-ladakh-assertion-at-odds-with-historical-facts-155895
