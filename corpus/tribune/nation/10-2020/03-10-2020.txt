03-10-2020||New Delhi||Indian scientists find method for early diagnosis of peptic ulcer-causing bacteria||Scientists at the S N Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences in Kolkata have found a method for early diagnosis of a peptic ulcer-causing bacteria with the help of a biomarker called ‘BreathPrint’ found in the breath, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) said on Saturday.The team of researchers at the SNBNC, an institute under the DST, recently spotted the new biomarker for diagnosis of helicobacter pylori in semi-heavy water (HDO) in exhaled human breath.The team used the study of different water molecular species in human breath, also called ‘Breathomics’ method, to explore different water isotopes in human exhaled breath, according to a DST statement.The stomach infection cased by Helicobacter pylori may turn serious if it is not treated early. It is usually diagnosed by the traditional and panfully invasive endoscopy and biopsy tests which are not suitable for early diagnosis and follow up.“Our gastrointestinal (GI) track plays a crucial role in water metabolism in the body. Water exists in nature as four isotopes.“It is believed that any kind of impaired or unusual water absorption in our GI track may be associated with various gastric disorders or abnormalities like ulcer, gastritis, erosions and inflammation. But, so far, there has been no clear experimental evidence to support this,” the statement said.Experiments by the team has shown direct evidence of unique isotope-specific water metabolism in the human body in response to the individual’s water intake habit. They have shown that different isotopes of exhaled water vapour are strongly linked with various gastric disorders during the process of human respiration, it said.This work, funded by the Technical Research Centre (TRC) and supported by the DST, was recently published in the journal ‘Analytical Chemistry’ of the American Chemical Society (ACS).The researchers have demonstrated that the isotopic signatures of unusual water absorption in the GI tract can trace the onset of various abnormalities.The team has already developed a patented ‘Pyro-Breath’ device for diagnosis of various gastric disorders and Helicobacter pylori infection, which are under the process of technology transfer, it added.

03-10-2020||Jaipur||Consent does not matter when minors are involved: NCW on Baran rape case||A member of the National Commission for Women on Saturday asked why action cannot be taken in the alleged Baran rape case in Rajasthan even if the girls went out with the accused on their own, saying consent does not matter when minors are involved.Two minor sisters of Baran district went missing on September 19 and were found in Kota on September 22. After recording their statements, girls were handed over to their families.According to police, both the girls in their statements made it clear that they were not raped and had gone to Kota on their own without being forced.“I saw the chief minister’s statement that the girls in their statement admitted that they had gone with their own will, but a legal point arises here because the girls are minor and minor’s consent is not a consent in the language of law,” Rajulben Desai, member of the commission, told reporters here.“Why can’t we take action in this case?” she asked.On Thursday, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had hit out at a section of the opposition and media for “misleading” the public by comparing an incident in Baran district of the state to the gruesome gang-rape of a Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras.Desai, along with another NCW member Shyamala S Kundar, was in the city to meet the DGP and other officials to discuss the cases of violence against women.When asked about the NCW’s stand on the Hathras case in Uttar Pradesh, Desai said the commission had taken a cognisance of the matter when the girl was admitted to Safdarjung hospital in New Delhi.“The commission held a video conference with the DGP and also wrote to the chief secretary of Uttar Pradesh over the issue,” she said.When asked why the members of the commission decided to visit Rajasthan instead of Hathras, she said, “We have girls alive here and we do not want that what happened there should take place here also. We will go to other states as well.” Shyamala S Kundar said the commission received 764 complaints last year and 61 of them are related to rape and attempt to rape.She said the Rajasthan Police is yet to submit action-taken reports in 55 of the 61 cases.“We raised the matter with the DGP and he has assured us that the ATRs will be submitted soon,” Kundar said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/consent-does-not-matter-when-minors-are-involved-ncw-on-baran-rape-case-150526

The incident occurred just after midnight on Friday.Javadekar is in Goa to conduct meetings with farmers' groups over the controversial farm Bills which were passed by the Parliament recently."Jungle raj in Goa -- @INCGoa delegation led by Vice-President @SankalpAmonkar @JanaBhandariGoa @varadmardolkar @AdvArchitNaik @RautMeghashyam @SudinNaikGoa and 10 others arrested by @DGP_Goa for seeking appointment with @PrakashJavdekar and waiting to meet him in hotel lobby in Panaji," Goa Congress chief Girish Chodankar tweeted.Speaking to reporters, even as the opposition party workers were being taken away to the police station, Amonkar said the Congress delegation had arrived at the hotel to meet Javadekar and seek a formal appointment to discuss the Mhadei interstate river water-sharing issue."We are being arrested just because we want to seek an appointment with a Union Minister," Amonkar added.The Congress had in the past accused Javadekar of being partial to Karnataka, one of the three states besides Goa and Maharashtra which are part of the Mhadei river water-sharing dispute.On Saturday, the party workers burnt an effigy of Javadekar in Panaji.The police, however, said the Congress workers were arrested because they insisted on meeting Javadekar late at night."It was a preventive arrest only to avoid a law and order situation," a senior police officer said.Meanwhile, Javadekar met two groups of farmers in Mayem village and Mapusa town in North Goa, during which the Union Minister explained the importance of the three farm Bills, which he said would give greater freedom to farmers vis-a-vis selling their produce for a better price.Javadekar's entourage was also shown black flags by a group of around 50 farmers near Mapusa.

The deceased was identified as Dishu Kumari. She used to work in a BPO in Gurgaon, the officer said.Police checked the CCTV footage and found that the deceased, along with the suspect, had entered the room on September 23. However, only the suspect came out of the room a few hours later, and went away on a scooter, which he had borrowed from his friend, the officer said.During investigation, police got a tip-off that the suspect had fled to Dibrugarh in Assam and may visit his friend there.The police also got to know that the suspect had called one of his friends in Dibrugarh, using the phone of a shopkeeper and told him that his scooter was parked at Alambagh bus stand in Lucknow."Kumar was finally apprehended from a hotel in Dibrugarh. He had booked a taxi and was ready to move to Shillong in Meghalaya," Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said.Kumar got married in April 2017 and has a two-year-old daughter.He left his family and started living in a rented accommodation at Qutub Vihar. He was working in a BPO in Gurgaon and was in a relation with Dishu since 2017, the DCP said.However, Kumar came to know that Dishu was having relations with other people and this often led to a fight between them, police said.On September 23, Kumar and Dishu came to the rented accommodation in Qutub Vihar. They both again had a heated argument, following which Kumar strangled her, police said.Dishu fell unconscious but regained consciousness after sometime, started screaming and also tried to escape from the room. But Kumar again strangled and smothered her to death, the DCP said.While Kumar was trying to stuff the body inside the storage compartment of the bed, the head of the woman hit an iron nail. Kumar then covered her body with a blanket, locked the room and fled, police said.He sold his mobile phone in Dwarka Sector-12 for Rs 31,000 and threw Dishu's mobile phone in the bushes near Greater Kailash-1.Kumar then went to Agra on a scooter after which he travelled to Lucknow the next day following which he took a bus to Gorakhpur.

Speculations mount after Chirag Paswan’s tweet||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 3Amid reports that LJP president Chirag Paswan is “consulting” his father, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan before officially announcing the party’s decision to contest outside the NDA in Bihar, speculations of a multi-corner contest in the poll-bound state are now becoming stronger.  The LJP, which was to meet on Saturday to take the final call on whether to go with the NDA or strike alone on 143 seats in the forthcoming Assembly elections in Bihar, put off the meeting until Sunday after Chirag Paswan had to “rush to the hospital to see his ailing father”.However, before doing that he posted his picture with Prime Minister Narendra Modi where he said he took inspiration from the PM and hoped that he would give blessing to his efforts to make ‘Bihar first and Bihari first’ “so that all his candidates can strengthen the hands of the Prime Minister”..#Bihar1stBihari1st pic.twitter.com/l1PEi15K7a  “I am proud that I got an opportunity to work as an MP with a Prime Minister whose skillful leadership is known across the World. Taking inspiration from PM Modi, the Lok Janshakti Party prepared the ‘Bihar First, Bihari First Vision Document 2020’ with the suggestion of four lakh Biharis so that Bihar and Bihari can be brought to the forefront. I not only hope but believe that you (PM Modi) will give your blessings to bring Bihar at the forefront and help return its lost identity and glory so that all my candidates can strengthen the hands of respected Prime Minister,” he wrote in a post on the social media.Notably, this is the last meeting of the Parliamentary Board of the LJP which wants to contest 143 seats in the forthcoming elections. Chirag Paswan, who recently flagged with Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda LJP’s issues and differences with JD-U supremo and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, is also believed to have told them about the pressure from within his party to contest at least 143 seats in the polls to the 243-member Bihar Assembly.The LJP has said it will contest 143 seats if it does not get an “honourable” deal within the NDA. At the same time it also assured to not contest against the BJP.In the 2015 Assembly elections, the LJP contested 42 seats and won two. The JD(U) was then with the opposition alliance. According to reports there are posters in Patna with the slogan “Modi se bair nahi, Nitish teri khair nahi” (No issues with Modi, but Nitish you are done with). It is not just the question of number the party is demanding but also the quality of seats. Interestingly, LJP leaders, who have claimed that the party will not fight on seats which the BJP will fight, also promise to back a BJP CM in the post-poll scenario. Sources in the LJP say it is the right time to  project Chirag Paswan as the leader in the state “where  Nitish Kumar is fighting his last elections and there is also a leadership vacuum”. This is the best time to expand the LJP because of Nitish Kumar’s anti-incumbency, they add.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ljp-in-or-out-of-nda-in-bihar-speculations-mount-after-chirag-paswans-tweet-150513

03-10-2020||New Delhi||Paytm, other Indian startups vow to fight ‘big daddy’ Google's clout: Sources||Dozens of India's technology startups, chafing at Google's local dominance of key apps, are banding together to consider ways to challenge the US tech giant, including by lodging complaints with the government and courts, executives told Reuters.Although Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, has worked closely with India's booming startup sector and is ramping up its investments, it has recently angered many tech companies with what they say are unfair practices.Setting the stage for a potential showdown, entrepreneurs held two video conferences this week to strategise, three executives told Reuters."It's definitely going to be a bitter fight," said Dinesh Agarwal, CEO of e-commerce firm IndiaMART. “Google will lose this battle. It's just a matter of time.” He said executives have discussed forming a new startup association aimed chiefly at lodging protests with the Indian government and courts against the Silicon Valley company.Nearly 99 per cent of the smartphones of India's half a billion users run on Google's Android mobile operating system. Some Indian startups say that allows Google to exert excessive control over the types of apps and other services they can offer, an allegation the company denies.The uproar began last month when Google removed popular payments app Paytm from its Play Store, citing policy violations. This led to a sharp rebuke from the Indian firm's founder, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, whose app returned to the Google platform a few hours later, after Paytm made certain changes.In a video call on Tuesday, Sharma called Google the "big daddy" that controls the "oxygen supply of (app) distribution" on Android phones, according to an attendee. He urged the roughly 50 executives on the call to join hands to "stop this tsunami.""If we together don't do anything, then history will not be kind to us. We have to control our digital destiny," Sharma said.One idea raised was to launch a local rival to Google's app store, but Sharma said this would not be immediately effective given Google's dominance, one source said.Sharma and Paytm, which is backed by Japan's SoftBank Group Corp, did not respond to requests for comment.Google declined to comment. It has previously said its policies aim to protect Android users and that it applies and enforces them consistently on developers.Straining tiesThis week the US company angered some Indian startups by deciding to enforce a 30 per cent commission it charges on payments made within apps on the Android store.Two dozen executives were on a call on Friday where many slammed that decision. They discussed filing antitrust complaints and approaching Google's India head for discussions, said two sources with direct knowledge of the call.Participants included sports technology firm Dream Sports, backed by US hedge fund Tiger Global, social media company ShareChat and digital payments firm PhonePe, the sources said.None of those companies responded to requests for comment.Google defends the policy, saying 97% of apps worldwide comply with it.Google already faces an antitrust case related to its payments app in India and a competition investigation into claims it abused Android's dominant position. The company says it complies with all laws.These spats strain Google's strong ties to Indian startups.It has invested in some and helped hundreds with product development. In July, its Indian-born CEO Sundar Pichai committed $10 billion in new investments over five to seven years.The conflict "is counterproductive to what Google has been doing--- it's an odd place for them to be," said a senior tech executive familiar with Google's thinking. "It's a reputation issue. It's in the interest of Google to resolve this issue." Google looms over every aspect of the industry.Paytm on Saturday told several startup founders in a communication seen by Reuters that it was collating input on challenges to Google Play Store and its policies to submit to the authorities.To craft their attack, they are using a shared Google document. --- Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/paytm-other-indian-startups-vow-to-fight-big-daddy-googles-clout-sources-150482

According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.#Galwan #LAC #India #IndianArmy #IndiaChinaStandoff A memorial has come up on DSDBO road to commemorate the sacrifice of Galwan Braves. This is some 100 kms north of Shyok village in Ladakh. Doubt if the #PLA will honour it's soldiers. @thetribunechd @adgpi @NorthernComd_IA pic.twitter.com/VV3966BRhf  Post 120 lies along the Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi (DBO) road. The names of all the 20 Indian Army personnel were inscribed at the unit-level memorial.Colonel B Santosh Babu, the commanding officer of the 16 Bihar regiment, was among the Indian Army personnel killed in the clash that had significantly escalated the border tension between the two countries with India calling it “a premeditated and planned action by China”.The Chinese soldiers used stones, nail-studded sticks, iron rods and clubs in carrying out brutal attacks on Indian soldiers after they protested the erection of a surveillance post by China around patrolling point 14 in Galwan Valley.Giving a brief account of Operation “Snow Leopard”, the Army mentioned in a plaque at the memorial that Colonel Babu led the ‘Quick Reaction Force’ of 16 Bihar Regiment and attached troops tasked to evict a group of Chinese troops from the general area in ‘Y nala’ (a junction) and stop them from moving further to Patrolling Point 14.“The column successfully evicted the PLA OP from Y Nala and reached PP14 where a fierce skirmish broke out between the IA (Indian Army) and PLA troops. Col B Santosh Babu led from the front and his troops fought gallantly in hand-to-hand combat, causing heavy casualties to the PLA. In the ensuing fight twenty ‘Gallants of Galwan’ achieved martyrdom,” the Army wrote.The list of 20 personnel in the memorial included three naib subedars, three havildars and 12 sepoys.The defence ministry has also started the process to inscribe the names of Colonel Babu and other soldiers at the National War Memorial in Delhi.During a visit to Lukung forward post in eastern Ladakh on July 17, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh personally conveyed his appreciation and compliments to the troops from the Bihar regiment for displaying exemplary grit and courage in fighting the Chinese troops.In his address to the soldiers, the defence minister said the Indian soldiers killed in the Galwan Valley clash not only showed exemplary courage in safeguarding the border but also protected the pride of 130 crore Indians.Army Chief Gen M M Naravane has already awarded ‘Commendation Cards’ to five soldiers of the unit for their bravery in dealing with Chinese troops during the Galwan Valley clashes as well as confronting them in Pangong Tso in May.India and China are locked in a five-month-long bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh that has significantly strained bilateral ties.Both sides held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the row. However, no breakthrough has been achieved to end the standoff. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-builds-memorial-in-ladakh-for-soldiers-killed-in-galwan-valley-clash-150479

Its two stages use solid propellants.Describing the trial as successful, the sources said that the state-of-the-art missile performed a manoeuvre in the closing stages of its flight and hit the impact point in the Bay of Bengal with precision and accuracy.A gas generator at the bottom of the canister pushed the missile out it. Its first stage ignited then and fell off.The second stage went into action after this, a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) official said.During the test flight, the missile was tracked by various telemetry stations and radars and performed well, he said.DRDO officials rate Shaurya as one of the top 10 missiles in the world in its class with its high performance navigation and guidance systems, efficient propulsion systems, sophisticated control technologies and canisterised launch,” sources said.The missile can be launched from silos and canisters mounted on a truck and fixed on the ground, they said adding that it can be easily moved around. A truck itself can become a launching platform.“Shaurya” missiles can kept in locations where the enemies would not be able to detect them. Besides, it cannot be detected by satellite imaging, the sources said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nuclear-capable-hypersonic-missile-shaurya-successfully-test-fired-150471
03-10-2020||New Delhi||RJD MP Manoj Jha moves SC against farm laws||Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP Manoj Jha has moved the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of the newly enacted three agriculture laws, saying they are “discriminatory and manifestly arbitrary” and will expose marginal farmers to exploitation by big corporates.Parliament has recently passed the three Bills—the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020. These have came into effect from September 27 after President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent.Besides Jha, Congress Lok Sabha member from Kerala TN Prathapan and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Rajya Sabha member from Tamil Nadu Tiruchi Siva had moved the top court against the farm laws.Jha, in his plea, said, “The impugned legislations corporatise agriculture and ushers in an unregulated and exploitative regime. A farmer would not have the knowledge to negotiate the best terms with a private company. This leads to unequal bargaining position in negotiating the farm agreement with corporates would lead to corporates monopolising the agriculture sector.”The plea said the laws have been passed by Parliament “in breach of the Parliamentary Rules and convention and the impugned acts are unconstitutional on the ground that it is discriminatory and manifestly arbitrary and further violates the Basic Structure of the Constitution.”These laws encourage “corporatisation” of Indian agriculture which is the lifeline of the poor farmers and key to the survival of the nation’s agriculture sector, it said.“The impugned Acts primarily intends to sacrifice the interest of the farmers and leave them at the mercy of the sponsors without any proper dispute resolution mechanism. The Acts provide for ‘farming agreements’ between the farmers (of whom 85% are marginal farmers owning up to 2 acres) and the Corporate entities,” it said.It is noteworthy that the farmers by way of these legislations are pitted against the corporates with disproportionate bargaining powers, the RJD leader said in the plea.The price determination mechanism under new laws is only through the agreements between the corporate entities and farmers and do not stipulate that the price should not be below the minimum selling price (MSP) and does not even guarantee the price given by the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), it said.Instead of the ensuring MSP, the laws intend to corporatise peasant agriculture and erode the existing legal safeguards that prevent direct invasion of rural agriculture market by the monopoly corporate forces, it said.The laws enable the sponsors to deprive the market committees of their market fee on transaction within the specified market yards under the State Mandi Laws, the plea said.“The farmers currently have the freedom to sell their farm produce to anyone anywhere. The freedom however is not real but is bereft of any safety or guarantees, to protect them against the superior bargaining force of the buyers,” the plea said.“The Acts have been passed in blatant breach of the principles of federal structure of Constitution as ‘agriculture’ is a state subject under Entry 14 of List II which does not grant competence to the central government to legislate on the issues relating to ‘agriculture’. Only State Legislature have the legislative competence to pass laws dealing with the subject,” it said.As per the government, the new law intends to provide a national framework for the farming agreements to protect and empower farmers as they engage with agri-business and food processing firms, wholesalers, exporters and large retailers for farm services and sale of produce at a remunerative price framework in a fair and transparent manner.Some parts of the country have been witnessing farmer protests on the issue in view of the alleged apprehension that the law would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big companies.

The actress, who has levelled sexual harassment charges against filmmaker Anurag Kashyap, has also questioned the authenticity of the movement that started two years ago in the country."All the accused got a clean chit in the #Metooindia movement. So it deems the accuser to be false. Why are they not punished for harassment then? Where is the truth. Up in the air. Why are those women not behind the bars for false accusations, as the accuser got a clean sheet?" Payal wrote on her verified Twitter account."The women posting in support of the accused know nothing about the situation and can have an opinion that the accused can't do this ever. It's like the rapist's wife saying that the husband is innocent and can never do this. Tell me otherwise," Payal wrote in separate tweets, tagging her opinion with #fake and #Metooindia.Payal's claim over authenticity of the MeToo movement in India comes at a time when Anurag Kashyap has received the support of several industry colleagues, including actresses he has worked with, as well as his two ex-wives after she accused him of sexual harassment.On Friday, Payal had claimed on Twitter that the filmmaker has lied before the police while giving his statement. The actress demanded a lie detector, polygraph test and narco analysis be performed on him.On Friday evening, Payal's lawyer Nitin Satpute tweeted from his unverified account: "Today I hv filed an application to the Police station on behalf of Payal Ghosh to conduct Narco Analysis, Lie Detector and Polygraph Test of Mr Kashyap to find out the truth, for the interest of Justices." —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/payal-ghosh-calls-metooindia-movement-fake-150466

It won't be appropriate to comment on it until we get official information.""We will give a statement as and when we receive any official information about it," he said."We want that the CBI inquiry report into the case should soon come before public so that they get to know whether it was a suicide or murder," he said.Earlier this week, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had said that it has not reached any conclusion in Rajput's death case and that all aspects were under investigation.Rajput was found hanging in his Bandra apartment on June 14.The Mumbai Police had earlier registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR) and launched an investigation.However, the CBI took over the probe into the high- profile case in August following the Supreme Court's nod.Rajput's father K K Singh had on July 25 lodged a complaint with the Bihar police against his son's rumoured girlfriend and actress Rhea Chakraborty and her family members accusing them of abetting the late actor's suicide.Deshmukh had in the past defended the Mumbai Police's investigation into the case, saying the force conducted the probe in a "professional manner".

03-10-2020||New Delhi||Centre agrees to waive ‘interest on interest’ on loans up to Rs 2 crore||In a relief to individual borrowers and medium and small industries, the Centre has agreed in the Supreme Court to waive compound interest (interest on interest) charged on loans of up to Rs 2 crores for a six-month moratorium period announced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.It said the government will seek due authorisation from Parliament for making appropriate grants in this regard and “the endeavour shall be over and above the support of Rs 3.7 lakh crore to MSMEs, Rs 70,000 crore for home loans etc. already extended through the Garib Kalyan and Aatma Nirbhar packages announced by government earlier”.In an affidavit filed by Union finance ministry on behalf of the Union of India, it said that the relief to all borrowers in respect of compounding of interest during the period of moratorium would be admissible to the categories specified irrespective of whether the borrowers had availed the moratorium or not. “The government, therefore, has decided that the relief on waiver of compound interest during the six-month moratorium period shall be limited to the most vulnerable category of borrowers. This category of borrowers, in whose case, the compounding of interest will be waived, would be MSME loans and personal loans of up to Rs 2 crore,” it said.The loans were categorised into eight categories by the government including MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises), education, housing, consumer durable, credit card dues, auto, personal, and consumption.It further said that any individual/entity whose loan amount is more than Rs 2 crore will not be eligible for waiver of the compounding of interest.It said in view of the cumulative circumstances, after careful consideration and weighing all possible options, the government has decided to continue the tradition of hand holding of small borrowers.The affidavit has been filed by the Centre in response to a batch of pleas in the apex court raising issues pertaining to validity of RBI's March 27 circular which allowed lending institutions to grant moratorium on payment of instalments of term loans falling due between March 1, 2020 and May 31 this year due to the pandemic.Later, the period of moratorium was extended till August 31.Earlier, in the matter, the Centre had told the top court that waiver of interest on deferred EMIs during moratorium period would be against “the basic canons of finance” and unfair to those who repaid loans as per schedule.The Centre in the fresh affidavit said that waiving compound interest would result in very substantial and significant financial burden and it is impossible for the banks to bear the burden without passing on the financial impact to the depositors or affecting their net worth adversely, which would not be in the larger national economic interest.It said that the only solution under the circumstances is that “the government bears the burden resulting from waiver of compound interest and this court would be satisfied that government bearing this burden would naturally have an impact on several other pressing commitments being faced by the nation”.Regarding downgrading of loan accounts from standard to Non-Performing Asset (NPA) and the consequential impact on credit ratings, the Centre said that any account becoming non-performing even due to the bank's or any other delay, will not suffer from being labelled as NPA.The Centre said that it has suspended from March 25, the operation of provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) to protect corporate borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.It said that the word “moratorium” is categorically defined by the RBI while issuing various circulars which show that “moratorium” was never intended to be “waiver of interest” but “deferment of interest”.The government said borrowers have understood the difference between waiver in interest on loan and deferment of payment of instalments for that loan. Therefore, a majority of the borrowers have not taken benefit of moratorium which is nothing but deferment of payments of instalments. “Though it may not be possible to give the exact percentage of the borrowers who have not availed of the moratorium and have deposited payment instalments, approximately such class would be more than 50 per cent,” it said.The Central government said that if it were to consider waiving interest on all loans and advances to all classes and categories of borrowers for a six-month period for which the moratorium was made available under the RBI circulars, the estimated amount foregone will be more than Rs 6 lakh crore. “If the banks were to bear this burden, it would necessarily wipe out a substantial and a major part of their net worth, rendering most of the banks unviable and raising a very serious question mark over their very survival,” it said.On September 28, the Centre had informed the top court that a decision is likely in two to three days over charging of compound interest by banks on instalments which were deferred during the moratorium period in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan is likely to take up the matter for hearing on October 5.On September 3, in a relief to stressed borrowers who are facing hardships due to the impact of the pandemic, the top court had said that accounts which were not declared as non-performing assets till August 31 this year, shall not be declared NPA till further orders.

You should not hold agitations as a part of political agenda," the Environment Minister said in his brief address to farmers."These laws have received an overwhelming response from the farming community across the country," he claimed."The Narendra Modi government aims to give justice to each and every farmer, who were denied their dues in the past," he said.Javadekar said the party leaders were holding smaller meetings across the country on the issue as large public gatherings are not allowed due to the pandemic.He also accused NCP chief and former Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar of failing to implement the Swaminathan Committee report, which had several recommendations in favour of farmers."I had raised the issue of Swaminathan Committee recommendations in the Rajya Sabha when Pawar was agriculture minister. But they failed to implement the committee report," he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/good-response-to-farm-laws-protests-only-in-punjab-javadekar-150439

But there is no ‘Ram rajya’ (ideal governance) in Uttar Pradesh. ‘Jungle raj’ is prevailing in UP in terms of the law and order situation,” the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.“Atrocities against women continue to happen and the incidents of rape and murder of young women are on the rise in that state,” it said.“A 19-year-old woman in Hathras was raped and murdered, which triggered an outrage across the country. In her dying declaration, the victim said that she had been raped. But the UP government now says that she was not raped.Soon after, an incident of gang-rape also took place in UP’s Balrampur,” the Sena added.“But despite all this, neither the rulers in Delhi nor the Yogi Adityanath government were moved. The government itself says that when there was no rape, why is the opposition crying hoarse. But if the woman was not raped, why did the police cremate her in the dead of the night?” it asked.“Earlier, when the UP government led by Akhilesh Yadav withdrew Yogi Adityanath’s security cover, the latter had cried in the Parliament. Now he himself is the chief minister, but women in his state are not safe,” the party said.The UP police stopped Congress leader Rahul Gandhi from visiting the grieving family in Hathras, it said.“Gandhi was caught by collar and pushed to the ground.“Humiliating a leader of a prominent political party in such a manner is a gang-rape of democracy,” it said.“The body of Hathras victim was burnt by the police by pouring petrol on it. In which Hindu tradition does this inhuman act fit?” it asked.“When two sadhus were lynched in Palghar (in Maharashtra in April this year), we saw the statements of Yogi Adityanath and the BJP blew the conch of Hindutva. But why is it silent now?” the Uddhav Thackeray-led party asked.It said that BJP spokespersons went to town over TV channel debates in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case.“But the same people are now saying that the Hathras victim was not raped. The victim’s dying declaration has no value!” it said.The Sena said that the country was never so “lifeless and helpless” in the past.

03-10-2020||New Delhi||State of mind to commit crime must be visible to prove offence of abetment: SC||State of mind to commit a particular crime "must be visible" to determine the culpability for offence of abetment, the Supreme Court has said while setting aside the conviction of a man who was accused of abetting his wife's suicide in 1997.The apex court said that ingredient of "mens rea" (intention) cannot be assumed to be ostensibly present but has to be "visible and conspicuous".A bench headed by Justice N V Ramana said this while setting aside the March 2010 order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court which had upheld the trial court's verdict convicting the man for the offence under section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code."As in all crimes, mens rea has to be established. To prove the offence of abetment, as specified under sec 107 of the IPC, the state of mind to commit a particular crime must be visible, to determine the culpability," said the bench, also comprising Justices Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy.The top court said that in order to prove mens rea, there has to be something on record to establish or show that the man had a guilty mind and in furtherance of that state of mind, abetted the suicide of his wife.The bench delivered its verdict on a plea filed by the man against the order of high court which had dismissed his appeal and upheld the four-year jail term awarded to him by the trial court in the case.An FIR was lodged in the matter in August 1997 at Barnala on the basis of statement of the deceased's father and the prosecution had alleged that the woman was harassed after marriage for insufficient dowry. The apex court noted that there is no direct evidence of cruelty against the husband or the in-laws in the case."Insofar as the possible reason for a young married lady with two minor children committing suicide, in the absence of evidence, conjectures cannot be drawn that she was pushed to take her life by the circumstances and atmosphere in the matrimonial home," the bench said."In view of the foregoing, we are persuaded to conclude that the decisions under challenge cannot be legally sustained. Consequently, interfering with the impugned judgment of the high court and the trial court, the appellant's conviction under section 306 IPC is set aside and quashed," it said.

I can talk about dozens of projects that are important from the strategic point of view, but for years they were neglected,” he said, hitting out at the previous Congress-led governments.“Nothing more important to us than protecting country, but there was an era when defence interests were compromised,” he said, in an apparent swipe at the Congress.Striking an emotional chord with the people of Himachal Pradesh, he said he had a right over the state and its people as he remained in charge of party affairs in Himachal.“Very often, me and Dhumal ji would broach the topic of the tunnel with Atal ji, who saw this dream of Rohtang tunnel, which has today become a reality,” he said.Crediting his regime of accepting One Rank-One Pension demand of ex-servicemen, he said one lakh retired Army personnel had benefited from it in Himachal. He said the previous regime only rendered lip service to the issue of one rank-one pension.He said the Defence Ministry, the Ministry, the Education Ministry and the Ministry of External Affairs must jointly showcase the Atal tunnel as an engineering marvel for students of engineering and science.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-lashes-out-at-congress-led-previous-govts-says-defence-interests-compromised-for-years-150423
03-10-2020||Washington||Quad seeks to establish, promote, secure Indo-Pacific: US||Ahead of the second ministerial meeting of the four countries under the Quad—India, Japan, Australia and US—in Tokyo next week, the Trump administration has said the purpose of the group is to establish, promote and secure Indo-Pacific region, especially at a time of increased Chinese “aggression and coercion” in the region.“The Quad seeks to establish, promote, and secure Indo-Pacific principles, especially as PRC tactics, aggression, and coercion increase in the region,” Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs David R. Stilwell told reporters during a conference call on Friday.US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is travelling to Tokyo next week to participate in the second Quad ministerial meet that includes External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar from India.The first ministerial was held in New York last year.State Department Spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said the visit reflects the strong partnership between the United States and its partners and allies in the region and demonstrates its commitment to continuing the good work that is being done on the full range of bilateral, regional, and global issues that affect prosperity and security in the Indo-Pacific region.The Quad is an informal grouping of likeminded partners formed to deepen cooperation on sub-regional issues and shape a more closely-aligned Indo-Pacific region, Stilwell said, adding the core of the Quad partnership rests on a commitment to continued dialogue and work toward mutually agreed-upon outcomes.“Quad membership is driven by shared interests, not binding obligations,” he said.Stilwell said the Quad was not formed to exclude nations. He said It was a group formed in 2004 as part of the effort to coordinate the respective humanitarian assistance and disaster relief responses to the Indian Ocean tsunami.“Quad collaboration has grown beyond humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and now focuses on furthering our shared vision of a free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific region.  This last year has seen some of the Quad’s most remarkable growth, to include a focus on ASEAN centrality in our respective approaches to the region,” he said.Responding to a question, Stilwell said there is unlikely to be a joint statement after the Quad ministerial meeting.He further said, “The bringing together of four distinct perspectives on issues has been very helpful.  This is the wonderful thing about the Quad is we have shared values but different perspectives, and from those come great ideas and elegant solutions.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quad-seeks-to-establish-promote-secure-indo-pacific-us-150422
03-10-2020||Washington||NASA’s resupply mission honouring Kalpana Chawla on way to ISS||A NASA resupply spacecraft named in honour of late astronaut Kalpana Chawla was on way to the International Space station (ISS) on Saturday with nearly 8,000 pounds of scientific investigations, technology demonstrations and commercial products, and a new space toilet is part of the cargo.Its features improve on current space toilet operations and help NASA prepare for future missions, including those to the Moon and Mars.“The Universal Waste Management System (UWMS) demonstrates a compact toilet and the Urine Transfer System that further automates waste management and storage. The smaller footprint of the UWMS supports a possible increase in the number of crew members aboard the space station, as well as planning for future exploration missions,” NASA said in a statement on Saturday.A new crop of vegetables was also headed to the space station.While previous experiments have grown different types of lettuces and greens aboard the orbiting laboratory, the “Plant Habitat-02” investigation adds radishes to the mix, cultivating seeds to see how different light and soil conditions affect the growth.“The findings could help optimise the growth of the plants in space, as well as provide an assessment of their nutrition and taste.”A Northrop Grumman Cygnus resupply spacecraft launched on an Antares rocket was scheduled to arrive at the space station around 5.20 am on Monday.Expedition 63 Commander Chris Cassidy of NASA will use the space station’s robotic arm to capture Cygnus that will remain at the space station until mid-December before it disposes of several thousand pounds of trash as it burns up during a safe re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere.Another investigation ‘Ammonia Electrooxidation’ onboard the spacecraft examines a process for ammonia oxidation in microgravity.An electrochemical ammonia removal system could serve as an innovative water recovery system on long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars and provide vital drinkable water in remote and arid areas on Earth.A medical investigation tests drugs based on messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNA) for treating leukaemia.In normal gravity, the drugs to be tested are onco-selective, meaning they can distinguish cancer cells from healthy ones.“Researchers expect any drugs that also demonstrate this trait in microgravity could make good candidates for safer, more effective, and affordable medicines to treat leukaemia and other cancers. This could improve survival rates for thousands of people every year,” NASA said.The International Space Station Experience (ISS Experience) is also creating an immersive virtual reality series documenting life and research aboard the space station.A new camera will be mounted to capture a spacewalk from start to finish as well as footage of Earth and the exterior of the space station.The Cygnus spacecraft for this resupply mission is named in honour of Chawla, who made history at NASA as the first female astronaut of Indian descent.Chawla, who dedicated her life to understanding flight dynamics, lost her life during the STS-107 mission when the space shuttle Columbia disintegrated upon re-entering Earth’s atmosphere in 2003.Kalpana Chawla was born in Karnal, Haryana on March 17, 1962.She received a bachelor’s of science degree in aeronautical engineering from the Punjab Engineering College in India in 1982. She then moved to the US to pursue her education.Chawla began her career at NASA in 1988 as a powered-lift computational fluid dynamics researcher at the Ames Research Center in California. Her work concentrated on the simulation of complex air flows encountered by aircraft flying in “ground-effect.” IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nasas-resupply-mission-honouring-kalpana-chawla-on-way-to-iss-150421

We met everyone in the family. We spoke to them and assured them that the strictest action would be taken against all those found guilty,” Awasthi told reporters.“The SIT inquiry is on and it will continue to do its work. The family members have raised certain issues. Whatever points and the complaints they have raised, the SIT will note them, and we will make all efforts to ensure that each of them is addressed,” Awasthi said, without elaborating.The officer said that they would submit a report to the chief minister.The visit by the two top officials came as a massive controversy raged over the incident with the opposition targeting the Adityanath government.“The first report of the SIT was received yesterday evening and within two hours orders were issued for the suspension of the then SP, CO, inspector, senior sub-inspector and constable,” Awasthi said.The victim, who was attacked on September 14, died of her grievous injuries in the early hours of Tuesday in a Delhi hospital and was cremated in the dead of night near her home on Wednesday with her family alleging that they were hurried into carrying out her last rites by local police.The incident triggered widespread outrage and protests.On Thursday, the Hathras administration clamped prohibitory orders barring the assembly of more than four people in the district, where scuffles broke out as politicians, including from the Congress and the TMC, as well as the mediapersons tried to access the village. About 300 police personnel stood on guard to prevent anybody from entering.Today, however, the administration lifted restrictions on the entry of media persons. To a query, Awasthi said, “If people’s representatives want to come, five people will be allowed”.“We also met some people’s representatives and requested them to help maintain social harmony,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hathras-case-top-up-official-meets-victims-family-says-sit-will-look-into-all-issues-raised-by-them-150417

They are asking why their daughter was cremated with petrol and why are they being threatened. They are saying where’s the surety the mortal remains they have collected are of their daughter. The family has the right to these answers and the UP government will have to provide these answers.”Earlier, Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met the family of the Dalit woman who died this week after she was allegedly gang-raped, triggering nationwide outrage.Uttar Pradesh authorities had scuttled an earlier attempt by the two leaders to travel to Hathras, detaining them and several party workers in Greater Noida outside Delhi.On Saturday, the party staged another show of strength at the Delhi-Noida border. The UP Police said they will allow five party representatives to meet the family in the village in Hathras district.The 19-year-old woman was allegedly gang-raped on September 14 in an assault by four men that left her critically injured. She died at a Delhi hospital last Tuesday.Earlier, in a dramatic twist following massive police arrangements and traffic chaos, Rahul Gandhi Vadra and his sister Priyanka Gandhi along with other party leaders were allowed to meet the family of the girl.Succeeding in his second attempt to meet the victim's family, Rahul made the announcement from the Delhi-Noida Direct (DND) flyway where he, Congress General Secretary Priyanka and various Congress MPs and supporters were stopped by the police from entering Uttar Pradesh in the afternoon, leading to massive traffic jams with people stuck on the 9.2-km stretch for more than one hour. "Five Congress leaders have been allowed to visit Hathras," announced Rahul Gandhi.It was Rahul and Priyanka's second attempt to visit Hathras. On Thursday, Gandhi was allegedly pushed to the ground by Uttar Pradesh Police personnel when he was marching towards Hathras after their vehicles were stopped on the Yamuna Expressway in Gautam Budh Nagar. — With agency inputs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/how-do-we-know-these-ashes-are-our-daughters-priyanka-raises-queries-of-hathras-girls-kin-150405

Experts said had work been done at this speed, it would have been completed by 2040,” Modi said.Taking a swipe at Congress, he said there was an era when defence interests were compromised.The Prime Minister arrived at Manali on early today morning to inaugurate the Atal Tunnel, the longest highway tunnel in the world built at an altitude of 3,000 meters. The longest motorable tunnel at a height of over 3,000 metres will reduce the distance between Manali and Keylong by 46 km. It is expected to boost tourism and winter sports in the region. Significantly, it will facilitate the movement of armed forces and infantry combat vehicles to the Line of Actual Control.Modi saw the exhibition put up by the Border Road Organisation (BRO) regarding the different stages in the construction of the tunnel at 10,000 feet.The 9.02-km tunnel connected Manali to Lahaul-Spiti valley throughout the year, the Prime Minister’s Office has said, noting that the valley was earlier cut off for about six months every year due to heavy snowfall.Modi was accompanied by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat.PM @narendramodi reached Sasse in Himachal Pradesh.

India remains convinced of the need for meaningful dialogue among all states possessing nuclear weapons, for building trust and confidence,” Shringla said.The foreign secretary reiterated that India accords “high priority” to the Conference on Disarmament as the world’s single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum and supports the commencement of negotiations on a Comprehensive Nuclear Weapons Convention at the Conference on Disarmament (CD).“Without prejudice to the priority attached to nuclear disarmament, India remains committed to the immediate commencement of negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty in the CD,” he said, adding: “India espouses the policy of ‘No First Use’ against nuclear weapon states and non-use against non-nuclear-weapon states.”Underlining that India was a key partner in global efforts towards disarmament and strengthening the non-proliferation order, Shringla expressed hope that the high-level event would bring the further focus of the international community on the need to mobilise global will towards a nuclear-weapons-free world.He said India’s annual resolution in the General Assembly on the ‘Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons’ tabled since 1982, enjoyed wide support and reaffirmed that any use of nuclear weapons would be a violation of the UN Charter and a crime against humanity.Shringla underlined that mindful of the catastrophic consequences of unintentional or accidental use of nuclear weapons, India has since 1998 tabled an annual resolution in the General Assembly on ‘Reducing Nuclear Danger’ that calls for immediate and urgent steps to reduce the risks of unintentional and accidental use of nuclear weapons, including through de-alerting and de-targeting.The high-level event was held on the International Day of Non-violence, which is observed on Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday on October 2. It was the final major event of the General Assembly’s high-level week.Quoting Gandhi, who had said: “Whatever you do will be insignificant, but it is very important that you do it”, Shringla asserted that it was in this spirit that India was ready to work with other states towards the achievement of the “noble goal of a world free of nuclear weapons”.During the event, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said nuclear disarmament had been a priority of the United Nations since the very beginning of the Organisation’s existence. Yet 75 years since the founding of the UN and since the horrific bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the world continues to live in the shadow of nuclear catastrophe.“Some states view nuclear weapons as vital to their national security and survival. Unfortunately, progress towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons has stalled and is at risk of backsliding,” he said.The UN chief said that growing distrust and tension between the states that possess nuclear weapons have increased nuclear risks.Guterres urged that “for the sake of all of our security, the world must return to a common path towards nuclear disarmament. States possessing nuclear weapons have a responsibility to lead this endeavour, including by fulfilling their existing disarmament commitments and by taking practical steps to reduce nuclear risk”.The General Assembly commemorates September 26 as the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. This Day provides an occasion for the world community to reaffirm its commitment to global nuclear disarmament as a priority. It provides an opportunity to educate the public — and their leaders — about the real benefits of eliminating such weapons and the social and economic costs of perpetuating them.Commemorating this Day at the United Nations is especially important, given its universal membership and its long experience in grappling with nuclear disarmament issues. It is the right place to address one of humanity’s greatest challenges; achieving the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons, the UN said.

In an interview to a private television channel, Khan accused his predecessor for creating a "huge mischief" by attacking the Pakistan Army.“Nawaz Sharif is playing a dangerous game against Pakistan and I am 100 per cent sure that India is supporting him," he said.“Sharif is now playing the same game that was once being played by former founder of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) Altaf Hussain, who he said was also working on India's agenda. He is becoming the next Altaf Hussain,” Khan said. “India's interest was to weaken our army. India's think tanks say they want to break Pakistan.

Wearing masks and raising slogans against the UP administration, they demanded justice for the 19-year-old Dalit victim and asked Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to resign.Hathras SP suspended; Kejriwal joins protestThe protest was to be held at India Gate initially but was shifted to Jantar Mantar owing to the prohibitory orders in Rajpath area. The rape victim died in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital a fortnight after she was allegedly raped by four upper caste men. The woman’s family alleged the police forced them to conduct the last rites in the dead of the night. But local police officers claimed the cremation was done as per the wishes of the family.“What is happening in UP is goonda raj,” lawyer-activist Prashant Bhushan said. “The police have surrounded the village, are not allowing Opposition leaders and mediapersons to enter and have taken away the cellphones of victim’s family members,” he pointed out. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, actor Swara Bhaskar, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, AAP MLA Saurabh Bhardwaj and Left leaders Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury joined the protesters.

He said the number of people with non-specific and non-respiratory symptoms of Covid is small, but cannot be ignored.“A majority of the patients have respiratory symptoms, fever, body ache, sore throat and cough, but there are some who show atypical signs,” said Guleria.Meanwhile, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in collaboration with Hyderabad-based Biological E Limited has developed “highly purified antisera”, prepared by injecting inactivated SARS-CoV2 in horses, which can be a potential treatment for Covid-19.Antiserum is a blood serum high in antibodies against specific antigens and is injected in humans to help kickstart the immune system to fight specific infections.Toll touches 1 lakhCovid toll neared the 1-lakh mark while active cases stood at 9,42,217— remaining under 10 lakh for 11th day.RT-PCR test in 2 hrsReliance Life Sciences has developed an RT-PCR kit that promises Covid diagnosis in two hours, sources said.Trump tests positive, global stocks fallUS stock futures and European stocks fell on Friday after President Donald Trump said he and his wife had tested positive for Covid.

03-10-2020||Vibha Sharma||BJP fears Hathras may dent its prospects in Bihar, MP||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 2As Opposition parties continue to up the ante against CM Yogi Adityanath over the Hathras incident, worries of the ruling BJP at the Centre appear to be far from over despite PM Modi telling the UP Government to take strict action against the culprits.Political observers believe the incident — a Dalit woman died following gangrape — has the potential to affect the saffron party’s prospects not only in UP, but also in poll-bound Bihar and the bypolls to 56 crucial Assembly seats across the country, including in Madhya Pradesh.“It is difficult to gauge the damage, but Hathras has exposed the fault lines in Hindu unity, which helped the BJP garner over 50 per cent votes in several states in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Though Assembly polls are contested on local issues, the incident’s fallout cannot be ruled out in other states too,” says analyst Prof Sudhir Panwar from the Lucknow University.Sources in the BJP maintain the leadership is “keeping a close watch” and the Bihar and bypoll results in November may decide their future course of action, including in UP where CM Adityanath is battling strong perceptions of running a “pro-Thakur or pro-upper caste” government.Though senior BJP leaders, including Ravi Shankar Prasad, have accused the Congress of “double standards” on rape incidents and “playing caste card”, observers point towards “low-key support” for Adityanath from the top leadership.The caste factor plays a decisive role in most states, including Bihar where a mix of SC/ST and upper caste votes had earned the BJP-JD(U)-LJP combine 53.3 per cent vote share in the 2019 General Election. In the 2015 Assembly poll, a statement by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on the reservation issue had turned the tide in favour of the BJP’s rivals in the state.That’s reason enough for observers to believe that perceptions about “law and order and atrocities against Dalits in UP can go against the NDA alliance in Bihar”.Besides, 28 of the 56 bypoll are being held in Madhya Pradesh, primarily Chambal-Gwalior belt, where atrocities by upper castes are seen as the main reason for the rise of ‘baaghis’ (dacoits). The era may have ended but if Hathras manages to dent, CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan may find himself in trouble. Yogi Adityanath in the firing line||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-fears-hathras-may-dent-its-prospects-in-bihar-mp-150134

Appearing critical of the police action in handling the case, Bharti said the last rites of the Dalit victim was done in a hastily manner by the police.She said there is no rule that a family cannot be allowed to meet anyone during an investigation, in fact this brings the SIT investigation in this case under suspicion. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/allow-media-politicians-to-visit-hathras-victims-family-uma-bharti-tells-yogi-adityanath-150135

They beheaded the bodies near the burial site of Gour and set them on fire,” Deuri said.Senior police officers and Executive Magistrate Jintu Borah visited the site and collected the remains from the pyre, besides soil samples, he said.A case has been registered and nine persons, including two women, have been arrested and weapons seized, the officer said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-lynched-set-on-fire-over-witchcraft-suspicion-in-assam-150271
