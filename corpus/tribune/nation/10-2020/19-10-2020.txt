That’s enough syringes to wrap around the world one and a half times,” she said.Besides syringes, UNICEF is buying 5 million safety boxes so that used syringes and needles can be disposed of in a safe manner by personnel at health facilities, thus preventing the risk of needle stick injuries and blood-borne diseases. Every safety box carries 100 syringes.Injection equipment such as syringes and safety boxes have a shelf life of five years.As the key procurement coordinator for Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF is already the largest single vaccine buyer in the world, procuring more than 2 billion doses of vaccines annually for routine immunisation and outbreak response on behalf of nearly 100 countries.India manufactures 60 pc of all vaccines UNICEF uses for distribution across the world.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-unicef-to-stockpile-over-half-a-billion-syringes-by-year-end-158133

The Region still reports large numbers of COVID-19 cases. We need to continue to do our very best to curtail the pandemic,” she said in a statement.For the third week in a row, the WHO South-East Asia Region has registered a 6-8 per cent decline in the number of COVID-19 cases, mainly due to a decrease in reported cases from India and Bangladesh.Member countries have been making concerted efforts scaling up capacities for timely detection, testing, tracing contacts, isolating the affected and providing hospital care to those who need it.“Our relentless efforts need to continue with more vigour,” she said.This festive season we must continue to take responsibility as individuals of the need to maintain physical distance, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and wear a mask when and where needed.  She said people must remember to avoid the three Cs—crowded places, closed settings, confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.The co-circulation of seasonal influenza and COVID-19 in the winters may present challenges for health systems and health facilities, since both diseases present many similar symptoms.      Many of the same measures that are effective in preventing COVID-19 are also effective for preventing influenza, including physical distancing, hand hygiene, covering coughs, ventilation and masks, Singh said in the statement. WHO is working with countries to take a holistic approach to the preparedness, prevention, control and treatment of all respiratory diseases, including influenza and COVID-19. Home to one-fourth of the worlds’ population, the region has reported more than 8 million of the nearly 40 million cases globally, mostly from the most populous countries which also face unique demographic and geographic challenges, the statement said. The WHO continues to support countries in their containment and mitigation efforts providing technical guidance, laboratory capacity strengthening for testing, equipment for hospitals and protection of healthcare workers, and creating awareness and addressing misinformation, she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-cautions-against-let-up-in-covid-19-fight-after-slight-decline-in-cases-in-se-asia-158128

The introduction of AYUSH system of traditional Indian medicine can also be used to complement the health system in the UAE,” he added.Humaid Al Qutami, Director-General of Dubai Health Authority said, “The UAE and India share a deep-rooted, historic partnership and there are several areas in the health sector where both sides can explore collaboration and continue this partnership with an aim to benefit the people of both the countries and provide high-quality and efficient patient care”.Humaid Al Qutami also highlighted areas such as innovation, research and development, medical education and training as well as telehealth, where there is a strong potential for further collaboration.He added that this conference would be the right forum to establish a channel to achieve the common goals for the healthcare sectors of both countries. We look forward to a fruitful collaboration between both the countries, he added.Ahmed Albanna, Ambassador of the UAE to India, said that COVID-19 has altered the dynamics of our global economic ecosystems.Ambassador Albanna said: “COVID-19 will mark an era of a paradigm shift in the realm of diplomacy with healthcare medical diplomacy taking the centre stage.In the wake of the pandemic, the new dimension of medical diplomacy has indeed further bolstered the strategic partnership between the two nations. There is a huge untapped potential in the healthcare sectors between the two countries, he added.Dr Sangita Reddy, President, FICCI, said that at no other time in the world has healthcare become as centerstage as it is today.“This is an important meeting of people with shared ideologies to innovate, collaborate and to find new solutions, she said.Abdulla Ali Al Mahyan, Chairman, Sharjah Health Authority, and Dr Amin Hussain Al Amiri, Assistant Undersecretary of Health Policy and Licensing, Ministry of Health and Prevention, Abu Dhabi stressed on the historic and strategic relationship that exists between both the nations.“We have great cooperation with India, and we look forward to supporting any Indian pharma or medical industry to invest with us,” Dr Amiri said. Dr Amiri also provided several facts about Indian healthcare workers and UAE as well as pharma and medical tourism, going forward.Dr Praveen Gedam, Additional CEO of National Health Authority, highlighted the transformation currently underway in India as the Ayushman Bharat Programme is being delivered.This program will eventually benefit more than 500 million people and create huge opportunities for investment by the UAE and other international investors in the healthcare sector., he said.Dr Aman Puri, Consul General of India, said, “This conference becomes all the more relevant as key stakeholders from UAE and India healthcare landscapes join together to deliberate on exploring new avenues for partnership between the two countries.”Abdul Salam Al Madani, Executive Chairman, Waterfalls, UAE said that there is a need to further strengthen business relations with India. Dr Azad Moopen, Chairman & MD, Aster DM Healthcare; Dr Shamsheer Vayalil, Chairman & MD, VPS Healthcare Group; Girish Krishnamurty, CEO & Director- Tata Medical and Diagnostics, Tata MD; Dr Akbar Moideen, VP Thumbay Group; Dr Viren Shetty from Narayana Hrudayalaya; Sophiya Faizal, Director, KEF Holdings (Meitra Hospital), Dr Taher Shams, MD Zulekha India, made presentations on opportunities in healthcare in the UAE and India.The conference also had three separate sessions focusing on the UAE India Partnership in Healthcare Delivery, Pharma & Medical Devices and Ayush in which renowned doctors, entrepreneurs and regulatory authorities made their presentation and discussed ways and means to further boost bilateral cooperation in the respective fields.

19-10-2020||Warsaw||Polish woman’s quest for abortion exposes conflicted society||In April, in the midst of a nationwide coronavirus lockdown in Poland, Katarzyna found out that the baby she was carrying had a severe genetic disorder and would probably die before birth or shortly after.She immediately decided to terminate the pregnancy. When she finally managed to, five weeks later and after meeting some 10 doctors, securing a fallback plan in Germany and researching home methods, she knew she would not try to get pregnant again.“I knew how difficult it can be to get a legal abortion in Poland, so I chose to be stubborn,” said 38-year-old Katarzyna, who lives in a small town in central Poland and already has two daughters, one of them disabled.“I don’t think I could survive this sense of helplessness and the contempt from the medical community if something went wrong again,” she said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the subject of abortion is largely taboo in Poland.Terminations like hers are at the heart of a fierce public debate about abortion rights in predominantly Catholic Poland, expected to culminate with a rare ruling by the Constitutional Tribunal as early as Thursday on whether they are permissible.Many doctors in Poland, which has some of the strictest abortion rules in Europe, already exercise their legal right to refuse to terminate pregnancies on religious grounds. Some say they are pressured into doing so by their superiors.Many in Poland’s conservative ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), including its leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, believe abortions requested on the basis of foetal defects should be banned, and that only terminations due to incest, rape or a threat to a woman’s life or health should remain legal. Abortion on demand is already banned in Poland.But PiS, which came to power five years ago promising to entrench more traditional, Catholic values in public life, has so far been reluctant to push new restrictions through parliament because previous debates sparked a big public outcry.Its critics say PiS now hopes instead to use the Tribunal to change policy---a charge it denies---after a series of judicial reforms that the European Commission says has undermined the independence of Poland’s courts.A group of right-wing lawmakers has asked the Tribunal, which reviews the compatibility of laws with the constitution, to rule on the legality of aborting defective foetuses.“(Abortion) has always been a difficult issue for parliament, it awakens massive public emotions,” said Bartlomiej Wroblewski, a PiS lawmaker and one of those seeking a verdict.“I thought we needed to find another place where constitutional arguments on the right to life, on human dignity, the ban on discrimination, can be decisive,” Wroblewski said.‘Gigantic’ strainPiS denies trying to influence Tribunal rulings, although its shakeup of Poland’s judiciary has prompted charges at home and abroad that it is subverting democratic norms. PiS says its reforms only aim to make the judiciary more efficient and fair.“PiS is afraid to take responsibility for making abortion rules more restrictive. They know perfectly well that current rules are already very difficult to accept,” Barbara Nowacka, a left-wing lawmaker, told Reuters.“They want to ban abortion using the Tribunal, which is politicised and staffed with judges appointed illegally,” she said, referring to changes that give the ruling party a bigger say in appointing judges.While taking a firmer stand against abortion would play well with PiS’s conservative base, there is no wider public clamour for change. An opinion poll published late last year, after PiS won re-election, showed fewer than 15 per cent back a tightening of abortion rules.Government data shows roughly 1,000 legal abortions are conducted in Poland each year, mostly due to foetal abnormalities.Rights activists say thousands more women terminate pregnancies illegally or travel abroad, mainly to Germany, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, where rules are far less strict.A friend helped Katarzyna find a doctor in Germany who performs abortions for Polish women in case her hospital in Warsaw backed out. She was determined to shield her daughters from the shock of losing a severely ill baby sibling.If it were not for the coronavirus pandemic, Katarzyna added, “I wouldn’t have gone begging (for an abortion in Poland)... I would have gone abroad. The psychological strain was gigantic”.  --- Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/polish-womans-quest-for-abortion-exposes-conflicted-society-158126
19-10-2020||New Delhi||CBI questions 4 accused arrested in Hathras case||The CBI on Monday questioned all the four accused lodged in Aligarh prison for alleged involvement in the rape and murder of a 19-year old Dalit woman in a village in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras, officials said. The CBI team had taken permission of the court to examine the accused — Sandeep, Luvkush, Ravi and Ramu — who are in judicial custody, they said. The CBI investigators also met doctors at the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital, where the victim was treated after the alleged gangrape on September 14, they said. The victim had succumbed to injuries during her treatment at Safdarjung hospital in Delhi on September 29. The district administration had allegedly forcibly cremated the body at the dead of the night, denying the family permission to carry it home for proper last rites.The alleged insensitive attitude of the administration had invited some sharp remarks from the Allahabad High Court. The issue snowballed into a major embarrassment for the Yogi Adityanath Government.The BJP government had transferred the case to the CBI after the controversy.  The CBI constituted a team which has already recorded the statements of family members of the victim.

19-10-2020||New Delhi||COVID19: Digitized network, digital health IDs to be used to immunize citizens: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday that India was working to put a well established COVID vaccine delivery system in place and this digitized network along with digital health IDs would be used to immunize citizens.“India is now at the forefront of vaccine development for COVID 19. Some of the vaccines are in advanced stages. We are not stopping here. We are working on putting a well established vaccine delivery system in place. This digitized network along with digital health ID will be used to ensure immunization of our citizens,” PM Modi said on Monday as he delivered a keynote address at the Annual Grand Challenges meeting organised virtually by the Ministry of Science on Monday.Speaking in the presence of Bill Gates, PM Modi also credited India’s "flexible lockdown" for a high COVID 19 recovery rate.“Today we are seeing a decline in the number of cases per day and the growth rate of cases. India has one of the highest recovery rates of 88 pc. This happened because India was one of the first countries to adopt a flexible lockdown when the total cases were just a few hundred. India was one of the first to encourage the use of masks. India began to actively work on effective contact tracing. India was one of the earliest to deploy rapid antigen test,” the PM said, attributing low death rates in India to “people's power and people driven approach.” India’s COVID case fatality rate is 1.52 pc, among the lowest globally.The PM also said it had taken COVID to make the world realize yet again the importance of team work.“Diseases do not have geographic boundaries, diseases do not discriminate,” he said urging collaboration in science.The PM also lauded India’s scientific institutions as great assets and said India was making 60 pc of the global vaccine requirement.He said the future will be shaped by societies that invest in science and innovation. “The journey to these innovations must be shaped by collaborations. Science will never prosper in silos,” the PM added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid19-digitized-network-digital-health-ids-to-be-used-to-immunize-citizens-pm-158119

Ultimately, if the petition is allowed, she can be granted retrospective promotion with all consequential benefits,” the Bench added while stressing that any action taken shall be provisional and subject to the final decision of the petition.The Bench observed that the file pertaining to conduct of the selection board revealed that a meeting of the board was held from December 2 to December 6, which was chaired by an Army Commander and its members comprised two Lieutenant Generals and two Major Generals. It was a ‘closed board’ where the identity of seven officers under consideration for two vacancies was not revealed.During the meeting, comparative merit was worked out for five officers and accordingly, two officers, who were highest in merit have been recommended for promotion. The marks of the remaining two officers of a different batch were compared with the cut-off marks for promotion of their original batch to determine their eligibility.“We find that, rightfully, as per policy, the respondents have not clubbed together officers from more than one ‘fresh’ batch as per their reckonable seniority. The officers who were given their ‘first look’ as fresh candidates were of 1997 reckonable seniority,” the Bench said.The reckonable seniority of two officers, originally of 1993 batch and 1994 batch, respectively, was correctly worked out in accordance with the amended policy letter of 2014, the Bench observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aft-vacates-stay-on-promotion-results-of-jag-officers-from-colonel-to-brigadier-158113

Besides, Biden has as his running mate Kamala-Harris, the first-time ever that a person of Indian extraction has been nominated by either of the two parties for the post.A survey of about 1,000 Indian-Americans showed their continued attachment to the Democratic Party. They viewed US-India relations as a low priority issue in this electoral cycle.The Indian American population in the US grew by nearly 150 per cent between 2000 and 2018, making it the second-largest immigrant group in America today. “In select swing states, the Indian American population is larger than the margin of victory that separated Hillary Clinton and Trump in the closely contested 2016 presidential race,” said the study.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fight-for-indian-votes-in-us-sharpens-158111

He also claimed that Gulf passengers are being charged at the same level for flights from three other airports in the state.India has an air travel arrangement with Bahrain that allows Air India/Air India Express and Gulf Air to operate flights between the two countries.Kumar, who is a leader of the Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD), noted that there were eight services from Calicut to Bahrain and the number is only five now.As there are reduced number of flights, tickets are not available till December and many people face the threat of losing their jobs unless they reach that country on time. Their visas are going to expire and many of them were served reminders by their employers to join duty as per their job demands, he noted.Kumar also flagged concerns about rise in airfares and fewer flights to various Gulf, European and Asian countries.Seeking immediate intervention of the minister, the Rajya Sabha member said there should be enough air services for people going back for work to other countries, adding that it will be possible only by amending air bubble agreements. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajya-sabha-member-flags-concerns-over-high-airfares-on-gulf-other-routes-158106

19-10-2020||New Delhi||Homebuyers in SC to frame model pacts to protect realty customers||A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking direction to the Centre to frame model pacts for builder and agent buyers to protect customers and bring in transparency in the realty sector in tune with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) Act 2016.The plea filed by 62 homebuyers has also sought a direction to all the states to enforce ''Model Builder Buyer Agreement'' and ''Model Agent Buyer Agreement'' and to take steps to avoid “mental, physical and financial injury” to customers.The plea has made Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, DLF Southern Homes Pvt Ltd (Begur OMR Homes Pvt Ltd) and Annabel Builders & Developers Pvt Ltd as parties in the case."Promoters, Builders and Agents use manifestly arbitrary one-sided agreements that do not place customers at an equal platform with them, which offends Articles 14, 15, 21 of Constitution. There have been many cases of deliberate inordinate delays in handing over possession and customers lodge complaints but police don’t register FIRs, citing arbitrary clauses of the agreement."Builders issue revised delivery schedule again and again and adopt arbitrary unfair restrictive trade practices. All this amounts to criminal conspiracy, fraud, cheating, criminal breach of trust, dishonestly inducing delivery of the property, dishonest misappropriation of property and violation of corporate laws," read the plea, filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey.Due to deliberate excessive delays in possession, real estate customers are not only suffering from mental and financial injury but also from brazen violation of their right to life and livelihood, the plea added.The PIL contended that many developers across the country still follow a common practice of pre-launching a project without securing requisite approvals for the project from the authorities, and term it as ''soft launch'' or ''pre-launch'' etc. thus, openly violating the law but no action had been taken against any builder till date."It is necessary to state that registration of the project with the regulatory authority has been mandatory before it is launched for sale, and for registration, the basic pre-requisite is that the developer must have all the requisite approvals."Thus the buyer is protected as the project is ring-fenced from the vagaries of non-approvals or delays in approvals which are one of the major causes of delay for the project," read the plea.The plea has also sought directions to compensate the buyers for losses incurred due to inordinate delays on the part of promoters-builders and to recover their money.

Despite his age & health issues, he was kept at ED office for five hours. pic.twitter.com/G6oQM1wpxi  “The summons are part of vindictive politics practiced by the Central government to kill dissent and disagreement across the country and in the present case to silence the genuine demand for the reversal of unilateral and unconstitutional decisions of August 5, 2019 and restoration of August 4, 2019 status of J&K,” said the Alliance.Alliance members include PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, NC vice-president Omar Abdullah, People’s Conference president Sajjad Lone, CPM’s MY Tarigami and Awami National Conference’s Muzaffar Shah and J&K People’s Movement’s Feroze Peerzada.What a sorry state of affairs. Dr Farooq sahib summoned by ED. Reeks of vendetta. Contrary to what they want to coercively achieve this will certainly have the opposite impact.  The Alliance, formed on October 15, said the Centre “unnerved by the unity amongst people across regions and communities to pursue the goals of Gupkar Declaration and the support extended to it by  political parties and civil society groups is resorting to a game of witch hunt and suppression at the national level”.It said the Government of India must realise the “dangers of witch hunting and intimidation and desist from vindictive designs”.Dialogue with stakeholders and restoration of special status remain the only option to address the deepening uncertainty in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh, the Alliance said.Earlier on Monday, Mehbooba Mufti tweeted in support of Farooq Abdullah. “ED’s sudden summon displays the extent of GOI’s nervousness about mainstream parties in J&K fighting as one unit. It also reeks of political vendetta and won’t in the least blunt our collective resolve to fight for our rights.”The party will be responding to this ED summons shortly. This is nothing less then political vendetta coming days after the formation of the People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration. To set the record straight no raids are being conducted at Dr Sahib’s residence.  Sajjad Lone also backed the NCP chief saying, “What a sorry state of affairs, reeks of vendetta. Contrary to what they want to achieve through coercive acts, this will certainly have the opposite impact.”Omar Abdullah meanwhile clarified that there were no raids at his father’s house.NC also officially attacked the BJP questioning the timing of ED summons and said, “After failing to politically fight party president Farooq Abdullah, BJP has resorted to employing its agencies for the task.”NC questioned the timing of ED summons and said, “The previous summons were issued just before August 5 last year and today’s summon comes within days of forming the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration of which Dr Farooq Abdullah has taken a lead.”The JKNC said Abdullah continued to maintain his innocence and would cooperate with the authorities “in what is nothing but a witch hunt”.Principal allegation against Abdullah is that he siphoned Rs 43.69 crore off the amount BCCI gave for cricket promotion when he was the president of the Jammu Kashmir Cricket Association.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/peoples-alliance-slams-ed-summons-to-farooq-as-vindictive-158090

BJP did well in the region in last year’s Lok Sabha general elections. Tribute paid by Nadda today to social reformer Panchanan Barma is also said to be aimed at making an impression on the Rajbangshis who form a substantial chunk of the voters in the area.Nadda said the BJP was grateful to the Gorkhas for the support consistently being extended to BJP candidates by the voters of the community. The party was committed to fulfil its election promise of finding a “permanent political solution” of their problems and also to give recognition to 11 tribes living in the Darjeeling Hills, he said.Nadda visited Siliguri after union home minister and former party president Amit Shah cancelled his proposed trip to the city owing to health reasons.Nadda said he had spoken to Railway Minister Piyush Goyal this morning about certain demands of the people of north Bengal regarding railway connectivity. Goyal, who is now convalescing after a surgery, would meet a delegation of BJP leaders of north Bengal and take the necessary steps as soon as he resumes normal work, Nadda said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nadda-says-rules-for-caa-will-be-ready-soon-158089

19-10-2020||Chennai||Hundreds of Indian workers demand unpaid wages from Saudi construction firm||Hundreds of Indian migrant workers who were laid off by a construction company in Saudi Arabia due to the coronavirus pandemic have filed a rare complaint to the Indian government over unpaid earnings, lawyers and campaigners said.More than 280 labourers---who were fired by the Nasser S Al Hajri Corporation before being flown home on chartered flights in July---are part of what is believed to be the biggest collective case of its kind, said their lawyer Subhash Chand.Chand said all of the workers had been at the firm for at least five years--- some over a decade---and were entitled to a "substantial amount" in outstanding end-of-contract benefits."Most of (the workers) confirmed that they had been asked to sign blank papers or documents that they didn't understand...(in order to get) their passports and tickets," said Chand, who is part of Lawyers Beyond Borders, a network of legal experts."Many didn't want to return without their money but had no choice," he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.The Indian embassy in Riyadh said the workers' complaint had been taken up with the company and Saudi officials this month, and that it was awaiting a response on the matter.The Saudi human resources ministry could not be reached for comment but last month said workers could log violations through its online dispute settlement platform or go to a labour court.The Nasser S Al Hajri Corporation---which describes itself on its website as the largest industrial contractor in the Middle East---did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Helpline in demandHundreds of thousands of Indian migrant workers are estimated to have returned home from Gulf nations this year due to COVID-19, and activists, lawyers and unions said they were dealing with fresh complaints about pay issues on a daily basis.The number of wage theft cases reported from Gulf countries rose more than three-fold between April and July compared with the same period last year, says the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, which advocates for human rights in business."We started a helpline for Gulf migrants in the middle of the pandemic and were flooded with calls of wage theft," said Rafeek Ravuther, founder of The Centre for Indian Migrant Studies, a Kerala-based charity that works for migrant rights."Among them there were hundreds calling in about (the Nasser S Al Hajri Corporation) and a few others," he added. "We consolidated the complaints and encouraged them to fight this collectively since it is difficult to pursue alone for many." One of the workers in the case said he was owed 120,000 rupees ($1,637) and feared for his future without the money."I wanted to start a grocery store with (the money) but now I am running around filing complaints and job-hunting," said Krishnan, who did not use his real name due to the ongoing case."I am still waiting while ... my savings are diminishing rapidly," he said by phone from Kerala. --- Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hundreds-of-indian-workers-demand-unpaid-wages-from-saudi-construction-firm-158083

He disclosed that 80 special officers were working round the clock on a three-phase disaster management plan to minimise casualties. Hyderabad has suffered an estimated loss of Rs 670 crore. The government has spent Rs 45 crore towards providing food, sanitation and relief camps and another Rs 60 crore in restoring electricity, water pipes etc.The state has asked the Central government for an immediate assistance of Rs 1,350 crore, while the total losses could be around Rs 5,000 crore. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has suspended all its activities for the next few days and is only tasked with disaster management responsibility.He appealed to all those living in the low-lying areas to immediately vacate their houses and shift to the government shelters.“The shelters have food, drinking water, toilets, medical camps and masks,” he said.  The government has supplied 37,000 ration kits and includes everything from tea powder to toiletries. All people being rehabilitated in these shelter homes are being tested for Covid-19 to prevent spread of coronavirus. Terming it once in a century rainfall, KTR, who is the working president of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and also son of the chief minister, said encroachments in lakes and along the river beds had precipitated the situation along with nature’s fury.  “We have all the reports of encroachments and satellite photos of encroachments. However, our present focus is on rescuing the people. We will discuss the encroachments later. These issues can’t be addressed overnight,” he said. KTR said his government’s current focus was on saving lives. He said in some incidents, the government has to forcefully evacuate the people living in low-lying areas as they refused to move. State Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar has asked Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka to provide 15 rescue boats each, apart from the 15 available with the government of Telangana.Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Edapaddi Palaniswami has announced Rs 10 crore fund, apart from thousands of blankets as relief to the state. CM K Chandrashekhar Rao announces a financial package of Rs 550 croreTelangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) has announced a financial package of Rs 550 crore for flood affected people residing in low lying areas in the state’s various Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) including Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) limits.In a statement the chief minister said that the authorities have been instructed to implement the relief operations immediately and to provide the financial assistance forthwith.  KCR said people residing in inundated areas have suffered severe losses after rain water entered into their homes and damaged their essential commodities. As part of the financial package the state government will provide Rs 1 lakh each for completely collapsed houses and Rs 50,000 each for partially damaged houses.  A financial assistance of Rs 10,000 will be provided to each flood-affected family as part of the relief operations.

19-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Confessional statements of accused not in public domain cannot be published, says HC||Confessional statements of an accused which are not in public domain cannot be accessed and published, observed the Delhi High Court which on Monday questioned a news channel over broadcast of an alleged confession of an accused in a case related to communal violence in northeast Delhi during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act in February.It also said that journalists do not have the right to take out the case diary and publish it.The high court directed media house, Zee News Media Corporation Ltd, to file an affidavit disclosing the name of the source from whom the journalist concerned got the documents of an alleged confession statement of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) university student.Justice Vibhu Bakhru declined the request of the media house that it should be allowed to disclose the name of the journalist concerned in a sealed cover as revealing his name openly would risk his life and his family.The judge asked the news channel to file a separate affidavit while listing the matter for further hearing on October 23.“Police have already initiated a vigilance inquiry into the matter. You (Zee News) have got access to documents which even the accused does not have. You file the counter reply disclosing the source from where you got the document,” the judge said.The high court was hearing a plea by JMI student Asif Iqbal Tanha alleging misconduct by police officials in leaking his disclosure statement, recorded by the probe agency during the investigation, to the media.While the police have claimed that the disclosure statement was not leaked by any of its officials, the counsel for the news channel said the journalist has requested that he should not be pressed to disclose his source of information in view of the fact that the truthfulness of Tanha’s confessional statement has not been disputed by him in the petition.Advocate Vijay Aggarwal, representing Zee News, argued that pressing for disclosure of source would amount to interfering with the freedom of press as guaranteed under the Constitution and in a situation where the source of information is not protected or safeguarded, the freedom of press will be severely jeopardised or interfered with.The high court, however, said it does not think that it’s a journalist’s right to take out the case diary and publish it and that the news report cannot be based on documents which are not in the public domain.“These are documents which you cannot take out and publish. There is no doubt about it,” the judge said.Advocate Siddharth Aggarwal, appearing for Tanha, said he was not concerned with the internal arrangement of the media house and before putting out a news on a national TV, they should verify the details.“One has to determine from where the document is coming. Accused were not being given copies of remand applications in which there are details about their case but journalists are given everything,” he argued.Earlier, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (special cell) in an affidavit, had said that Delhi Police were also aggrieved by the newspaper report in which the alleged confessional statement of JMI student Asif Iqbal Tanha was leaked out.The police affidavit, through advocates Amit Mahajan and Rajat Nair, also stated that none of its officials indulged in the investigation of the case leaked out the information to the media.The high court had asked two media houses and two social media platforms to respond to the plea which also sought direction to take down the sensitive/ confidential information leaked to them by the officials of Delhi Police.The high court had also refused to pass an ex-parte order directing the media houses, Zee News and OpIndia and social networking platforms Facebook and YouTube to remove the content and had said that it will pass necessary orders after hearing all the parties.Tanha, in his petition, said he was aggrieved by various publications reporting that he has confessed to orchestrating the Delhi riots and alleged that he was coerced to sign certain papers in the effective custody of police.It said this information does not have any evidentiary value and alleged that the Delhi Police officials, with malafide intention, leaked the statements to the media to prejudice his case.Tanha, who was arrested in May, is currently lodged in judicial custody in the Delhi riots case.Tanha, a third-year student of BA in Persian language, was earlier arrested in connection with the violence in the Jamia area during a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in December last year.The police had said that Tanha, a resident of Abul Fazal Enclave in Shaheen Bagh, was a member of the Students Islamic Organization and was part of the Jamia Coordination Committee which spearheaded protests against the new citizenship law.“Tanha is a key member of the Jamia Coordination Committee and played an active role in organising protests and riots in Jamia in December 2019. He is a close associate of Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam, Meeran Haider and Safoora Zargar who had been key organisers of anti-CAA protests and subsequent riots,” the police had said.On December 15 last year, protesters had turned violent, torching four public buses and two police vehicles and pelting stones at the police and civilians, near JMI. At least 40 people including students, policemen and firefighters were injured in the incident. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-confessional-statements-of-accused-not-in-public-domain-cannot-be-published-says-hc-158069
19-10-2020||Mumbai||Why can’t NBSA guidelines be given more teeth, Bombay HC asks Centre||The Bombay High Court on Monday asked why the Union government could not ratify and enforce guidelines of private bodies such as the News Broadcasters Standards Authority (NBSA) to regulate the content broadcast by TV news channels.A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni said since the NBSA had detailed code of ethics and guidelines that all member channels are expected to adhere to, the same could be given some teeth and made enforceable by the government.“Can we not make a request to the government, that there are guidelines in place, so that those guidelines get a stamp and can be enforced?” the bench asked.The question came when senior counsel Arvind Datar and advocate Neela Gokhale, representing the NBSA, told the high court that the private body had taken action on several complaints received against news channels.The advocates said that in the past, the NBSA had imposed the maximum fine of Rs one lakh on some news channels for content that breached its guidelines.While all other channels had apologised and paid the fine, the Republic TV had refused to do so, Datar said.“The Republic TV then walked out of the National Broadcasters Association (NBA) and formed its own association, the National Broadcasters Federation,” Gokhale said.Datar said taking a cue from previous Supreme Court judgements, the NBSA also supported a mechanism of self-regulation for news broadcasters.The NBSA is an independent body set up by the NBA to consider and adjudicate upon complaints about broadcasts.On Datar’s arguments on self-regulation and the Republic TV incident, the bench asked what happened if the self-regulatory mechanisms failed and a channel refused to adhere to the guidelines.“When doctors are admitted to a PG course at concessional rates, they have to serve in rural areas. If they cannot fulfil that condition, then the doctors will not be given their certificate. If they refuse the condition, then they are fined heftily,” it said.“Why can’t you have guidelines like that? This should be the teeth of guidelines,” the court said.Datar said in case a channel refused to adhere to the NBSA guidelines or if it refused to pay the fine, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&B) could step in and take action.He also said that if self-regulation failed then the court, too, had ample power to step in.Datar said the NBSA also felt its guidelines should be made mandatory and their violation should be taken as a ground for granting injunction (against the offending channel).“Otherwise there is no deterrence,” he said.However, the NBSA was not in favour of any new statutory body to regulate the media, he said.“We do not want a statutory body over the existing system of self-regulation. The fastest relief is the court’s relief. Courts have considered several cases in the past too,” Datar said.“I (news broadcasters) do not want the statutory remedy to take away my remedy with the court. I am safer with the court than with a statutory body,” he said.The court has been conducting the final hearing on a bunch of public interest litigations seeking that the press, particularly TV news channels, be restrained in their reportage on the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.The pleas, filed by activists, retired police officers and some private citizens, also opposed the “media trial” conducted in the case by the press.The HC will continue the hearing on Wednesday.It directed Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh to inform the court on the next hearing why the I&B ministry was forwarding the complaints it received to the NBSA?“Have there been instances where channels have been banned by the ministry?” it asked.

19-10-2020||New Delhi||Australia to be part of Malabar exercise||India on Monday announced that Australia will join the upcoming Malabar exercise which effectively means that all the four member countries of the ‘Quad’ or Quadrilateral coalition will be participating in the mega drill.The US and Japan are the other countries that participate in the annual exercise, which is likely to take place next month in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.India’s decision to heed to Australia’s request to be part of the mega naval drill comes in the midst of growing strain in ties with China over the border row in eastern Ladakh.“As India seeks to increase cooperation with other countries in the maritime security domain and in the light of increased defence cooperation with Australia, Malabar 2020 will see the participation of the Australian Navy,” the defence ministry said in a statement.It said the exercise has been planned on a ‘non-contact - at sea’ format.“The exercise will strengthen the coordination between the navies of the participating countries,” the ministry said.China has been suspicious about the purpose of the Malabar exercise as it feels that the annual war game is an effort to contain its influence in the Indo-Pacific region.The Malabar exercise started in 1992 as a bilateral drill between the Indian Navy and the US Navy in the Indian Ocean. Japan became a permanent participant in the exercise in 2015.For the last few years, Australia has been showing keen interest in joining the exercise. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/australia-to-be-part-of-malabar-exercise-158064

19-10-2020||New Delhi||Israeli Embassy to have ‘Water Attache’ in India from January; North-East Consul: Ambassador||Israel Embassy here will have a separate ‘Water Attache’ from January 2021 to help share their country’s best practices and technologies for advancements in India’s water management and agriculture sectors, Israeli Ambassador to India Ron Malka has said.In another significant development, Israel will soon nominate an honorary Consul in the North-East with the aim to increase its presence and collaboration in that region, Malka said.Israel was less present in the Northeast and now it is going to increase that presence as it feels it can bring a lot of added value to that region in various development sectors, Malka told PTI in an interview.The Israeli envoy also said that in January his country for the first time is going to nominate a ‘Water Attache’ who will join the ‘Agriculture Attache’ who has been here for many years and together they will go to the centres of excellence for agriculture established as part of Indo-Israel collaboration and bring to India technology and systems in water management and agriculture.He said as many as 29 such centres of excellence have already been established across India and nearly 1.5 lakh farmers have been trained at these centres in just one year.“India and Israel have a strategic partnership in water management. This is one of the main pillars, we are collaborating on because we understand and realise that water is one of the biggest challenges in India post-COVID,” Malka said, adding that Israel is the perfect match to meet that challenge.“We have so much to do together in this field. We just signed a flagship project on water in UP. We are advancing rapidly on this front,” he said.“We are working very closely on water-related matters with both the federal government and the states. We congratulate India on reforms in the water sector and concentrating all the authority in the Jal Shakti Ministry,” he said.Malka also hailed the chemistry between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in deepening ties.“Besides, the place that we have now reached is much beyond any particular individual or any party or any political developments because now our relationship is people to people,” he said.Malka said Israel’s efforts are to identify all possible areas where it can bring in value addition in sectors identified as important by the Indian government and these sectors range from agriculture, water, defence and security, innovation, healthcare and technology, among various others.Asked whether defence remained the main glue that binds India-Israel bilateral ties, he said it is “one of the glues”.Defence and security might have been the main glue earlier, but it is just one of the many now as the partnership between the two countries has deepened and expanded to several sectors and several areas.He identified agriculture as one of the most diverse areas of cooperation at present and said there is so much scope to do in this area, including with the use of latest water technology solutions that Israel has created and can be tailor-made for the Indian context easily.

19-10-2020||New Delhi||Air India bid deadline may be extended till Dec 15, govt to ease asset valuation norm||To attract potential suitors, the government will ease asset valuation norms for Air India by allowing bidders to put in offers on an enterprise value basis, a source said on Monday.To begin with, the government is likely to further extend the deadline for putting in a preliminary expression of interest for the loss-making national carrier to December 15.The source said bids will be sought on an enterprise value basis — a popular valuation methodology for takeover deals.Enterprise value (EV) is a measure of a company’s total value, often used as a more comprehensive alternative to equity market capitalisation.EV includes in its calculation the market capitalisation of a company but also short-term and long-term debt as well as any cash on the company’s balance sheet.The source said the government would remove from the Preliminary Information Memorandum (PIM) the quantum of debt to be assumed by the bidder.The bidders would also be asked to place offers for the entire company, 85 per cent of which would be considered to go towards debt repayment and the balance would accrue to the government, the source said.“Changes are being made to the valuation method. CGD (Core Group on Disinvestment) has approved it and it would be placed before AISAM (Air India Specific Alternative Mechanism). The deadline for Air India bid is proposed to be extended till December 15,” the source told PTI.This would be the fifth extension to the Air India bid deadline with the current one ending on October 30.After its unsuccessful bid to sell Air India in 2018, the government in January 2020 restarted the divestment process and invited bids for selling 100 per cent of its equity in the state-owned airline, including Air India’s 100 per cent shareholding in AI Express Ltd and 50 per cent in Air India SATS Airport Services Private Ltd.In 2018, the government had offered to sell its 76 per cent stake in the airline.Of the airline’s total debt of Rs 60,074 crore as of March 31, 2019, the buyer would be required to absorb Rs 23,286.5 crore, while the rest would be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL), a special purpose vehicle.The source further said that the government would be giving a “merit list” of Air India debts to the interested bidders at the due diligence stage based on which the bidders can decide on which debt to repay.The change in valuation methodology for Air India was necessary as the aircraft fleet is idle during COVID time and valuation based on flight operating capacity would not be possible at present.The government would be giving time to potential bidders to raise queries on the change in valuation methodology, the source added.For the current fiscal, the budget has pegged disinvestment proceeds at Rs 2.10 lakh crore. This includes Rs 1.20 lakh crore from CPSE share sale and Rs 90,000 crore from share sale in public sector banks and financial institutions, including listing of insurance behemoth LIC.

The words used in the video are highly defamatory and shows disrespect towards the dignity of a woman," the NCW said in a statement."At a time when we want more women to enter politics, such disrespectful remarks against a woman leader, that too from a person holding such a responsible position is very unfortunate," it noted.Addressing a poll meeting on Sunday in Gwalior's Dabra town, where the BJP has fielded Imarti Devi, Nath said the Congress candidate was a "simple person" unlike the opponent who was an "item".Imarti Devi and 21 other MLAs loyal to Jyotiraditya Scindia had resigned from the Congress and the state assembly and joined the BJP in March, in the process bringing down the Nath government.Bypolls for 28 Madhya Pradesh Assembly seats will be held on November 3 and the counting of votes will be done on November 10.

19-10-2020||Mumbai||TRP case: Issue summons to Goswami before arraignment, says HC||The Bombay High Court on Monday said if the Mumbai police crime branch proposed to arraign Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami in the television rating points (TRP) case, it should first issue summons to him as was done for eight others in the case.A division bench of Justices SS Shinde and MS Karnik said if such a summons was issued, then Goswami would appear before the police and cooperate with the investigation.The court also directed the police to submit, for its perusal, investigation papers pertaining to the case in a sealed cover by November 5 when it would hear the matter.“The FIR is not an encyclopaedia. We would like to peruse the investigation papers and see what probe has been done from today till the next date of hearing,” the court said.The court was hearing a petition filed by ARG Outlier Media Private Limited, which owns Republic TV, and Goswami seeking to quash the FIR lodged on October 6.The petition has also sought a direction to transfer the case to the CBI to ensure a fair and transparent probe and also on the ground that the case will have pan-India repercussions. The plea said the HC should stay the investigation and restrain police from taking any coercive action against the petitioners pending hearing of their petition.Appearing for the petitioners, senior counsel Harish Salve sought the court to grant Goswami protection from arrest.“The police have been targeting him (Goswami) and there is apprehension that he may be arrested,” Salve said.Senior counsel Kapil Sibal, appearing for Maharashtra government and police, said since Goswami had not been named as accused in the case as of now, there could not be any order granting him protection.Sibal said till now, police had issued summons to eight persons in connection with the TRP case and questioned them. “None of these persons has been arrested,” he added.The bench noted that since Goswami had not been named as an accused in the case, it could not pass an order granting him protection or directing the police to not take any coercive action against him.“In case the Investigating Officer proposes to name petitioner No 2 (Goswami) as accused in the case, then, as done with the eight persons, summons shall be issued to him (Goswami). The petitioner No 2 shall then cooperate with the police,” the court said.The court also raised questions on whether it was correct on the part of the Mumbai police and its commissioner Param Bir Singh to hold press conferences in such matters.“We don't know if it is the correct method or procedure to give interviews to the media. We are not talking about just this matter but many sensitive cases...we find police giving information to the media even when an investigation is in progress. Police are not supposed to reveal incriminating information pertaining to the case,” Justice Shinde said.Sibal, while agreeing to this, assured the court that the police would not speak to the media with regard to the TRP scam case.“But at the same time, even the petitioner channel should assure the court it will not indulge in vilification of the police and conduct a media trial,” he said.To this, Justice Shinde said: “Media is considered as the fourth pillar of democracy and, hence, they too need to behave responsibly.”Salve, while seeking for the FIR to be quashed, argued that no offence was made out and the entire conduct of the police reeked of malafide and was only an attempt to silence the voice of the petitioners.“The petitioner has been targeted by the police and the Maharashtra government since his strong reports during the Palghar lynching incident. A slew of FIRs has been registered against him after his reports then. This whole thing is a disguise and excuse to target Goswami and Republic TV,” Salve said.Sibal, however, said the Palghar lynching incident and the petitioners’ reports on the same had nothing to do with the present case.“The present investigation pertains to money paid to rig TRPs in order to gain commercial profit. The investigation is at a nascent stage. Maybe many other media channels are also involved,” Sibal told the court.The TV channel filed the plea in HC on October 16, a day after the Supreme Court refused to hear a plea filed by one of its senior officials challenging the summons issued to them by the Mumbai police.“The officers and key managerial persons of the channel and Arnab Goswami have reasonable and tangible grounds to believe they will be apprehended by the Mumbai police in connection with the FIR which is false, frivolous, politically motivated and an attempt to muzzle the media and silence the news reporting by Republic TV,” the petition said.The Mumbai Crime Branch registered the FIR under various sections of the Indian Penal Code for cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal conspiracy against Republic TV and its senior officials and also against two other local regional channels.The plea also said the court should initiate a CBI inquiry and disciplinary proceedings under the service rules against Param Bir Singh for “gross dereliction of duty and abuse of power”.

The decline in the cumulative positivity rate has demonstrated that the rate of spread of infection is being effectively contained,” it said.Also read: 55,722 more coronavirus cases take national tally past 75 lakh“Higher testing across wide regions leads to early identification of positive cases, prompt tracking through efficient surveillance and tracing, and timely and effective treatment in homes or facilities and in hospitals for severe cases. These measures in tandem eventually lead to lower mortality rate,” it added.The total number of tests for the detection of coronavirus infection has crossed 9.5 crore so far, according to the Ministry. The average daily positivity rate for the third week of October is 6.13 per cent, the statement said.“This is a result of a successful test, track, trace, treat and technology strategy of the Central government effectively followed by states and UTs,” it underlined.The Ministry said the country has been reporting a steady decline in active cases.The active cases of coronavirus infection remained below 8 lakh for the third consecutive day on Monday. There are 7,72,055 active cases of coronavirus infection in the country which comprise 10.23 per cent of the total caseload, according to ministry data updated at 8 am.The total number of recoveries has surged to 66,63,608, thereby enhancing the difference with respect to active cases, the Ministry said.A total of 66,399 patients recovered and were discharged the previous day, while 55,722 new infections were reported. The national recovery rate has progressed to 88.26 per cent, it said.According to the statement, 79 per cent of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 10 states and UTs — Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Odisha and Chhattisgarh.Maharashtra is the biggest contributor with more than 11,000 recoveries in a day, followed by Kerala and Karnataka with more than 8,000 recoveries each, the statement said.The Ministry said 81 per cent of the 55,722 new cases are from the 10 states and UTs.With more than 9,000 fresh infections, Maharashtra continues to report a very high number of cases, followed by Kerala and Karnataka with more than 7,000 cases each, it said.A total of 579 case fatalities were reported in a span of 24 hours.

19-10-2020||New Delhi||SC asks Maharashtra SDMA to take decision on Nanded gurdwara Dussehra procession||The Supreme Court Monday asked the Maharashtra State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) to decide on the representation by Nanded gurudwara management board seeking to hold Dusshera procession amid COVID-19 pandemic.A bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao, which assembled during the Dusshera vacation of the apex court to hear the matter, said the decision will have to be taken on the basis of ground situation.The bench, also comprising Justices Hemant Gupta and Ajay Rastogi, asked the gurudwara management to file a representation in this regard with the SDMA by Tuesday.The gurudwara management board can move the Bombay High Court if it is not satisfied with the decision of the SDMA, it said. The top court was hearing a plea by ‘Nanded Sikh Gurudwara Sachkhand Shri Hazur Abchalnagar Sahib Board' seeking permission to carry out the customary procession on account of the 300-year old event --  'Dusshera, Takht Isnan, Deepmala and Gurta Gaddi' --with certain conditions. The plea has said that “Gurudwara Takhat Shri Hazur Abchalnagar is a pious place of world fame for being the last place of tenth Sikh Guru Shri Guru Gobind Singh ji Maharaj, where he granted holy seat of Guru to the Gurugranth Sahiv ji before going to Sachkhand”. The Maharashtra government has told the apex court that allowing the Nanded gurudwara to hold Dusshera procession as per custom will not be a "practically feasible option” amid COVID-19 and the state has taken a conscious decision of not allowing religious functions to check the spread of the virus.

Senior administration and police officials were present at the meeting when the incident took place.After evading arrest for days, Singh was arrested by the UP Special Task Force from Lucknow on Sunday. A cash reward of Rs 50,000 had been announced for his arrest.During interrogation, Singh told the police that he opened fire in self-defence, according to officials."DIG Azamgarh range Subhash Chandra Dubey interrogated Dhirendra Pratap Singh for nearly an hour, and he gave the details of the incident. He assured the police that he would help in the recovery of the weapon (used in the crime), and said that he had fired in self-defence," said SHO of Kotwali police station Vipin Singh.He told police that around 2,000 people had gathered in the village on Thursday and there was a fracas over the allotment of ration shops, the SHO said.The accused claimed that the other side started the quarrel and opened fire, injuring his nephew and five-six women of his family. His nephew later succumbed to his injuries, he added.Singh also blamed the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) and the circle officer for the incident, the police said.He alleged that the SDM colluded with the other side.He claimed that initially, the SDM had announced that the allotment of shops will be done on the basis of majority. But later he said only those having identity cards could take part in the voting, according to the police.The Uttar Pradesh government has already suspended the SDM, the circle officer and other policemen present at the spot.Besides Singh, four others -- Santosh Yadav, Amarjeet Yadav, Ajay Singh and Dharmendra Singh -- were arrested in connection with the case from Ballia on Sunday.Meanwhile, BJP MLA from the state's Bairia assembly constituency Surendra Singh came out in support of Dhirendra Pratap Singh.He said he will try to meet Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and present his side of the story.He also said he will seek an impartial probe into the incident by the CB-CID.The Bairia MLA said while the person who fired bullets has been arrested, action should also be taken against those who wielded sticks and pelted stones."A case should also be registered from the other side (Dhirendra Pratap Singh). Action should be taken against both sides as per their role," he said.On Sunday, BJP workers held a meeting in Bairia over the incident, with one of them demanding a CBI probe in the case. They alleged that the police are working in a biased manner.The BJP workers threatened to resign from the party if a case from Dhirendra Pratap Singh's side is not registered within two days.So far, police have arrested 10 people in the case, in which an FIR has been lodged against around 30 people, most of whom are yet to be identified.The Uttar Pradesh Police had on Saturday said it would invoke the stringent National Security Act (NSA) and the Gangsters Act against the accused.Under the NSA, one can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months if authorities are satisfied that the person is a threat to national security or law and order.Under the UP Gangsters and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act, a district magistrate can order attachment of property, whether movable or immovable, if there is a reason to believe that it has been acquired as a commission for an offence triable under this law.

Who are we to make any demand?” Pawar said.“After the Union Home Minister’s statement expressing disappointment over language in the letter, anybody with self- respect will take a call on whether to continue in the post or not,” he added.Koshyari recently wrote to Thackeray on reopening places of worship in the state and asked if the Shiv Sena president had “suddenly turned secular”, triggering a war of words between the Governor and the Chief Minister.Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday told a news channel that “Koshyari could have chosen his words better”.Asked about speculations that senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse may join the NCP, Pawar said Khadse was earlier the leader of the opposition and played a huge role in building the BJP in the state.“He would criticise us and we would take note of it,” the NCP chief said.“One is bound to feel disturbed if his contributions and hard work are not taken note of. He may think why shouldn’t he shift to a party which appreciates his work,” he said.Khadse has been sulking since he was made to resign as a minister in the then BJP government in 2016 on allegations of corruption.

You have not just disrespected Smt Imarti Devi, but each and every girl and sister of Gwalior-Chambal region,” Chouhan said in a tweet in Hindi on Sunday.“Kamal Nathji, who gave you the right to play with the respect of women?” he asked in the tweet.Imarti Devi and 21 other MLAs loyal to Scindia had resigned from the Congress and the state Assembly and joined the BJP in March this year, in the process bringing down the Kamal Nath-led government.By-elections for 28 Assembly seats in the state will be held on November 3 and the counting of votes will be held on November 10.

19-10-2020||Vikramdeep Johal||French Ambassador Emmanuel Lenain: France supports India’s strategic autonomy||India and France have helped each other in fighting Covid-19, and commitments such as the on-time delivery of Rafale jets were kept despite the pandemic, says France’s Ambassador to India Emmanuel Lenain. In an exclusive interview to The Tribune, the Ambassador answers questions related to Indo-French ties, why India deserves a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, and more. Excerpts:This is your first official trip outside of Delhi since the outbreak of the pandemic. What brings you to Chandigarh?France and the City Beautiful share many connections, from Le Corbusier’s work to our ongoing Smart Cities cooperation and the technical assistance from the French Development Agency since 2016. French companies are world leaders in the sustainable cities sector and are keen to provide their expertise. This is one of the main goals of my visit: expand this cooperation even further to develop a model of sustainable urban living – which is even more crucial after the pandemic.French architect Le Corbusier designed Chandigarh, the first planned city of India, after Independence. What can France and India do together to preserve this heritage?Chandigarh is an architectural site of major importance, unlike any other in the world, and France is glad and honoured to contribute to its preservation, working hand in hand with the city authorities. The goal is to protect the buildings themselves, which were appraised by a French expert mission in February, but also the thousands of pieces of furniture created by Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret. I am delighted to announce that a second mission will take place soon, which will focus on how to track, protect and restore this furniture heritage.How do you see Indo-French relations at the moment and in the context of India’s border standoff with China?These past months have shown that the Indo-French friendship is even stronger in tough times. We have helped each other in fighting Covid-19, and commitments such as the on-time delivery of Rafales were kept despite the pandemic. Regarding the border situation, it is important that de-escalation and disengagement be achieved through dialogue, which is the path chosen by India. France will always support India’s strategic autonomy. Our interests have always been remarkably aligned, and they will be even more so in the post-pandemic world.Is there a possibility of French involvement in the Quad group of nations? How do France and India cooperate in the Indo-Pacific?France is itself a nation of the Indo-Pacific. We do not view cooperation in this region as being about formats, but rather shared values and willingness to achieve concrete results. That is the basis of our ambitious cooperation with India: we share intelligence analysis, we ensure our navies can operate together, we support each other in regional organisations. We are open to working with other like-minded countries, as with the recently launched trilateral dialogue with Australia.What is the future of Indo-French defence cooperation? Does it remain limited to being a seller-buyer relationship?Our defence cooperation is first and foremost based on mutual trust. Take the Rafale fighter jet for instance: it takes great trust on both sides to share a military asset that is so close to the core of our sovereignty. Moreover, Indian companies will benefit from offsets amounting to 50% of the Rafale contract, including through technology transfer. French defence companies have contributed to Make in India for decades, and will continue to do so.France has been supporting India’s candidature for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. What would India’s presence at the high table mean to France?We see India as a major, responsible power that is committed to a rules-based multilateral order. In an era of rising tensions, the world needs countries like India that have both the means and the willingness to defend collective solutions and international law. That’s why India deserves a permanent seat and would be a force for good at the UNSC. We will keep pushing for this. In the meantime, we plan to work closely with India as it joins the UNSC in 2021-22.In the education sector, there is a huge potential for tie-ups between French and Indian universities and for greater student mobility. What can be done to improve them?Indeed, the potential is immense. Indian students are very talented; 10,000 of them chose France in 2019 and we want to welcome more and more. France was the first country to reopen visas for Indian students in August, and French universities are doing everything possible to ensure the best and safest study conditions despite the pandemic. We also want to increase ties between our academic institutions: that’s the goal of the bilateral Knowledge Summit, whose third edition will take place next year in India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/french-ambassador-emmanuel-lenain-france-supports-indias-strategic-autonomy-157877

Instead of honouring the law and granting adequate protection to India’s daughters, BJP governments are siding with the criminals. The voice of oppressed families is being suppressed by the agencies of the state. Is this the new raj dharma?”She said, “Democracy is passing through its most tumultuous times. There is a designed attack on our Constitution and democratic traditions. Our country is ruled by a government, which is systematically bartering the interests of our citizens at the altar of profiteering by handful of crony capitalists. The current BJP government has attacked the very foundation of our resilient agrarian economy by bringing in three anti-agriculture black laws.”Sonia said a conspiracy had been hatched to defeat the gains of “Green Revolution” and the country had been pushed into the abyss of the Covid-19 pandemic by sheer ineptitude and mismanagement of the government.Sonia gave a call for a national agitation against the BJP with AICC general secretary organisation KC Venugopal later saying fasts would be observed at all district headquarters on October 31, the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel and the death anniversary of former PM Indira Gandhi.“In line with the concerted opposition to the anti-farmer legislations and our committed fight for justice for the rape victim in Hathras, it has been decided to observe October 31 as ‘Kisan Adhikar Divas’ and Satyagrah and fasts will be held at every district headquarter between 10 am and 4 pm against anti-farmer and anti-labour laws,” Venugopal said. He said on November 5, the party will observe Mahila and Dalit Utpidan Virodhi Divas with protests at every state headquarters.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/is-suppressing-oppressed-families-new-raj-dharma-sonia-asks-bjp-157874
19-10-2020||New Delhi||Pakistan fails to fulfil 6  key mandates of FATF||Pakistan’s failure to fulfil six key obligations of the FATF, including action against two of India’s most wanted terrorists Maulana Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed, and the sudden disappearance of more than 4,000 terrorists from its official list will most likely lead to its continuation in the “grey list” of the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, officials said on Sunday.The virtual plenary of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), to be held on October 21-23, will take the final call on Pakistan’s continuation on its grey list after a thorough review of Islamabad’s performance in fulfilling the global commitments and standards in the fight against money laundering and terror financing.The FATF had given Pakistan a total of 27 action plan obligations for completely checking terror financing of which so far it has cleared 21, but has failed in some of the key tasks, an official privy to the developments said.The mandates which Pakistan has failed include action against all UN-designated terrorists like JeM chief Azhar, LeT founder Seed and the outfit’s operational commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi.Besides, the FATF has strongly noted the fact that there was sudden disappearance of the names of more than 4,000 terrorists from its original list of 7,600 under Schedule IV of its Anti-Terrorism Act.“Under these circumstances, it is almost certain that Pakistan will continue in the FATF grey list,” the official said.Besides, the four nominating countries — the US, Britain, France and Germany — are also not satisfied with Islamabad’s commitment to taking strong action against the terror groups operating from its soil.Azhar, Saeed and Lakhvi are most wanted terrorists in India for their involvement in terrorist acts, including the 26/11 Mumbai terror strikes and the bombing of a CRPF bus at Pulwama last year.With Pakistan’s continuation in the grey list, it is increasingly becoming difficult for Islamabad to get financial aid from the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, Asian Development Bank and the European Union. — PTILikely to remain on grey list||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-fails-to-fulfil-6-key-mandates-of-fatf-157858

On September 29, a day before his scheduled superannuation, the HC had granted him protection till the tribunal heard the matter further.Directing that the petitioner, currently posted at Bathinda, would be deemed to have retired from service on September 30, his original date of superannuation, the tribunal ruled that the retirement shall be subject to any final order passed on merits after hearing all concerned.After the government had stopped issue of free ration to officers in 2017, Col Dev had sent a legal notice to the Defence Secretary, terming the move to be illegal. He was awarded a “displeasure” by the Corps Commander for violating the Army’s rules and regulations by sending the notice directly to the Defence Secretary.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/colonel-who-took-up-ration-issue-loses-out-on-promotion-157854

19-10-2020||---||Covid control likely by early ’21||New Delhi, October 18Top government experts today said India can control the Covid pandemic by early next year if everyone follows safety protocols with 10.6 million confirmed cases projected until February next. India has 74,94,551 cases as of today.Led by Prof M Vidyasagar of IIT-Hyderabad, the Covid India National Supermodel Committee, set up by the Centre, said the Covid pandemic had peaked but cautioned of active cases surging to 26 lakh if people became lax during festivities. Current active cases are below 8 lakh.Second wave can’t be ruled out: Niti AayogThe number of new coronavirus cases and deaths has declined in the past three weeks as the spread of the pandemic has stabilised in most of the states, Niti Aayog Member VK Paul said on Sunday but did not rule out the possibility of a second wave of infections in the winter season.The committee said 30% people are projected to have developed antibodies to the virus as of today. The Central panel estimated 14% people with antibodies at August-end as against 7% projected by the ICMR. Prof Vidyasagar said 30% prevalence was good news and the reason why new cases were dropping.Mandated to study the efficacy of the lockdown, the panel found that in the absence of the lockdown, active cases could have peaked to 140 lakh in June with 26 lakh deaths by August-end as against under eight lakh cases in September with one lakh deaths.“Without the lockdown, the peak would have been 15 times higher than now. National lockdown lowered the peak load, pushed the peak to September and geared health systems to respond better. Had the lockdown been imposed from April 1 to May 1, 40 to 50 lakh peak active cases are projected by June with 7 to 10 lakh deaths by August-end,” Vidyasagar said adding total cases could have been 204 lakh by February 2021 without the lockdown.Community transmission limited: Health MinisterHealth Minister Harsh Vardhan said community transmission was restricted to certain districts in a limited number of states, clarifying “this is not happening across the country”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-control-likely-by-early-21-157794
