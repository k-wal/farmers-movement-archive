05-10-2020||New Delhi||PM Modi for protecting world from weaponisation of AI by non-state actors||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday rooted for protecting the world against the weaponisation of artificial intelligence (AI) by non-state actors, saying accountability as important as transparency in the use of intelligence generated by machines.Speaking at the inauguration of the 'RAISE 2020 Summit' on AI, Modi said India was looking to become a global hub for artificial intelligence and would use a National Programme on AI for solving the problems of society."It remains our collective responsibility to ensure trust in how AI is used. Algorithm transparency is key to establishing this trust. Equally important is accountability. We must protect the world against the weaponisation of AI by non-state actors," he said.He urged everyone to think about how the intellectual edge over machines can be retained and ensure human intelligence was always a few steps ahead of the AI.He further said people should think about how AI can help humans increase their own capacities.Stating that AI is a tribute to human intellectual prowess, Modi said today tools and technology have also acquired the power to learn and think.AI is a key emerging technology and it teaming up with humans can do wonders for the planet, he noted.India, he said, had led the world in knowledge and learning at every step of history. "In today's age of IT as well, India is making outstanding contributions. Some of the brightest tech leaders belong to India."         The Prime Minister said the nation had also proved to be the powerhouse of the global IT services industry and continues to excel digitally."In India, we have experienced that technology improves transparency and electronic delivery of services," he said, referring to the government using bank accounts linked to biometric identification to deliver benefits to the intended people and plug diversions.With the world's largest unique identity programme, Aadhaar, and the globe's most innovative payment system UPI, access to digital services including financial services has been provided to poor and marginalised, said Modi."In the pandemic situation, we showed how India's digital readiness was of great help. We reached out to people for help at the earliest and in the most efficient manner," he added.The government is expanding the optical fibre network in the country with an aim to provide high-speed Internet connectivity to every village, he said. "We want India to become a global hub for AI. Many Indians are already working in this area."         Also, the National Programme on AI will be dedicated to the rightful use of artificial intelligence for solving the problems of society. "It will be implemented with the support of stakeholders," he said.He further said AI had a big role to play in agriculture, healthcare, education, creating next generation urban infrastructure and addressing urban issues like reducing traffic jams, improving sewage systems and laying energy grids."It can be used for making our disaster management system stronger. It can even be used to solve the problem of climate change," he said.Stating that technology has transformed workplaces and improved connectivity, he said the merger between social responsibility and AI would enrich artificial intelligence with a human touch.The Prime Minister hoped many more Indians would start working on AI to help make India a global hub for artificial intelligence.The recently adopted National Education Policy 2020 focuses on technology-based learning and skilling as a major part of education, he said, adding e-courses will also be developed in various regional languages and dialects.This whole effort will benefit from Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities of AI platforms, he said.Under the 'Responsible AI for Youth' programme launched in April 2020, more than 11,000 students from schools completed the basic course, he said, adding they are now building their AI projects.Modi said the National Educational Technology Forum would create an e-education unit to boost the digital infrastructure, digital content and capacity.The AI will unlock the unique potential of each person and empower them to contribute more effectively to society, the Prime Minister added.

05-10-2020||New Delhi||SC to hear Hathras rape case on Tuesday||A retired judge on Monday moved the Supreme Court seeking a probe into the role of police officials and registration of FIRs against them in connection with a Dalit woman who died days after being allegedly gang raped in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh.Filed by ex-judicial officer Chandra Bhan Singh, the petition alleged that “callousness and highhandedness” of the state administration and police officials in giving treatment to the victim led to her death and sought a probe by any agency other than affiliated to Uttar Pradesh government.Another PIL filed in the matter sought an investigation by the CBI or SIT monitored by sitting or retired judge of the SC or high court into the case.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde is likely to take up the matter for hearing on Tuesday.Alleging abuse of authority and high-handedness, yet another petition filed in the top court demanded imposition of President’s rule in UP in view of the incident, contending it amounted to failure of constitutional machinery.The state government has already recommended a CBI probe even as it denied that the 19-year-old Dalit woman was raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14.The woman had died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital during treatment and her body was cremated at night near her home on September 30. Her family alleged the police forced them to hurriedly conduct her last rites – an allegation denied by police.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-hear-hathras-rape-case-on-tuesday-151450
05-10-2020||New Delhi||Show-cause notice issued to Sudarshan TV on recommendation of inter-ministerial group: Centre to SC||The Centre told the Supreme Court on Monday that a show-cause notice has been issued to Sudarshan TV based on the recommendation of an inter-ministerial group that has viewed all the episode of the channel’s ‘Bindas Bol’ programme.The apex court was hearing a plea that has raised grievance over Bindas Bol’ programme whose promo had claimed that channel would show the ‘big expose on conspiracy to infiltrate Muslims in government service’.A Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud was informed by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that the inter-ministerial group has also heard the representative of the channel.Taking note of Mehta’s submission, the Bench, also comprising Justices Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee, posted the matter for hearing on October 26 to enable the channel to file its reply to the show cause notice.On September 23, the Centre had informed the apex court that it has prima facie found violation of the programme code by Sudarshan TV’s ‘Bindas Bol’ show and has issued a notice to the channel.The top court had said that steps taken by the government in pursuance to the show cause notice against the channel would be subject to the orders of the court.The apex court had also said that its interim order of September 15, 2020 (injuncting the telecast of remaining episodes of the programme) shall continue to remain in operation pending further orders.On September 21, the apex court had pondered over the nature and extent of its order regulating ‘Bindas Bol’ programme on alleged infiltration of Muslims in bureaucracy saying it did not want to “curtail” freedom of speech as the programme has “public interest” involved on issues of “foreign funding” and “reservation”.Earlier, the top court had questioned Sudarshan TV over its programme asking whether the media can be allowed to “target whole set of communities”. It had asked the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the National Broadcasters Association to give suggestions for strengthening the “self-regulating mechanism” of NBA for electronic media.

05-10-2020||New Delhi||India chairs special WHO COVID meet, seeks impartial review of world body led response||Chairing a two-day special session of the WHO executive board which started Monday to discuss an evolving COVID pandemic, India called for an urgent and impartial review of lessons learned from the world body led global disease response amid more than one million global deaths.Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, who chaired the fifth special session of WHO Executive Board, said in his remarks on Monday: “There is a need to initiate, at the earliest appropriate moment, and in consultation with the Member States, a stepwise process of an impartial, independent, and comprehensive evaluation, including using existing mechanisms, as appropriate, to review experience gained and lessons learned from the WHO-coordinated international health response to COVID-19”.Vardhan’s remarks came ahead of the update expected to be presented at Monday’s meeting by the WHO appointed panel for review of International Health Regulations. The panel was formed in the wake of several countries led by the US raising question marks on the role of China in reporting the pandemic. The US later even pulled out of the WHO accusing it of delayed response.As the confirmed cases today reached 34,804,348 worldwide with 10,30,738 deaths, WHO said about 10  per cent of the world’s population may have been infected by COVID 19 causing SARS-CoV 2 virus by now.“Our current best estimates tell us that about 10 per cent of global population may have been infected by the virus. But what it does mean is that the vast majority of the world continues to remain at risk. Pandemic will continue to evolve and the future will depend on the choices we make,” said WHO Emergency Response chief Michael Ryan.Ryan said the pandemic continued to evolve in South East Asia.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom opened his remarks with “namaastey” and said although all nations have been affected by COVID, it is an uneven pandemic.  “Ten nations make up 70 pc of all cases and deaths and three account for half. Not all nations have responded the same way,” the WHO chief said. The US, India and Brazil account for half of all world’s cases.India’s COVID load on Monday crossed 66 lakh with 55,86,703 recoveries and 84.34 per cent national recovery rate.Confirmed cases as of today were 66,23,815 with 74,442 daily infections and higher daily recoveries at 76737.The toll reached 1,02,685 after 903 deaths in a day and there were 9,34,427 active cases with the government managing to keep the active case load in India below 10 lakh for 14 days at a stretch.The active cases now make up 14.11 per cent of the confirmed cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-chairs-special-who-covid-meet-seeks-impartial-review-of-world-body-led-response-151443
05-10-2020||New Delhi||Ambani pitches for new regulation on data protection||Billionaire Mukesh Ambani on Monday pitched for the government framing new regulation to protect data and ensure data privacy, saying nations will increasingly compete on digital capital in the coming decades.Ambani, who has been a votary of data nationalisation, said India has a unique advantage to harness enormous digital capital for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven development that is “bottom-up and inclusive”.Speaking at RAISE 2020 summit, Ambani said the time is ripe, and the tools ready to make India a world leader in AI and to make AI work for all Indians.“We are confident that the government will introduce a sound data regulation framework to protect this national resource and ensure data privacy,” Ambani said.Citing India’s global lead in mobile data consumption; its sprawling pan-India optical fiber network through BharatNet initiative; and the Make in India programme, he said the country had all crucial elements in place to position itself as a ‘Premier Digital Society’.“Together, our economy and society will generate data at an explosive and exponential rate,” he said terming data the raw material for AI.He further said intelligent data is ‘Digital Capital’ and a vital national resource.                   “In the past, nations have competed on physical capital, financial capital, human capital and intellectual capital. But, in the coming decades… nations will increasingly compete on Digital Capital,” he noted.India has unique advantage to harness its enormous Digital Capital for AI-driven development, which is “bottom-up and inclusive”, on the strengths of its demography and democracy.“When 1.3 billion Indians are digitally empowered, they will unleash a proliferation of new digital enterprises that will create faster economic growth, greater prosperity, high quality employment opportunities, and better standards of living … across all sections of our society,” he said.Ambani, who is the chairman of Reliance Industries, said advent of modern AI is comparable only to the birth of intelligent life on the planet.“In the coming decades, the total non-biological intelligence will exceed rational intelligence of the entire human population,” he said but asserted that AI will “never” replace the human mind.Instead, he said, it will vastly expand capacity to solve most complex and pressing problems before India and the world.AI will enable India to move swiftly towards achieving its ambitious goals. This include transformation of the country into USD 5 trillion dollar economy, making industries and businesses ‘aatmanirbhar’ and dominating new global value chains, modernising Indian agriculture and increasing farmers’ incomes, delivering affordable and quality healthcare, and education.The RAISE summit raises hope that the hardships and hurdles caused by the coronavirus pandemic will be temporary, he said adding that India has the resilience and resolve to bounce back and progress faster than ever before.“Indian industry is ready…Indian youth are ready…Indeed, the entire nation is ready to implement an agenda that will promote AI for a strong, sustainable and equitable New India,” he said.

05-10-2020||Hathras/Lucknow||Hathras case: FIR for bid to trigger caste conflict in UP; sedition charge included||Amid an outrage over the alleged gang rape and killing of a Dalit woman, Hathras Police have lodged an FIR against some unknown people and invoked the sedition charge against them for attempting to “trigger a caste conflict” and “tarnish” the Uttar Pradesh government’s image.The FIR lodged at Chandpa police station on Sunday mentioned 19 IPC sections, including 124A (sedition), 505 (intending to cause public alarm and inducing someone to commit offence against state or public tranquillity), 153A (promoting enmity between groups).Altogether, the UP police have filed 19 cases on similar charges in parts of the state.ADG (Law and Order) Prashant Kumar said six cases have been filed in Hathras district and the rest 13 in Bijnor, Saharanpur, Bulandshahr, Allahabad, Ayodhya and Lucknow.The development comes amid an undying controversy over the alleged gang rape of the woman and continuous protests and visits to her village by political leaders and activists.Kumar said efforts are on to vitiate the atmosphere through posters and social media posts. In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, permission had been given for only five people linked to political parties to visit the victim’s village but some parties and workers violated it, he said. The FIR filed at Chandpa police station has also invoked section 67 (transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the IT Act, according to the FIR.“The UP government’s statements and facts related to the Hathras incident are being forged, manipulated and circulated through social media. Misleading content is being shared with forged logos of media houses,” a police officer told PTI.“Some accused are circulating material that could trigger caste-based conflict and these are serious offences considering the current situation in the region,” the officer said, adding the investigation is underway.According to the FIR, lodged on a complaint by a local policeman, some anti-social elements wanted to leverage the situation to as part of a well-thought “criminal conspiracy” to provoke a “specific community” and a “specific caste” in order to disrupt law and order and “dent the image of a legally established government in the state.“The accused also tried to lure the victim’s family with an offer of Rs 50 lakh and tried to manipulate them into speaking against the government by changing their previous testimony,” the FIR stated.It also alleged that an unidentified journalist had tried to pressure a family member into convincing the victim’s father and mother “to give a byte (statement to TV media) saying they are not satisfied with the probe done by the administration and the state government while the victim’s father had earlier publicly said that he was satisfied with the probe.”The FIR also states that wrong statements attributed to the chief minister with forged logo of a TV channel were circulated to trigger “class conflict” and animosity against a caste-specific in order to leverage the situation.“Several such imaginary and false statements were circulated on social media by unidentified persons with an objective to damage the image of the government and spread animosity among groups which has led to sensationalism and tension in the state,” it alleged.The Dalit woman died of grievous injuries in a Delhi hospital on September 29, a fortnight after she was allegedly raped at her village by four “upper caste” men.She was cremated in the early hours of September 30. While the family claimed the cremation was carried out against their wishes, the police said the last rights in the dead of the night were held “as per the wishes of the family”.The incidents have triggered massive outrage across the country, bringing severe flak for the government of UP which has now recommended a CBI probe into the whole episode.

05-10-2020||---||Bhartiya Kisan Party moves SC against farm laws||New Delhi, October 5Bhartiya Kisan Party on Monday moved the Supreme Court challenging the validity of the new farm laws, contending that they violated the basic features of the Constitution.In its petition, the party submitted that agriculture was a state subject under List II of Schedule VII of the Constitution and therefore, Parliament didn’t have the legislative competence to make laws on the subject.This is the fourth petition filed in the Supreme Court against the three farm laws – The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020 – which were assented to by President Ram Nath Kovind last month.Earlier, Congress MP from Trissur in Kerala TN Prathapan, DMK MP Tiruchi Siva and RJD MP Manoj Jha had moved the Supreme Court against the farm laws that have triggered farmers’ protest, especially in Punjab and Haryana.Jha had contended that the farm laws were “discriminatory” and would expose marginal farmers to exploitation by big companies.Siva submitted that the new farm laws would be disastrous for the farming community as they gave an "uneven edge over the farmers’ interest in favour of the sponsor or the farm service provider" while Prathapan said they opened the door for "corporate greed" of multinational companies to trample on the agriculture market.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhartiya-kisan-party-moves-sc-against-farm-laws-151436
05-10-2020||New Delhi||Modi, Xi likely to come face-to-face in virtual BRICS summit on November 17||For the first time since the standoff between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to come face-to-face virtually at the BRICS annual summit to be held on November 17.Russia, the chair of the five-nation BRICS, announced on Monday that the annual summit of the bloc will be held on November 17 via video conference.The BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa) is known as an influential bloc that represents over 3.6 billion people, or half of the world’s population.The BRICS countries have a combined GDP of USD 16.6 trillion.“The theme of the meeting of the leaders of BRICS countries is ‘BRICS Partnership for Global Stability, Shared Security and Innovative Growth’,” the Russian government said in a statement.Both Prime Minister Modi and President Xi have attended all summit meetings of the BRICS in the last few years.Modi and Xi are attending the virtual summit, said a diplomat, involved in the arrangements for the multilateral event.Last year, the BRICS summit had taken place in Brazilia, the capital city of Brazil. Modi and Xi also held a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the summit.India and China are locked in a bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh since early May that has significantly strained the bilateral ties.Both sides have held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the row. However, no breakthrough has been achieved to end the standoff.The Russian statement also said, “this year the five countries have continued close strategic partnership on all the three major pillars: peace and security, economy and finance, cultural and people-to-people exchanges”.Anton Kobyakov, Adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said despite the current global situation due to the spread of the coronavirus infection, the activities under Russia’s BRICS chairmanship were consistent.“Since January, more than 60 events have been organised, including via videoconferencing. The BRICS Summit will be the jewel-in-the-crown event of the Russian BRICS chairmanship, which will provide impetus for further strengthening cooperation together with our partners to ensure the well-being of BRICS countries,” Kobyakov said.

05-10-2020||---||No consensus over compensation, GST Council to meet again on Oct 12||New Delhi, October 5An eight-hour meeting of the GST Council on Monday failed to break the impasse over how to make up for the GST shortfall to states, leading to another meeting a week later, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced at a media briefing.However, the GST Council approved several decisions such as extending the period of GST compensation cess to five years, reducing the number of GST return forms for small businesses by one-third and wiring tonight to states the Rs 20,000 crore collected this year in GST compensation.The GST Council also approved the transfer of Rs 24,000 crore to states that had received less IGST than they were entitled to.States that have been paid more will not be immediately asked to refund the money due to the pandemic situation, assured Sitharaman.But the GST Council decided not to levy differential GST on alcoholic and non-alcoholic sanitisers.“Nobody is being denied compensation arising out of the implementation of GST and also compensation arising out of Covid impact. The borrowing has to be done,” she said while rebutting charges by 10 Opposition-ruled states that the Centre was shortchanging them of their legitimate GST dues.“The question was that 20 states have chosen an option but some have not chosen any. The argument of those who had not chosen any option was that the Centre should borrow. At the end of day, it was felt the GST Council can’t decide on the basis of the opinion of 20 states, we need to talk further,’’ she said while explaining the long drawn-out meeting and indicating that the Centre wanted consensus instead of a division to prevail.“I was gently reminded that I can’t take anybody for granted. I don’t take anybody for granted. Since there was a suggestion from a senior member (Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Modi) suggesting that some days be given, I have given a clear eight days,’’ Sitharaman added.She also announced that from January 1, GST payers with annual turnover of less than Rs 5 crore need not file GSTR 3B and GSTR 1 every month.  They nevertheless will have to submit “a very simple challan” every month.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-consensus-over-compensation-gst-council-to-meet-again-on-oct-12-151432
05-10-2020||Tokyo||US, Australia, India, Japan to discuss China’s growing power||Foreign Ministers from four Indo-Pacific nations known as the Quad group are gathering in Tokyo on Tuesday for talks that Japan hopes will increase their involvement in a regional initiative called “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” aimed at countering China's growing assertiveness.The meeting – the first in-person talks among the Foreign Ministers since the coronavirus pandemic broke out – brings together US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne, Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi.Japanese officials say they will discuss the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) initiative for greater security and economic cooperation that Japan and the US have been pushing to bring together “like-minded” countries that share concerns about China's growing assertiveness and influence.On his way to Tokyo, Pompeo told reporters that the four countries hope to have some “significant achievements” at the meeting, but did not elaborate.The talks come weeks ahead of the US presidential election and amid escalating tensions between the US and China over the virus, trade, technology, Hong Kong, Taiwan and human rights.Pompeo is attending the Quad meeting, though he cancelled subsequent planned visits to South Korea and Mongolia after President Donald Trump was hospitalised with the coronavirus.The talks follow a recent flare-up in tensions between China and India in eastern Ladakh.   Relations between Australia and China have also deteriorated in recent months.Japan, meanwhile, is concerned about China's claim to the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands, called Diaoyu in China, in the East China Sea. Japan also considers China's growing military activity to be a security threat.Japan's annual defence policy paper in July accused China of unilaterally changing the status quo in the South China Sea, where it has built and militarised manmade islands and is assertively pressing its claim to virtually all of the sea's key fisheries and waterways.New Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will make his in-person diplomatic debut when he attends part of the Quad meeting. He will also hold separate talks with Pompeo on deepening the Japan-US alliance and the FOIP.“The world is possibly becoming even more unpredictable and uncontrollable due to heightening selfish nationalism and growing tension between the US and China,” Suga said in an interview with Japanese media on Monday.He said he would pursue diplomacy that was based on the Japan-US alliance as a cornerstone and “strategically promote the FOIP”, while establishing stable relations with neighbours, including China and Russia.He said he also planned to promote the FOIP during a planned visit to Southeast Asia later this month.Suga replaced Shinzo Abe, who resigned due to poor health, on September 16, pledging to carry on Abe's hawkish diplomacy and security policies. Abe has been a driving force behind the FOIP. Japan sees it as crucial to have access to sea lanes all the way to Middle East, a key source of oil for the resource-poor island nation.Suga, a former chief Cabinet secretary, has little experience in diplomacy. Balancing between the US, Japan's main security ally, and China, its top trading partner, will be tough, says analysts.“The challenges of Japan-US relations are not in themselves, but in where Japan stands when US-China disputes intensify,” said Yasushi Watanabe, an expert on US diplomacy at Japan's Keio University.It would be best for Japan to take a pragmatic approach to China while maintaining the Japan-US alliance as a cornerstone,” he said.        “And it is indispensable for Japan to strengthen cooperation with the EU, Britain, Australia and ASEAN.”Japan hopes to regularise the Quad Foreign Ministers' talks and broaden their cooperation with other countries.That would be a major challenge for the Quad, said Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan.“A shared threat perception of China does not mean shared views on what to do and if it's possible to build the Quad into something along the lines of NATO,” he said.The US and Australia would favour the idea, but Japan and India are ambivalent and so is the ASEAN, he said. “Transforming the Quad into a collective security organisation targeting China forces governments to choose sides,” said Kingston.  “Beijing has generated an arc of anxiety in Asia but there is a preference for dialogue and negotiations, not saber rattling.” AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-australia-india-japan-to-discuss-chinas-growing-power-151427

05-10-2020||New Delhi||Retired judge moves SC seeking investigation into role of police officials in Hathras incident||A retired judge Monday moved the Supreme Court seeking an investigation into the role of police officials and registration of FIRs against them in connection with the Dalit woman who died a fortnight after being allegedly gang raped in Hathras district.The PIL filed by ex-judicial officer Chandra Bhan Singh alleged that “callousness and highhandedness” of the state administration and police officials in giving treatment to the victim led to her death and sought a probe by any agency other than affiliated to Uttar Pradesh government.A 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14. She died on September 29 at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital during treatment.The victim was cremated in the dead of the night near her home on September 30. Her family alleged they were forced by the local police to hurriedly conduct her last rites.Local police officers, however, said the cremation was carried out “as per the wishes of the family”.The state government has already recommended a CBI probe in the matter and quoting FSL reports, it has denied the rape charge.The petition filed through advocate Smarhar Singh, contended that visuals surfaced in electronic media shows that bones of the victim still scattered in the open field and there is a complete embargo on the press, media, any civilian, or even law maker to enter inside the village.“The conduct of the involved officials of the government administration is a penal offence hence prosecution should be launched against the erring Government officials. Since the perpetrators are the Police officials and the administration of the state, therefore, nothing can be hoped from the state authority, therefore the petitioner is constrained to file this petition,” the PIL said.The petition has also sought directions to get the statement of the mother, father and brother of the victim recorded before a Magistrate Under Section 164 CrPC.“Direct the investigating agency that in the event the allegation made by the family of the victim as reported widely in Print and Electronic media is found to be true then FIR be lodged against the erring respondents and all others whose involvement is found,” the plea said.

05-10-2020||---||In Shringla-Naravane visit to Myanmar, a subtle hint to China||New Delhi, October 5The unusual combination of Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and Chief of the Army Staff Gen MM Naravane ended its two-day visit to Myanmar with a subtle message to China.As Shringla and General Naravane went through the paces of calling on State Councilor Aung San Suu Kyi and Myanmar Army Chief Senior Gen Min Aung Hlaing, India also announced that it had opened a high tech IT center in Myitkyina.The significance of this town, closer to the China border, is not only that it is on Stillwell Road, now largely a rutted track, that snakes from Assam to China via Myanmar. The town is located just 60 km from Myitsone, the confluence of two rivers and the starting point of a now-junked Chinese project to build a huge, multipurpose dam.India was highly concerned after Myanmar awarded the dam to the Chinese but it has since been kept suspended with Beijing reportedly lobbying for its revival.The centre inaugurated by India with its advanced IT training modes, including conventional and virtual classrooms, is expected to be a magnet for the youth in this Kachin territory considered strategic as it is a bridge between Yunnan and north east India.  Shringla and General Naravane, accompanied by Indian envoy Saurabh Kumar, handed over 3,000 vials of Remdesivir to Suu Kyi as India has positioned itself as a reliable partner in Myanmar’s battle against Covid. They also discussed important bilateral issues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-shringla-naravane-visit-to-myanmar-a-subtle-hint-to-china-151417

Although, it is a good development, not all restaurants are geared up to re-open immediately. We expect only around 30 per cent of the restaurants to open starting Monday and the rest will re-open gradually through the month,” Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) senior vice-president Pradeep Shetty said in a statement.He said Mumbai restaurants are allowed to operate with only 33 per cent capacity and a lot of them are facing shortage of staff due to the problem of mobility.“Also, restaurants were shut completely for over six months so, therefore, interiors and other premises may need some renovation or maintenance. There is also the problem of finance. Over the last six months, restaurants had to dip into their savings for salary and utility payments,” Shetty added.Echoing the view, Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association (AHAR) president Shivanand Shetty said customers were supportive and patient as the standard operating procedures (SOP) were carried out to ensure their, as well as the staff’s safety.“We are overwhelmed by the support extended by our customers who chose to step out and gave us a chance to serve them again after a long time. As expected only 30-35 per cent restaurants reopened with most of them with only 30-40 per cent staff, limited menus, reduced timings, but we are hopeful that in 15 days things would be back to normal,” he said.All restaurant owners, who re-opened their properties for business, ensured compliance of the SOPs in maintaining temperature checking, social distancing, wearing of masks, noting down customer contact details among others.“We are thankful to the state government for this day and look forward to more support to help us get back on track,” Shetty added.On September 30, the Maharashtra government issued guidelines that allowed further relaxations outside containment zones, while extending the lockdown in the state till end of October.According to the state government guidelines, hotels, restaurants and bars were allowed to operate from October 5, with capacity not exceeding 50 per cent of the total staff.

05-10-2020||                                                                    Kolkata||WB police says personal enmity could be behind BJP leader’s murder||West Bengal Police hinted on Monday that personal enmity could be the reason behind the sensational murder last evening of a BJP leader in Titagarh near Kolkata. “A person was shot dead last evening in Titagarh area of Barrackpore. Police is investigating the crime and looking into all possible reasons including personal enmity because the victim was accused in some cases of murder and attempt of murder. Please do not jump on conclusion without proper investigation. Irresponsible comments on social media tantamount to interference in the investigation. Please refrain from this”, said a tweet posted by @WBPolice.  The police’s suggestion that the murder could have had a personal angle and its sly attempt to play up the murdered BJP functionary’s gory past has attracted strong condemnation from his party colleagues here.BJP MP from Barrackpore Arjun Singh, who was close to the murdered party functionary Manish Shukla, said that police were acting as if  it did not know that Shukla was a municipal councillor  and a vocal critic of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.“The Police and their political headmasters must answer who was responsible for Shukla’s murder”, Arjun told journalists today.“Instead of taking action against the murderers of BJP leader Manish Shukla in Titagarh, 24 North Parganas, WB police, on instructions, does what it does best - vilify the victim and issue veiled threats to civilians outraged by the cold-blooded murder”, tweeted Amit Malvya, head of the BJP’s IT Cell.Shukla was shot dead on Sunday evening, about 20 km from north Kolkata, when he was speaking with some locals and party workers near a police station. The BJP called for a 12-hour bandh (shutdown) in the Barrackpore area today, blaming the ruling Trinamool Congress for the killing.TMC denied the charge and blamed the incident on an internal feud within the BJP.Senior state BJP leaders including Kailash Vijayvargiya visited the slain party functionary’s home and demanded a CBI probe into the murder.Journalist-turned-BJP ideologue Swapan Dasgupta said 110 BJP functionaries had been killed in West Bengal in political violence over a short period of time.Alarmed by the murder, West Bengal Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar summoned the state home secretary and DGP to the Raj Bhavan this morning. Both officers ignored the Governor’s missive and did not report to the Raj Bhavan for the meeting. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also refused to discuss the issue with Dhankhar.“Alarming nosediving law and order scenario @MamataOfficial. Targeted political killings in spite of alert by Constitutional Head. Neither ACS Home nor DGP @WBPolice responded.  To CM  at 10.47 PM “Would like to speak to you urgently !”  Only silence  that speaks volumes”, a frustrated Dhankhar tweeted this morning.However, later in the day the newly appointed chief secretary Alapan Banerjee met the Governor at Raj Bhavan and the latter conveyed his concern to him.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wb-police-says-personal-enmity-could-be-behind-bjp-leaders-murder-151410

05-10-2020||New Delhi||Don’t vote for JD(U), BJP-LJP will form next govt in Bihar: Chirag Paswan||A day after walking out of the NDA in Bihar targeting Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) president Chirag Paswan appealed to people against voting for Kumar’s JD(U) and claimed that an alliance of his party and the BJP would come to power in the state after the Assembly polls.In an open letter, Paswan told the voters of Bihar that a vote for the Janata Dal (United) would force the migration of their children tomorrow as he sought their support for his party candidates in the three-phase poll starting October 28.The LJP on Sunday decided to put up its candidates against the JD(U) citing “ideological differences” with the party to assert that it would not accept Kumar’s leadership of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is the principal member of the NDA and it has already announced Kumar as the leader of the bloc in the state.“This is the most decisive moment in the history of the state of Bihar. It is a question of life and death of the 12 crore people of the state and we have no time to lose.... The road ahead is not easy for the LJP but we will fight and win too,” Paswan said.All LJP MLAs would work under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he added.The 37-year-old leader also made a reference to his ailing father, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, who has undergone a heart surgery at a private hospital in Delhi and is expected to remain hospitalised for some time.He spoke of his “Bihar first, Bihari first” vision document and said his father would be proud that his son has stuck to the issue he had raised through it.Citing his party’s differences with the JD(U), Paswan said be it the growing bureaucracy in Bihar, the ruling party’s treatment of its allies or its agenda, people’s grievances were not being addresses either by the officials or the Chief Minister.

05-10-2020||New Delhi||Congress alleges ‘witch-hunt’ after CBI raids Shivakumar; links it to Karnataka bypolls||The Congress on Monday accused the BJP of playing an “insidious game of intimidation” through its “puppet CBI” after the agency conducted raids against its Karnataka unit chief D K Shivakumar.The Opposition party questioned the timing of the raids as by-election to two assembly seats in Karnataka is to be held on November 3 and termed it as “witch-hunt” by the BJP against its political rivals.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the “raid raj” would not deter it from unearthing “corruption and maladministration” by the BJP governments.“The insidious game of intimidation and machinations of Modi-Yeddyurappa duo being executed by a puppet CBI by raiding DK Shivakumar won’t deter us. CBI should be unearthing the layers of corruption in the Yeddyurappa Government. But, ‘Raid Raj’ is their only ‘Machiavellian Move’!” he said on Twitter.Searches were held by the CBI at 14 locations linked to Shivakumar in Delhi, Karnataka and Maharashtra in connection with allegations of acquisition of disproportionate assets.Also read: CBI carries out searches at 14 locations linked to Karnataka Congress president ShivakumarState Congress leaders have hit out at the BJP governments at the Centre and in Karnataka for the CBI action, linking it to November 3 by-election to Sira and RR Nagar Assembly segments.Party workers protested against the CBI in front of Shivakumar’s residence and various places, calling the agency as an “agent of the BJP”.“Let the Modi and Yeddyurappa governments and BJP’s frontal organisations i.e. CBI-ED-Income Tax know that Congress workers and leaders will not be cowed down nor bow down before such devious attempts,” Surjewala also said.Congress spokesperson Sushmita Dev alleged that the BJP repeatedly used the central agencies to target Opposition leaders and questioned why no action had been taken against the family member of the chief minister over allegations of corruption.“Why is it that before every election, the moment an election or a by-election is ordered the CBI suddenly wakes up and starts these raids,” she asked.The BJP described as “ridiculous and meaningless” the protests by the Congress workers.The Karnataka BJP spokesperson, Captain Ganesh Karnik, said the CBI, the ED and the IT Department are institutions with functional autonomy to investigate and bring to justice financial and criminal fraudsters.“They are always on their job. The present raid is in continuation of investigations started by ED in 2017,” he said.Speaking in the same vein, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan rejected the charge that the CBI action was “politically motivated”, and asserted it had nothing to do with the November 3 by-election.Dev questioned the BJP over Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Na khaunga, na khane dunga” slogan, saying “what justification can it give to the nation about not investigating Chief Minister Yediyurappa’s family members”.“We want to ask the Central Bureau of Investigation that why is it that you always wake up before an election? Are you not acting as a stooge of this government,” she asked.The Congress leader alleged that the BJP was repeatedly using agencies to divert the attention of the nation.“We condemn this witch-hunt and the Congress Party stands by DK Shivakumar, who is nothing but a victim of an election that is due to happen in Karnataka,” she said.The CBI has registered a fresh case against Shivakumar based on a source information from another agency. The information relates to assets amassed during Shivakumar’s tenure as a minister in Karnataka, officials said.Shivakumar was arrested on September 23 last year by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money-laundering case and was lodged in the Tihar jail under judicial custody.The Congress leader was released from the jail on October 23 after the Delhi High Court granted him bail.

05-10-2020||Ballia (UP)||Rahul man of 'foreign mentality', should learn nationalism from nationalists: UP BJP MLA||BJP legislator from UP Surendra Singh hit back at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday, alleging that he is a man of "dual character" and "foreign mentality" and he should learn nationalism and the country's culture from "nationalists".Singh was reacting to Gandhi's tweet on his controversial statement on Saturday that "rapes can only be stopped if parents teach sanskar (values) to their daughters".Gandhi reacted to Singh's remark, saying on Sunday, "This is the filthy RSS male chauvinist mentality at work. Men do the raping but women need to be taught good values."  He had also tagged a newspaper report on Singh's statement in his tweet.On Monday, the BJP legislator from Bairia constituency, in Ballia district, responded to Gandhi and said the former Congress president "is totally ignorant" about the Indian culture."Rahul is a person of dual character and foreign mentality. He is totally ignorant about Indian culture," Singh told reporters at his residence. "He will understand the definition of nationalism if he takes tuition from nationalists. He could not understand the crux of the country's culture." "The dual characters of Rahul and Priyanka (Gandhi Vadra) became obvious during their journey to meet the victim's family in Hathras. While they were laughing during their journey, they shed tears at their homes," Singh claimed.The Congress leaders met the family on Saturday evening after an earlier attempt by them was scuttled by Uttar Pradesh authorities, who briefly detained them and other Congress workers in Greater Noida outside Delhi. They have declared that they will fight for justice to the Dalit woman who died a fortnight after being allegedly gang-raped on September 14.Speaking on the incidents of rape, the BJP legislator said, "Immoral works cannot be stopped till the head of the family - the father or the mother - don't monitor the activities of the daughter or the son." For a "cultured society", government and family support are necessary, Singh said, adding that he stands by his statement given earlier.Singh in his earlier statement had said, "It's the duty of all mothers and fathers to imbibe good values in their daughters and bring them up in a cultured environment. I am a teacher and MLA. Such incidents (like rape) can be stopped only with 'sanskar' not with governance or might."

05-10-2020||New Delhi||Rise in cases against sitting, ex-lawmakers; need strict monitoring, says report filed in SC||Criminal cases against sitting and former lawmakers have increased over the last two years and strict monitoring at the micro level is needed by high courts to ensure expeditious disposal of cases against them, the Supreme Court was informed on Monday.The total number of cases against sitting and former lawmakers is 4,859 as per a new report, while it was 4,442 in March 2020, the top court was apprised in a report filed before it."The number of cases pending against MPs/MLAs (sitting and former) has increased over the last two years despite monitoring for expeditious disposal in the present proceedings."It is, therefore, submitted that strict monitoring, at a micro-level, by the high courts, is necessary to ensure expeditious disposal of the cases against legislators," said the report filed by senior advocate Vijay Hansaria, assisted by advocate Sneha Kalita.The report has been submitted in a petition filed in 2016 by BJP leader and advocate Ashwini Upadhyay, and raised the issue of inordinate delay in disposal of criminal cases against former and sitting lawmakers.The report stated that some high courts favoured constitution of special courts in each district, both at sessions and magisterial level."Many other high courts have favoured trial by the respective jurisdictional courts with a mandate to take these cases on a priority basis. In some of the states, the high courts have recommended constitution of zone-wise special courts."The high courts have recommended the appointment of nodal prosecution officer and special public prosecutor for each of the court and have written to the state governments in this regard," the report said.All the high courts have favoured setting up of Safe and Secure Witness Examination Room with video-conference facility citing lack of infrastructure facilities and non-availability of funds for this, the amicus curiae told the court."No status report has been filed by the Union of India with respect to initiation and current stage of cases against the legislators pending before CBI, Enforcement Directorate and other central agencies, the grant of sanction and expected time for completion," the report said.There are 25 cases pending at sessions level and 62 at magistrate level in Delhi which include matters under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the like."The high court is considering establishing four special courts, two at sessions level and two at magistrate level. A suo motu writ petition has been registered to monitor the trials and directions have been issued to list pending matters before the respective benches of the high court," the report said.The report suggested that one special court at Bengaluru, which includes the number of cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, for the trial of 165 cases is not sufficient for disposal of cases.The witnesses have to travel from long distance for participating in the trial which will affect a fair trial, it said, adding that "this court may direct the high court to revisit its proposal to establish only one additional court at Bengaluru"."Instead, it will be more appropriate to assign cases to the respective jurisdictional courts with a mandate to try the cases on a priority basis. Other cases may be allotted to such courts only having regard to the workload," the report said.Referring to West Bengal, the report said one Special Court at Barasat, 24 North Parganas, is not sufficient for a trial of all 134 cases and if cases relate to different parts of the state, it will be inconvenient for witnesses to travel to Barasat to give evidence.The report suggested that the high court may be requested to establish more number of special courts.With regard to Tamil Nadu, the report of the high court shows that in 92 cases stay has been granted; however, the present action plan report does not indicate as to the steps taken for disposal of cases under stay.Regarding Uttar Pradesh, the report said the special court at Allahabad has 12 adjoining districts and has 300 cases and expeditious disposal may not be possible of these cases in one special court."Thus, high court may be requested to constitute special courts in the adjoining districts of Allahabad to lessen the burden of the special court at Allahabad."There are 85 cases of stay by the high court. The Chief Justice of the High Court may be requested to constitute a special bench(es) for these cases. The High Court has pointed out that in some cases the accused persons are in other districts/states, which is an obstacle in speedy disposal of cases," it said.The UP government may be directed to equip these courts electronically so that trial can proceed through video-conferencing without the physical presence of the accused, the report said.Pointing to the Kerala High Court's submission stating that “police personnel are reluctant to arrest and produce legislators”, the report said that it may be directed that the SP of the district concerned will be personally responsible for the execution of warrants."Similarly, if any legislator despite receipt of summons/warrant does not appear before the court, he/she will be liable for contempt of this court apart from disciplinary proceedings," it said.In Punjab and Haryana, the trial of eight cases in Haryana and 10 cases in Punjab has been stayed by the high court; however, the action plan does not show steps taken to list and dispose of such cases expeditiously, the report said.

05-10-2020||Naypyitaw||India gives 3,000 vials of Remdesivir to 'friendly' Myanmar to help fight Covid||As part of India's contribution to help "friendly neighbour" Myanmar in its fight against Covid, Army chief Gen MM Naravane and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Monday handed over 3,000 vials of Remdesivir to State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi.Gen Naravane and Shringla are here on a two-day visit to Myanmar from Sunday with an aim to further expand ties in a range of areas, including connectivity, defence and security.The Indian Army chief and the Foreign Secretary, along with Ambassador of India to Myanmar, Saurabh Kumar, called on Suu Kyi at Naypyitaw on Monday during which they discussed important bilateral issues, the Indian embassy tweeted."As part of India's contribution to help friendly neighbour Myanmar fight against COVID-19,” General Naravane and Shringla handed over 3,000 vials of Remdesivir to Suu Kyi, it said in another tweet.The intravenous antiviral drug, Remdesivir, is used to treat COVID-19. US President Donald Trump, who tested positive for COVID-19 last week, is also being administered Remdesivir.The visit by Gen Naravane and Shringla to Myanmar assumes significance as it comes in the midst of the Indian Army's bitter border standoff with the Chinese military in eastern Ladakh as well as restrictions on foreign visits due to the coronavirus pandemic.It is Gen Naravane's first visit to any foreign country after he took charge as the Chief of Army Staff on December 31 last year.Myanmar is one of India's strategic neighbours and shares a 1,640-km-long border with a number of north-eastern states, including militancy-hit Nagaland and Manipur.The visit by Gen Naravane and Shringla came four days after the two countries carried out a detailed review of their ties in a wide range of areas at a virtual meeting held under the framework of India-Myanmar foreign office consultations.In the meeting, Shringla said India and Myanmar are working towards operationalising the Sittwe Port by the first quarter of next year and that the tendering process for 69 bridges proposed under the ambitious India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway would begin soon.Sittwe Port is part of the Kaladan multi-modal transit transport project which is being viewed as India's gateway to Southeast Asia. The port will connect India's landlocked north-eastern region with the Bay of Bengal through Mizoram.In his remarks, Shringla said that Myanmar's handing over of 22 Indian insurgents had been deeply appreciated by India and sent a strong message of "deterrence to inimical elements on both sides".India has been concerned over some militant groups from the North-East region taking shelter in Myanmar. The country has been assuring India that it would not allow any insurgent group to use its territory against India.In June 2015, the Indian Army had carried out an operation in areas near the Indo-Myanmar against the NSCN (K) militants, days after the ultras had killed 18 Army men in Manipur.The two countries have significantly ramped up defence and security cooperation in the last few years, including in the maritime security sphere.India has been assisting Myanmar in developing border areas under an agreement inked in 2012 that provided for granting USD 5 million each year over a period of five years. This MoU has already been extended till 2022.India's development cooperation in Myanmar is estimated at USD 1.4 billion.The two countries are also expanding partnership in the area of energy cooperation.With investments of over USD 1.2 billion, Myanmar has the highest Indian investment in any country in South Asia, a source said.Recently, India approved an investment of over USD 120 million in the Shwe Oil and Gas project.

05-10-2020||Mumbai||Bombay High Court closes arguments on Kangana's plea, reserves order||The Bombay High Court on Monday closed all arguments and reserved its verdict on the petition filed by actor Kangana Ranaut against the demolition of a part of her bungalow in Mumbai by the city civic body.A bench of Justices SJ Kathawalla and RI Chagla conducted hearings on the plea last week before closing it for orders on Monday.Ranaut approached the high court on September 9 after the demolition of a part of her bungalow in Pali Hill area here by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).She had sought that the demolition be declared illegal and the court direct BMC to pay her Rs 2 crore as damages.Ranaut, through her counsel Birendra Saraf, had alleged that the BMC carried out the demolition out of malice following a comment she made against the Mumbai police that irked the Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra.She also cited an alleged threat given to her by Shiv Sena's chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut in an interview.Saraf told the HC during previous hearings that the demolition was carried out on September 9, the same day as the interview.The BMC's counsel, Anil Sakhre, Joel Carlos and Aspi Chinoy, had, however, denied the actor's allegations.They said the BMC had simply been performing its statutory duty in demolishing such portions of the bungalow that Ranaut had altered illegally.In an affidavit filed through Carlos, the civic body alleged that despite making illegal structural changes, Ranaut had approached court for relief.This was an abuse of the process of law, the BMC said and urged the HC to dismiss her plea and impose a cost on her.Raut also told the court through his counsel Pradeep Thorat that the BMC's action had nothing to do with his interview or any other comments made on Ranaut.During the previous hearings, the bench questioned the BMC's swiftness in demolishing Ranaut's property.It also stayed the demolition through an interim order and noted that had the BMC shown similar swiftness in all cases of illegal construction, Mumbai would have been a very different city.The court had also asked Raut if it befitted a parliamentarian to use ungraceful language against a citizen."Don't you have any grace?" the HC asked after viewing a clip of the interview where Raut asked "what is law", responding to a question on if he would take legal action against Ranaut for having compared Mumbai to PoK in a tweet.The HC on Monday also accepted written submissions from Saraf and the BMC summing up their arguments before closing the matter for orders.

There is no question that in case of any conflict, China can get the better of us.” His reply came when asked how well prepared the IAF was in Ladakh.Asked if India's estimation of China was correct, the IAF Chief said the adversary could not be underestimated as it had made huge investment in military technology."Their strength lies in surface-to-air systems they have put up in the area. They have long missile systems. We cater to those in our matrix... we can take on that threat."Answering another question whether the military was surprised by Chinese aggression in Ladakh, he said, “We acted swiftly and it will not be correct to say we were surprised... We do hope the talks between the military commanders progress on expected lines. The current progress (by China) is an effort to dig on for the winter... we too are taking actions to step up air assets."Asked if China could use Pakistan air bases, the IAF Chief said it would mean a collusive threat and the force was ready to tackle it.   On the possibility of a two-front threat, he said, “We are aware they are cooperating closely  There is significant threat, but so far there is no such indication that they are colluding for a two-front war.”On Rafale, he said it had provided the IAF a technological edge. “It gives the ability to strike first and strike deep and hard even in a contested air space,” he said.About the delivery schedule of Rafale, he said five planes were expected beginning November. Next year, the first squadron would  be ready and by 2023, both the squadrons (36 planes) would  be ready and inducted, he said.On the role of drones, the IAF Chief said drones were useful in the build-up to the conflict. On the specifics of armed drones, which India is looking to buy from US company General Atomics, he said, “Attack drones have been successful, some will succeed and some will fall to enemy action. We have worked to find the right mix of having armed drones within the overall firepower.""A war cannot be won through armed drones alone. We will take the final decision keeping in mind all aspects," he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-well-positioned-to-take-on-china-says-iaf-chief-ahead-of-air-force-day-151350

05-10-2020||---||Loan Moratorium: SC seeks further clarification from Centre, RBI||New Delhi, October 5The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre and the RBI to file an additional affidavit bringing on record relevant policy decisions and guidelines consequent to the decision of waiving ‘interest on interest’ charged on loans of up to Rs 2 crore for “most vulnerable” borrowers during the six-month moratorium due to COVID-19.“The Union of India and the Reserve Bank of India may also file counter affidavit in other writ petitions where certain additional issues have been raised,” a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said, adding, they should also give their response with regard to different sectors’ grievances highlighted by different writ petitioners.The Bench gave a week to all stakeholders to respond to Centre's affidavit that sought to waive ‘interest on interest’ charged on loans of up to Rs 2 crore, irrespective of whether they availed of the moratorium or not.The top court also asked the government to produce the Kamath Committee Report and posted the matter for further hearing on October 13.The order came after counsel representing individual petitioners, banks and the real estate sector sought time to file their response.During the hearing, the Bench pointed out that the Centre’s affidavit didn't deal with several issues arising in the case and no consequential circular had been issued either by the RBI or any other authority."Our earlier order was for filing of the affidavit along with the decisions taken by the RBI and different banks," the Bench said while asking the government and the RBI to indicate the same in the additional affidavit to be filed within a week.As Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, said compound interest waiver would put an extra burden of several lakh crore on the government, CREDAI counsel complained that no loan restructuring had been given to the Real Estate sector and from September 1 builders would have to pay full interest on loans.The Finance Ministry had said the concession would be given to eight categories, including housing, education, MSMEs, consumer durable, credit card dues, auto, personal, and consumption loans, irrespective of whether a borrower availed of moratorium or not.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/loan-moratorium-sc-seeks-further-clarification-from-centre-rbi-151346
05-10-2020||New Delhi/Bengaluru||CBI registers disproportionate assets case against Congress leader DK Shivakumar; conducts raids||The CBI has registered a case against Karnataka Congress chief DK Shivakumar for allegedly amassing disproportionate assets worth Rs 74.93 crore and carried out searches at 14 locations on Monday during which the agency claimed to have recovered Rs 57 lakh cash, officials said.The case was registered after a seven-month-long preliminary enquiry looking into disproportionate assets of Shivakumar amassed in his and his family members’ name during his tenure as a minister in the Karnataka government, the CBI alleged.This is the first case by the CBI against Shivakumar, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee President and an MLA, who was earlier arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in a case of alleged money laundering, they said.The Congress hit out at the BJP-led central government, accusing it of “witch-hunt”, and linked the CBI action to the November 3 by-election in two assembly seats in Karnataka.The BJP rejected the charges and said Shivakumar should answer the agencies on the source of his assets.After registering the case under IPC sections related to criminal conspiracy and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the CBI teams searched at 14 locations spread across Karnataka, Maharashtra and Delhi.Nine locations in Karnataka, four in Delhi and one in Mumbai were searched by the CBI which also included the residence of Shivakumar at Safdarjung Enclave and that of his brother DK Suresh, a member of parliament, in Kaveri Apartments in the national capital and their residences in Bengaluru, they said.“Searches were conducted today at 14 locations including Karnataka, Delhi, Mumbai at the premises of said MLA (Shivakumar) and others which led to the recovery of cash of Rs 57 lakh(approx) and several incriminating documents including property documents, bank related information, computer hard disk, etc. Investigation is continuing,” CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said in a statement.Shivakumar, who was appointed chief of the Congress’ Karnataka state unit in March this year, had been a minister in the Siddaramaiah Government of the Congress as well as the JDS-Congress Government led by HD Kumaraswamy.The CBI action drew flak from Congress leaders who questioned its timing as the by-election to Sira and R R Nagar assembly segments in Karnataka is to be held on November 3.Party workers protested against the CBI in front of Shivakumar’s residence in Bengaluru and various places in the state.Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala termed it “raid raj” and a “Machiavellian move” by the BJP government.“The insidious game of intimidation & machinations of Modi-Yeddyurappa duo being executed by a puppet CBI by raiding @DKShivakumar won’t deter us.“CBI should be unearthing the layers of corruption in Yeddyurappa Govt. But, ‘Raid Raj’ is their only ‘Machiavellian Move’!,” Surjewala said on Twitter.“Let Modi & Yeddyurappa Govts & BJP’s frontal organizations i.e CBI-ED-Income Tax know that Congress workers & leaders will not be cowed down nor bow down before such devious attempts. Our resolve to fight for people & expose BJP’s maladministration only becomes stronger,” he tweeted.Congress Legislature Party leader Siddaramaiah alleged that the BJP “has always tried to indulge in vindictive politics and mislead public attention”.“The latest CBI raid on @KPCCPresident @DKShivakumar’s house is another attempt to derail our preparation for bypolls. I strongly condemn this,” he tweeted.Congress spokesperson A S Ponnanna, who is also a senior advocate of the Karnataka High Court, questioned the searches, claiming that it was against the direction of the court.“I’m surprised politics is down to this level... CBI has to function under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, under which if they have to come to a state and investigate, they have to get permission from the state government, the permission that was given has been questioned by Shivakumar,” he said.“The court had said do not precipitate, what I have understood from this is- they (CBI) should have not have acted.“They should have got it vacated from the court and acted, after permission from the court,” Ponnanna, who served as an additional advocate general during the Congress government, said, adding that the investigation should be fair and lawful.Countering the allegations, BJP National General Secretary C T Ravi said Shivakumar should cooperate with the CBI in its investigation.Ravi, a former Karnataka minister, said, “The CBI is doing its work. If the Congress leader is clean, he should cooperate and tell the truth”.He also sought to know if Shivakumar’s economic growth was natural as his assets grew “from Rs 75 crore in 2008 to Rs 250 crore in 2013 and Rs 840 crore in 2018”.“You can respond to political issues standing in the street, but about the illegal acquisition of money or illegal transfer of money, one has to respond to CBI or ED,” the BJP leader said.“There is no problem in making assets, but one needs to reveal the source of the money. If crores of rupees are kept in the name of his daughter who is still studying, he ought to respond to the CBI,” Ravi added.Earlier, the ED had arrested Shivakumar in September last year on charges of money laundering. He was released from jail on October 23 after the Delhi High Court granted him bail. The PMLA case against him and others was slapped on the basis of a charge sheet (prosecution complaint) filed by the Income Tax Department in 2018 before a special court in Bengaluru on charges of alleged tax evasion and hawala transactions worth crores.The I-T department has accused Shivakumar and his alleged associates of transporting a huge amount of unaccounted cash regularly through ‘hawala’ channels with the help of three other accused.The former Karnataka cabinet minister played an instrumental role in ensuring the safe stay of Gujarat Congress MLAs in a Karnataka resort during the Rajya Sabha polls in 2017 amid allegations that the BJP was trying to poach them.Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s political secretary Ahmed Patel had fought the Rajya Sabha election from Gujarat in 2017 and Shivakumar had hosted 44 Gujarat Congress MLAs at the resort to keep the flock together.The ED had questioned his daughter Aishwarya too in this case after she was summoned to appear in Delhi.

We did not even see her face. I collected the ashes on grounds of humanity because it must have been someone's body if not my sister's and I did not want the ashes to be trampled upon," said that victim's brother.The cremation took place around 3 a.m. on September 30.The brother further said that they will not submit to a narco-polygraph test as they are not the ones who are lying."They should conduct these truth tests on the accused and the policemen who are trying to twist the narrative," he said.It has been six days since the girl, who died after being allegedly assaulted by four upper caste men in her village, was cremated by the police without the presence of the family, according to the victim's kin.The cremation spot is a small clearing in the middle of a millet field in the village.The 19-year-old has two brothers and two sisters.The family is upset at the fact that no action has yet been taken against District Magistrate Praveen Laxar, who allegedly misbehaved with the family and even threatened them."We have complained against the district magistrate to everyone who has visited us but no action has been taken against him," he said.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hathras-family-says-will-not-immerse-ashes-until-confirmed-they-were-of-their-daughter-151336
05-10-2020||Kolkata||BJP leader shot dead in West Bengal; Vijayvargiya demands CBI inquiry||A local BJP leader in West Bengal was shot dead on Sunday by two motorcyclists near Titagarh in North 24 Parganas district, police said.The duo opened fire at Manish Shukla, a local councillor, on BT Road at night, following which he was taken to a private hospital, where he was declared brought dead, they said.The BJP leadership blamed the Trinamool Congress for the incident, but the ruling party has rubbished the accusation.Also read: WB Guv slams state govt after home secy, DGP fail to turn up despite summons over BJP leader’s killing"It is shameful that the TMC has now started politics of annihilation of political opponents. We don't have any faith in local police as this happened in front of the police station. We want a CBI inquiry," BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said.BJP MP Arjun Singh also held the TMC responsible for Shukla's "killing" and claimed that shots were fired at him from a carbine.Shukla, who switched over to the saffron party last year, was considered to be close to Singh.Senior TMC leader Nirmal Ghosh said the incident was a result of infighting within the BJP and allegations against his party were baseless.A huge police contingent was rushed to the spot after Shukla was gunned down around 9.30 pm."We have started an investigation and will look at all possible angles," a police officer said.The BJP has called a 12-hour bandh in Barrackpore area on Monday in protest against the incident.Meanwhile, Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar expressed concern over the law and order situation in the state and summoned the Additional Chief Secretary, Home, and the DGP on Monday morning."ACS Home @MamataOfficial and DGP @WBPolice have been summoned at 10 am tomorrow in the wake of worsening law and order situation leading to the dastardly killing of Manish Shukla, Councillor, Titagarh Municipality in political party office," Dhankhar said in a tweet.

A subsequent clause makes it clear that the targets are ruling communist parties in “totalitarian regimes”, such as China, Cuba and North Korea. The policy says the norm applies to members of a single political party, “organised on a dictatorial basis, with so close an identity with its governmental policies that the party and the government constitute an indistinguishable unit”. No communist party in India makes that cut.“Membership or affiliation is a question of fact for the officer to determine," says the policy. A person will be found inadmissible only if there is oral or written testimony or a document containing information about current or previous membership.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-bars-communists-but-new-norms-not-applicable-to-india-151211

Twenty-one state and UTs, on the other hand, have accepted the arrangement offered by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.The pandemic has affected states, increasing their dependence on GST compensation as against internal revenue generation. The situation is particularly dire for Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Chhattisgarh.Bid to bridge compensation shortfallOne of the rare examples of a consensus-driven approach since its inception, Monday’s GST Council is expected to see non-BJP ruled states demand that the Centre should borrow on their behalf to meet the shortfall. Battle lines have hardened, as the Centre, on the strength of legal advice from Attorney General KK Venugopal, believes that it cannot borrow for the states on the basis of the security of the tax it does not own.The crux of the matter is that the Centre has been unable to pay states Rs 2.35 lakh crore. However, it says it is obliged to pay only Rs 97,000 crore, as the remaining shortfall of Rs 1.38 lakh crore is due to the Covid pandemic.At the last GST Council meeting on August 27, the Centre gave two options: Borrow Rs 97,000 crore from a special RBI window or lift Rs 2.35 lakh crore entirely from the market. The CMs or Finance Ministers of Punjab, West Bengal, Kerala, Delhi, Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have already opposed both options.On the other hand, states and UTs run by the BJP and its allies have agreed to the option of borrowing Rs 97,000 crore through a special window. But they too have sought some tweaks in the arrangement.The Centre expects to collect only Rs 65,000 crore as cess as against the requirement of Rs 3 lakh crore this year, leaving a gap of Rs 2.35 lakh crore, assuming 10 per cent year-on-year revenue growth.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oppn-ruled-states-to-oppose-borrowing-option-at-gst-meet-151209

Images of Rahul and his sister Priyanka in the middle of “dhakka mukki” with the police went viral, leading to critical comments on social media.Former Kerala CM Oommen Chandy sought to draw parallel with Indira Gandhi’s visit on an elephant to Belchi in Bihar to sympathise with Dalit families after a massacre. That visit revived her political fortunes to bounce back from the humiliating defeat in 1977.While the BJP and its supporters were swift to remind that there should be no politics on the death, the thin line gets breached when there is an attempt by the Opposition to become the voice of the people on issues that arouse anger, especially when the state comes down with its might.The Congress seeks to keep the pressure on and have announced a day of ‘Satyagrah’ on October 5 in the state and district headquarters across the country and silent sit-in at Mahatma Gandhi/Ambedkar statutes against the “brutal and arbitrary actions” of the UP Government.Congress workers would hope that Rahul’s stir does not end up as a “cameo role”, as was described by a former Union Minister from the state, after Rahul rode pillion on a bike to western UP’s Bhatta Parsaul village in solidarity with farmers agitating against acquisition of their land nine years ago.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/on-agitation-path-rahul-priyanka-stir-cong-cadre-in-up-151207

This will also check the migration of people from Lahaul and Spiti during the harsh winter months.Editorial: Atal Tunnel opens: Start of a new chapter beyond RohtangGenerally, 70 per cent of the people of Lahaul and Spiti would leave the district from November to April as they remained cut off from the rest of the world due to the closure of the 13,058-foot-high Rohtang Pass, the gateway to Lahaul on the Manali-Leh highway.All-weather link Now, the Lahaul valley has got an all-weather connectivity between Manali (Kullu) and Keylong (Lahaul and Spiti) via the tunnel and the travel distance has been reduced to 74 km from 120 km. Earlier, the road link to Lahaul from Manali was only via the Rohtang Pass, which is officially closed for traffic from November 15 till mid-May or June every year.Mohan Lal Relingpa, a resident of Lahaul, said: “Atal Tunnel has come as a blessing for Lahaul residents. The tunnel has brought light to the lives of tribal people in the district.” Sanjiv Kumar, another resident of the valley, said: “The tunnel will play a crucial role in checking the migration of people from Lahaul and Spiti during winter. Now, tourism will also pick up in the valley.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/atal-tunnel-will-check-winter-migration-151205

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda were present.Postal ballot for elderly, disabledThe Election Commission on Sunday came out with a set of new instructions to make it more convenient for the elderly and persons with disabilities to exercise the postal ballot option. It has appointed two expenditure observers for the Bihar Assembly elections. The postal ballot would be delivered at the residence of all those aged above 80 years and people with disabilities by the booth-level officer. TNSThe BJP may now end up contesting a larger chunk of seats than the JD-U, which also has to accommodate Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM(S) from its quota of seats. Amid speculation over a “fixed match” between the BJP and LJP, the latter gave a hint with its public assurance of support to the BJP in case “it forms the government in Bihar under its own CM”.The LJP said it would contest 143 seats, mostly the ones the JD-U was contesting. “Owing to ideological differences with the JD-U, we have decided to contest the Assembly elections independently,” the LJP said, adding that it would not contest under Nitish Kumar.At the same time, it also said it would continue to be part of the NDA at the Centre, citing instances when allies contested against each other, including in Jharkhand where the LJP contested independent of the NDA. “LJP legislators will strengthen the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” it assured. Political observers who see it as a “fixed match” between the LJP and BJP say Nitish Kumar is facing “massive anti-incumbency and possible loss of ground because of his handling of Covid situation, floods and migrants.”Will contest 143 seats, mostly against JD-U||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ljp-walks-out-of-nda-in-bihar-but-ready-to-back-bjp-led-govt-151200

Senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan said: “As per the Supreme Court, no one can be forced to take a narco test. A narco test is akin to torture and is totally unconstitutional. The CM and his SIT continue to mock the rule of law.”Accused ‘defended’A meeting at the house of former BJP MLA Rajvir Singh Pehalvan in Hathras ‘defended’ the accused and sought an FIR against the victim’s family.

He should be suspended and his role in the matter probed.BSP chief Mayawati also demanded the DM’s removal. “The state has agreed to a CBI probe, but if the DM stays here, how can an impartial probe be conducted?” asked Mayawati. SP, RLD and Bhim Army leaders visited Hathras today, with SP and RLD alleging resistance by cops.A meeting was held outside the house of former BJP MLA Rajvir Singh Pehalvan where they allegedly defended the accused. One of the organisers of the meeting and Pehalvan’s son Manveer denied that the gathering comprised upper caste people and claimed they were from “different sections of society”.“The entire scenario has been created to blame the government. The accused persons are in favour of any type of inquiry. But the victims are changing their stand every now and then.
