11-10-2020||Jaipur||Second arrest in Karauli priest case; BJP leader Kapil Mishra meets victim’s family||A second arrest was made on Sunday in connection with the Karauli incident where a priest died after allegedly being set afire by landgrabbers.Controversial BJP leader Kapil Mishra met the family members of the victim at Bukana village and offered them Rs 25 lakh as assistance collected from the public.The incident which occurred on Wednesday has triggered a war of words between the BJP and the Congress, which is in power in the state.Police arrested Dilkhush alias Dillu in the priest murder case, Hindaun Deputy Superintendent of Police Kishori Lal Mehrania said.On Saturday, accused Kailash Meena was taken into custody.He said both the accused were arrested under IPC Section 302 (murder).Mishra, who has been mired in a controversy over his speeches made in the days before the Northeast Delhi riots in February, consoled the family members of priest Babu Lal Vaishnav and promised them all possible help.“It is a very painful incident, and I feel that no one should see such kind of suffering,” Mishra told the reporters after meeting the priest’s family.He said Rs 25 lakh would be transferred to the account of the priest’s kin.“We will not only give financial help to the family but have also given a promise to hold their hand and make them stand on their feet again so that they can move forward,” the former AAP MLA said.Vaishnav was attacked on Wednesday and died at the SMS Hospital a day later.It is alleged that five people, who were trying to occupy cultivated land near the temple, set him ablaze after spraying petrol.The priest was cremated on Saturday after his family relented following an assurance from the administration on their demands.The Congress on Sunday said those making comparisons between the incidents in Hathras and Karauli were doing so for “vested political interests”.It said while justice was not done in Uttar Pradesh, prompt action was taken in Rajasthan.In UP’s Hathras, a 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men on September 14 and she succumbed to injuries at a Delhi hospital a fortnight later.Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had met the family members of the Hathras victim.The BJP had hit out at the Congress over incidents of crime in Rajasthan, saying law and order in the state has “gone for a toss” and asked Rahul Gandhi to pay attention to it instead of visiting BJP-ruled states for “political tourism”.Asked about the two incidents at a press conference in Delhi, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said, “Let me be very clear that to compare as is being done by innuendo and insinuation by vested political interests, between Karauli and Hathras, is to make a mockery of justice.”“Every murder, and it is the highest crime in our penal book, is despicable, dastardly and must be condemned, be it Hathras and be it Karauli. But that is not the point. Did you have a midnight cremation in Karauli? Answer is ‘No’. Did you have it in UP? Answer is ‘Yes’....“One is justice, one is injustice. So before you make comparisons, search your soul and don’t think the people of India are fools,” Singhvi said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/second-arrest-in-karauli-priest-case-bjp-leader-kapil-mishra-meets-victims-family-154320
11-10-2020||Jodhpur||SIT formed to probe Jodhpur teen’s suspicious death||A fresh investigation has been ordered into the suspicious death of a 16-year-old girl in Rajasthan’s Jodhpur district last month, police said on Sunday.The Government Railway Police (GRP) had registered a case of suicide on the basis of a note found with the teenager, who was found dead on the railway track in Lohawat subdivision, over 110 km north of Jodhpur city, on September 21.But her mother had given a complaint to the GRP, alleging that the girl was raped and murdered. The family had demanded an investigation and also accused the police of hushing up the case. They had also refused to accept the body for cremation, but later relented.A fresh inquiry has been ordered by Director General (Crime) ML Lathar and a special investigative team constituted, a police official said.Factors like the medical report, forensic report of the ‘suicide note’, timing of any train passing from the track and call details of the deceased’s mobile phone will be analysed, police said.The official added that a fair investigation would be carried out considering all the aspects of the case and allegations.The GRP had found a purported suicide note in the girl’s pocket where she blamed her mother, sisters and a neighbour for taking such a step.However, the mother alleged that a person named Mahipal Bishnoi and others raped and killed her daughter, and dropped the body on the railway track with a note to give it a shape of suicide.“There were marks of bite, nails and scratch injuries on her body,” she said. “If call details of her mobile phone are checked, the truth will come out.”            According to the complaint, Bishnoi had called the girl and asked her to come out to see him. He threatened that if she did not come, he would kill her and her family members.The teenager finally left out of fear and she was found dead the next day, her mother had said in the complaint.Murlidhar Vaishnav, a retired judge who took up the case with higher authorities to support to the family, claimed that the girl’s both legs were broken and her body was recovered even before any train passed from the track.“This is a clear indication that she had been killed elsewhere and brought on the railway track later,” he alleged.

11-10-2020||New Delhi||Depression over Bay of Bengal delays withdrawal of monsoon: IMD||The southwest monsoon is unlikely to withdraw from the rest of the country until next week, further extending the rainfall season, the India Meteorological Department said on Sunday.The ongoing depression over the Bay of Bengal --- a cyclonic circulation --- is likely to intensify into a deep depression during the next 24 hours and cross north Andhra Pradesh coast between Narsapur and Vishakhapatnam during the night of October 12.Besides Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the system will also bring rains over Telangana, north interior Karnataka, central Maharashtra and Vidarbha, and south Odisha on October 13.“There are very little chances of further withdrawal of the southwest monsoon until next week due to the ongoing depression,” IMD director general Mrutunjay Mohapatra said.The first week of October also saw formation of one low pressure area.The official rainfall season in the country is from June 1 to September 30. This season, the country received above normal rainfall for the second consecutive year.The normal withdrawal date of monsoon from west Rajasthan is September 17. However, this year the monsoon retreated from parts of west Rajasthan and Punjab on September 28, 11 days after its normal withdrawal date.The monsoon usually withdraws from large parts of Karnataka and Telangana and parts of Andhra Pradesh by October 15. It also marks the commencement of northeast monsoon which brings rains over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.By the first week of October, the monsoon had withdrawn from several parts of north India, parts of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.“The withdrawal line of the southwest monsoon continues to pass through Faizabad, Fatehpur, Nowgong, Rajgarh, Ratlam, Vallabh Vidyanagar and Porbandar,” the IMD’s bulletin said on Sunday.The withdrawal of monsoon from the country was delayed even last year.“There has been a trend that the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon is getting delayed. Also, after the monsoon hits Kerala, it has been observed that its progress over north India has slowed,” M Rajeevan, secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences said.From this year, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has revised the onset date of monsoon over some parts of the country and also the withdrawal date from west Rajasthan. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/depression-over-bay-of-bengal-delays-withdrawal-of-monsoon-imd-154302

The central government has sent an invitation to members of all 29 farmer organisations for another meeting in New Delhi at 11.30 am on October 14,” they said. With farmers’ agitation gaining momentum with every passing day, official sources said the Centre was “keen to hear the side and put forth its views on the matter”. At a meeting with union ministers Rajnath Singh and Narendra Singh Tomar last week, one of the key concerns expressed by leading farmers’ leaders was regarding the MSP. While they demanded that the MSP be factored in legislation, they also wanted purchase below the support price to be made a punishable offence.While asserting that MSP was there to stay, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said making purchase below MSP a punishable offence will hamper the functioning of the market  and adversely affect the farmers. “If the quality of grains is not good the buyer will turn him back. But today the farmer is at least able to sell on negotiated price,” he also told the farmers leaders. Regarding apprehensions that the MSP will be done away with the government has been categorical that it will continue in future.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-invites-agitating-farmers-organisations-for-talks-on-october-14-154301

11-10-2020||New Delhi||Kejriwal to launch spraying of anti-stubble burning solution on Tuesday||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will on Tuesday launch the spraying of anti-stubble burning solution in Delhi’s Ghalib Pur village, Environment Minister Gopal Rai said on Sunday.“So far, we have received applications to spray the anti-stubble burning solution on nearly 1,500 acres of land where non-basmati rice is grown,” he said.              Scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, PUSA, have developed “bio-decomposer” capsules, which are used to prepare a liquid formulation. The solution, when sprayed in the fields, can decompose crop residue and turn it into manure.A centralised bio-decomposer system has been set up in Kharkhari Nahar village in southwest Delhi. This year, the Delhi government is going to use the solution on the land where non-basmati rice is grown. “We have estimated that only Rs 20 lakh is needed to manage stubble in 800 hectares of agricultural land in Delhi through this solution. It includes the cost of preparation, transportation and spraying,” he said. If this proves to be successful in Delhi, it can be a good solution to the issue of stubble burning in neighbouring states too, he said. Rai said the contribution of farm fires in neighbouring states to Delhi’s pollution goes up to 44 per cent during the harvesting season.

11-10-2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala’s 11,755 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday higher than daily count of Maharashtra, Karnataka||From just a solitary new COVID-19 case on May 8 to clocking over 10,000 fresh infections in a single-day, Kerala has seen a total reverse in the pandemic situation in the last five months.The 11,755 cases recorded on Saturday turned out to be the biggest ever single-day surge in the state and also surpassed the daily tally of Maharashtra and Karnataka, among the high case load states, for the day.Maharashtra, which is leading the states in total infections, on Saturday reported 11,416 new cases while Karnataka added 10,517 cases.Kerala, which won global praise for its strategy in containing the spread of the pandemic in the initial months after reporting the first COVID-19 case in the country in January, has been witnessing a sharp spike in new infections since last month.The increase was, though, on expected lines as experts had predicted that the state was likely to witness a steep rise in the months of August and September with the daily infections forecast to touch between 10,000 and 20,000.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had on Saturday said October-November months were crucial and cautioned people to strictly follow the health protocol to reduce death rates.The country’s first coronavirus case was detected in the state on January 30 after a woman medical student from Wuhan returned. The second and third cases were also Wuhan returnees, but it effectively checked any large scale spread then while the three also recovered.From January-March, the state had 499 cases, out of which 33 per cent was through local transmission and there were three deaths. Case fatality rate at that time was 0.5 per cent.When the lockdown was declared on March 24, the government got some time to improve its health system and up to May 3 there were no other cases.“The whole world looked at us and asked us the method to flatten the graph”, Health Minister KK Shailaja said.After May 4, things changed as the lockdown was eased and people started returning to the state from abroad, mainly Gulf, and other states. Nine lakh people have returned to the state since then, she said.On May 8, after reporting a solitary case and with just 16 people under treatment, Kerala had announced it had flattened the COVID-19 curve.Five months later on October 7, Kerala’s fresh infections crossed 10,000-mark for the first time and on Friday, it saw an addition of 9,250 cases. The total infection count mounted to 2,77,855 on Saturday and active cases stood at 95,918.The celebrations during the Onam festival and the political protests held without following COVID-19 protocol have been cited by the government among the reasons for the growth in cases.A total of 978 people have lost their lives to the deadly virus with the capital Thiruvananthapuram accounting for 306.Of those who succumbed, 699 were in the 60 plus age group, 234 in 41-59 and 42 in the 18-40 age group.Kerala’s 83.8 per cent cases are due to contact and 13.39 per cent have nil travel history and the remaining were travellers and returnees.The silverlining is that the case fatality rate, which was 0.77 per cent in May, has been brought down to 0.37 per cent in September.Dr Amar Fettle, state Nodal officer for COVID, said though there was a steady increase in cases, the recoveries were also happening.The people were lowering their guard and this will lead to increase in absolute cases.

11-10-2020||Deoria (UP)||Congress woman worker roughed up at party meet in UP; State unit orders probe||A Congress worker was roughed up by her colleagues at a party meet in Deoria after she alleged that a “rapist” had been given the ticket for the assembly by-election, prompting the party to order a probe into the incident and expel two party workers for indiscipline.As the videos of the ugly scenes at the meeting held on Saturday went viral, an embarrassed state unit of the Congress termed it as a “political conspiracy” to defame the party.The woman, Tara Yadav, lodged a police complaint against four office-bearers of the party, including the district president, for allegedly beating and molesting her.According to eyewitnesses, Yadav allegedly tried to “manhandle” party secretary Sachin Naik, and also hurled a bouquet towards him during the meeting on Saturday.Yadav was protesting over the party nominating Mukund Bhaskar Mani for the November 3 by-polls, accusing him of being a rapist, a charge denied by him.As she hurled a bouquet towards Sachin Naik, angry workers allegedly roughed up Yadav and whisked her out of the meeting venue, the eyewitnesses claimed.“A police complaint has been received. The matter is being probed. However, no case has been registered so far,” SHO Kotwali Chandrabhan Singh said.Yadav, who claimed to be associated with the party for four years, said she was only questioning the choice of candidate and never expected that the party members would react in such a manner.“You have given the ticket to a rapist, and this has tarnished the image of Congress. You could have given the ticket to someone else. As I said this, I was pushed by someone from behind. Can I not even put forth my point of view. These people want to destroy the Congress and end it,” Yadav said.Meanwhile, in a statement issued on Sunday, the UP Congress said, “In the context of by-polls to the Deoria assembly constituency, a meeting was held at the party office in Deoria on October 10. In this meeting, Deendayal Yadav and Ajay Kumar Sainthwar indulged in indiscipline, and have been expelled from the party with immediate effect.” “The incident is a political conspiracy to defame the Congress party,” it said, adding a three-member probe committee has been formed on the directives of UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu.The committee will submit its report to Lallu within three days.

11-10-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||Protests outside Ram Gopal Varma’s house after filmmaker plans movie on vet rape, murder case||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, October 11  Infuriated over filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma decision to make a movie “Disha Encounter” that pertains to the brutal gang rape and murder of a veterinarian doctor in Hyderabad, the family of the victim on Sunday staged a protest outside the filmmaker’s residence in Hyderabad. The family had earlier moved the Telangana High Court seeking that the release of the film be restrained and also sought a ban on the film, which is scheduled to be released on November 26. The filmmaker has claimed that the movie is based on a “fictional story”, but passion and anger has made the family and supporters relent. In a Twitter message, Ram Gopal Varma said, “With regard to speculations on DISHA ENCOUNTER film I once again want to clarify it’s a fictional story based upon many cases from Nirbhaya rape onwards.”  Disha’s father told the media in Hyderabad today that the filmmaker was unnecessarily rubbing salt on the wounds of the family that was yet to come to terms with the reality after facing the tragedy a year ago. The father said Varma had “cast an actor who looks like my daughter, everything about the movie looks like it is about the incident, and despite this, he is saying it is about Disha which means a “path”.”“Do people believe that? He should tell us what the truth is. If the movie is not about my daughter, why would I get calls and messages about it? He should cast his own daughter in the role and then make the movie. I have another daughter who is of marriageable age, what will be our fate if he drags our family to the streets?” he said. The movie apparently is made around the rape and the murder of the veterinarian and the subsequent encounter of the four accused, all truck drivers and cleaners. The body of the veterinarian was found from under a bridge in a burnt state and subsequently the four men accused in the crime were gunned down by the Cyberabad Commissionerate Police allegedly when they tried to escape during evidence collection.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/protests-outside-ram-gopal-varmas-house-after-filmmaker-plans-movie-on-vet-rape-murder-case-154280

11-10-2020||Patna||Patna Collectorate iconic living heritage, demolition will be colossal loss: Historians||Patna University historians have joined a growing chorus for preserving the Collectorate building here, saying the centuries-old landmark is the “city’s pride” and an “iconic living heritage” that should be saved and passed on to the coming generations.They also cautioned that the demolition of the Patna Collectorate will be a “colossal loss” and “create a gap” in the continuity of long and layered history of the city.The current and former heads of the history department, other scholars, the present vice chancellor of the 103-year-old university and his immediate predecessor, have all appealed to the Bihar government to not demolish this “city icon”.Surendra Kumar, the head of History Department at the prestigious university, said, “Collectorate is our living heritage, our living history, and should definitely be preserved. No two ways about it”.“In fact, the buildings of Collectorate are living proof that Patna was a thriving riverine port city even in the 17th century and a preferred destination for the Dutch, Danish and others, even before the British arrived on Patna soil. And, Patna being on the banks of Ganga stood out as a riverine trade hub,” he said.These buildings, thus, form part of the “glorious era” of the city when Patna was already an economically thriving city where multi-national companies like the Dutch East India Company invested and opened factories to trade in sugar, cotton, silk, saltpetre, opium, among other products, Kumar said.“So much being spoken about the opium trade link to the buildings now, with the government adding a rather pejorative connotation to it. The opium trade rather amplifies the historic value of the buildings. Opium wars were fought and Patna opium was exported to China and other regions. It is part of history, one can’t negate it sitting conveniently in the 21st century,” he added.Bharati Kumar, a former head of the PU’s History Department, asserted that Collectorate has buildings from Dutch era and British era, and it has been the seat of the district administration since 1857 when even Patna was part of the Bengal presidency.“So, it has its own history of over 160 years as a Collectorate. As a silent sentinel, it has seen centuries of history unfold, from creation of Bihar province in 1912 to two World Wars, the country’s Independence, and of course the Dutch history to begin with. It is a part of the evolution of the city,” she said.Preserving the Collectorate buildings is important to “preserve that continuity of history, without being judgmental” and see it as part of urban history of Patna, she said.The Dutch-era buildings of the Collectorate, include the Record Room, the oldest structure on the campus, and Old District Engineer’s Office building, while the DM Office and 1938-built District Board Patna buildings were constructed during the British period.The 12-acre complex, parts of which are over 250 years old, has high ceilings, huge doors and hanging skylights, and it also featured in some of the key scenes in the Oscar winning film ‘Gandhi’.Patna University Vice Chancellor G K Choudhary said, “It should be preserved as the historic architectural fabric of Patna with memories of several generations attached to it”.Scholar and ex-VC of Patna University, RBP Singh, who retired during the lockdown period, termed the Collectorate a “pride of Patna” and an “architectural beauty” that must be preserved.“In fact, the Collectorate before being shifted to its present site near Gandhi Maidan, used to be housed in the building, now serving as the main administrative block of the historic Patna College that was founded in 1863. This Dutch-era block was also used as an opium warehouse earlier, but now the building is a glorious heritage,” said Singh, also a former principal of the Patna College.Bharati Kumar said history has various layers, and old buildings  represent the “whole vocabulary of architecture” of different eras, and help us understand the “evolution of the city”.The Bihar government had in 2016 proposed to demolish the Patna Collectorate to make way for a new complex, sparking huge public outcry and appeal to save it from various quarters in India and abroad.Heritage body INTACH in August 2019 took the matter to the Patna High Court and filed two PILs, one to avert the demolition and the other seeking constitution of the Bihar Urban Arts and Heritage Commission, which was pending since 2012.The state heritage panel was set up in March this year on the directions of the court. The seven-member Commission, then submitted a report to the HC claiming, the Collectorate building “did not have much architectural, cultural or aesthetic value” as it was used to “store opium and saltpetre”.Bharti Kumar, the former head of the history department, asked” “So, by that argument should the Dutch-era part of Patna College be demolished too?”  She also countered the Commission’s assessment on architecture of Collectorate, saying, “The Dutch-era Record Room has exquisite pillars, and its thick walls, high ceilings huge doors and windows, hanging skylights, and British-era buildings are also admirable and worth preserving from the architectural point of view”.Hearing a petition by INTACH, the Supreme Court on September 18 had ordered a stay on the demolition of Patna Collectorate.The then Dutch envoy Alphonsus Stoelinga, London-based Gandhi Foundation, noted historians and others had also appealed in 2016 to spare the demolition of the landmark, whose fate currently hangs in the balance. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/patna-collectorate-iconic-living-heritage-demolition-will-be-colossal-loss-historians-154278

11-10-2020||New Delhi||Non-AC sleeper coaches to be replaced by AC coaches for trains running at 130/160 kmph: Rlys||Trains running on identified routes at a speed of 130 kmph or above on the railway network will have only air-conditioned coaches in the near future as part of the Railways’ plans to upgrade the network, an official said on Sunday.Stressing that the ticket prices of such trains will be “affordable”, railway ministry spokesperson D J Narain clarified that it should not be misconstrued that “all non-AC coaches will be made into AC coaches”. Currently on most routes, speeds of mail/express trains have a ceiling of 110 kmph or lower.Premium trains like Rajdhanis, Shatabdis and Durontos are allowed to operate at 120 kmph on significant parts of the Golden Quadrilateral and Diagonals. The rakes for such trains are fit to operate at 130 kph or above, officials said.“AC coaches have become a technical necessity wherever the speed of the train is going to be above 130 kmph. Indian Railways is working on a massive plan to upgrade the railway network to high speed potential,” Narain said.Tracks on the Golden Quadrilateral and Diagonals are being upgraded to cater to speeds of 130 kmph to 160 kmph. The non-AC sleeper coaches would be replaced by AC coaches only for such trains which will be running at 130/160 kmph.“Non-AC coaches will continue to run in trains running at 110 kmph,” he said.“It will be ensured that while the price of tickets of modified AC coaches remains very affordable for the passengers, the comfort and conveniences increase manifold and there is substantial reduction in travel time,” Narain said.He said that a prototype of such an AC coach is being manufactured at Rail Coach Factory at Kapurthala and should be ready in a few weeks. “Presently, an 83-berth coach is being designed. It is planned to have 100 such coaches this year and 200 next year. The coaches will be evaluated and experience gained from the running of these coaches will lead to further progress,” he said. Officials said the new AC coaches will be economical as their tickets will be priced between AC 3 and Sleeper coaches.Compared to 72 berths in a sleeper coach, this new AC coach will have 83 berths, but the number of berths in a coupe will remain the same. However, there will be no extra middle berth between side-upper and side-lower berths.The coaches are being re-designed by moving the electrical units and removing the space reserved for storing blankets and bed sheets, since Railways will stop providing them due to coronavirus. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/non-ac-sleeper-coaches-to-be-replaced-by-ac-coaches-for-trains-running-at-130-160-kmph-rlys-154270

Later, it was extended till November 24.Among the Indian domestic carriers, only Vistara has premium economy class seats in its flights.Domestic passenger services resumed in India on May 25 after nearly two months of suspension owing to the coronavirus pandemic situation.Modifying its May 21 order, the MoCA in its October 5 communication stated, “The fares indicated... are not applicable for business class and premium economy class. However, in premium economy class, the lower fare band would be applicable.”       The ministry had on May 21 said that there would be seven bands of ticket pricing with lower and upper fare limits based on flight duration.The first such band consists of flights that are of less than 40 minutes duration. The lower and the upper fare limits for the first band is Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,000, respectively.The subsequent bands are for flights with durations of 40-60 minutes, 60-90 minutes, 90-120 minutes, 120-150 minutes, 150-180 minutes and 180-210 minutes.The lower and upper limits for these bands are: Rs 2,500-Rs 7,500; Rs 3,000-Rs 9,000; Rs 3,500-Rs 10,000; Rs 4,500-Rs 13,000; Rs 5,500-Rs 15,700 and Rs 6,500-Rs 18,600, respectively, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said.The aviation ministry had made it clear that each airline would sell at least 40 per cent of its tickets on a flight at prices less than the midpoint between the lower limit and upper limit.It had imposed the fare limits to make sure that passengers were not charged beyond a certain limit amid the coronavirus pandemic and there was no predatory pricing among the airlines as their financial condition was bad due to the pandemic.

11-10-2020||New Delhi||Multiplexes still awaiting approval from state govts to resume operations||Multiplex operators are still awaiting nod from many state governments to resume operations even though the Centre has already issued guidelines with regard to reopening of cinemas and theatres.Multiplexes, cinema halls and theatres have been allowed to reopen from October 15, with up to 50 per cent of their seating capacity. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) have been issued by the central government.Though the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has given its go-ahead to resuming cinema and theatre activities under Unlock 5.0, it has left for the states to take a final call in this regard.Multiplex chains including PVR, Inox, Cinepolis and Mukta A2 Cinemas are all set to re-open their cinema halls from October 15 with half of their seating capacity while ensuring contactless operations and maintaining social distancing norms. These operators have lined up “promising contents” to entertain the audiences in the coming months.Leading multiplex operator PVR, which operates 875 screens in 22 states, would be able to open only 496 screens as only 14 state governments have granted permission to re-open its multiplexes, according to its CEO Gautam Dutta.The company is yet to receive any direction from the state government of Maharashtra, where it operates the highest number of screens.“Maharashtra is an extremely important market for us, occupying the largest percentage of our screen share,” he said.Mexican movie theatre chain Cinepolis said the company is fully ready and would abide by the directions issued by the government.“We welcome the move from the central government. Almost 75 per cent screen of the 350 screens, which we operate in India would be open. We are requesting the other state governments to allow us to open the balance screens as soon as possible,” Cinepolis India Chief Executive Officer Devang Sampat said.Subhash Ghai’s film production company Mukta Arts, which runs multiplex chain under the brand name ‘Mukta A2 Cinemas’, said it will be able to open approximately 40 per cent of the screens that it operates.“We welcome the decision to reopen cinemas and multiplexes. The SOPs that have been released are highly comprehensive and will guarantee that the return to normalisation is a smooth one. This announcement brings enormous relief to media and entertainment industry and the thousands of people it employs, many of whom have been severely impacted by this shutdown,” Mukta Arts MD Rahul Puri said.Moreover, as the number of permissible seating in the auditorium has gone down to 50 per cent under the Unlock 5.0 guidelines, some multiplex chains are now exploring private screenings for families and smaller groups.INOX Leisure CEO Alok Tandon said: “We are also looking to innovate with private screenings, where families or smaller groups of guests can book the entire auditorium and enjoy the content of their choice”.“Our shows will be programmed in such a manner that there are no simultaneous entries, intermissions and exits,” he said.All multiplex chains have assured that they will strictly follow the SOPs issued by the government in this regard.“We have some very promising content lined up in the coming months, and Maharashtra opening makes us hopeful of things speeding up in this direction. With that we must also reiterate our priority to ensure the safety and well-being of our customers through strict adherence to all the safety protocols and guidelines laid down,” said Dutta.Besides mandatory temperature checks, masks, pedal-operated touch-free hand sanitisers, the multiplexes would now rely on the digital ways such as e-tickets instead of traditional paper tickets, self-check in with QR codes, sharing of auditorium’s seat chart and location of the seat and online order of food and beverages, under the new normals.Some multiplex operators like Mukta A2 Cinemas is using ‘matrix seating’ method, which will ensure an empty seat between patrons, while allowing families and groups to sit together.“This starts right from the booking of the tickets, which will take place exclusively through the Mukta A2 Cinemas website and mobile application. Upon arrival at the theatre, customers will be able to self-check by scanning a QR code. Social distancing will be also be maintained during screenings, with occupancy of the cinema hall capped at 50 per cent,” Puri said.Inox will also keep PPE kits available for purchases, which would include a mask, a pair of gloves and sanitiser. It would also provide a web link to its viewers through SMS to access the food and beverage menu to place order.Many cinema halls were closed even before the lockdown period started.Several states including Delhi, Kerala, J&K, Maharastra etc had directed to close the cinema halls between March 11 to 16 for a temporary period, till March 31, 2020.Later, the central government had directed a complete lockdown of the country, effective from March 25.According to estimates, India has a total number of around 8,750 screens, in which 3,100 are in multiplexes and balance 5,650 are single screens operating mostly in small tier II, III and below cities.

11-10-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal govt says it has highest respect for Sikh panth||West Bengal government on Sunday said it had the highest respect for the Sikh panth.Reacting on the controversy triggered off by the arrest of Balwinder Singh, a native of Bathinda, who was found carrying a firearm while participating in BJP demonstration in Kolkata against Chief Minister Mama Banerjee, the state home department said BJP was giving communal colour to the police action.“One political party is giving communal colour to the subject in narrow partisan interest in a manner that Bengal does not believe in. Policing was done as per law, but highest respect for the Sikh panth and ways from GOWB is affirmed”, @HomeBengal said in a tweet.“One illegally carried firearm amidst agitationists in an agitation that was not authorized is now being twisted out of context, being distorted, and being given communal colours in fractious and partisan interest,” the home department said in a second tweet which was in continuation of the first.“Our Sikh brothers and sisters live here in West Bengal in perfect peace and harmony, in happiness and tranquillity, with respect from all of us for their faith and practices”, @HomeBengal said in a third tweet.Earlier today, Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, presented a memorandum to Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar at the Raj Bhavan here urging him to take appropriate penal and departmental action against police personnel responsible for “excessive use of force” against Balwinder.“The action of the West Bengal Police in defiling the turban and keshas of a practising Sikh standing peacefully represent deliberate and malicious acts intended to insult the religious belief of the Sikh community as a whole,” stated the memorandum.In a message, the Governor said he assured the DSGMC delegation that all steps would be taken for “such outrage”. “In no civilised society such blatant abuse of police power can be countenanced or condoned,” Dhankhar said.Delhi BJP spokesperson Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga also wrote a letter to Minorities Commission member Atif Rasheed on Sunday demanding “strictest possible” action in this regard.Balwinder, said to be a former member of the Special Forces (6 Para), who was working as personal security guard of BJP leader Priyanshu Pandey, was arrested by police on Thursday after violence broke out during BJP’s “Nabanna Chalo Abhiyan”.A .32 bore pistol, whose licence is valid for Rajouri only, was found in Balwinder’s possession.

11-10-2020||Vijay Mohan||Mohali centre develops technology for eco-friendly, economic farming method||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, October 11The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Mohali, has developed the technology for aquaponic cultivation of plants, which is not only environment-friendly but also has high socio-economic benefits for the farming community.Aquaponics is an emerging technique in which both fish as well as plants complement each other to sustain and grow. The fish waste provides organic food for plants and the plants naturally filter the water which is used to replenish the fish tank. There is no requirement for the use of soil and fertilisers.“The process is completely organic, increases the productivity of the given land, saves water and also augments the farmers’ income,” Dr PK Khosla, director C-DAC, said, adding: “The technology has been developed and suitable protocols have been evolved for scientists and farmers,” he added.A pilot project to develop the technology was awarded to C-DAC by the Ministry of Information and Technology and a budget of Rs 1.60 crore sanctioned for it. A plant has been set up at Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU), Ludhiana, which is scheduled to be inaugurated tomorrow.Scientists from GADVASU as well as Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, are also being associated with the project.Water from the fish tanks is made to flow through horizontal pipes that are fixed on a framework one on top of the other with the required gap to accommodate the plants. Holes are made in the pipes into which small perforated cups, containing plants, are laid. The roots of the plants draw the nutrients from water flowing through the pipes. The pipes can be stacked up to a reasonable height, thereby drastically reducing the area required for the same number of plants to be cultivated.Aquaponics is suitable to cultivate lettuce, spinach, capsicum, coriander, broccoli and some other leafy plants without the use of soil, pesticides and fertilizers. The area where plants grow is enclosed in a glasshouse-like structure.According to a scientist at C-DAC, three water tanks with a combined capacity of 54,000 litres, containing three kg of fish, have been installed at the pilot project. The fish would further multiply. This quantity is sufficient to sustain 2,000 plants.Though aquaponics is a relatively new field in India, it is being used in many parts of the world as it offers a diverse and stable poly-culture system that allows farmers to grow vegetables and raise fish at the same time.

Such disregard to air pollution will not be tolerated,” he said.On Saturday, the Delhi government had imposed a fine of Rs 20 lakh on the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) for violating dust control norms at a demolition site on Tansen Marg in New Delhi.Directions were also issued not to carry out or restart any demolition activity without installing an anti-smog gun and taking other measures to prevent dust pollution at the project site.The Delhi Pollution Control Committee had earlier asked FICCI and other bodies to stop work at six demolition and construction sites for not taking adequate steps to control dust pollution.It is mandatory to install anti-smog guns at construction and demolition sites larger than 20,000 square meters, according to government guidelines.                                               The government has also imposed fines ranging between Rs 20,000 and Rs 5 lakh on 31 RMC plants for not taking measures to prevent dust pollution.Eleven of these plants where violations were of “serious nature” have been told to stop work.The environment department has set up 14 inspection teams to check violations of pollution norms.“This anti-dust campaign will continue in mission mode till October 15 and strict action will be taken against the violators,” the minister had earlier said.

11-10-2020||New Delhi||PM attacks rivals for opposing agri reforms, says middlemen powered their politics||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday hit out at the opposition, saying those whose politics was powered by brokers and middlemen are spreading “lies” about his government’s reform measures and asserted that the country would not waver from this path.Farmers are not going with those who have opposed “historic” reforms enacted by his government, he said.Speaking at a programme to launch the physical distribution of property cards under the ‘SVAMITVA’ (ownership) scheme via video conferencing, Modi said his government had done more for villages and its residents in the last six years than what was done in the six decades before that.Also read: PM launches physical distribution of property cards under SWAMITVA schemeIn this context, he referred to a number of projects, including the opening of bank accounts, the building of toilets and houses, cooking gas scheme and electrification.Rural India was left to fend for itself by those who ruled the country earlier, Modi said in a swipe at the Congress.Many people don’t want villages, poor, farmers and labourer to be ‘Aatmanirbhar’, the Prime Minister said and added that his government’s measures to empower them, including by directly transferring to farmers and others, had hit them hard by cutting off their source of illegitimate earning.Without naming the opposition, he said it was upset not for farmers but for themselves as it was for long strengthened by the power of middlemen, brokers and commission agents.People of the country have begun destroying its web of deception, Modi said.The Congress has been opposing the farm laws enacted by the government last month.Parliament had passed The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020, during the Monsoon Session.The Prime Minister said his government was undertaking development without any discrimination and with full transparency and everyone was getting the benefit of schemes.Keeping people in villages deprived has been the basis of some people’s politics. They wanted problems of villages and people to continue so that their purpose was served, he said.“Those who looted the country are being recognised by people. That is why they are indulging in opposition, bad-mouthing (government) and using foul language. They are not bothered about the poor, villages or the country. They are troubled by all the good work. They want to stop the development march of the country,” the Prime Minister said.

11-10-2020||New Delhi||All about an idli: British prof's tweet sparks not so ‘boring' debate||Some would say it's much ado about the idli, that humble staple of south India and the centre of the furious debate on social media after a British academic disparaged it as “boring”. And others that this is a cultural, “civilisational” issue and the brouhaha is entirely in keeping with its status in the annals of India's diverse cuisine. Idli are the most boring things in the world. https://t.co/2RgHm6zpm4Either which way, the steamed rice and lentil ‘cake' -- a pan India favourite, a must-figure in most breakfast buffets, and the choice of the discerning dieter as well as the foodie for its health quotient -- is suddenly much talked about and much discussed.Paired mostly with coconut chutney, sambhar and some spicy gunpowder soaked in ghee, the idli moved from the accounts of thousands of Twitter users to national and also some international media outlets with several food writers and journalists dishing up articles that explored its origins and reflected the social media debate.It all began with British historian Edward Anderson responding to a question from food aggregator with this innocuous statement on Twitter, “Idlis are the most boring things in the world."  And the floodgates opened.Author and Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram Shashi Tharoor termed the professor "truly challenged" and Twitter users, some indignant, some passionate and some tongue firmly in cheek, flooded the microblogging site with variations of why they like the Indian rice cakes and also why they don't. Tharoor's son Ishaan Tharoor, a US-based columnist, said, “I think I have encountered the most offensive take on Twitter.” “Yes, my son, there are some who are truly challenged in this world. Civilisation is hard to acquire: the taste & refinement to appreciate idlis, enjoy cricket, or watch ottamthullal is not given to every mortal. Take pity on this poor man, for he may never know what Life can be,” tweeted the Congress MP.This is so gracious of you, @edanderson101. You're welcome at my breakfast table anytime! Tip: the secret of tasty idlis lies in the fermentation (too little makes it bland, too short could make it rubbery). But accompaniments are key: idlis both absorb&complement their flavours. https://t.co/tqYumHgAcYAnderson, whose Twitter bio states that he works on the “politics and history of India & Britain, migration & diasporas”,  did also say his wife is from Kerala. He may have found the idli boring but loves “basically all south Indian food”.But idli fans were up in arms nonetheless. The idli has found a place in the Indian plate – and palate – because it lights on the stomach, inexpensive and tasty too, said many food lovers, historians and critics alike.Terming Tharoor's tweet a “valid response” to Anderson, food historian Pushpesh Pant said the “beautiful and perfectly balanced food” is not just healthy but “cost-effective” too as the batter can be used over several days for different dishes.“I think idli is a beautiful and perfectly balanced food. It has lentils, it has rice and it gives you a very interesting mix of vegetable proteins. It is a steamed food, it doesn't take too much oil to make, also it is easy to digest.  “The batter you prepare to make idli on the first day can be used to make idli which is the softest, second day you make dosas which are slightly less fluffy, third day you use it for uttapam, so this cycle continues,” Pant told PTI.While the basics of making a steamed rice cake remain the same -- rice flour, urad dal (black gram) and a fermenting agent -- several versions of the idli are available in India's south. If in some parts of Karnataka the flat saucer-shaped ‘thatte idli' is preferred, in others ‘muday idli' steamed after being wrapped in pine or coconut palm leaves has foodies salivating.Apart from the most commonly available plain idli and sambar from Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the coastal state of Goa has the ‘sanna', a savoury steamed rice cake shaped like a hockey puck. The unlikely combination of idli with chicken or mutton curry can be found in Andhra Pradesh.Although he is not an idli fan, food critic Rahul Verma believes the taste comes from what it is eaten with.“Idli doesn't have a taste of its own, it depends on what goes with it. Idli either with chutney or sambar, or chicken, mutton or pork curries make all the difference,” Verma said.On his food journeys, Verma has enjoyed gunpowder idlis from Tamil Nadu, mini idlis with fried chicken from Andhra Pradesh and the softest ones from Karnataka. But he can't forget the idlis, far from its native land in south, he had at a bus stop in Karnal, Haryana.“I broke two spoons trying to eat those idlis. I can only request everyone to make only what they are capable of,” Verma said.“Famous food historian KT Achaya had written some path-breaking books on the origin of different food in India. According to him, idli came to India from Indonesia. The cooks employed by the Indonesian Hindu kings may have made the first idli. And it came to India during the 9th to 12th centuries, but people here wouldn't believe in that origin," Verma added. For Neelima Vaid, an MA student and “home foodie” from Delhi, the best idlis are those made by her mother.“She adds dry fruits to it, sometimes roasted ones, and it adds an entirely different taste and texture to idli. I know people say idli is all about what goes along with it, but homemade idlis stuffed with dry fruits -- you don't need anything with that,” Vaid said.Food critic Pritha Sen said almost every Indian state has a steamed dish similar in concept but idli became the best known because its patrons took it all over the world. “The easiest that comes to mind is Gujarat with their dhoklas and stuff, in Bengal, we have something called ‘bhapa pithe'. “...but unfortunately the urban elites have kind of forgotten this... the Udupis have gone out and spread it across the world. The rest of India has somehow not been able to do that,” she rued. Before the debate heated up in India, it had found a connection in the US election.Democratic vice-presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris, during her maiden address to the Indian-American community in August, recalled how her Indian origin mother always wanted to instil in her a "love of good idli"."Growing up, my mother would take my sister Maya and me back to what was then called Madras because she wanted us to understand where she had come from and where we had ancestry. And of course, she always wanted to instil in us, a love of good idli," Harris said.

11-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality ‘poor’, likely to improve in coming days||The National Capital’s air quality was recorded in the “poor” category on Sunday morning, while a government agency said it is likely to improve slightly in the coming days due to a change in the wind direction.The city recorded an overall air quality index (AQI) of 218 at 10:30 am, with Jahangirpuri (AQI 283) recording the highest pollution levels in the capital.On Saturday, the 24-hour average AQI stood at 221, which falls in the “poor” category.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the AQI is likely to improve to the “moderate” category by Monday.Farm fires were observed in Punjab adjoining Pakistan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh which is likely to impact Delhi’s air quality on Sunday, SAFAR said.However, the wind direction will change to easterly and the impact of farm fires will reduce, it said.On Sunday morning, Delhi’s minimum temperature settled at 19.8 degrees Celsius. The maximum wind speed was 15 kilometers per hour and the direction was west-northwesterly.Low temperatures and stagnant winds help in accumulation of pollutants near the ground, affecting air quality.High levels of air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most -- 18 to 39 percent—to Delhi’s air pollution.Road dust is the second largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 percent), followed by industries (2 to 29 percent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 percent) and construction (8 percent).

Today, nearly two crore poor families in villages have got pucca houses,” the Prime Minister said.Modi said that the scheme will bring about a historical change. “Today you (beneficiaries) have a right, a legal document that your house is yours; you own it.”  “With records of your property, getting a loan from the bank will be easier,” the PM said.Interacting with the beneficiaries, he enquired whether there were any disputes during the demarcation of their land, responding to which the beneficiaries replied in the negative.The SVAMITVA scheme, launched by the PM in April, enables rural masses to use property as a financial asset, aiming to create a geospatial database of all rural properties.The Panchayati Raj Ministry’s scheme aims at a pan-India cadastral survey facilitated by drones, followed by the issuance of property cards to those living in abadi areas (inhabited rural land).In the long run, it is hoped that the land records would help people to leverage property as an asset to avail loans and also aid in the overall rural planning processes.Over the last two years, pilot cadastral survey projects yielded successful results in pilot locations in Haryana and Maharashtra, where property cards were issued. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/svamitva-scheme-will-make-rural-people-atmanirbhar-pm-modi-154206

It has now allowed graded reopening of schools from October 15.Gaikwad, who recently recovered from COVID-19, said schools had been conducting virtual classes and teachers have been taking special classes for students in some areas.However, the challenge was to find a way to end the academic year and assess students, she said.“While we are exploring various options, it is clear that schools will not open before Diwali,” Gaikwad said.According to senior officials in the state education department, reopening schools under the current circumstances is out of question, as there is no sign of the pandemic abating.State Higher and Technical Education Minister Uday Samant also said his department did not intend to reopen colleges until the COVID-19 situation was under control. “The situation is grim for students who wish to pursue higher studies abroad, as their future depends on our decision,” he added.Even as the state government and bureaucracy mull over solutions, children and parents are worried as they seem to be caught in a quagmire.“I have taken an education loan and my parents are repaying it. If I don’t get good grades in exams, how will I get a good job?” said Raviraj Humbe, an engineering student from Pune.There must be some technical solution for conducting exams and tests, he said.Meanwhile, education expert Kishore Darak suggested that the state government could club two or three educational years so that concerns of parents about academic loss could be addressed.While the safety of students was imperative, it was high time that the state came up with a bipartisan approach towards education, he said.“The government must come up with a solution where local officials are authorised to take context-specific decisions like full or partial reopening of schools or alternate day scheduling of classes, among others,” he said.

The land deals took place during the term of Chandrababu Naidu.The state has placed material evidence before the CJI, the instances evidencing Justice NV Ramana’s proximity with N Chandrababu Naidu and his interventions to protect the interests of the TDP. The instances of judicial impropriety of Justice NV Ramana, while he was the Judge of High Court, in passing orders favouring Dammalapati Srinivas, was also mentioned.The Chief Minister, in his letter dated October 6, 2020, has expressed his enormous respect towards the Judiciary, the High Court and the Supreme Court and the letter is only to sensitise the Supreme Court about the acts of a few individual judges and reiterated his government’s abiding compliance with the Judiciary, the Constitution and all institutions.The eight-page letter written by the Chief Minister mentioned about the material he has enclosed in the annexure to show that “Justice NV Ramana has been influencing the High Court including the roster of a few Honourable judges and instances of how matters important to the TDP have been allocated to a few Honourable Judges to establish the nexus between Justice NV Ramana, TDP and a few Judges of High Court. The latest one being the orders passed by High Court Chief Justice Maheshwari, in a writ petition filed by Dammalapati Srinivas, can lead to no other inference. This is the order of stay of an investigation in the FIR lodged against D Srinivas, including the gag order on press, against which an SLP is preferred. An interim order was passed on the very next day of the gag order staying further proceedings, despite the SLP”.“The beneficiaries of both orders of the High Court are politicians belonging to the TDP, of which Justice NV Ramana was a legal adviser and Additional Advocate General in the past advising the government run by the TDP and his closeness to Chandrababu Naidu is well known. This reflects in the nature of orders passed staying investigation, inquiry and rest at the admission stage itself,” the letter further read.The Chief Minister in his letter stated that he had true faith and allegiance to the Constitution, under which the three branches of Legislature, Executive and Judiciary should function. “To avoid power in any one of the three branches, the Constitution has devised a scheme of power distribution both horizontally and vertically. The check on members of the judiciary is their conscience and adherence to settled principles and jurisprudence,” he said in the letter.During the period of 2014-19, the former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu and his coterie have amassed wealth by misuse of power which mandated an inquiry by our government based on numerous complaints The cabinet sub-committee report was placed in the State Assembly, which has pointed out the illegal transactions of about 4,000 acres of land.In course of the inquiry, it came to light that two daughters of Justice NV Ramana and some of his close associates and relatives are beneficiaries of the questionable transactions that took place between the date of swearing in by Chandrababu Naidu as the Chief Minister and his announcement of the Capital region. The transactions were routed through D Srinivas who was at that point of time Additional Advocate General of the state.In the annexure, the Chief Minister gave a detailed report on the numerous petitions and PILs filed by the TDP or its sympathisers against the decisions and Bills passed by the government and the Court, with names of judges, protecting their interests — Amaravati Land scam, Stay of eviction or demolition process, a criminal petition on Ramesh Hospitals, State Election Commissioner seeking quashing of the FIR against Assistant Secretary of Navayuga Engineering, writ challenging the SIT and Cabinet sub-committee findings, allegations of phone tapping of Honourable judges, PIL relating to arrest of Chandrababu Naidu in Vizag among others.The state has appealed to the CJI to look into the matter and consider initiating steps to ensure that the state judiciary’s neutrality is maintained.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhra-pradesh-cm-complains-to-cji-against-sitting-supreme-court-judge-154200

The Chinese embassy had emailed an advice to journalists, saying they should “properly” report Taiwan’s National Day. To this, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said, “The Indian media is free to report on any issue it deems fit.”Double tenth dayOctober 10 National Day dates from the start of a 1911 rebellion against Qing, China’s last empire, that led to the establishment of the Republic of China, which remains Taiwan’s formal name. APPosters near Chinese embassyNew Delhi: Posters wishing Taiwan on its National Day came up near the Chinese embassy in New Delhi on Saturday, but were removed by the New Delhi Municipal Council within hours, an official said. The posters, reading “Taiwan Happy National Day October 10”, were issued by Delhi BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga. PTIIndian netizens have vied to post “Happy Double Tenth National Day” to commemorate the island’s separation from Beijing on October 10, 1949.Besides, for the first time, the Taiwan President has mentioned India in her National Day speech. In addition, BJP supporters today hung pro-Taiwan hoardings for the first time outside the Chinese embassy in the highly protected diplomatic enclave here. Right-wing publications, in particular, have approvingly noted this act.China maintains that Taiwan will ultimately join the mainland. It doesn’t allow any country to have normal diplomatic relations with Taipei under its “One China Policy”. A furious Beijing has inflated the number of hoardings in front of its embassy to hundreds and warned via Global Times that India’s provocation on the Taiwan question will lead to an “irreversible” impact on the China-India ties.The first-ever pro-Taiwan gesture in a diplomatic enclave means that Chinese diplomats here will now have to keep an eye out for mischief from Tibetans as well as pro-Taiwan activists. On Taiwan’s unusually high visibility on social media, mainly powered by Indians, Pradeep Taneja, a fellow at Australia India Institute, said, “I have never seen so many foreigners sending their best wishes to the people of Taiwan on the National Day celebrations as this year. What has changed? Perhaps it is time for Beijing to introspect.”An online spat between Indians and the Chinese Government has been on since October 7, which was also briefly touched upon by the Ministry of External Affairs. The Chinese embassy here had emailed an advice to journalists on “properly” reporting Taiwan’s National Day. When asked, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said, “Indian media is free to report on any issue it deems fit.”The MEA’s observation has provided more ballast to hashtags #TaiwanisACountry and #TaiwanNationalDay.India has already indicated that it will not abide by Chinese rules for developing its ties with Taiwan after tensions broke out along the LAC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-netizens-defy-china-wish-taiwan-on-national-day-154074

It was extended to six months till August 31. The government said more than 50 per cent of the borrowers didn’t avail moratorium. The apex court is hearing a bunch of pleas, including the one which has sought a direction to declare the portion of an RBI notification, issued on March 27, “ultra vires to the extent it charges interest on the loan amount during the moratorium period”.In its affidavit, the RBI said any waiver of interest on interest would entail “significant economic costs” which cannot be absorbed by the banks without serious dent on their finances and this, in turn, would have huge implications for the depositors and the broader financial stability.It also requested the top court to vacate “with immediate effect” its September 4 interim order restraining banks from classifying accounts into NPAs. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-extend-loan-moratorium-rbi-to-sc-154042
