29-10-2020||New Delhi||1st batch of 8-10 Indians out of 33 stuck in Somalia to return home soon: MEA||The Indian mission in Kenya has taken up the case of 33 Indians stuck in Somalia after not being paid their salaries by the firm they were working for and the company has agreed to clear their dues and facilitate their return, the Ministry of External Affairs said on Thursday.Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the Indian mission in Kenya is taking the required steps and expressed hope that the first batch of about 8-10 people out of the 33 will arrive in India soon.Asked about the Indians stuck in Somalia after not getting salary for months, Srivastava said at an online briefing that the case “is of 33 Indian nationals from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Gujarat and are working in Somalia”.“Our mission in Kenya which covers Somalia got information about them and our mission officials travelled from Kenya to Somalia and with the help of foreign office there they spoke with the company and workers.“After talks, the company people agreed to clear the dues of the Indians. They have also said that they will facilitate those Indians who want to return home,” he said.Last week, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said India is working on relief and return of 33 Indians stuck in Somalia and the High Commission in Nairobi has taken up their predicament with Somalian authorities.To a separate question on Vijay Mallya’s extradition, Srivastava said his leave to appeal in Supreme Court had been rejected on May 14, and after that the UK side informed the Indian side that there were some “confidential legal issue” due to which his extradition was not taking place.“We are engaged with the UK side on this,” he said.On Nirav Modi’s extradition from the UK, he said his extradition hearing was held at the Westminster Magistrate Court London between September 7 and 11 during which the prosecution presented its case against him.The next hearing is on November 3, Srivastava noted, adding Nirav Modi had applied for bail in October on grounds of mental health and this bail application was rejected.

29-10-2020||New Delhi||Statements made to officers of central or state agencies under NDPS Act inadmissible: SC||Maintaining that officers of the central and state agencies appointed under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985 are police officers, the Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that statements recorded by them were not admissible as evidence during trial.“The officers who are invested with powers under section 53 of the NDPS Act are ‘police officers’ within the meaning of section 25 of the Evidence Act, as a result of which any confessional statement made to them would be barred under the provisions of section 25 of the Evidence Act, and cannot be taken into account in order to convict an accused under the NDPS Act,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice RF Nariman said in a 2:1 verdict.Deciding a batch of appeals on the contentious issue, the top court said that a statement recorded under section 67 of the NDPS Act cannot be used as a confessional statement in the trial of an offence under the NDPS Act.The majority verdict was delivered by Justice Nariman and Justice Navin Sinha, while Justice Indira Banarjee delivered a dissenting judgment.The majority verdict said that “to arrive at the conclusion that a confessional statement made before an officer designated under section 42 or section 53 can be the basis to convict a person under the NDPS Act, without any non obstante clause doing away with section 25 of the Evidence Act, and without any safeguards, would be a direct infringement of the constitutional guarantees contained in Articles 14 (right to equality), 20(3) (right against self-incrimination) and 21 (right to fair trial) of the Constitution of India”.The latest verdict reverses an earlier judgment of a two-judge Bench which had ruled that statements made to officers of central and state agencies under Section 67 of NDPS Act was admissible.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/statements-made-to-officers-of-central-or-state-agencies-under-ndps-act-inadmissible-sc-162916
29-10-2020||---||States get Rs 51,000 crore less till September-end||New Delhi, October 29Though the Centre has transferred Rs 2.60 lakh crore to state governments as devolution of share of taxes, this amount is Rs 51,000 crore less than the amount transferred to the states till the end of September in the last fiscal.This is largely because in the first six months of the current fiscal, the Central Government has been able to collect only a quarter of the targeted amount for the full year. The Centre received Rs 5.65 lakh crore of receipts till September-end, which was about a quarter of budgetary estimates, according to the monthly account of the Union Government up to September 2020.Worryingly, the Centre has spent a very small portion on capital expenditure or for the building of productive assets.The total expenditure incurred by the government till the end of September was Rs 14.79 lakh crore. But most of it – Rs 13.13 lakh crore – was on the revenue account and just Rs 1.66 lakh crore on capital account.In revenue expenditure, Rs 3.05 lakh crore was for interest payments and Rs 1.56 lakh crore on account of major subsidies.Of the collections of Rs 5.65 lakh crore, tax revenue comprised the lion’s share – Rs. 4.58 lakh crore – non-tax revenue amounted to Rs 92,274 crore and non-debt capital receipts were Rs 14,635 crore of which recovery of loans were Rs 8,854 crore and disinvestment proceeds Rs 5,781crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-get-rs-51-000-crore-less-till-september-end-162912
29-10-2020||New Delhi||Overcrowding in festive season, pollution, lax behaviour causing rise in cases: Experts||Milling crowd in festive season, increase in pollution level and laxity in behaviour by many people in observing COVID-19 safety norms have led to a massive surge in daily cases in the last few days in the national capital, experts said on Thursday.Delhi on Wednesday recorded 5,673 cases, the first time when the number of daily cases here crossed the 5,000-mark.The experts feel the sudden spike in cases, among other factors, can also be attributed to “aggressive tracing and testing” done by the Delhi government.Medical Director of the Delhi government-run LNJP Hospital Suresh Kumar said due to the festive season and reopening of theatres, overcrowding is happening in markets and other public places, which is leading to transmission of the virus.“Besides, a large number of people are not observing safety norms, like wearing masks, hand hygiene or social distancing. And then rise in pollution level also makes those who have respiratory illness susceptible to COVID-19 infection too,” he told PTI.However, the Delhi government has significantly ramped up testing, especially the RT-PCR tests, and contact-tracing has been increased aggressively too, and family members and others of positive cases, also being tested.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday told reporters that this is festive season and slight cold weather already, “but we have also changed our strategy” and doing tracing and testing of all family members and close contacts of people found positive.“And, we are at times, testing them twice after a gap of 4-5 days. We don’t want to leave any positive case,” he said.So for this reason the rise in cases might have been seen, but this is “the best strategy and results should be seen soon,” Jain added, while asserting that ramping up of tests was one of the factors behind the rise in daily cases suddenly.As the city is witnessing a surge in COVID-19 cases, occupancy rate of hospital beds has also gone up.According to official data, 5,404 beds in COVID-19 dedicated hospitals had been occupied on October 26.On October 27, the number rose to 5,453 and on October 28, 5,665 beds were occupied, it said.The National Centre for Disease Control in a report drafted recently had warned that Delhi needs to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh cases of COVID-19 per day taking into account the upcoming winter season-related respiratory problems, large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings.Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant, Internal Medicine at Apollo Hospitals here said the projection by experts is “scary”.“Yet, many people are just roaming around without masks with scant or no regard for safety norms which should be drilled in the psyche of the masses. Also, we just had Durga Puja and other festivals, and more are coming up, and add to it the increased pollution factor. It’s a dangerous cocktail,” he told PTI.Asked what factor he considered as the major one, Chatterjee, himself a COVID-19 survivor, said “complacent behaviour by people, in observing safety norms is really making the matter worse”.People who may be asymptomatic carriers are just transmitting it to others via coming in contact with others and not wearing masks in public, he flagged.Kumar of LNJP Hospital, a dedicated COVID-19 hospital, also underlined the laxity in behaviour by people in observing safety norms, and said, “If people followed these precautionary measures, a lot of the new cases can be precluded”. Delhi has been witnessing a rise in pollution the last few days.On Tuesday, Delhi’s air quality was recorded in the “very poor” category.On Wednesday, the city recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 297, which falls in the “poor” category. Prior to this, the air quality remained “very poor” for five days on the trot.The previous highest single-day spike of 4,853 COVID-19 cases was recorded on Tuesday.The number of fresh cases recorded on Monday stood at 2,832, and 4,136 on Sunday, while the figures were 4,116 on Saturday and 4,086 on Friday.The active cases tally on Wednesday rose to 29,378 from 27,873 the previous day, according to the bulletin.The bulletin said the total number of cases has climbed to 3,70,014.

29-10-2020||Islamabad||No constitutional, Sharia constraints on construction of temple: Pak religious body||Pakistan's supreme religious body has said that there were no constitutional or Sharia restrictions on the construction of a Hindu temple in Islamabad or any other part of the country.The Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) made its decision in a meeting on Wednesday on the basis of the Constitution and the Liaquat-Nehru Agreement of 1950, which led to the establishment of the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) in Pakistan, the Dawn News reported.The CII also allowed the government to hand over an ancient Hindu temple and adjoining dharamshala (community centre) in Saidpur village to Islamabad's Hindu community.“In view of the current population in Islamabad the ancient temple and the adjoining dharamshala at Saidpur village be opened to the Hindus and they should be facilitated to reach there to perform religious services as per their beliefs,” said the CII.The decision, signed by 14 CII members, added that Hindus, like all other religious groups in the country, have the constitutional right to a place for last rites according to their faith.“Under this right the Hindu community in Islamabad can have a suitable place for cremation of their dead and perform last rites of the deceased according to religious instructions,” said the council.An application was referred to the CII by the Ministry of Religious Affairs on July 6, seeking its opinion on the allotment of a land to the Hindu community for a crematorium, community centre and temple.The ministry had also sought the CII's advice on the allocation of Rs 100 million by the Prime Minister for the construction of the crematorium and temple.Some clerics, mainly those affiliated with Lal Masjid, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl and Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadis, had objected and claimed that a government grant for a temple was un-Islamic.An application was also filed in the Islamabad High Court by an individual against the construction of the temple and crematorium.The court deferred the matter and connected it to the CII's decision.After the meeting, CII chairman Qibla Ayaz said a conclusion was reached after the council heard the perspectives of various applications, mostly by clerics, and of the Hindu community.“The decision has been made in light of various provisions of Sharia,” he told the press.Dr Ayaz said the construction of the temple was permissible and a constitutional right, adding that there is no restriction in Sharia on the construction of community centres by non-Muslims for collective activities such as weddings and the celebration of religious festivals.However, the council said it did not support the provision of government funds for the construction of the temple because there was no tradition in general for the government to provide funds for places of worship owned by private parties.But the CII also suggested alternatives to resolve the funding issue, including amending the ETPB act to meet the financial needs for the execution of religious activities or creating a fund for non-Muslim communities.In Pakistan, the ETPB is responsible for taking care of Hindu temples and Gurudwaras and providing facilities to visitors and pilgrims at these places of worship.The CII noted that the ETPB's source of income is from renting abandoned properties belonging to Hindu and Sikh communities prior to partition.The council's other solution was to create a block fund for non-Muslims, as they are citizens of Pakistan and the state is responsible for ensuring their welfare and prosperity.The government may allocate funding separately and hand it over to non-Muslim communities, as there is no Sharia requirement on the utilisation of those funds by the relevant community.Ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf lawmaker Lal Chand Malhi welcomed the council's decision, saying it proved that the state guarantees rights to religious minorities.“After the CII decision the Capital Development Authority should issue a no-objection certificate to the Hindu Panchayat Islamabad to erect a boundary wall around the plot in H-9,” said Malhi.

The MEA described the unhindered legal movement of people as “an important foundation of the special relationship between India and the US”.“In our engagements, we have emphasised that this has been a mutually-beneficial partnership which should be nurtured. We are engaged with the US Government for increasing predictability in the visa regime and to minimise the inconvenience being faced by those in the U.S. or those who need to travel to the U.S. for bonafide reasons. The Government will continue to monitor any developments on this issue,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava at a media briefing today.The US has severely altered the lottery system of allocating H-1B visas, restricted even bonafide travel and has turned against immigration generally. India believes that partnership with the US in trade and people-to-people ties are as vital legs of the relationship as security and defence.Trade issues also remain unresolved. “We have agreed to rejuvenate bilateral trade. There are ongoing discussions between the USTR and the Ministry of Commerce to reach an understanding on improving market access and the business environment,” said the spokesperson.On the whole, however, the talks were reflective of the comprehensive global strategic partnership with the US under which a range of foreign policy issues were discussed. “The discussions covered various elements of bilateral partnership and there was a sense of satisfaction that the partnership has grown in every domain such as defence, education, energy etc,” said Srivastava.The two sides engaged most closely on national security and one important focus was the Indo-Pacific. The two sides also engaged views on multilateral issues against the backdrop of India poised to hold a two-year term in the UNSC from January 1, 2020.There was also progress in discussions on energy, including the four-identified pillars, besides an extension of cooperation under the global center for nuke energy partnership.The US also appreciated Indian developmental assistance and multimodal connectivity to Afghanistan via the Iranian port of Chabahar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/visas-an-irritant-in-excellent-ties-with-us-mea-162903

Governor Dhankhar was with the Union Home Minster for over an hour and state of affairs and affairs of state in West Bengal were traversed," read a post on the official Twitter handle of the West Bengal Governor.The meeting bears significance as the Governor is known for often expressing his disagreement on various matters in West Bengal, inviting sharp reactions from Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her government.Last month, Banerjee and Dhankhar were at loggerheads over the latter summoning the state's Director General of Police and calling the state “home to illegal bomb making" in a following note.Dhankhar had also alleged in the note to the DGP that the police "overlooked rampant and open loot in PDS distribution, cyclone 'Amphan' relief funds, and criminal negligence by officials during the COVID-19 pandemic".

29-10-2020||New Delhi||Fawad’s ownership of Pulwama yet another proof of Pak ministers backing terrorism: MEA||The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Thursday said a Pakistan minister terming Pulwama attack a success for the Imran Khan government is yet another statement by its leaders supporting terrorism.The MEA also dismissed Pakistan’s objections to India issuing rules for the purchase of land in the UTs of Ladakh and Kashmir.This step was among a number of measures being taken for socio-economic development and improving the livelihood of people.“Such things are India’s internal affairs and no country has the right to ask such questions,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava at a media briefing today.In what amounted to ownership for the Pulwama suicide attack that killed over 40 Indian security personnel, Pakistan Federal Minister Fawad Chaudhry on Thursday termed it a great achievement under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan.Apparently riled by a parliamentarian from the Nawaz Sharif camp charging Pakistan army chief of quaking in his boots after India had served an ultimatum for releasing Wg Comdr Abhinandan, Chaudhry said in Urdu, “We attacked India in its own territory...and Pulwama was an achievement under the leadership of Imran Khan. You all (opposition) are also a stakeholder in this success, all of us are stakeholders in this success.”The PML (Nawaz) parliamentarian, Ayaz Sadiq, while speaking in the Pakistan National Assembly on Wednesday said, “When the Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Bajwa came to meet Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi for a meeting, his legs were shaking and there was sweat on his forehead. Qureshi told him for god’s sake, let Abhinandan go as India was about to attack Pakistan at 9 pm.”In another Kashmir related development, India has conveyed serious concerns to Saudi Arabia, both to its Ambassador here and in Riyadh, for excluding the undivided J&K and Ladakh from India in its global map on a bank note released to celebrate its Presidency of G-20.“We have taken up the gross misrepresentation in the official and legal bank note of Saudi Arabia. We have asked the Saudis to take urgent, corrective steps in this direction,” said the MEA spokesperson.The Saudi development comes at a time when it appeared that Riyadh was no more interested in meeting Pakistan’s desire to raise the Kashmir issue strongly in the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC).Riyadh had rebuffed Pakistan’s top leadership when it attempted to hold an Islamic summit of non-Saudi Islamic powerhouses like Turkey and Malaysia. It also asked Islamabad to return the $1 billion it had lent as well as stopped supply of concessional oil to Pakistan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fawads-ownership-of-pulwama-yet-another-proof-of-pak-ministers-backing-terrorism-mea-162897
29-10-2020||New Delhi||Fare limits to remain in place for another three months: Puri||The upper and lower limits on domestic airfares will remain in place for another three months post November 24, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Thursday.The ministry had on May 21 placed these limits through seven bands, classified on the basis of flight duration, till August 24. Later, it was extended till November 24.Puri said if the scheduled domestic flights reach pre-COVID levels by the end of the year, he will have no hesitation in removing the fare limits at that time.“We are extending the price bands for another three months,” he said at a press conference.“Even though we are extending it by three months, if by the time we reach the end of the year, and if we find that there is a very appreciable movement in the situation and we are reaching pre-COVID levels, I would absolutely have no hesitation if my colleagues (aviation ministry officials) want us to not utilise the price band for the full three months period,” Puri added.Domestic passenger services resumed on May 25 after nearly two months of suspension to combat the coronavirus outbreak.           The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had on May 21 announced seven bands of ticket pricing with lower and upper fare limits based on flight duration.The first such band consists of flights that are of less than 40 minutes duration.The lower and the upper fare limits for the first band is Rs 2,000 and Rs 6,000, respectively.The subsequent bands are for flights with durations of 40-60 minutes, 60-90 minutes, 90-120 minutes, 120-150 minutes, 150-180 minutes and 180-210 minutes.The lower and upper limits for these bands are: Rs 2,500-Rs 7,500; Rs 3,000-Rs 9,000; Rs 3,500-Rs 10,000; Rs 4,500-Rs 13,000; Rs 5,500-Rs 15,700 and Rs 6,500-Rs 18,600, respectively, the DGCA said.

29-10-2020||Vibha Sharma||Permanent commission to control air pollution defines holistic approach: Javadekar||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 29The Centre’s decision to bring in an Ordinance for setting up a Commission for Air Quality Management in the “National Capital Region and Adjoining Area” has been welcomed by experts and environmentalists, including members of the now-dissolved EPCA Sunita Narain and Bhure Lal.The statutory authority replaces the 22-year-old Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) or any committees’ body constituted so far for air pollution matters in the NCR region.Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar called the permanent commission a “consolidated”, “collaborative” and “participatory” approach between Centre, States, local bodies and other stakeholders for monitoring, tackling and eliminating the causes of air pollution. “Air pollution is not a problem of Delhi and its corporations alone but of a big airshed that includes the NCR. The Centre and the four NCR states have to work together to tackle the problem,” he said, calling it a holistic approach, a special new regime for special region spread over five states.Regarding whether states, including Punjab, may have issues given its jurisdiction, Javadekar said the issue of paddy stubble, which contributes anywhere between 4 to 40 per cent to air pollution, “will not remain a problem in next three-four years with the kind of research, innovations and solutions in the pipeline”. The Commission will have jurisdiction in adjoining areas beyond the NCR in Punjab, Haryana, UP and Rajasthan.There are also strict repercussions for default— a jail term up to five years and penalty up to Rs 1 crore.According to officials the aim is to replace “inadequate, haphazard and temporary commissions, authorities, etc., appointed either judicially or administratively. For the first time a regulatory mechanism for stubble burning is put in place. It will identify, specify and rigorously enforce measures for eliminating and mitigation of air pollution included, but not limited to, controlling or eliminating activities of stubble burning, vehicular pollution, road dust and urban construction”.  The government is expected to replace the Ordinance with a Bill in the next Parliament session. The CPCB, SPCBS will continue to deal with the subject. However in the case of conflict the orders of the commission will prevail. CPCB’s nationwide powers will standStudies show that north Indian states in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) region face the twin challenge of high population density and heavy concentration of air pollutants round-the-year, both urban and rural areas. Any substantial reduction in pollution is possible only if the administrative approach includes regional pollution sources and regional coordination mechanism among StatesChairperson and member of now dissolved EPCA Bhure Lal and Sunita Narain said the move showed the intent and determination of the union government to mitigate the high levels of air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region.Prof S N Tripathi from IIT Kanpur and member, NCAP steering committee welcomed the “much-needed move. The key problem was how to coordinate among these states. There was no single body, authority, ministry or state which was empowered or dedicated to do that.

29-10-2020||New Delhi||Parliamentary panel questions Paytm about Chinese investment, storing of data in servers abroad||A parliamentary panel on Thursday questioned Paytm representatives about the quantum of Chinese investment in the company and told them that the servers on which customer data is stored should be in India.Top officials of Paytm appeared before the Joint Committee of Parliament on the Personal Data Protection Bill, and submitted their suggestions on key aspects of the proposed legislation such as management and transfer abroad of sensitive personal data, sources said.Members of the panel from different political parties asked Paytm why the server on which data of its customers is collected and stored is abroad when it claims to be an Indian firm, sources said.The panel members told Paytm representatives that the server on which customer data is stored should be based in India, sources said, adding that they also wanted to know about the quantum of Chinese investments in the digital payment service and specifics about its "backend linkages".Questions were also raised about the possible conflict of interest considering that Paytm also sells its own products on its e-commerce platform, they said.In its submission before the panel, Paytm said sensitive and personal data may be transferred outside India for the purpose of processing when explicit consent is given by the "data principal" for such transfer.Facebook, Twitter and Amazon have deposed before the panel, while representatives of telecom operators Reliance Jio and Airtel and cab aggregators Ola and Uber have been asked to appear before it.The committee, chaired by BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi, is examining the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019.The Personal Data Protection Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha by Minister of Electronics and Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad on December 11, 2019. The bill seeks to provide for protection of personal data of individuals and establishment of a data protection authority for the same.The bill was later referred to a joint select committee of both Houses of Parliament. The proposed law seeks bar on storing and processing of personal data by entities without the explicit consent of an individual.

29-10-2020||New Delhi||Economic recovery faster than expected, confident of meeting $5-trn target by 2024: PM Modi||The Indian economy is getting back on track faster than expected as a timely lockdown and various relief measures announced by the government helped address issues faced by all sections of society and all economic sectors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said.He also expressed confidence that the target of making India a USD 5-trillion economy will be achieved by 2024, saying that the crisis gave the government an opportunity to carry out reforms that were waiting to happen for decades but no one earlier took the initiative.“Reforms across sectors such as coal, agriculture, labour, defence, civil aviation and so on have been undertaken which will help us get back on the high growth path that we were on before the crisis,” Modi said in an interview published in the Economic Times newspaper on Thursday.On COVID-19 vaccine, he said every Indian will be vaccinated as and when a vaccine becomes available, though the focus initially would be on protecting the most vulnerable and the frontline workers.Modi reiterated that there should be no room for complacency in fighting this virus and the only way forward is to take precautions such as wearing masks, hand washing and social distancing.He said the government in the very beginning decided to be proactive and introduced a timely nationwide lockdown.“We not only got the broad timing of various phases of lockdown right, we also got the unlock process right and much of our economy is also coming back on track. The data for August and September indicates that” he said.He said this is a new virus and countries which had initially controlled the outbreak are now reporting a resurgence.“The geographical spread of India, population density, the regular social gatherings must be kept in mind when we look at these numbers and seek to compare with others. Many of our states are larger than countries,” he added.Modi said India’s response in tackling the crisis has been focused on increasing capabilities to handle the situation, making people more aware, creating more facilities etc in keeping with the dictum ‘Hope for the best but prepare for the worst’.Asked about plans for further stimulus for the economy, he said, “We will take all measures needed to constantly stimulate the economy in a timely manner while ensuring overall macro-economic stability.“Remember, we are still not over with the pandemic. Yet, our economy has shown a remarkable capability to bounce back, largely because of the resilience of our people.“This is something that is not captured in these numbers but is the reason behind those numbers. The shop-owner, the trader, the person running an MSME, the person working on the factory floor, the entrepreneur, all these are the heroes responsible for the strong market sentiment and revival of the economy,” he said.Modi further said India has not started speaking about manufacturing only after the pandemic and the work has been continuing on increasing manufacturing for some time now.“India is, after all, a young country with a skilled workforce. But India doesn’t believe in gaining from the loss of others. India will become a global manufacturing hub on its own strengths.“Our effort is not to become some country’s alternative, but to become a country which offers unique opportunities. We want to see the progress of all. If India progresses, one-sixth of humanity will progress,” he said.Referring to a new world order that was formed after World War II, the prime minister said something similar will happen post-COVID-19.“This time, India will ride the bus of manufacturing and integrating in global supply chains. We have specific advantages in the form of democracy, demography and demand,” he said.On the USD 5-trillion target for the Indian economy by 2024, he said, “Our government has a track record of meeting our targets.”“We met the rural sanitation target before the deadline, we met the village electrification target before the deadline, we met the 8 crore Ujjwala connections target too well before the deadline. So, going by our track record and continuing reforms, people also have confidence in our abilities to reach the target,” Modi said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/economic-recovery-faster-than-expected-confident-of-meeting-5-trn-target-by-2024-pm-modi-162888

Our success in Pulwama, is a success of this nation under the leadership of Imran Khan. You and us are all part of that success,” Science & Technology Minister Fawad Chaudhry said in the National Assembly during a debate.READ: 'Pak Army chief's 'legs were shaking' as Qureshi said India would attack if Abhinandan not freed'Chaudhry, a close aide of Prime Minister Imran Khan, made the remarks a day after Opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Ayaz Sadiq said Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in an important meeting pleaded to release Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captured by the Pakistani Army on February 27, 2019 after his MiG-21 Bison jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets.In the early hours of February 26, 2019, the IAF jets bombed the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror camps in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan and avenged the Pulwama terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel.“Legs were shaking and forehead perspiring, and the foreign minister (Qureshi) told us, ‘For God’s sake, let him (Varthaman) go back now because India is attacking Pakistan at 9 PM in the night’”, Sadiq said, recalling the high-level meeting which was also attended by Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, and added that “India was not planning to attack...They just wanted to kneel before India and send back Abhinandan.”Chaudhry, who was the information and broadcasting minister at the time of the Pulwama attack, criticised Sadiq’s remarks and termed them as “inappropriate”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-minister-admits-to-imran-khan-govts-role-in-pulwama-terrorist-attack-162879

Get ready to sweep roads!||Next time if you are caught without a face mask in public in Mumbai, get ready to sweep roads as part of community service if you fail to pay fine to the city civic body.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is making violators do community service in the form of sweeping roads if they are reluctant to pay Rs 200 as fine for not wearing masks in public places, according to civic officials.In view of the coronavirus pandemic, authorities have made wearing of face masks mandatory in public to curb the spread of the infection.The K-West civic ward, which includes areas like Andheri West, Juhu and Varsova, has already made several violators sweep roads for an hour to deter people from roaming around without a mask.Vishwas Mote, assistant municipal commissioner (K-West ward), told PTI on Thursday that since the past seven days they have made people do community service in the form of sweeping roads if they unnecessarily argue with officials or refuse to pay fine for not wearing a mask.“Until today, a total of 35 people were made to do community service in the K-West ward,” Mote said.According to the officials, this punishment is being handed out as per the BMCs Solid Waste Management Bye-Laws that give the civic body powers to ask citizens to do various community services for spitting on roads.A civic official said initially most people show reluctance to do community service like sweeping roads, but they fall in line when they are warned about police action.“On realising that they made a mistake by not wearing face mask, some people readily agree to do community service,” the official said.Aiming to control the pandemic, the civic body is continuously spreading awareness among citizens about wearing face masks, maintaining social distance and practicing hand hygiene.Last the BMC had directed authorities concerned to disallow entry of people without masks in public buses, taxis, auto-rickshaws and even inside housing societies.

29-10-2020||Naveen S Garewal||Telangana makes land registration a 20-minute affair||Tribune News ServiceHyderabad, October 29 After the abolition of Village Revenue Officers (VRO) in a bid to clean the revenue department of rampant corruption this September, Telangana Chief Minister K Chandra Shekhar Rao (KCR) has launched the online ‘Dharani’ portal that will serve as one-stop for hassle-free transactions, be it registration or mutation, with minimum human interface.During the inaugurating function at Moodu Chintalapally in Medchal-Malkajgiri district, KCR said the entire process of land or property registration or mutation would not take more than 20 minutes.“This as a national trendsetter,” KCR said. “Gone are the days when people, particularly farmers, had to make the rounds of various offices for transactions, including registration and mutation, often greasing the palms of corrupt officials.”With this exercise, about 1.45 lakh crore acres of land in the state would now have clear titles that would go a long way in cleaning up the revenue records, reduce litigation and empower the farmers and other landowners.Telangana has during the Monsoon Session introduced the new Revenue Bill 2020 that aimed at addressing all land-related disputes on a permanent basis. It paved the way for the digitisation of revenue records and land transactions and simplified the registration process.The Chief Minister said that the common man would now be able to transfer both agricultural and non-agricultural properties on the click-of-a-button through the Dharani portal. He said once the success of the portal is seen by other states, they would soon adopt a similar revenue portal. “This is bound to have an impact across the country since both the Union and other state governments will now be under pressure to introduce similar measures to ensure transparency in land dealings and make the procedures simpler.”“Even before the formal launch of the portal, during the trial run in the past three or four days, officials reported heavy traffic since thousands of people not just from the state but also from other countries were accessing Dharani as they were keen on knowing the functioning of the portal and its uniqueness,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-makes-land-registration-a-20-minute-affair-162876
29-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt conducted aggressive contact tracing and testing, leading to rise in cases: Jain||Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday said the AAP government has changed its strategy by conducting aggressive tracing and testing in the city, attributing it as one of the reasons for a sudden spike in COVID-19 cases in the past few days.Jain said that it would be too early to say if this was the “third wave” of fresh coronavirus cases, adding that it may be “third wave”, but one should wait for one week to see trends.Amid the festive season and rising pollution levels, Delhi on Wednesday recorded over 5,600 COVID-19 cases for the first time, with the national capital witnessing a surge in daily cases.Talking to reporters about the new strategy which, he claimed, would be the “best strategy” to contain the virus, Jain said the Delhi government has started conducting aggressive tracing and testing of all family members and close contacts of those found infected with the novel coronavirus.“And, we are at times, testing them twice after a gap of 4-5 days. We don’t want to leave any positive case...we have changed our strategy that’s why the number of cases has gone up. I believe that this strategy would be successful,” Jain said.Asked if the government was not conducting tests earlier on the family members of those found positive for COVID-19, the health minister said that authorities would conduct test only those who had coronavirus-like symptoms.“Our main focus is that not a single (COVID-19) case should be left for testing. You can see a rise in number of cases, but it is a good strategy and its results should be seen soon,” he said.On being asked about the figure of 15,000 cases per day projected by experts in coming months, Jain said, “Figures have been projected by experts on surge in daily COVID-19 cases, but it may not reach that level. However, we want to be fully prepared.”     As per the Wednesday bulletin, 5,665 beds were occupied and 10,100 still vacant in COVID-19 hospitals, Jain said.He said that the number of RT-PCR tests, which are considered the gold standard for COVID-19 testing, is also going up in the national capital.Officials cited some reasons—festive season, cold, increase in RT-PCR testing and complacency in following anti coronavirus measures—for the spike in cases.Jain said the situation of death due to COVID-19 is fine as of now in the national capital.According to the health bulletin released on Wednesday, 40 deaths were reported, while 44 deaths were recorded on Tuesday, 54 deaths on Monday and 33 deaths on Sunday.“Day-wise fatality is one thing, but if we look at the moving average of 10 days, death rate is 0.99 per cent and overall case fatality rate is 1.73 per cent,” Jain said.On the resident doctors association of LNJP Hospital requesting resumption of non-COVID-19 services, Jain said, “We will look into that after Diwali”.On Wednesday, 5,673 fresh cases came out of the 60,571 tests conducted the previous day, with the Delhi government scaling up RT-PCR tests, whose count stood at 17,284.This is the first time when the number of daily cases in Delhi has crossed the 5,000-mark. The previous highest single-day spike of 4,853 cases was recorded on Tuesday.The number of fresh cases recorded on Monday stood at 2,832, and 4,136 on Sunday, while the figures were 4,116 on Saturday and 4,086 on Friday. The active cases tally on Wednesday rose to 29,378 from 27,873 the previous day, according to the bulletin.

The EC statement said Munger will get a new DM and a Superintendent of Police Thursday itself.Alleging that no action was taken against the SP and other police personnel over the Monday night incident, the agitators allegedly torched muffasil and women police stations in the town.They also allegedly set police outposts at Purab Sarai and Basudeopur on fire, and ransacked the SP office and several other police stations and outposts.The office of Sub Divisional Officer (SDO) was also allegedly targeted by the protestors, official sources said.Witnesses said finding themselves outnumbered, the police personnel at all these stations escaped from the premises.Official sources said the agitators went berserk and also tried to set kotwali and Kasim bazar police stations on fire, but there they faced a strong resistance from the policemen who fired in the air to disperse the mob.They burnt tyres near Rajiv Chowk in the Munger town, demanding action against the SP and the police personnel responsible for allegedly opening fire during the idol immersion procession.Additional Director General of Police (Headquarters) Jitendra Kumar told PTI-Bhasha in Patna that extra police force has been sent to Munger.Deputy Inspector General of Police, Munger, Manu Maharaj led a flag march in Munger town to bring the situation under control.The RJD-helmed Grand Alliance has strongly criticised the Monday incident, likening the district police with General Dyer of infamous Jallianwala Bagh incident in Punjab during British rule on April 13, 1919.IPS officer Lipi Singh is the daughter of RCP Singh, the JD(U) leader in the Rajya Sabha.Coming on the eve of the first phase of polling, the incident had its impact voting too as two of the three Assembly seats—Munger, Jamalpur—in the district witnessed lower voter turnout as compared to the 2015 polls. While Munger constituency had witnessed a poll percentage of 54.26 in 2015, it recorded 47.89 Wednesday. Similarly, the decline was from 49.70 per cent to 47.24 per cent in Jamalpur this time.But Tarapur constituency recorded a polling percentage of 54.80 this time compared to 52.66 in 2015.State minister and senior JD(U) leader Shailesh Kumar is in the fray from Jamalpur seat.Meanwhile, the police department has ordered the removal of in-charges of muffasil police station and Basudeopur outpost in connection with the October 26 firing and baton-charge incidents.RCP Singh was mobbed Wednesday by angry protesters demanding action against the “guilty officials” when he visited Begusarai, where polling is scheduled for November 3.Begusarai is the Lok Sabha seat of BJP leader and Union minister Giriraj Singh who had condemned the Munger incident and sought action against “erring officials no matter how highly connected they may be”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/violent-protesters-target-police-over-munger-firing-ec-removes-sp-dm-162869
29-10-2020||Guwahati||Gauhati HC asks for affidavit on how ineligible persons were included in the NRC||The Gauhati High Court has directed the NRC state coordinator to file a comprehensive affidavit explaining how a section of ineligible persons managed to include their names in the National Register of Citizens.The court asked the NRC state coordinator to file the affidavit within three weeks and list the case immediately thereafter.Hearing a writ petition by Rahima Begam against a Nalbari district Foreigners' Tribunal order declaring her a foreigner, the HC Bench comprising Justices Manojit Bhuyan and Soumitra Saikia said they had noticed that many names were included in the NRC by flouting laid down norms."Let the Assam State Coordinator, NRC, file a comprehensive affidavit and bring on record the situations along with necessary particulars, whereby inroads into the National Register of Citizens (NRC) may have been created by individuals who are undeserving and not legally entitled to be included in the NRC," the court observed.The affidavit will not be confined to Nalbari district only, but contain details of all other districts across the state as well, the Bench said in its October 19 order  which was uploaded recently."An issue of great importance is noticed in the present case. It is not a solitary instance, inasmuch as, in a number of cases we have noticed and recorded similar issues appearing," it added.The Bench noted that the name of the petitioner appeared in the NRC even when proceedings against her had been initiated and continued on the basis of reference made by the Nalbari Superintendent of Police (Border)."Such insertion of name is against the law ... As indicated above, this is not an isolated case," it added.Rahima Begam was declared a foreigner by the Foreigners' Tribunal No. 3 of Nalbari district on November 8, 2019 and she had filed a writ petition in Gauhati High Court on August 14 this year challenging it.The final NRC list was released on August 31, 2019 by excluding the names of 19,06,657 persons. A total of 3,11,21,004 names were included out of 3,30,27,661 applicants.As per the rules of the NRC, names of persons belonging to the categories of declared foreigners, 'D' (doubtful) voters and against whom cases are pending in Foreigners' Tribunals cannot be included in the historical document as well as with their descendants.On October 13, the NRC state coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma wrote to all the Deputy Commissioners and the District Registrars of Citizen Registration (DRCR) directing them to issue "speaking orders" for deletion of "ineligible" names from the final NRC as many of them and their descendants were included in the list.Though the letter did not mention how many people's names would be excluded, sources close to the development claimed that around 10,000 people had been identified whose names were "wrongly included" in the final NRC and would now be excluded.Though the final NRC list was made public last year, it has not been notified by the Registrar General of India yet. This leaves the historic and controversial document without any official validity.After the publication of the final NRC, almost all stakeholders and political parties had criticised it as a faulty document alleging exclusion of indigenous people and inclusion of illegal migrants.On August 31, state Parliamentary Affairs Minister Chandra Mohan Patowary told the Assembly that the Assam Government had submitted an affidavit in Supreme Court for re-verification of 20 per cent names in districts bordering Bangladesh and 10 per cent in the rest.

29-10-2020||New Delhi||SC stays HC order directing CBI probe against Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Rawat||The Supreme Court Thursday stayed the Uttarakhand High Court’s “drastic order” for a CBI probe into corruption allegations against Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, saying it was passed without hearing him and taking “everybody by surprise”.The corruption allegations levelled by two journalists pertained to the money transferred allegedly into the accounts of relatives of Rawat in 2016 to support appointment of a person as head of ‘Gau Seva Ayog’ of Jharkhand when Rawat was the in-charge of Jharkhand BJP unit.A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said the “drastic order” passed by the high court without hearing the Chief Minister has taken “everybody by surprise” as there was no prayer in the plea by the scribes to lodge an FIR against Rawat.“The state was not a party and all of a sudden, an FIR was ordered and such a drastic order was passed taking everybody by surprise,” said the bench, also comprising Justices R S Reddy and M R Shah.Attorney General K K Venugopal, appearing for Rawat, said that an FIR cannot be lodged without hearing the party who is the Chief Minister and this would “unsettle the elected government”.“An elected government cannot be unsettled like this. The question is can a suo motu order be passed without hearing the party,” Venugopal said.“A demand for resignation of the chief minister has already been made and the order has been passed without hearing the CM,” he added.Venugopal told the bench that the high court has “mixed up all grounds”.“The person against whom FIR is registered is bound to be heard especially in case of a person who holds a public office,” he said.“The high court passed the order disregarding the fact that this order may destabilise an elected government,” he said.“The high court is entirety wrong on law when it says that it can direct lodging of an FIR without hearing the party and the high court cannot be oblivious that it will result unsettling of the government,” he said.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the two scribes, said that he was not opposing the stay order but there was ample evidence in support of corruption allegation against Rawat.The apex court, while staying the high court order for CBI probe against Rawat, issued notices to the state and the two scribes Umesh Sharma and Shiv Prasad Semwal.“Issue notice. Counter affidavit be filed in four weeks,” the bench said.The apex court, however, has not stayed the part of the high court order by which it had quashed the FIR lodged against the two scribes in July this year under various provisions of the IPC relating to sedition, cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy.While quashing the FIR, the high court had ordered CBI probe into the allegations levelled against Rawat.The top court passed the order while hearing an appeal filed by Rawat against the high court’s October 27 verdict.The FIR against the scribes was lodged for posting a video on Facebook alleging that one Amritesh Chauhan from Jharkhand deposited money after demonetisation into the bank account of a couple, Harendra Singh Rawat and his wife Savita Rawat, who are allegedly related to the chief minister.Harendra, a retired professor, had lodged the FIR at a police station in Dehradun against Sharma and also alleged that the journalist was blackmailing him.The apex court, on October 16, had dismissed a separate plea by Sharma seeking transfer of three criminal cases pending against him to Delhi from Dehradun on the grounds of being targeted by the Rawat government.The top court had observed that “credibility” of Sharma’s “journalistic activity” was itself questioned by his member of the sting operation team.The top court had noted that Sharma faces 17 cases in Uttarakhand, four in Uttar Pradesh, five in West Bengal, two in Delhi and out of which one is under investigation of CBI, and another one at Ranchi, Jharkhand.In its judgement, the Uttarakhand High Court had said, “Superintendent of Police, CBI Dehradun is directed to register an FIR on the basis of the allegations levelled in para 8 of the petition in WPCRL no. 1187 of 2020 and investigate the case in accordance with law, with promptitude.”“This court is of the view that considering the nature of allegations levelled against Trivendra Singh Rawat, the Chief Minister of the State, it would be appropriate to unfold the truth. It would be in the interest of the State that the doubts are cleared,” it had said.“Therefore, while allowing the petition, this Court proposes for investigation also. In view of the nature of the allegations, this Court is of the view that the CBI should be directed to lodge an FIR on the basis of allegations levelled in para 8 of the instant petition and investigate the case in accordance with law,” the high court said.It had also observed that criticizing the government can never be sedition and unless the public functionaries are criticized, democracy cannot be strengthened.

29-10-2020||New Delhi||SC seeks Centre’s reply on plea alleging no approval for Remdesivir, Favipiravir to treat COVID-19||The Supreme Court on Thursday sought response from the Centre on a plea alleging that two medicines, Remdesivir and Favipiravir, are being used for the treatment of COVID-19 without approval.A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde issued notice to the Centre on the plea and sought its response in four weeks.Advocate ML Sharma, petitioner in-person, referred to the Bench — also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian — the World Health Organisation (WHO) report of October 15 and said nowhere these medicines were designated officially as medicines for coronavirus.The bench said it was only going to make the Central Government aware of it and, therefore, was issuing a notice.On September 16, the top court had said there was an approval by the Central Government on use of Remdesivir and Favipiravir as medicines to treat COVID-19.The top court was hearing a plea seeking the registration of an FIR by the CBI against 10 Indian pharmaceutical firms for manufacturing and selling these two medicines for treating COVID-19 patients allegedly without valid licences.Remdesivir and Favipiravir are antiviral drugs and their efficacy in treating COVID-19 patients has been a matter of debate among medical expertsOn September 16, the top court had referred to the New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2018, and said these medicines had been permitted by the government for the treatment of novel coronavirus patients.Seeking a CBI probe, Sharma had filed the PIL alleging that these two medicines had been wrongly manufactured and sold for treating COVID-19 patients without any valid licences from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation.Sharma has sought prosecution of the Indian companies for offences of cheating and criminal conspiracy besides under the provisions of the Drug Act, 1940.The PIL said these medicines had not been certified as medicines for COVID-19 to date by any country.“They are under trial and no country, including India, has issued a licence to manufacture and sell them in the country...,” it said.The companies are manufacturing and selling them at very high rates in India and people are paying that “due to the fear of COVID-19 infection” and are dying, it said.More than 300 doctors have died in hospitals where these two medicines have been supplied and it amounted to “exploitation of public” due to the fear of death.Remdesivir was introduced by Gilead Science Inc USA to treat Ebola Virus in Africa but it was not effective to treat Ebola virus as well, it said. Favipiravir was developed by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical and was actually approved to treat Influenza.The PIL has made the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation as parties.It has also made 10 pharmaceutical companies including Cipla Ltd, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Limited, Hetero Labs Limited and Zydus Cadila Healthcare Limited as parties.Stressing that there were no effective medicines for the pandemic, the plea said: “The Prime Minister has already initiated the process with Russia to import COVID-19 vaccine to manufacture and distribute in India through PSU Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals Corporation Limited (BIBCOL).” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-seeks-centres-reply-on-plea-alleging-no-approval-for-remdesivir-favipiravir-to-treat-covid-19-162824

The victim's colleagues at ISKCON said that they did not doubt his prolonged absence since Manoj often used to travel to preach Bhagavad Gita.Mathura Superintendent of Police (city) Udai Shanker Singh said that whenever police called Manoj's son for questioning, he would evade coming and would instead ask the police under what provisions of the law they were trying to interrogate him.However, when police checked his mobile phone, they found a history of the boy watching Crime Patrol episodes at least 100 times. Police said after several rounds of questioning, the boy finally broke down and admitted to his crime.The police arrested the boy and his mother Sangeeta Mishra, 39. They have been booked for murder and destroying evidence.The 11-year-old sister of the accused has been handed over to the grandparents.

Even the petitioners would like to see. Let's hear it next Friday," the CJI said posting the matter for further hearing on October 30.Headed by a Secretary-rank officer, the 'Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance 2020’, will have jurisdiction over NCR, including areas in Haryana, Punjab, UP and Rajasthan with regard to air pollution.The decision came three days after Mehta assured the top court that the government was in the process of introducing a law to deal with the menace of air pollution in Delhi-NCR. The top court had decided to keep in abeyance its order to appoint Justice MB Lokur (retd) as a one-man panel to check stubble-burning.According to the Ordinance, the Commission supersedes all other bodies/authorities set up through judicial orders or otherwise on air quality management and in case of a conflict between orders of the Commission and those issues by state governments, the Commission's orders will prevail.It means the newly set-up Commission - which is to function under the Central Government - will replace the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA) constituted by the Supreme Court more than two decades ago.Any non-compliance of measures or directions of the Commission will attract a maximum jail term of five years or fine up to Rs one crore or both.As senior advocate Vikas Singh, representing one of the petitioners, said the situation would get worse by next week, CJI Bobde said, "We will hear you, Mr Singh, and the Solicitor General too and look at the points made by you. This is not an adversarial litigation...."If any of the parties here fall sick because of air pollution till next date then you are solely responsible... Ensure no one falls sick due to air pollution," the CJI told Mehta in a lighter vein.The Bench said some experts had said that it's not only stubble-burning that creates pollution. "All of you should stop using the beautiful cars and start using bicycles now," the CJI commented.Earlier, the Supreme Court had on October 16 appointed Justice Lokur as a one-man committee to monitor the measures taken by governments of Punjab, Haryana, UP and Delhi to prevent farmers from resorting to stubble-burning.“It is necessary that there must be some monitoring of stubble-burning with a view to its prevention before it assumes abnormal proportions,” the Bench had said. But on October 26, the top court decided to put its order on hold after the Solicitor General said the government would come up with a law within three-four days to deal with air pollution problem.Despite a ban on stubble-burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to do so because of lack of financial incentives to switch over to environment-friendly farm waste management practices.Last year, Punjab produced around 20 million tonnes of paddy residue of which farmers burnt 9.8 million tonnes while the figures in Haryana stood at 7 million tonnes and 1.23 million tonnes, respectively.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stubble-burning-president-promulgates-ordinance-to-deal-with-air-pollution-in-delhi-ncr-162819

29-10-2020||Mumbai||FIR against Sushant Singh Rajput's sisters by Rhea Chakraborty 'vitiated': CBI||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday slammed the Mumbai Police for registering an FIR against late Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput's sisters on the complaint of Rhea Chakraborty, saying it is "vitiated" and "bad in law".The CBI made the submissions in the Bombay High Court while opposing the second FIR filed by Mumbai Police on the complaints of Rhea related to the death of Sushant.The CBI informed the court that the present FIR has been registered by Mumbai Police in complete disregard to the provisions of Section 154 of the CrPC.It said both respondent Rhea and Mumbai Police were consciously aware that an FIR has been registered by the Patna Police to look into the circumstances surrounding the death of Sushant, which has been transferred to the CBI for investigation.The agency said that the probe by the CBI was approved by the Supreme Court on August 19."Therefore, registration of another FIR on the same facts and cause of action was neither warranted, not allowed under the law. Thus the FIR is vitiated and bad in law," the CBI said.The probe agency also said that the allegations against the late actor's sisters in the FIR registered on the basis of Rhea's complaint are "presumptive and speculative"."Pertinently, the allegations levelled in the instant FIR are most presumptive and speculative in nature," it said.The CBI also argued that the Mumbai Police have not registered an FIR as an outcome of the inquest proceedings being conducted by them. Therefore, the Supreme Court judgement of August 19 does not allow registration of any such FIR.The CBI's reply came in the court after Rhea on Tuesday urged the Bombay High Court not to dismiss her case against Sushant's two sisters—Meetu Singh and Priyanka Singh—whom she has accused of helping the actor illegally access anxiety drugs using fake prescriptions from one Tarun Kumar in Delhi.The CBI in its reply also stated that if Mumbai Police or Rhea had any information on the death of Sushant, they should have been directly shared with the CBI for action. The FIR registered at the Bandra police station was not required, it said.The CBI also said that it received an application from Rhea dated September 14 through Mumbai jail authorities to "drop or delete" Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code in the FIR filed by the Mumbai Police on her complaint.The CBI stated that the procedure of dropping a penal section of law during investigation is a process unknown to law and the same cannot be done by the investigating agencies."An FIR which has been registered can either be quashed by Constitutional courts or culminate into a report under Section 173 of the CrPC. Therefore the request of Rhea to drop Section 306 from the FIR cannot be acceded to," it said.The CBI also said that it is conducting an investigation wherein Section 306 has been invoked in the FIR. "Thus the role of each and every person, whosoever had instigated or abetted the commission of suicide by Sushant, is being investigated," it said.The CBI also stressed that the agency is conducting investigation meticulously and professionally without being hindered by any external factor and would thoroughly go into each and every aspect relating to the death of Sushant in a fair and impartial manner.The Mumbai Police registered a case against Sushant's sisters on the complaint of Rhea alleging that they were helping the actor access anxiety drugs illegally using fake prescriptions.Rhea's complaint was based on WhatsApp chats between the actor and his sister on June 8 -- just six days before he was found dead at his Mont Blanc Apartment on June 14.The alleged chats between Sushant and his sister indicated that she had advised her brother to take three medicines banned under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.In her complaint, she pointed out that the alleged chats of Sushant and his sister were opposite to the family's claim that they were unaware of the late actor's mental health issues.The CBI had registered a case on August 6 after notification from the Centre on the request of Bihar government.The Bihar Police registered a case on the basis of the complaint filed by Sushant's father K.K. Singh on July 25 against Rhea, her brother Showik, father Indrajit, mother Sandhya, Sushant's house manager Samuel Miranda and former manaqger Shruti Modi, among others.A CBI team went to Mumbai on August 20, a day after the Supreme Court gave the nod for the federal agency to probe the matter.The CBI team has recorded the statements of Rhea, Showik and several others in the case.Besides CBI, Rhea is also being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). Rhea and her brother were arrested by the NCB. While Rhea was granted bail after 28 days, Showik is still in judicial custody.

Narendra Modi had succeeded him as Gujarat chief minister.Patel was a member of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly six times. He quit the BJP in 2012 and floated the Gujarat Parivartan Party, which performed poorly in the 2012 Assembly polls and merged with the BJP in 2014.Born in Visavadar town of Junagadh district in 1928, Patel joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in 1945 as a pracharak. He started his political career as a worker for the Jan Sangh."Though he recently recovered from coronavirus, his health kept deteriorating due to post-Covid effects in the body," said Patel's son Bharat Patel."We rushed him to a hospital here after his health deteriorated on Thursday morning. Though doctors tried hard, he could not survive," Patel told reporters.Patel was also the chairman of the Shree Somnath Trust, which manages the famous Somnath temple in Saurashtra region.Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani paid tributes to the BJP stalwart saying Patel's death is a huge loss for the people of Gujarat.Speaking at a rally at Ghadhada, where bypolls will be held on November 3, Rupani said, "Keshubhai Patel, the leader who made the BJP big from Jan Sangh days, who dedicated his entire life for service of nation and farmers, has died today.

29-10-2020||London||UK’s deep liquid capital markets can help India’s infrastructure needs: Rishi Sunak||UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has hailed a series of “ambitious” new UK-India initiatives across investment, trade, infrastructure, sustainable finance and research as he highlighted the role to be played by the UK’s capital markets in India’s infrastructure development.The Indian-origin finance minister, addressing the UK-India Investing for Growth Forum on the sidelines of the UK-India 10th Economic and Financial Dialogue (EFD) on Wednesday, said while a new Partnership on Infrastructure Policy and Financing would help catalyse private finance flows into India’s ambitious National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), a new Sustainable Finance Forum would help green up the financial partnership between the two countries.According to a high-level task force, India’s NIP has projected infrastructure investment of Rs 111 trillion during 2020-25.“Sustainable finance provides a significant opportunity for the UK-India relationship. In the next 20 years, India is estimated to require $4.5 trillion of investment in sustainable infrastructure. The UK, with our deep and liquid capital markets, can play an enormous role in providing private finance to meet that need,” said Sunak, in a virtual address to the summit.“Building on the unique strengths each country brings to our partnership – the UK’s deep and liquid capital markets and India’s extraordinary economic dynamism – together we can build an ambitious and exciting economic partnership and through our close and cooperative working relationship, show the way to global recovery,” he said.The address followed his ministerial-level EFD dialogue, also held virtually with Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, earlier on Wednesday, during which both sides concluded a broad range of agreements.A new annual Financial Markets Dialogue between India and the UK to remove regulatory and market access barriers for British and Indian firms, is set to kick start with a meeting early next year.It will be led by senior officials from the finance ministries of both countries and include the participation of financial regulators and private sector players.“India holds huge potential for investors, and the Indian government’s ambitious vision for infrastructure financing is a massive opportunity to drive the post-pandemic global economy forwards,” said William Russell, the Lord Mayor of London.“London has deep expertise in sustainable infrastructure investment and this event is a huge opportunity to mobilise capital ahead of COP26,” he said, in reference to the UK’s presidency of the UN climate summit COP26 scheduled for November 2021.A new strategic partnership to accelerate the development of Gujarat International Finance Tec (GIFT) City as an international financial centre, including regulatory capacity-building support for the new International Financial Services Centre Authority, was also flagged as a means to drive international capital flows from the City of London to India.“The UK is home to many world-class institutions from all stages of the investment lifecycle, from project conception to delivery and advisory. It is vital that we continue to leverage that expertise enabling us to collaborate ever more closely as we look ahead to COP26 in the UK next year,” said Catherine McGuinness, Policy Chair at the City of London Corporation.The corporation, the governing body of the financial hub of the UK capital known as the Square Mile, said the private sector-led UK-India Sustainable Finance Working Group, established earlier with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), is already working on reducing barriers to sustainable investment.“Much needs to be done to unlock capital for sustainable growth and together with the members of our working group, we hope to take practical actions in the coming 12 months to accelerate investment into India and deliver progress ahead of COP26,” said the co-chairs of the working group — Hitendra Dave, head of Global Banking and Markets, HSBC India, and Richard Abel, MD, UK Climate Investments.The UK government highlighted that since its first EFD with India in 2007, bilateral trade between the two countries has more than doubled to nearly GBP 24 billion in 2019.

He was released on the night of March 1 by Pakistan.Sadiq further claimed that the Foreign Minister had said this in a meeting between parliamentary leaders, including those of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and PML-N, and Army chief General Bajwa whose “legs were shaking and he was perspiring,” the report said.He said this without mentioning the date of the meeting.Sadiq said that he tries not to make any personal attacks but “when those in power refer to us as thieves or “Modi ka yaar” (Prime Minister Narendra Modi's pal), we will have to respond”.He also said that those running the government were not serious people.“The rulers don't even know the rules of Parliament,” he said.Sadiq said that the Opposition has supported the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan on every issue, including Kashmir and Varthaman, but it will no longer be appropriate to provide any further support, according to the Dunya TV report.

29-10-2020||Washington||2+2 ministerial dialogue brought ‘unprecedented cooperation’ between India, US: Lawmakers||Two eminent American lawmakers have welcomed the successful conclusion of the 2+2 ministerial dialogue between India and the US, saying that the deliberations brought “unprecedented cooperation” between the two countries.During the third edition of the Indo-US 2+2 dialogue in New Delhi on Tuesday, the two countries vowed to ramp up their overall security ties and inked a total of five pacts, including the strategic Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) that will allow sharing of high-end military technology, classified satellite data and critical information.The other pacts will facilitate cooperation in areas of nuclear energy, earth sciences and Ayurveda.The talks were led by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar from the Indian side and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark T Esper from the US side.“The US-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue has brought unprecedented cooperation between our two countries, pushing our Comprehensive Global Strategic Partnership to new heights,” said Congressman Michael T McCaul, Republican Leader of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.The achievements of the 2+2 dialogue, including the BECA geo-spatial cooperation agreement, add to a successful month, during which our two nations deepened the Quad framework with Japan and Australia, and welcomed Australia into the quadrilateral maritime Exercise Malabar, he said.In a significant move amid a Sino-India border row, India on October 19 announced Australia’s participation in the upcoming Malabar exercise along with the US and Japan, effectively making it the first military-level engagement between the four-member nation grouping — the Quad.“The United States will keep working with India to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific, and will remain steadfast as India seeks to defend its sovereignty from external aggression,” McCaul said.India, the US and several other world powers have been talking about the need to ensure a free, open, and thriving Indo-Pacific in the backdrop of China’s rising military manoeuvring in the region.In November 2017, India, Japan, the US and Australia gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the “Quad” to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence.In the midst of growing global concern over China’s expansionist behaviour, the foreign ministers of the Quad member nations met in Tokyo on October 6 and reaffirmed their collective vision for a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China’s increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China’s growing assertiveness.Congressman Brad Sherman, in a tweet, welcomed the successful conclusion of the 2+2 ministerial.“Great to see India & the US conclude another successful 2+2 Ministerial to further expand the US-India relationship,” he said.He said it was great to see that the US-India Parliamentary Exchange he established with his India Caucus Co-Chair last December has been mentioned. “Looking forward to virtually hosting the Parliamentary Exchange in November,” Sherman added.

29-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality borders ‘severe’ category||The national capital’s overall air quality inched closer to the “severe” category on Thursday morning as pollution levels rose sharply after a marginal reduction, primarily due to calm winds and spike in farm fires.The central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said a significant increase in the number of “fire points” was observed over Punjab (around 3,000), Haryana and Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday, which is likely to impact the air quality of Delhi-NCR and other parts of northwest India.Delhi recorded an air quality index (AQI) of 397 at 11 am on Thursday. The 24-hour average AQI was 297 on Wednesday, 312 on Tuesday, 353 on Monday, 349 on Sunday, 345 on Saturday and 366 on Friday.Also read: Stubble-burning: President promulgates ordinance to deal with air pollution in Delhi-NCRStubble burning share in Delhi’s pollution rise to 36 per cent: SAFARSixteen monitoring stations, including at Shadipur (406), Patparganj (411), Jahangirpuri (429) and Vivek Vihar (432) recorded the air quality in the “severe” category.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.A senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the wind speed dipped on Wednesday, which allowed the accumulation of pollutants.“Following slight relief, the air quality again entered the ‘very poor’ category by the evening,” he said.PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 420 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 10 am — the highest this season so far, according to CPCB data.PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.The levels of PM2.5 — finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream — were 227µg/m3.The PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large, dense cluster of fires that covered most parts of Punjab and some regions of Haryana.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration was 18 per cent on Wednesday.It was 23 per cent on Tuesday, the maximum this season so far, 16 per cent on Monday, 19 per cent on Sunday and 9 per cent on Saturday.SAFAR said accumulation of locally generated pollutants and increased external intrusion due to north-north westerly boundary level winds from regions where stubble was burnt, would be major factors for the increase in PM2.5 levels.According to the IMD, the predominant wind direction was northerly and the maximum wind speed was 8 kilometres per hour. The minimum temperature was recorded at 12.5 degrees Celsius - the lowest in this season so far.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.The city’s ventilation index — a product of mixing depth and average wind speed — is likely to be around 4,000 meter square per second on Thursday — unfavourable for the dispersion of pollutants.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.On Wednesday, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said only “green” firecrackers could be manufactured, sold and used in the national capital.He also said the Delhi government would launch an anti-firecracker campaign from November 3 and requested people not to burn crackers considering the seriousness of the situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, the Congress can’t stomach this," he added.The Union minister was in Indore to address a rally in support of the state's water resources minister Tulsiram Silawat, who is contesting the bypoll from Sanver Assembly seat here.

29-10-2020||New Delhi||At Bihar rallies, Rahul raises employment, migration issues||Starting the second leg of his campaign in Bihar today, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked PM Narendra Modi over the BJP’s economic and agricultural policies, saying people would chase away the PM if he were to again promise them jobs.Gandhi addressed two rallies in the state that witnessed phase 1 polling today and will go for the second phase polling on November 3.Tejashwi compares Nitish with Gen DyerRJD leader Tejashwi Yadav and Congress’ Randeep Surjewala on Wednesday slammed CM Nitish Kumar over the Munger firing in which a person was killed. The two compared the CM with Gen Dyer, who had opened fire on innocent people in the Jallianwala Bagh, and demanded a High Court-monitored probe into police shooting on a gathering of devotees out to immerse Goddess Durga’s idols.Addressing crowds at Valmiki Nagar in West Champaran and later at Darbhanga, Rahul said the Congress knew how to stand with the farmers and the labourers, but did not know how to lie.Striking a rapport with the voters, he hurled “chai- pakoda” jibes at the PM.The Congress chief termed “unfortunate” that Punjab’s farmers had to burn effigies of PM Modi over farm laws.“The PM did across the nation what Nitish did in Bihar in 2006 by launching the pilot project for the three Central farm laws. Now, farmers of Bihar are not getting the fair price for their produce,” Rahul said, alleging that the NDA partners were in no position to create jobs and had “turned a blind eye to migrants as they walked back home miles during the lockdown when no buses were arranged for them.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-bihar-rallies-rahul-raises-employment-migration-issues-162605

29-10-2020||New Delhi||PM invokes Ayodhya at rallies||Sharing the stage with ‘mitra’ (friend) Nitish Kumar at a series of public meetings in Bihar, which saw the first phase of elections today, Prime Minister Narendra Modi invoked the Ram temple at Ayodhya to underscore the NDA’s commitment towards its poll promises at a rally in Darbhanga.RJD raises MungerRJD leader Tejashwi Yadav demanded an HC-monitored probe into the Munger incident in which one person was killed. “Who gave permission to Munger cops to act like Gen Dyer,” he asked.Later in Muzaffarpur and Patna, in a scathing attack on RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, he cautioned voters against “jungle raj ka yuvraj”.As he went on to list achievements of the NDA and Nitish Kumar government, the PM said: “Bihar had two challenges: One from coronavirus and the other from those who wanted to make it ‘bimar’ (sick) again.”“Your one vote for the NDA can save Bihar from becoming sick again.... The NDA is creating jobs through reform, could Bihar dream of IT hubs in jungle raj? Can ‘yuvraj of jungle raj’ take the state forward? When I say the NDA, it means four parties: BJP, JD(U), HAM (S) and VIP,” he said, seeking votes for the coalition led by Nitish.Meanwhile, LJP leader Chirag Paswan fired yet another salvo at the JD(U) supremo, claiming that the latter was preparing to dump the BJP after the results and join the RJD, as done in the past. Chirag also claimed that Bihar would get a BJP-LJP government because the LJP would win more seats than the JD(U). “A single vote given to Nitish Kumarji will not only weaken and ruin Bihar, but will also strengthen the RJD and Mahagathbandhan,” he said.Sources said amid the negative perceptions mounting against the incumbent Chief Minister, the Prime Minister’s meetings were crucial for the NDA. Ground reports mention “less enthusiasm” at NDA rallies as compared to those by Tejashwi, who was targeted unsparingly by the PM in Muzaffarpur and Patna. “Consider what would happen if those who promote ‘jungle raj’ come to rule Bihar amid this pandemic, it will be a double whammy for Bihar,” the Prime Minister said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-invokes-ayodhya-at-rallies-162543
