I’m extremely proud of the initiatives undertaken by the Indian Army in the current security environment,” he said.The Army said the defence minister complimented the force for its high standard of operational preparedness and capabilities, which he experienced first-hand during his visits to forward areas.Talking about reform initiatives to strengthen combat capabilities of the armed forces, Singh mentioned plans to roll out integrated battle groups, integrated theatre commands and integrated air defence commands, and called them “game-changers” in the way Indian armed forces will fight future wars.Tributes to braveheartsIn his address, Singh also paid tributes to the “bravehearts” of Galwan, Kashmir and the Northeast for making the ultimate sacrifice in the defence of the motherland, the Army said in a statement.The defence minister, while commenting on the current situation along the northern borders, expressed confidence that while troops are standing firm, the ongoing talks for peaceful resolution of the crisis will continue, the Army said.His comments came ahead of the eighth round of military talks between the two armies. The fresh round of talks is expected to take place in the next few days.“It is our national responsibility to ensure availability of best weapons, equipment and clothing to our troops braving extreme weather and hostile forces to defend our territorial integrity,” the Army quoted Singh as saying.The defence minister also reaffirmed the faith of the billion-plus citizens in the Indian Army as one of the “most trusted and inspiring” organisations in the country, the Army said in the statement.In his address, Singh mentioned the stellar role played by the Army in guarding the country’s borders and fighting terrorism, apart from providing assistance to the civil administration whenever called for.“Actions of Indian Army truly ensure the integrity and sovereignty of our great nation,” he said.Referring to the situation along the border with Pakistan, the defence minister lauded the Army’s response to cross border terrorism and ceasefire violations and its excellent synergy with Central Armed Police Forces and police in tackling terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.“It is due to the synergised operations in the Valley that the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir is moving to a stable and peaceful environment conducive for overall growth and development,” he remarked.The top Army commanders are carrying out a comprehensive review of India’s combat readiness along the Line of Actual Control with China as well as the situation in Jammu and Kashmir at the four-day conference that began on Monday.The Army said its apex leadership is comprehensively deliberating upon all aspects of existing security scenarios, the situation along the borders and in the hinterland and challenges for the present security apparatus.Also, the conference is focussing on issues of organisational restructuring, logistics, administration and human resource management.In his remarks, Singh also described the creation of the post of Chief of Defence Staff and establishment of Department of Military Affairs as a “momentous decision” on the path of rolling out Integrated Battle Groups, Integrated Theatre Commands and Integrated Air Defence Commands.He said the concept will be game-changers in the way Indian armed forces fight future wars. “These were a result of the decision by the prime minister to undertake decisive reforms for transformational change to improve operational capability,” Singh said.He also alluded to the establishment of the Defence Cyber and Space Agencies which will enhance the kinetic potential of the forces, he said.The government had appointed Gen Bipin Rawat as Chief of Defence Staff on December 31 to bring in convergence among the three services and restructure military commands to effectively deal with future security challenges.The CDS is now planning to create theatre commands to help the armed forces prepare for future wars.As per the plan, each of the theatre commands will have units of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force which will work as a single entity looking after security challenges in a specified geographical territory under an operational commander.At present, the Army, Navy and the Air Force have separate commands.The defence minister also said that the government is focused on enhancing combat capability and ensuring the welfare of soldiers.He said that the Delegation of Financial Powers, Defence Procurement Manual and the Army headquarters restructuring proposals are currently under review and will be finalised soon.“The announcement of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) and notification of negative list of imports are big steps towards self-reliance in defence which offer a great opportunity to the Indian defence industry to meet the future requirements of the Armed Forces,” he said.On August 9, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced that India will stop the import of 101 weapons and military platforms like transport aircraft, light combat helicopters, conventional submarines, cruise missiles and sonar systems by 2024.Subsequently, the defence ministry released the first list of items, with a detailed timeline, which will not be allowed to import. The decision was aimed at promoting the domestic defence industry.The defence minister remarked that the decision to grant permanent commission to women in the Army is another significant step that will ensure equal opportunities for professional growth to all officers irrespective of their gender.Singh also said that the government is committed to corporatise the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) to enhance its efficiency and accountability.

Md. Danish along with a group of students, have blocked the road, erected a tent, and drawn electric connection from the control room of JNU security to the tent," read the notice issued to Danish.The notice also alleged that the act was in clear violation of the Supreme Court judgement against the illegal occupation of public space and also flouts several clauses "governing the rules of the discipline and proper conduct of the schools of the University".The Supreme Court, in its recent order passed on a batch of petitions against the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests in Delhi's Shaheen Bagh, has ruled that public places cannot be occupied indefinitely for protests, which must be carried out in designated areas alone.In a Facebook post, Ghosh said, "See the shameless attitude of the JNU Administration. Comrade Danish is suffering from dengue, and due to deteriorating health, he has been admitted today to Safdargunj Hospital."The JNU administration did not even bother to care about a student but sent security to the hospital to serve notice to Comrade Danish while he is on hospital bed to withdraw the protest happening at North Gate,"     The varsity recently announced the reopening of campus in a phased manner from November 2, for the scholars requiring laboratory access and project staff members.

Worlds largest contact tracing App, appreciated by WHO also."Clarification issued on Aarogya Setu App. Aarogya Setu App is a product of Government of India built in collaboration with the best of the minds of Industry & Academia. Worlds largest contact tracing App, appreciated by WHO also. #SetuMeraBodyguard #IndiaFightsCorona pic.twitter.com/mbhQ4pTuZw  The Ministry of Electronics and IT, in a release. said: “Since 2nd April 2020, regular press releases and updates have been issued on Aarogya Setu App, including making the source code available in Open domain on 26th May 2020. The names of all those associated with the development of the App and management of the App ecosystem at various stages was shared when the code was released in Open/Public Domain and the same was shared widely in media also.” The Information Commissioner was hearing the plea of one Saurav Das who had sought to know from the government details about the creation of Aarogya Setu application, the law under which it is functioning and whether the government was planning to bring a separate law about the handling of data collected by the application.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) did not provide any information, prompting Das to file a complaint under the RTI Act.He had filed a similar application before the NIC which responded by saying it did not have any information.During the hearing before the Commission, Das said the response of the NIC was surprising, as NIC is the developer of the application. He also said the ministry also did not provide any information relating to the mobile application’s creation and other matters.He told the Commission that many credible media reports have questioned the Aarogya Setu application, its making and handling, which makes it “of utmost importance” to bring transparency in the creation and handling of this application, which collects vast amounts of user and personal data of individuals. After hearing the submissions of ministry officials, Sarna noted that ultimately the steps taken till today failed to locate the source from where information can be accessed.“None of the CPIOs were able to explain anything regarding who created the application, where are the files, and the same is extremely preposterous,” she said.The Commission observes that it is a current issue and it is not possible that there was no file movement while creating this App. “A citizen cannot go round in circles to find out the custodian,” Sarna said.“The CPIO, NIC’s submissions that the entire file related to creation of the App is not with NIC is understandable, but the same submissions if accepted from MeITY, NeGD and NIC in toto, then it becomes more relevant to now find out how an App was created and there is no information with any of the relevant public authorities,” she said.“Therefore, the Commission directs the CPIO, NIC to explain this matter in writing as to how the website https://aarogyasetu.gov.in/ was created with the domain name HYPERLINK “http://gov.in”gov.in, if they do not have any information about it,” Sarna ordered.The Information Commissioner issued a show cause notice to four officials—Deputy Directors MeitY SK Tyagi and DK Sagar, Senior General Manager National E-Governance Division RA Dhawan and CPIO NIC Swarup Dutta.“The addressees cannot simply wash their hands off by stating that the information is not available with them. Some efforts should have been put in to find out the custodian(s) of the information sought, by the concerned public authorities when apparently they are the relevant parties,” she said.She directed the officers to appear before the Commission to explain why a penalty under the RTI Act not be imposed on them. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-info-about-creation-of-aarogya-setu-app-it-ministry-cic-issues-show-cause-notice-162399

Net sales, however, jumped to 47.77 billion rupees from 39.98 billion rupees a year ago.The drugmaker, which last week isolated all its data centre services as a preventive measure following a cyberattack, said it was a ransomware attack, but was yet to ascertain if any personal information was accessed.

28-10-2020||Hyderabad||Andhra Pradesh handcuffs and detains agitating farmers||The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has flayed the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) for what the former termed as “defaming” Andhra Pradesh as a state hostile to the interest of the farmers by allowing authorities to handcuff protesting farmers and shifting  them to a jail for a democratic protest. TDP national president and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has said that it was appalling to see the government treat innocent farmers in an inhuman way when they raised their voice for their genuine demands.“This is all the more shocking when considering that the person running the state was himself facing criminal cases,” he said. In a statement here, the TDP chief said it was a violation of human rights to use handcuffs after the cases have been withdrawn against the farmers.“There was not a single farmers’ family that has not shed tears in the past 17 months because of rising losses and debts and failure of crops. The ruling party was acting with a vengeance and subjecting the farmers to mental agony.” Naidu accused the Jagan Reddy regime of implicating and filing false cases against the farmers who cultivate, give their sweat and blood to provide food for others.The farmers, who expressed dissent against forcible acquisition of their lands, were persecuted and harassed, he said.The TDP chief demanded the government to prevent repetition of the atrocious incidents like the handcuffing and false implication of farmers. The government initiated action against the lower level police while giving a clean chit to the actual persons responsible for this chaotic incident, Naidu said.TDP politburo member Varla Ramaiah has written a letter to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) requesting for its interference and action in the farmers’ handcuffing incident.

28-10-2020||New Delhi||U’khand CM Trivendra Singh Rawat moves SC against HC order for probe into graft allegations||Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat moved the Supreme Court on Wednesday against the Nainital High Court order for CBI probe into the allegations of corruption levelled against him by a journalist.The high court verdict came on two separate petitions filed by two journalists—Umesh Sharma and Shiv Prasad Semwal—seeking quashing of FIR lodged against them in July this year under various provisions of the IPC.While quashing the FIR, the high court ordered CBI probe into the allegations levelled against the Chief Minister Rawat.      Sharma accused Rawat, who was then Jharkhand in-charge of the BJP, of alleged money transfers to accounts of his relatives in 2016 to support an appointment of a person in that state to head the Gau Seva Ayog.Rawat moved the top court by filing an appeal against the high court judgement through lawyer Divyam Agarwal, who has not yet divulged the grounds of the challenge.Congress wants CM's resignation The Congress demanded Rawat’s resignation."A chief minister, who does not tire of flaunting the state government's policy of zero tolerance to corruption, has no right to continue in office for a minute after an order like this," state Congress chief Pritam Singh told a joint press conference in Dehradun, held along with All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary and former chief minister Harish Rawat and the newly-appointed party in-charge for Uttarakhand, Devendra Yadav.Singh said the party is waiting for an appointment with Governor Baby Rani Maurya to seek her intervention in the matter.Harish Rawat described the court's order as "serious" and asked the chief minister to resign to help ensure an impartial probe into the case.  "After the high court's order, the chief minister should quit immediately to pave the way for an impartial probe into the charges against him," he said.The Congress leader said the party will take up the matter with the governor and continue to fight for justice in the case, using its democratic rights.Yadav, who is on his first visit to Uttarakhand after assuming the party's charge of the state, said the court order for a CBI probe into the allegations against the chief Minister shows the gap between what the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) says and what it does."It is shocking to see what the BJP government has come to in Uttarakhand after coming to power in 2017 promising clean governance," he said.The high court on Tuesday quashed an FIR registered against a journalist for a social media post alleging that a man from Jharkhand deposited money post demonetisation into the bank account of a couple related to the chief minister for the latter's benefit and issued instructions that a CBI inquiry be conducted into the matter.Issuing the order, Justice Ravindra Maithani also said all documents related to the case be submitted before the court.Sharma, a journalist, had had filed a petition in the court seeking quashing of the FIR lodged against him for the social media post, in which he had claimed that one Amritesh Chauhan from Jharkhand deposited money after demonetisation into the bank account of Harendra Singh Rawat and his wife Savita Rawat for the personal benefit of Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat.Bank statements were also attached with the post in support of the allegations. Sharma had claimed that Savita Rawat was the sister of the chief minister's wife. Harendra Singh Rawat had filed a case against Sharma at a Dehradun police station on July 31, accusing him of blackmailing.He had claimed that the allegations levelled by the journalist were false and baseless and that Sharma had forged the bank statements.Senior Supreme Court lawyer Kapil Sibal pleaded in the high court on behalf of Sharma.After hearing the parties, Justice Maithani quashed the FIR against Sharma and issued directions for a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the matter.

28-10-2020||Mumbai||Rhea’s accusations against Sushant’s sisters ‘speculative’: CBI||The CBI on Wednesday told the Bombay High Court that Rhea Chakraborty’s accusation that late actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s sisters obtained a fake medical prescription for him was “mostly speculative”.Such speculation cannot be the basis of an FIR, the central agency said in response to Rajput’s sisters Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh’s petition seeking to quash the case lodged against them by Mumbai Police.Chakraborty, Rajput’s girlfriend, has alleged that a fabricated prescription was used to help him procure medicines banned under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act only a few days before his suicide in June 2020.“The allegations in the present FIR are mostly presumptive and speculative in nature,” the CBI said.The Central Bureau of Investigation also pointed out that it is probing the complaint filed by Rajput’s father KK Singh against Chakraborty and her family members for allegedly abetting the 34-year-old actor’s suicide.Rajput’s sisters filed the petition through advocate Madhav Thorat on October 6 seeking that the FIR filed against them by Bandra police here be quashed.The CBI said the police should have conducted preliminary enquiry before registering the First Information Report.“It is settled law that two FIRs cannot be registered on the same cause of action....the CBI is already investigating the causes relating to the death of Sushant Singh Rajput and all aspects surrounding the same.“In view of this, it was expected from the Mumbai Police to forward the complaint received from Rhea Chakraborty to the CBI instead of registering FIR itself,” the CBI said.“Therefore, registration of FIR on the same facts and cause of action is both unwarranted and not allowed under law. Thus, this FIR is vitiated and bad in law,” the agency said.If Rhea Chakraborty was aware of the mobile phone chat between Rajput and his sister Priyanka in June 2020 during which Priyanka allegedly sent him a medical prescription, then Rhea should not have kept silent till September, the CBI said.It was conducting probe without being hindered by any external factors in an impartial manner, it said.The police’s FIR names Rajput’s two sisters and a doctor of the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital in Delhi, Tarun Kumar, who allegedly signed the medical prescription.The HC will hear the petition on November 4.

The quick trial and sentencing came within five months by the Additional District Sessions Judge in Warangal K Jayakumar. Yadav has been given an option to move the High Court against the capital punishment given to him. The judge said the prosecution succeeded in proving the guilt of the accused for under sections 449, 328, 380, 404 and 302 of the IPC. During the trial, the police established that all nine victims were rendered unconscious after being made to eat food laced with sedatives and then dumped into the well in Gorrekunta village of Geesukonda Mandal on May 21.  After the incident was reported by the owner of a closed factory where the nine victims lived, the police found four bodies of one Mohammad Maqsood’s family on May 21, the other five bodies – that of Maqsood, two Bihari youths and one Mohammad Shakeel were found on the next day. A 475-page charge sheet was filed on July 28 and the court examined 67 witnesses in the case and the trial was completed in 36 days of the charge sheet being filed. According to the charge sheet Sanjay was in relationship with Rafiqa (37), a niece of Maqsood’s wife Nisha who was separated from her husband. When the lady started prevailing upon Sanjay to marry her, Sanjay accompanied her on a train on March 6 and on the way throttled her to death. He dumped her body near Nidubrolu in Tadepally railway station limits of West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh.  After Sanjay returned Rafiqa’s relatives asked him about her whereabouts. To cover up one murder he killed the entire family to erase evidence and make it look like a mass suicide.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/man-gets-capital-punishment-for-killing-9-migrant-labourers-162380
28-10-2020||Pune||Countries with low GDP, poor sanitation had lower COVID-19 death rate: Study||Countries with poor hygiene and sanitation and low quality of water supply seem to have had lower COVID-19 Fatality Rates (CFR) compared to richer countries which do well on these parameters, Indian researchers have found.But they cautioned that it did not mean that poor hygienic conditions were desirable.Rather, the findings can lead to exploration of "immune training with possibilities of microbiome therapies", said Dr Shekhar Mande, Director General, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).Researchers from the National Centre for Cell Sciences (NCCS) and Chennai Mathematical Institute conducted the study – The mortality due to COVID-19 in different nations is associated with the demographic character of nations and the prevalence of auto-immunity.The paper, published in Medrxiv, has not been peer- reviewed.The study was made across 106 countries and based on 25 to 30 parameters, including demography, prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases, BCG vaccination, sanitation and COVID-19 deaths per million."Per million population (deaths) number appears to be high in countries that are richer and having high GDP, and (in) countries with low GDP, less number of people are dying, which is very paradoxical," said Mande, who is a co-author of the research paper.The percentage of people above the age of 65, who are believed to be at greater risk if they contract COVID-19, is significantly higher in high-GDP countries, said Mande.They also found higher auto-immune diseases prevalence in richer countries.Auto-immune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma "are prevalent in richer countries because they have very good sanitation such as hand-wash, basic drinking water, no open defecation and that actually led to more auto-immune disease parameters in higher GDP countries", said Mande."So all these parameters (demography, sanitation and prevalence of auto-immune diseases) combined together account for the fact that countries with higher GDP have higher death per million (due to COVID-19) than countries with lower GDP," he said.The research paper noted that poor hygiene practices and lack of sanitation were known to be responsible for the higher communicable disease burden in the low GDP countries."It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that parameters describing safe sanitation and safe drinking water to be correlated negatively with the Covid-19 deaths."Surprisingly, we find a contrary observation, where different sanitation parameters are correlated positively with the Covid-19 outcome," said the study."It is, therefore, perplexing to note the positive correlation of sanitation parameters with the Covid-19 Fatality Rates," it said."Countries which are poor and have less hygiene, they get more infectious diseases such as TB, malaria and countries which are rich with better hygiene conditions, there are no such diseases in abundance, but exactly opposite happened in our study (regarding COVID-19 mortality)," said Mande.Although the study provided a possible explanation based on sanitation practices on the CFR difference between economically stronger and weaker countries, it did not mean the researchers favoured weaker hygiene practices for handling future pandemics, he stressed."Rather this analysis opens up avenues to consider immune training with possibilities of microbiome therapies to supplement improved hygiene and sanitation practices," said Mande.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/countries-with-low-gdp-poor-sanitation-had-lower-covid-19-death-rate-study-162378
28-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi University vice chancellor Yogesh Tyagi suspended||Delhi University Vice Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi was suspended on Wednesday on the orders of President Ram Nath Kovind who has also directed an inquiry against him over allegations of dereliction of duty, according to officials of the Ministry of Education (MoE).The move comes amid a power tussle in the central university.The President, who is the Visitor to the university, has placed Tyagi under suspension to ensure that the inquiry is fair and that he is not able to tamper with material records or coerce the witnesses, a senior ministry official said.“All orders issued by or issued with the approval of Yogesh Tyagi during the period of his absence on medical ground are set aside and to be treated as null and void,” the official said.Tyagi has been on leave since July 2 when he was admitted to AIIMS under emergency medical condition. The government had on July 17 given Pro-VC P C Joshi the charge of VC, until Tyagi resumes office.The ministry official said, “The Vice Chancellor is not administering the university in accordance with (statutory) provisions...which has caused mis-governance and malfunctioning of University of Delhi. This is not conducive for appropriate academic as well as administrative environment of the university.”“The President of India in his capacity as Visitor of the University, on consideration of facts and material available on record, has ordered to conduct an inquiry into the allegations of dereliction of duties and lack of commitment and devotion to duty against him. The president has also been pleased to place Yogesh Tyagi under suspension with immediate effect until further orders as he may influence/coerce the witnesses and tamper with the material records of the university so as to ensure fair inquiry,” the official said.A controversy erupted last week when Tyagi removed Joshi as pro-VC on Thursday and appointed Geeta Bhatt, the director of the Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board of the university, in his place.Joshi had, meanwhile, notified the appointment of a new registrar, Vikas Gupta, whose interview had been completed and appointment cleared by the executive council on Wednesday.However, the same day, Tyagi had approved and notified the appointment of P C Jha as acting registrar and director of the South Campus.The ministry then intervened in the power tussle between the vice chancellor and the pro-vice chancellor, saying appointments made by Tyagi were not “valid” as he is on leave.The power tussle intensified with Jha writing to the ministry citing himself as “acting Registrar” and saying that all decisions taken by Tygai are in accordance with university norms. The ministry took objection to the letter and directed the varsity to take strict action against him. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-university-vice-chancellor-yogesh-tyagi-suspended-162377
28-10-2020||Patna||Modi will make Bihar ‘developed’ state if people vote NDA to power: Nitish||Bringing the ‘Modi factor’ to the fore of the poll campaign, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday devoted his speech at a BJP rally here to development works undertaken by the prime minister for Bihar and said Narendra Modi will make it a “developed” state if the ruling NDA is voted back to power.Lavishing praise on Modi, Kumar referred to a slew of projects to assert that the people of Bihar can never forget what he has done for the state.“Listening to his (Modi’s) appeal, if you give the NDA one more chance to work in the state, then you take it for sure that he will transform it into a developed state. Bihar will march ahead,” he said.Locked in a keen electoral battle with the RJD-led opposition amid a perceived anti-incumbency against Kumar’s nearly 15-year tenure as chief minister, the National Democratic Alliance is banking strongly on the ‘Modi factor’ to help it romp home.In the state capital and several other places, BJP’s posters carrying the prime minister’s photographs and its symbol, among with that of allies, have been put up prominently, assuring voters that he will bring them jobs—a central theme of the Bihar Assembly polls—and other developments in the same way he has brought them roads and electricity.In his speech, Kumar, the JD(U) president, spoke about the Patna metro project, smart cities plan and the Ujjwala scheme among other measures to laud Modi.He has done so much for building roads and bridges in the state, the chief minister said in his brief speech.Kumar also praised Modi for his initiatives in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Referring to the free ration scheme for over 80 crore poor in the country between April and November, the chief minister said, “This is not a small thing.”            The NDA has projected Kumar as its chief ministerial candidate.Opposition leader Tejashwi Yadav, the chief ministerial face of his alliance, has launched an aggressive campaign around the theme of “unemployment and corruption” in the NDA government in the state and has protected himself as a harbinger of hope and change.The NDA, on the other hand, has been raking up the issue of the “15-year-misrule” during the previous RJD regime from 1990 to 2005.

28-10-2020||Mumbai||Pawar blames Centre’s policies for soaring onion prices||NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday blamed the central government’s policies for the spiralling prices of onion and said he would speak to the Centre about the stock limit imposed on the commodity traders.Speaking to onion growers and traders in Nashik district of Maharashtra, Pawar said a comprehensive policy is needed regarding lifting of the export ban and stock limit of onion, and it should cover interests of all stakeholders.Onion is being sold at Rs 80 to Rs 100 per kg at retail markets in Mumbai.To contain onion prices, the Centre last week imposed stock holding limit on retail and wholesale traders till December 31 to improve the domestic availability of the key kitchen staple and provide relief to consumers.Retailers can stock up onion up to 2 tonne, whereas wholesale traders are allowed to keep up to 25 tonne, it said.To register their protest against the Centre’s move, traders kept off onion auctions for the last two days in all 15 Agriculture Produce Market Committees in Nashik, including at Lasalgaon APMC, Asia’s biggest onion market.Pawar on Wednesday urged traders to reopen the markets for auction, and said banning export and promoting import was contradictory and the stock limit condition should also be removed.He further said the Centre had excluded onion from the list of essential commodities and at the same time, there were raids against traders.“I don’t think the instructions came from the state government,” the former Union agriculture minister said.“The state government is not responsible for action against traders. The decision on import and export of onion takes place at the central government-level,” said Pawar, whose party is an alliance partner in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government.Nashik has always been known for growing quality onion and rise and fall in market prices affect onion the most, he added.Maharashtra is one of the top producers of onion and Nashik is a major hub of the commodity. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pawar-blames-centres-policies-for-soaring-onion-prices-162369

They may add their local UAE address in their passports,” he said.Change in address cannot be made in existing passports, the official clarified. Indian passport holders have to apply for a new passport in which the change in address can be made.The facility can be availed by Indian expats living in both rented or self-owned accommodations, the report said.Those wishing to give their UAE address should provide certain documents as proof of residence at the time of applying for a new passport for changing the address from India to overseas.Baraily said either the electricity and water bill or rent agreement/title deed/tenancy contract will be accepted as proof of residence in the UAE. Changing their address may help applicants to get quick police verification from India at the time of passport renewal.Police verification is now mandatory for the passport renewal of all Indian expats as per a change in the policy of India’s Ministry of External Affairs implemented since September.However, the diplomat clarified that police verification of Indians abroad does not require verification of the address of the applicant.“This [police verification] is just to verify the identity of the applicants as Indian citizens and that there are no criminal cases registered against them since the time of the last police verification done on them,” he explained.The mission is, however, encouraging Indians without a valid address to change their address, whether in India or locally, the report said.

28-10-2020||Beijing||China says border standoff with India bilateral issue; criticises US’ Indo-Pacific strategy||China on Wednesday said its border standoff with India in eastern Ladakh is a bilateral issue, and asked the US to “stop” its Indo-Pacific strategy, terming it as an attempt to impose American hegemony in the region.The remarks by the Chinese Foreign Ministry came a day after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo assured India that the US stands firmly with it to confront threats to its sovereignty.Pompeo’s remarks came after the third edition of the Indo-US dialogue in New Delhi during which the two sides deliberated prominently upon the Sino-India border row and situation in the Indo-Pacific region.Reacting to the US push for closer defence ties with India, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing here on Wednesday that “the border affairs between China and India are matters between the two countries.”“Now the situation across the border is generally stable and the two sides are in resolving relevant issues through consultations and negotiations,” he said, in apparent reference to the military and diplomatic level talks between India and China to resolve the standoff.In a blunt criticism of China, Pompeo cited the killing of 20 Indian Army personnel in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh in a clash with the Chinese military and said the US stands firmly with India in confronting threats to its sovereignty.“Our leaders and our citizens see with increasing clarity that the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) is no friend to democracy, the rule of law transparency...I am glad to say that the US and India are taking steps to strengthen our cooperation against all manner of threats and not just those posed by the Chinese communist party,” Pompeo said.Wang sharply criticised the US’ Indo-Pacific concept, saying “the Indo-Pacific strategy proposed by the US is preaching outdated Cold War mentality and preaching confrontation and geopolitical game. It is aimed to uphold the hegemony of the US. This runs counter to the common interest for the region and we urge the US to stop this.”         “In the meantime, any concept for regional development should be in line with the trend of the times for the peaceful development and win-win cooperation,” he said.The Chinese military has been flexing its muscles in the strategically vital Indo-Pacific region and is also engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea.Early this month, India, the US, Japan and Australia agreed to step up coordination in creating a free and open Indo-Pacific. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-says-border-standoff-with-india-bilateral-issue-criticises-us-indo-pacific-strategy-162363

28-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi schools won’t open for now, says Sisodia||All schools in Delhi will continue to be closed till further orders in view of the COVID-19 situation, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia announced on Wednesday.Parents are not in favour of reopening schools either, Sisodia said at an online press conference. The Delhi government had earlier announced that schools will remain closed till October 31."We keep getting feedback from parents that they are really concerned about whether it is safe to reopen schools. It is not. Wherever schools have reopened, COVID-19 cases among children have risen. So we have decided that as of now schools in the national capital will not reopen. They will continue to be closed till further orders," Sisodia said.Delhi recorded 4,853 fresh COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, the highest single-day spike here till date, as the infection tally in the city mounted to over 3.64 lakh, authorities said.The previous highest single-day spike of 4,473 cases was recorded on September 16.Universities and schools across the country were closed on March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.

According to ‘Unlock 5' guidelines, states can take a call on reopening schools in phases.

When I say NDA, it means four parties, BJP, JD-U, HAM(S) and VIP,” he said while seeking votes for the alliance.Listing achievements of the NDA government, Modi said the days of darkness of “lalten” (RJD's symbol) were over. "Can people who only thought about themselves fulfil aspirations of people," he questioned."Bihar will be the biggest beneficiary of Mission Dolphin. Today people want modem airports… they want river fronts, metros, passport centres in all cities... There will be an IT hub in Patna, other cities... Only NDA can fulfil these aspirations," he said, promising new opportunities for youth."NDA is creating jobs through reform, could Bihar dream of IT hubs in jungle raj. Can 'yuvraj of jungle raj' take the state forward in IT, people very well know answer to this," he said in an all-out attack against Tejashwi Yadav.Earlier, in his election rally at Darbhanga Modi evoked the Ram Temple issue in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh to congratulate people belonging to Sita's land – Sitamarhi in Mithilanchal.The construction of Ram Temple has started, he said, quoting it as an example of NDA's commitment.Bihar votes for 71 Assembly constituencies across 16 districts in Phase-1 of the elections on Wednesday.Meanwhile, cautioning people against 'jungle raj ka yuvraj', in his second rally in Muzaffarpur, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the people of Bihar needed a stable government in difficult times of coronavirus."These are not the times to do 'hawa hawai baten' (talk in air). Consider what would happen if those who promote 'jungle raj' come to rule Bihar amid this pandemic, it will be a 'dohri maar' (double whammy) on people of Bihar," said the Prime Minister."What can people of Bihar expect from 'jungle raj ke Yuvraj'... people here know these people well," he said attacking Tejashwi Yadav."Those who gave Bihar 'kushasan', 'arajakta', unemployment are looking for another opportunity… Those who gave Bihar migration, usurped people's money for their own family are promising employment to people...

(Beam) had a scheme to pay bribes to an Indian government official in exchange for the approval of a license to bottle a line of products that Beam sought to market and sell in India.This among others included efforts by a then-member of Beam's legal department to affirmatively avoid uncovering information related to improper activities and practices by third parties engaged by Beam in India that presented corruption risks.“Beam and its Indian subsidiary not only paid bribes to Indian government officials, they intentionally failed to implement internal controls to prevent bribery and falsified their books and records to conceal the corrupt activity,” Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C Rabbitt of the Justice Department's Criminal Division said.According to its admissions, Beam conspired with others to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by, among other things, engaging in a scheme to pay a bribe of Rs 1 million (approximately equal to US$ 18,000 at the then exchange rate) to a senior Indian government official in exchange for that official's approval of a license to bottle “ready-to-drink” products that Beam sought to market and sell in India through its subsidiary, Beam Global Spirits & Wine (India) Private Ltd. (Beam India).“Companies that use corrupt influence instead of competing in a fair, ethical, and honest manner should take note of today's agreement: paying bribes to obtain and retain business is not business as usual, it is a crime,” Rabbitt said in a statement. “US companies that attempt to gain the upper hand in foreign business ventures by engaging in corruption must be held accountable,” said U.S. Attorney John R. Lausch Jr. for the Northern District of Illinois. “The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act has a long reach, and for good reason.  It is critical that our global economy remain on a fair playing field.”               The Department of Justice press release did not name the Indian official or officials who allegedly received the bribes.The bribe was authorised by a high-ranking executive at Beam's Asia Pacific/South America regional business unit, who directed that the payment be made through Beam India's third-party bottler in order to conceal it, the DoJ alleged.Most of the corrupt payments were made through third-party sales promoters and distributors, who paid government officials to secure orders of Beam products at government controlled depots and retail stores, obtain prominent placement of Beam products in government retail stores, acquire and renew label registrations and licenses, and enable the distribution of Beam spirit products from Beam India's Behror (Rajasthan's Alwar) bottling facility to warehouses in other states throughout India.As part of the conspiracy, Beam also agreed with others to fail to implement and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls, which would have helped detect and halt Beam India's longstanding practice of making corrupt payments to Indian government officials, and to falsify its books and records. On numerous occasions, Beam was cautioned by outside advisors on the need to implement sufficient internal accounting controls relating to risks associated with improper activities by third parties in India, but Beam failed to implement sufficient controls.The company also maintained falsely recorded expenses, including corrupt payments concealed as commission expenses, and falsified certifications, including false sub-certification letters submitted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in its consolidated books, records and accounts, according to the DoJ press release.In July 2018, in a related matter with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Beam agreed to pay the SEC disgorgement and prejudgment interest totaling approximately US$ 6 million and a civil monetary penalty of US$ 2 million but the department is not crediting any portion of the penalty paid to the SEC because Beam did not seek to coordinate a parallel resolution with the department.In a statement, Beam's general counsel Todd Bloomquist said that the company began cooperating with the US government in 2012 and took corrective action, including temporarily suspending its India operations and terminating employees who violated the company's code of business conduct and ethics, Chicago Tribune reported.Company spokeswoman Emily York declined to say whether the five executives and employees referred to in court documents were terminated.The deferred prosecution agreement refers to the involvement of two executives in Beam's Asia Pacific/South America unit, one executive and one high-ranking employee in Beam's legal department and an executive of Beam India, but does not name them. The company continues to do business in India and has about 225 employees there, the report quoted York as saying.

28-10-2020||United Nations||Indian outfit wins UN award for efforts to combat climate change amid Covid||An Indian organisation that leverages tourism and technology to help remote communities access solar energy has won a prestigious UN award for its efforts to combat climate change amid the COVID-19 pandemic.The Global Himalayan Expedition (GHE) is among the winners of the 2020 UN Global Climate Action Award.GHE is one of the world's first organisations using tourism and technology to bring solar energy to remote communities.The recipients of the 2020 United Nations Global Climate Action Awards, announced on Tuesday, bring focus to the best examples of what people across the globe are doing “to combat climate change in a year that has cast darkness upon so many”.According to a statement on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) website, GHE is the one of the world's first outfits using tourism and technology to bring solar energy to remote communities as recognised by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) and the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO).In the Hindu Kush region, there are more than 16 million people without access to basic energy mainly due to their geographic remoteness.GHE conducts “Impact Expeditions” to remote Himalayan villages and uses a portion of the expedition fee to fund the capital cost of the hardware, transportation, installation and training of village-scale solar micro-grids.The micro-grid infrastructure set up by GHE is owned and operated by the community.To date, the GHE has solar-electrified more than 131 villages in three regions of India, directly impacting the lives of more than 60,000 villagers. More than 1,300 travellers from 60 different countries have been a part of these expeditions. Enabling livelihood through homestay tourism has generated over USD 114,000 in income for the villages, which represents a 45 per cent increase in the annual household income, the statement said.UNFCCC said this year's award-winning projects demonstrate leadership on climate change by nations, businesses, investors, cities, regions and civil societies as a whole. They range from the Caribbean's only carbon-neutral hotel to the world's first platform fully dedicated to green bonds to the first all-women solar team in Lebanon.Congratulating the winners of the 2020 UN Global Climate Action Awards, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the winners provide tangible proof that climate action is under way around the world.“It is exciting to see these climate solutions, which reinforce my call for decisive leadership on climate change by governments, businesses and cities, and for a green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Let us keep pressing ahead to build a more sustainable and equitable future for all,” he said.UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said the last eight months had been a nightmare for many throughout the world.“COVID-19 has altered lives, economies and the nature of business on every continent - from the largest cities to the smallest villages. It is the most urgent threat facing humanity today, but we cannot forget that climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity over the long term,” said Espinosa.Espinosa said the convergence of these two crises had opened a window of opportunity to build forward, to build cities and communities that are safe, healthy, green and sustainable.“Nothing exemplifies this better than the efforts of our 2020 award-winning activities to address climate change.”The award announcement is part of the wider effort to mobilise action and ambition as national governments work toward implementing the Paris Climate Change Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals.The UN Global Climate Action Awards are spearheaded by the Momentum for Change initiative at UN Climate Change. The projects are recognised as innovative solutions that not only address climate change but also help drive progress on many other sustainable development goals.The 2020 winning activities were selected by an international advisory panel as part of the UN Climate Change's Momentum for Change initiative."It is crucial we celebrate all actors who are leading the way,” said Gabrielle Ginér, Chair of the Advisory Panel.“The recipients of the UN Global Climate Action Awards send a strong political signal to all nations, and through their leadership and creativity, we see essential change.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-outfit-wins-un-award-for-efforts-to-combat-climate-change-amid-covid-162283
28-10-2020||New Delhi||As Bihar votes, all eyes on Modi's 3 rallies in state||As polling began Wednesday morning in 71 assembly constituencies of Bihar in the first phase of three-phase elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address rallies in three places in the state. At 10 AM he will address a public meeting at Raj Maidan, Darbhanga. It will be followed by speeches in Pachrukhi Maidan, Motipur, Muzaffarpur at 11. 45 AM and Veterinary College Campus, Patna at 1.30 PMThese are crucial meetings for the NDA in the backdrop of negative perceptions building against incumbent Chief Minister Nitish Kumar who has been caught losing his cool in public spaces several times in the past. It will be interesting to note what the Prime Minister says concerning Kumar, whose face appears to have gone missing from his posters—possibly an attempt by the BJP to ride on the prime minister's popularity and make it Modi versus the rest in Bihar.Observers say Nitish Kumar's taunt at an election rally about "having eight to nine children in the quest for a son" targetting Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav, is believed to have not gone down well with people.It as a proof of his "frustration over changed circumstances and public swell for Tejashwi", the eighth of former chief ministers Lalu Yadav and Rabri Devi's nine children, they say. Nitish Kumar is known for "good speak" in public and the "distasteful remark and anger in public " is contrary to his nature, they say.In a measured response, Tejashwi said even Nitish Kumar's insults were "blessings" for him. Later, he said the Chief Minister had insulted "women and my mother's sentiments".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-bihar-votes-all-eyes-on-modis-3-rallies-in-state-162281

This is the challenge of dynastic corruption (bhrashtachar ka vanshwaad), that is, corruption which is carried forward by one generation after another,” the PM said.“In the past decades it has been seen that when one generation involved in corruption escapes punishment, the next generation tends to be more brazen in committing such acts,” PM Modi noted while saying: “He sees that when nothing has happened to the one who earns crores at home, then his confidence is further enhanced.”The PM impressed upon the fact that there was “a need to have systemic checks, effective audits, capacity building and training against corruption”. He said, “Fighting corruption is not a job of a single agency but is a collective responsibility.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-dynastic-corruption-a-major-challenge-for-country-162043
