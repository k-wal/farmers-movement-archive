AIIMS report is a review of Cooper Hospital autopsy report. AIIMS did not have the benefit of the body which had been cremated. This same report was sent to the CBI. Dr Gupta met me and was firm on the question of suicide. But he had no explanation for the irregularities in the Cooper report.”Swamy said there are HC judgments permitting the police to refer autopsy reports to state medical boards for review and the same can be done in Sushant case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sushant-case-comes-up-before-parliamentary-panel-swamy-wants-aiims-post-mortem-report-reviewed-156691

These kind of conditions are imposed which are against the principle of law. Repeatedly such observations are being made,” senior advocate Sanjay Parikh submitted on behalf of the petitioner woman lawyers.Maintaining that the appeal had been filed under extraordinary circumstances, Parikh urged the top court to stay the bail condition imposed on the accused by the MP High Court.At one stage, the Bench sought to know from Parikh if he was making the submission only for Madhya Pradesh or for the entire country.As Parikh said he wanted the direction for all courts across India not to impose extraneous conditions for bail, the Bench issued notice to the AG’s office and posted it for hearing on November 2.The high court had on July 30 granted bail to a molestation accused and imposed a condition that he along with his wife shall visit the house of the complainant and request her to tie a ‘rakhi’ to him with the promise to protect her to the best of his ability for all times to come.Alleging that such an order amounted to trivialisation of sexual offences by courts, the petitioners said the bail condition further victimised the complainant and trivialized the trauma that she suffered .||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-seeks-ags-assistance-on-pil-against-trivialisation-of-sexual-offences-by-judges-156688

16-10-2020||New Delhi||FM writes to states explaining Rs 1.10 lakh cr borrowing window for meeting GST shortfall||A day after the Centre agreed to borrow Rs 1.10 lakh crore on behalf of states for meeting GST shortfall, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday reached out to all states explaining the contours of the special window.The Finance Minister's letter to states comes four days after the GST Council meeting failed to reach a consensus on the stalemate over the Centre's proposal of states borrowing against future GST collections to make up for the shortfall."We have now worked out some key aspects of special window. Based on suggestions of many states, it has now been decided that the Central government will initially receive the amount and then pass it on back-to-back to the states as loans. This will enable ease of coordination and simplicity in borrowing apart from ensuring favourable interest rate," read the letter accessed by PTI.Hence, it said, the quantum of resources available to the state was adequate to meet the entire amount of compensation which would have been payable this year. The interest and principal will be met from the future proceeds of the cess.States which were opposed to the Centre's earlier stance too welcomed Thursday's decision of Rs 1,10,208 crore borrowing by Government of India to meet the shortfall in GST revenue collection.Welcoming the move, Congress leader and former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Friday said the Centre had taken the "correct first step" and it should now work to re-establish trust with them."FM has written to the states that the Central government will borrow Rs 1,10,208 crore and give back-to-back loans to state governments. I welcomed the change of heart. There is no clarity on the balance of the gap in the GST compensation. FM's letter puts the number at Rs 1,06,830 crore for this financial year," Chidambaram said in a series of tweets.There is no clarity on who will borrow the money and how the debt will be serviced and repaid. States are opposed to borrowing on their own account, he said."States are right. There is no difference between the first amount and the second amount. Centre must resolve the impasse immediately by offering the same terms for Rs 1,06,830 crore as it has now offered for Rs 1,10,208 crore. Having taken the correct first step, I urge the PM and the FM to take the second step also and re-establish the trust between the Centre and the states," he said.A slowdown in the economy since last fiscal has resulted in a drop in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections, upsetting the budgets of states which had given up their right to levy local taxes such as sales tax or VAT when GST was introduced in July 2017.The four-page letter signed by Sitharaman appreciated the constructive cooperation of states in finding solution to the issue of GST compensation.Observing that the current financial year is unprecedented in terms of severe impact on revenues due to  the pandemic, it said: "The Union Government has also been badly affected by the fall in revenue and the enhanced level of expenditure required to meet the essential needs of relief and recovery and of state governments."It is against this background that the GST compensation issue is being resolved, read the letter.      Sitharaman said: "Long term macro-economic stability is the responsibility of the Centre, but it is also in the interest of the states who are partners in our system of cooperative federalism. The bona fide opinion of the Central government on this macro-economic issue is that borrowing on the books of Centre will not be optimal in the national interest."     The quantum of resources available to the state is adequate to meet the entire amount of compensation which would have been payable this year, she added.

16-10-2020||Kolkata||Teacher arrested for molesting student 23 years ago||A 37-year-old woman has managed to put her “molester” behind bars 23 long years after the alleged abuse, having found out that the accused continues to sexually prey on children.The woman, now a well-settled lawyer in Hong Kong, had filed a complaint in 2019 against her private tutor, who, she alleged, had molested her at her Darjeeling home when she was 14. The accused, in his late 40s, was arrested earlier this month in Siliguri.“Long way to go, this is just a small victory. The culprit’s bail application recently got rejected and I am thankful that the police have made a strong case against him,” she told PTI from Hong Kong.Asked what took her more than two decades to come forward and lodge a complaint, the woman said she was “scared and confused” and had no knowledge how to cope with her trauma, she said.“It can be really difficult to come forward with details of sexual assault and molestation, especially after burying it in some corner of the mind. I decided to file a complaint after I found out that the accused, a teacher in Siliguri, continues to sexually abuse kids,” she said.The lawyer maintained that she still struggled to talk about her experience.“The abuse had spanned for a month, and the nightmare haunts me to date. I want to stop other kids from going through the trauma,” she said.Darjeeling deputy SP (Town) Rahul Pandey said the police had swung into action immediately after receiving the complaint, and arrested the accused, a school teacher in Siliguri, earlier in October.“We have got proper evidence against this person. There are at least four victims we have spoken to and got hold of circumstantial evidence. The accused, who teaches chemistry, has been moving from one school to another. In the last 20 years, he has changed at least five schools,” Pandey said, adding that he has been remanded in judicial custody till October 23.The quadragenarian “admitted to his crime”, when evidence was produced before him, the SP claimed.He has been booked under various sections of the IPC for outraging modesty, criminal intimidation and word, gesture or act intended to insult modesty of a woman, the police officer said.

16-10-2020||New Delhi||Hong Kong bars Air India, Vistara flights till Oct 30 after passengers test positive for COVID-19||Hong Kong has banned Air India and Vistara flights from October 17 to 30 after a few passengers on their flights tested positive for COVID-19 post arrival, a senior government official said on Friday.This is the third time that Air India flights from India have been banned by the Hong Kong government for bringing passengers who tested positive for the infection after arrival. Previous bans were during September 20-October 3 and August 18-August 31.Vistara’s flights are being banned for the first time by the Hong Kong government during the coronavirus pandemic.Passengers from India can arrive in Hong Kong only if they have a COVID-19 negative certificate from a test done within 72 hours prior to the journey, according to rules issued by the Hong Kong government in July.Moreover, all international passengers are required to undergo a post-flight COVID-19 test at the Hong Kong airport.“A few passengers who travelled on Delhi-Hong Kong flight of Air India and Chennai-Hong Kong flight of Vistara on Thursday tested positive for COVID-19 post arrival,” the senior government official said.“Consequently, the flights of these two airlines have been barred from October 17 to October 30 by the Hong Kong government,” the official added.Besides India, a pre-flight COVID-19 negative certificate is mandatory for all passengers from Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa and the US, according to the Hong Kong government’s rules.An airline operating a flight to Hong Kong from any of these nine countries has to submit a form before departure, stating that all passengers onboard have COVID-19 negative certificates.Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23 due to the pandemic.However, the Indian airlines have been permitted to operate special international flights under the Vande Bharat mission since May this year and under the bilateral air bubble pacts since July this year.Under a bilateral air bubble pact, the airlines of both countries can operate international flights with certain restrictions. India has formed such pacts with approximately 17 countries.

16-10-2020||---||Woman has right to residence in ‘shared household’: SC||New Delhi, October 16Maintaining that the progress of any society depended on its ability to protect and promote the rights of women, the Supreme Court has clarified the legal position on “shared household” under the Domestic Violence Act, 2005 that has often been a matter of dispute between woman victims of and their in-laws’ families.Giving a liberal interpretation to “shared household”, a three-judge Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan ruled a woman was entitled to claim right to residence in a “shared household” where she had been living with her husband even if the said house belonged to his relatives.“In event, the shared household belongs to any relative of the husband with whom in a domestic relationship the woman has lived, the conditions mentioned in Section 2(s) (of The Protection of Women From Domestic Violence Act, 2005) are satisfied and the said house will become a shared household”, it said.However, the top court said, the DV Act didn’t operate against the landlord who would be free to initiate appropriate proceedings for eviction of the tenants of the “shared household”.  But here again the woman can oppose it on the ground of collusion between the tenants and landlord.The verdict came on a petition challenging a Delhi High Court order quashing a trial court decision allowing eviction of a woman from the first floor of her father-in-law’s house. Initially, she lived on the first floor of the house but later shifted to the ground floor with her husband. Thereafter, her husband sought divorce and she filed an application under the DV Act against her husband and in-laws.The top court overruled a 2006 verdict of a two-judge Bench in SR Batra versus Taruna Batra that had restrained a woman from claiming right to live in the house belonging to her mother-in-law on the ground that the hosue in question was not her husband’s.Noting that the 2006 judgment was not the correct interpretation of law, the top court said, “The right of occupation of matrimonial home, which was not so far part of the statutory law in India, came to be included in Act, 2005.”Hailing the DV Act, 2005 as “a milestone for protection of women in this country”, the Bench said, “The progress of any society depends on its ability to protect and promote the rights of its women.”Noting that domestic violence was rampant in this country, the court said, “The reason why most cases of domestic violence are never reported is due to the social stigma of the society and the attitude of the women themselves, where women are expected to be subservient, not just to their male counterparts but also to the male’s relatives.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/woman-has-right-to-residence-in-shared-household-sc-156679
16-10-2020||New Delhi||Pollution levels in Delhi dip slightly; stubble burning contribution 18 per cent||Pollution levels in Delhi dipped slightly on Friday with favourable wind speed helping in the dispersion of pollutants even as the contribution of stubble burning to the city’s PM2.5 concentration rose to 18 per cent, according to government agencies.With Delhi-NCR bracing for months of poor air quality, experts have warned that high levels of air pollution can aggravate the COVID-19 situation.The national capital on Friday recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 239. On Thursday, it was 315, the worst since February 12 when the AQI was 320.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said that meteorological conditions in Delhi have been “extremely unfavourable” for dispersion of pollutants since this September as compared to last year.PM 10 concentration between September 1 and October 14 this year has been more as compared to the corresponding period last year, said a CPCB official.CPCB Member Secretary Prashant Gargava hoped that with less area under non-basmati paddy cultivation in states neighbouring Delhi, the number of stubble burning incidents is likely to be fewer this time compared to last year.Non-basmati paddy straw is considered useless as fodder because of its high silica content and so farmers burn it.Gargava also said stubble burning peak might not coincide with the peak of adverse meteorological conditions this year due to early harvesting of paddy.NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large cluster of farm fires near Amritsar, Patiala, Tarn Taran, and Firozpur in Punjab, and Ambala and Rajpura in Haryana.But, a senior scientist at India Meteorological Department said the dip in pollution levels was likely because of an improvement in the wind speed up to 10 kilometres per hour.The Ministry of Earth Sciences’ Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said wind direction on Friday was northwesterly, favourable for the transport of pollutants from farm fires.According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration rose from around six per cent on Thursday to 18 per cent on Friday. It was only around one per cent on Wednesday and around 3 per cent on Tuesday, Monday and Sunday.With a marginal improvement expected in wind speed by Saturday, air quality is likely to dip further to the lower end of the ‘poor’ category by Sunday, it said.The farm fire count was 583 on Friday and the wind direction was favourable for the transport of pollutants. The contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration was around 18 per cent, SAFAR said.PM 10 levels in Delhi-NCR were 242 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 6 pm.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mould spores. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.The level of PM2.5 -- finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream—was 109 µg/m3, down from 151 µg/m3 on Thursday evening. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.According to the CPCB, the average ventilation index has been 1,334 metre square per second in September and October this year as compared to 1,850 metre square per second during the corresponding period last year.Ventilation index is the speed at which pollutants can get dispersed. A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants.Earlier in the day, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai issued directions for the imposition of Rs 1 crore fine on North Delhi Municipal Corporation for not taking action against garbage burning in Kirari assembly constituency area in northwest Delhi.Rai also directed the departments concerned to prepare a ground report for the implementation of the “Red light on, gaadi off” campaign to curb vehicular pollution.Severe air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contribute the most — 18 to 39 per cent—to Delhi’s air pollution.Road dust is the second-largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 per cent), followed by industries (2 to 29 per cent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 per cent) and construction (8 per cent).

16-10-2020||New York||India-China border clashes left relationship 'profoundly disturbed', says Jaishankar||The violent clashes on the India-China border in June had a very deep public and political impact and has left the relationship “profoundly disturbed”, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Friday.Tensions had escalated manifold between India and China after the Galwan Valley clashes in eastern Ladakh on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army also suffered an unspecified number of casualties.Jaishankar, speaking at a virtual event hosted by the Asia Society, said that India has built the relationship with China over the course of last 30 years “and a basis for building that relationship has been peace and tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control.”             He said there are multiple agreements, starting from 1993, which created the framework for that peace and tranquillity, which limited the military forces that came to the border areas, how to manage the border, how border troops behave when they approach each other.“So, from the conceptual level down to the behavioural level, there was an entire sort of framework out there. Now, what we saw this year was a departure from this entire series of agreements. The massing of large amount of Chinese forces on the border was clearly contrary to all of this.“And when you had friction point which was large number of troops at different points very close to each other, then something tragic like what happened on 15th of June happened,” he said.           “To underline the enormity of that, it was the first military casualty we had after 1975. So what it has done is, it has obviously had a very deep public impact, very major political impact and it has left the relationship profoundly disturbed,” Jaishankar said.Jaishankar said that apart from the Wuhan Summit in April 2018, there was a similar summit in Chenna last year and the idea of the summit was that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping spend time, talk to each other directly about their concerns.“What happened this year of course was a very sharp departure. Now it’s not just a sharp departure from the conversation, it’s a sharp departure over a course of relationship over 30 years,” he said.In response to a question on what did the Chinese actually do on the border and why they did it, Jaishankar said: “I haven’t frankly got any reasonable explanation that I can tell myself from them on this matter.“There are today a very large number of troops with weapons concentrated on that segment of the border and that is obviously a very critical security challenge that we face.”              In the special Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI) event, Jaishankar was in conversation with ASPI President Kevin Rudd, a former Australian prime minister. The two also spoke about Jaishankar’s new book ‘The India Way: Strategies for an Uncertain World.’ PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-border-clashes-left-relationship-profoundly-disturbed-says-jaishankar-156676
16-10-2020||New Delhi||DCHL promoters’ assets worth Rs 122 crore attached in loan fraud case: ED||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday said it has issued a provisional attachment order under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to seize assets worth Rs 122.15 crore of the promoters of the Deccan Chronicle Holdings Ltd (DCHL) in a loan fraud case involving a consortium of banks.The ED in an official statement said the attached assets belong to the DCHL and two of its former promoters — T Venkatram Reddy and T Vinayakravi Reddy and an alleged benami company floated by them.According to it the immovable assets consist of 14 properties located in New Delhi, Hyderabad, Gurgaon, Chennai, and Bengaluru. This is the second attachment in this case, the ED said, adding that with this, the total amount of assets attached in the case so far has come to Rs 264.56 crore.The ED had initiated investigation against DCHL and its management based on six FIRs and CBI chargesheet filed in Bengaluru in 2015. Another chargesheet has been filed by police and a prosecution has also been filed by SEBI against DCHL.“The total loan fraud committed by DCHL and its promoters is estimated to be Rs 8,180 crores. Investigation conducted under the PMLA revealed that the three promoters of DCHL— PK Iyer, T Venkatram Reddy and T Vinayakravi Reddy — hatched a well-planned conspiracy and manipulated the balance sheets of the company inflating the profits, advertisement revenue and grossly under-stated the financial liabilities of the company to paint a rosy picture for years to cheat the banks and its shareholders,” the ED alleged in its statement.The ED also claimed in the statement that the balance sheets of the company were allegedly fudged and loans taken from one bank were hidden from other financial institutions.“Over the years, DCHL availed credit facilities to the tune of more than Rs 15,000 crore. Money trail investigation revealed that most of the loans were cyclically rotated into group companies and were diverted to pay back older loans. Loans taken for working capital requirements and for business needs of DCHL were diverted to extravagant projects and the diverted funds which were so invested into new projects without the consent of the banks and were ultimately shown as losses,” the ED said,The promoters were allegedly also found to be re-purchasing the mortgaged assets at discounted rates through private treaties by using concealed proceeds of crime through front company, it said, adding that the net amount of loss caused is estimated at Rs 8,180 crores, including the unpaid principal loan amount of approximately Rs 3,000 crores.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dchl-promoters-assets-worth-rs-122-crore-attached-in-loan-fraud-case-ed-156675

16-10-2020||Aditi Tandon||No benefit of Remdesivir in reducing COVID deaths: WHO study||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 16Widely prescribed antiviral drug Remdesivir has shown little or no benefit in reducing COVID-19 deaths, the world’s largest trial on the efficacy of four repurposed drugs on COVID-19 mortality reveals ten months into the pandemic outbreak.Interim results from the WHO Solidarity Trial, which studied re-purposed anti-viral drugs Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir, and Interferon-β1a found none of these helped reduce deaths in COVID patients.The trial ran through March 22 to October 4, 2020, and followed 11,266 patients in 405 hospitals across 30 countries in all six WHO regions.“These drug regimens appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalised COVID-19 patients as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay. No study drug appreciably reduced initiation of ventilation in those not already ventilated,” said the pre-print of the study published today.Authors said the chief aim of the trial was to help determine whether any of four re-purposed antivirals could at least moderately affect in-hospital mortality and whether any effects differed between moderate and severe disease.“For each of these 4 repurposed non-specific antivirals, several thousand patients have now been randomised in various trials. The overall findings suffice to refute early hopes based on smaller or non-randomised studies that any will substantially reduce inpatient mortality, initiation of ventilation or hospitalisation duration,” the researchers note.Indian expert K Srinath Reddy, one of the study authors, told The Tribune, “This was the world’s largest trial on Remdesivir and three other repurposed drugs. None showed any benefit in reducing deaths. Of the 2743 patients who were given Remdesivir, 301 died and in the control group of 2708 patients who were given other treatments, 303 died. So, there was no impact on mortality reduction.”US-based Gilead Sciences, the makers of Remdesivir, however, issued a statement today, saying, “The emerging data appear inconsistent with more robust evidence from multiple randomized, controlled studies published in peer-reviewed journals validating the clinical benefit of Remdesivir. We are concerned that the data from this open-label global trial have not undergone the rigorous review required to allow for constructive scientific discussion, particularly given the limitations of the trial design.”Indian apex drug controller had earlier allowed Remdesivir for restricted emergency use in severely ill COVID patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-benefit-of-remdesivir-in-reducing-covid-deaths-who-study-156671

She said 37,000 puja committees across the state would benefit from the step.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamatas-puja-dole-court-says-money-to-be-used-on-sanitisers-masks-156669

The arbitrary and unconstitutional decisions of the Modi government of August 5, 2019, must be rescinded,” said Chidambaram.He said the coming together of mainstream regional parties of J-K to fight a constitutional battle to restore the rights of the people of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh is a development that must be welcomed by all the people of India“The central government must stop looking at the mainstream parties and the people of JK as secessionist or anti-national,” he said.J-K Congress chief Ghulam Mir had, however, not attended the meeting held at former state CM Farooq Abdullah’s Gupkar residence where six parties — NC, PDP, People’s Conference, JK People’s Movement, ANC and CPM — were represented.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-backs-j-k-alliance-wants-unconstitutional-decisions-of-august-5-2019-rescinded-156666

16-10-2020||New Delhi||Air pollution, hypertension among top-five risk factors for death in India in 2019: Study||Air pollution, hypertension, tobacco use, poor diet and high blood sugar levels were the top-five risk factors for death in India in 2019, according to a new study.The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study, published in the Lancet journal on Friday, assessed more than 286 causes of death and 369 diseases and injuries in more than 200 countries and territories across the world.It noted that India has gained more than a decade of life expectancy since 1990, but with wide inequalities between states.According to the researchers, including Srinivas Goli from the Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar, life expectancy in India has risen from 59.6 years in 1990 to 70.8 years in 2019, ranging from 77.3 years in Kerala to 66.9 years in Uttar Pradesh.However, they said the increase in 'healthy life expectancy' in India has not been as dramatic as the growth of life expectancy since "people are living more years with illness and disability.The study found that the largest contributors to increasing health loss in India over the last 30 years were non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like ischaemic heart disease, COPD, diabetes, and stroke.In 2019, the research noted that the top-five risk factors for death in India were air pollution (contributing to an estimated 1.67 million deaths), high blood pressure (1.47 million), tobacco use (1.23 million), poor diet (1.18 million), and high blood sugar (1.12 million).According to the researchers, over the past decade there has been more than 0.5 per cent annual increase in the exposure to several highly preventable risks such as obesity, high blood sugar, alcohol use, and drug use globally.They warned that the greatest cumulative impact on health comes from the striking rise in metabolic risks like high blood sugar, hypertension, and high cholesterol, which have risen 1.5 per cent a year since 2010, and account for nearly 20 per cent of total health loss worldwide in 2019.The study noted that these metabolic risks have grown by a staggering 50 per cent since 1990, and were responsible for a huge number of deaths globally – with high blood pressure contributing to 1 in 5 deaths (almost 11 million) in 2019, followed by high blood sugar (6.5 million deaths), high BMI (5 million), and high cholesterol (4.4 million).The scientists said several of the risk factors and NCDs highlighted by the study, including obesity and diabetes were associated with increased risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19.In the South Asia region, they said non-communicable diseases now contribute to more than half of the years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death, which was dominated by infectious, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases 30 years ago.Citing an example, the researchers said 58 per cent of the total disease burden in India was now due to non-communicable diseases, up from 29 per cent in 1990, while premature deaths due to NCDs have more than doubled from 22 to 50 per cent.According to the study, hypertension is the third leading risk factor after air pollution, responsible for 10-20 per cent of all health loss in eight states in India, primarily in the south."Most of these risk factors are preventable and treatable, and tackling them will bring huge social and economic benefits," said study lead author Christopher Murray, Director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in the US."We are failing to change unhealthy behaviours, particularly those related to diet quality, caloric intake, and physical activity, in part due to inadequate policy attention and funding for public health and behavioural research," said Murray.

16-10-2020||New Delhi||CBI searches 6 Indian firms in global Internet tech support fraud case, recovers Rs 190 crore||The CBI on Friday said it has recovered assets worth over Rs 190 crore during searches against six companies in India, which are booked in connection with a global Internet tech support scam case in which they targeted customers of Microsoft world over.Claiming that the agency has been collaborating with its counterparts in other countries for the purpose of investigation in the case, officials in the CBI said, its probe has received praise from the United States’ Department of Justice.    CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said, “During the agency’s searches on September 17, the sleuths also seized gold worth Rs 55 lakh, cash totalling Rs 25 lakh and a plethora of digital evidence indicating alleged nefarious activities of the six accused companies, based in Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.”He said the agency is collaborating “with US agencies and authorities of other friendly countries” against the fraudsters, who allegedly took remote control of computers of users by sending them a pop-up message of malware presence on their systems.Giving details of the modus operandi of the fraudsters the CBI officer said, “Once the user dialled the number given on the pop-up, he was directed at call centre executives who demanded huge sums of money to clean the non-existent malware and also installed unnecessary damaging softwares of the users’ computers.”Gaur said similar coordination is being done by the CBI with federal agencies of the other countries. The CBI has been making concerted efforts to identify and rapidly dismantle any such network of transnational cyber frauds operated out of India, he added.The central agency had conducted searches at the premises of accused companies - New Delhi-based Softwill Infotech Private Limited and Saburi TLC Worldwide Services Pvt. Ltd, Jaipur-based Innovana Think labs Limited and Systweak Software Private Limited, Noida-based Benovellient Technologies Private Limited, Noida and Gurugram-based Saburi Global Services Pvt Ltd., the CBI said in a statement.The searches were spread across various locations including Jaipur, Delhi, Noida, Gururgam, Faridabad and Mainpuri (Uttar Pradesh) at the premises of private companies and residential premises of accused persons in an on-going investigation in the case, Gaur said.The US Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a statement yesterday that in an “unprecedented collaborative” effort, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in India took actions in parallel with today’s filing against corporate and individual participants in the scheme located in Delhi, Noida, Gurugram and Jaipur.“The Department of Justice sincerely appreciates the CBI’s efforts to disrupt and prosecute technical-support fraud, government imposter fraud, and all other schemes directed at the American public,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Bossert Clark of the Civil Division in a statement in the US.The US authorities have filed a complaint in a Florida court against the scam on which the court had issued a restraining order yesterday to dismantle internet based infrastructure of the alleged fraudsters. According to the complaint Michael Brian Cotter, 59, of Glendale, California, knowingly provided US support for India-based accomplices in furtherance of the scheme, the DOJ said in the statement.The complaint has alleged that Cotter was working with Indian conspirators since 2011 to set up domains, setting up shell companies and putting in place payment infrastructure through banks and payment operators, it said, adding: “Individual victims are alleged to have reported paying hundreds to thousands of dollars to the scheme for unwanted and unnecessary technical-support services.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-searches-6-indian-firms-in-global-internet-tech-support-fraud-case-recovers-rs-190-crore-156650
16-10-2020||New Delhi||Govt to soon decide on minimum age of marriage for girls: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said the government will soon take a decision on revising the minimum age of marriage for girls after it receives report from the committee set up for this.The prime minister said the girls’ gross enrolment ratio in education has turned higher than that of boys for the first time in the country because of several efforts taken by the government in the last six years.Modi was addressing a video conference after releasing a commemorative coin of Rs 75 denomination on the 75th anniversary of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).“There is an important deliberation going on to decide what should be the ideal age of marriage for daughters,” Modi said.The prime minister said he has been receiving letters from women from across the country, asking about the report of the committee and when the government will take a decision on it.“I want to assure them, the government will soon take its decision after the submission of the report,” Modi said.In his Independence Day speech, the prime minister had announced that the government was deliberating on what should be the minimum age of marriage for women and has set up a committee to look into the matter.Currently, the minimum age of marriage is 18 years for women and 21 for men.Modi highlighted the efforts taken by his government in the last six years to fight against malnutrition.The prime minister said his government has taken an integrated and holistic approach to deal with the challenge of malnutrition.The government has adopted a multi-dimensional strategy to work on all those factors responsible for high malnutrition, he added.The government has started National Nutrition Mission, Modi informed.Highlighting other achievements, the prime minister said the government has built 11 crore toilets across the country under the Swachh Bharat Mission and has launched Jal Jeevan Mission to provide piped drinking water.The government is also providing sanitary pads at Re 1 to poor women, he further said.“Because of these efforts, for the first time, the gross enrolment ratio of girls in education is more than that of boys,” Modi said.On malnutrition, the prime minister said the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has closely followed India’s fight against this problem in past decades.Some departments at different levels in the country made efforts but the scope was either limited or scattered, he pointed out.Modi said pregnancy at tender age, lack of education and awareness, inadequate availability of pure drinking water and lack of cleanliness were some of the factors due to which the desired results against malnutrition could not be achieved earlier.Modi said he had started various programmes to tackle malnutrition in Gujarat when he was the chief minister of the state.After becoming the prime minister in 2014, Modi had said he started new programmes with fresh and holistic approach, based on his experience as a chief minister.Modi complemented the FAO for playing an important role in raising farm production and making efforts towards eradicating starvation and malnutrition across the world, including in India in the last 75 years.The prime minister said the commemorative coin of Rs 75 denomination has been released in recognition of FAO’s contribution and services.He also thanked the FAO for supporting India’s proposal to declare 2023 as International Year of Millets and said this will boost the availability of coarse cereals and enhance the income of small and marginal farmers.The government, Modi said, is making efforts to increase the production of millets and boost consumer demand.The prime minister also dedicated to the nation 17 recently developed biofortified varieties of eight crops.

16-10-2020||New Delhi||Pollution could worsen COVID-19 impact in winter: Experts||As smoky and hazy skies are back to haunt Delhi-NCR after a few months of blue skies and clean air, experts have cautioned people to brace for the winter season, saying higher pollution level may worsen the impact of COVID-19.Environment and health experts have asked people, especially those vulnerable to COVID-19 attack, to be more careful as the chronic exposure to air pollutants is associated with severe infections and higher mortality.They feel that lungs compromised due to pollution could lead to complications like pneumonia during COVID-19.“There is abundant evidence that exposure to air pollution increases our vulnerability to respiratory viral infections both in terms of transmission and the severity of the infection,” said Avinash Chanchal, climate campaigner, Greenpeace India.“Researchers have linked air pollution with mechanisms that may reduce our immune defenses such as damage to human airways, cilia and epithelial barriers. In the case of COVID-19, current evidence indicates that chronic exposure to air pollutants is associated with more severe infections and higher mortality,” he said.                       Every year the winter season brings with it cold, polluted air in northern India and the problem this year can worsen due to the pandemic.A layer of smoky haze lingered over Delhi-NCR on October 15 with the air quality in the region hitting ‘very poor’ levels, even as stricter anti-air pollution measures, including a ban on electricity generators, came into force under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).According to Health Ministry data updated on Friday, India’s COVID-19 caseload rose to 73,70,468 with 63,371 new infections being reported in a day.Doctor Shuchin Bajaj from Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals in Delhi, said at the onset of winter and stubble-burning, cases of asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) rise but one needs to be more careful this year because of the pandemic.“When your lungs are compromised and weak, you have more chances of developing complications like pneumonia during COVID. You have to take care of SMS - social distancing, mask and sanitisation more so in the coming days,” Bajaj said.According to SAFAR (System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research), contribution of farm fires to Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration was around 6 per cent on Thursday. It was only around one per cent on Wednesday and around 3 per cent on Tuesday, Monday and Sunday.NASA’s satellite imagery showed a large cluster of farm fires near Amritsar, Patiala, Tarn Taran, and Firozpur in Punjab, and Ambala and Rajpura in Haryana.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) swung into action on October 15 by sending its 50 teams to inspect pollution hotspots in Delhi and neighbouring cities and file reports from field for next two months.The Environment Ministry recently held a meeting with the CPCB and officials of Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh on stubble burning.Ravindra Khaiwal, Associate Professor, Environmental Health, PGI Chandigarh, said that air pollution has been identified as a major risk factor for premature deaths.“Air pollution has been identified as a major risk factor for premature death and non-communicable diseases. There are emerging evidence that air pollution could be linked with the severity of COVID-19 conditions,” he said, adding that stubble burning could spike pollution by 20-40 per cent.Experts advise that wearing mask is the most effective way to protect oneself from pollution as well as COVID-19.“Wearing face mask is single most effective way of keeping oneself safe from COVID-19 as well as pollution this winter. Avoiding strenuous outdoor exercise during peak pollution hours is also beneficial. For people with chronic lung diseases, it is very important to be compliant to their treatment,” Arunesh Kumar, Head Respiratory Medicine/Pulmonology at Paras Hospital, said.Piyush Goel, a doctor from Columbia Asia Hospital, Gurgaon, said while people need to follow basic principles of wearing masks, sanitising hands and maintaining distance, the government should ensure policy measures to prevent pollution.“Wear face mask covering nose and mouth upto chin, maintain social distancing and ensure hand hygiene. Face mask will also help to prevent impact of pollution such as particulate matters.“The government should ensure policy measures to prevent pollution. No stubble burning should be allowed, vehicular pollution should be avoided, and construction protocols should be followed. Besides, we must recognise that it is a collective responsibility of people to work together to defeat both COVID-19 and pollution,” Goel said.Khaiwal said the problem of pollution needs public policy and industry partnerships.“The government had last year launched the National Clean Air Program (NCAP) to reduce air pollution by 20-30 per cent by 2024. Public participation is vital as we are aware of the pollution problem. Still, our contribution is minimal, which we do by taking simple steps like recycling and segregating household waste, use of energy-efficient electronics and e-vehicles.“There should be policies to incentivise the public for walking and cycling. Cities should also adopt and promote a non-motorized mode of transportation. Industries should be encouraged to adopt a healthy business model having a focus on pollution reduction,” he said.India’s coronavirus death toll climbed to 1,12,161 with 895 fatalities reported on Friday.

We are fighting these elections with the JD-U, the VIP and the HAM(S) against the ‘apavitra gathbandhan’ of the RJD-Congress etc. It is a direct fight between NDA’s   ‘pavitra’ (pure) gathbandhan and ‘apavitra (impure) gathbandhan’, the alliance of extremism and corruption.” Patra said the LJP is fighting for its “existence and well being” but the way it is “spreading lies is sad and condemnable”.“Let me tell there is no place in politics for a ‘vote katua’ and somehow the LJP has emerged as a party that wants to cut votes,” he said, claiming that the “NDA alliance will win the upcoming three-phase elections with a two-third majority” about which “there should be no confusion or even an iota of doubt in anybody’s mind”.Chirag, on his part, said he felt “disappointed and sad” at the ‘vote katua’ accusation by the BJP.“Under pressure of Nitish Kumar, it is said that senior leaders like Bhupender Yadav and Prakash Javadekar are speaking the language of Nitish Kumar. They should remember they are calling Ram Vilas Paswan’s party ‘vote katua’. It is clear that Nitish Kumar is worried,” Chirag said, again asserting compete faith in “his prime minister”.BJP general secretary Bhupender Yadav, who is the party in-charge of Bihar, and Union Minister Prakash Javadekar also termed as “unfortunate” Chirag’s comments against NDA’s CM face Nitish Kumar and the JD-U. Chirag has been strategically criticising Nitish Kumar while praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and supporting the idea of a BJP chief minister in Bihar, earning the title of BJP’s ‘Plan B’ to ‘wipe out Nitish Kumar and the JD-U’.NDA’s rivals are having a field day who are using Chirag’s utterances against the incumbent CM to their advantage in their campaigns, ringing alarm bells in the NDA camp.  Notably Yadav, while reminding Chirag that he won the Jamui seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha election as a part of the NDA, also recalled how he praised the functioning of the Bihar government till as recently as February 2020.Questioning what then led to a change in stance in past few months, the senior BJP leader accused the Jamui MP of indulging in “politics of lies” to further his own interests. In his interviews, Chirag has been accusing the JD-U of working against LJP candidates in the 2019 Lok Sabha election in violation of the “coalition dharma”.While asserting support for the BJP and the PM, he also claimed that Nitish Kumar behaved in a haughty manner with his father Ram Vilas Paswan, whose death just before the elections has led to a certain sympathy for Chirag.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-slams-chirag-paswan-accuses-ljp-of-spreading-lies-156642

I welcomed the change of heart  "I welcome the change of heart," he said, noting that there was no clarity on the balance of the gap in the GST compensation.“FM’s letter puts the number at Rs 1,06,830 crore for this financial year. There is no clarity on who will borrow the money and no clarity on how the debt will be serviced and repaid.States are opposed to borrowing on their own account. States are right.There is no difference between the first amount and the second amount,” Chidambaram said.He said the Centre must resolve the impasse immediately by offering the same terms for Rs 1,06,830 crore as it has now offered for Rs 1,10,208 crore.“Having taken the correct first step, I urge the PM and the FM to take the second step also and re-establish the trust between the Centre and the States,” Chidambaram said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-to-borrow-to-compensate-states-for-gst-losses-chidambaram-welcomes-change-of-heart-156631

16-10-2020||Bengaluru||Bengaluru Customs cuts open gas stove to find drugs worth Rs 79L||The Bengaluru Customs has intercepted and seized Rs 79 lakh worth drugs—'Ephedrine'—from a steel gas stove at the Kempe Gowda International Airport Limited (KIAL).The seizure was made in the exports division on Thursday late night.According to the statement released by the Bengaluru Customs, they intercepted a consignment of steel gas stove, which was destined to Australia."As much as 1,983 grams of Ephedrine were concealed in four legs of the gas stove. We had to cut it open using a metal cutting machine tool," the statement stated.The statement further mentioned that the drug valued was neatly packed in plastic wrappers and placed in a hollow section of the pipes. The pipes were welded from both the ends and no one could easily detect or suspect anything from the outer look of the stove.The Customs stated that they got a tip off from the intelligence wing of the courier section.Meanwhile, the health experts told IANS that though it is prohibited, Ephedrine is often abused by sports players, especially weightlifters, college students, fashion industry, and even truck drivers are known to abuse the substance because of the performance enhancing effect of the drug.People who are wanting to lose weight, often use and abuse Ephedrine because of its association with weight loss, especially this is a big hit among the modelling and the film industry world over.This drug is found in nasal spray, tablets and liquid form. It can be swallowed, snorted, or injected, the source added.The source further claimed that most people who use Ephedrine do not realise that it is dangerous and addicting, therefore, they begin to abuse the drug, unaware of its harmful effects.The source observed that because Ephedrine is derived from an herb, users often think that it is a safer alternative to other stimulants. People will often use it in such an excess that they end up overdosing on it. Overdosing can cause serious health problems and even death.

16-10-2020||Satya Prakash||SC appoints ex-judge MB Lokur as one-man panel to monitor steps to prevent stubble-burning||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 16The Supreme Court on Friday appointed Justice (retd) Madan B Lokur as a one-man committee to monitor the measures taken by states of Punjab, Haryana, UP and Delhi to prevent farmers from resorting to stubble-burning that turns the entire NCR into a virtual gas chamber during October-November.“It is necessary that there must be some monitoring of stubble-burning with a view to its prevention before it assumes abnormal proportions,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said.It directed chief secretaries of Punjab, Haryana, UP and Delhi and EPCA to assist the committee in physical surveillance of fields where stubble was likely to be burnt and to devise additional means/methods for preventing it.“This order is not an indictment of any agency...We are only concerned that people in Delhi-NCR must be able to breathe clean and fresh air... While the court is shut (for Dussehra) we don’t want anything to happen during these nine days,” the CJI said.The committee is required to visit the affected states and submit fortnightly reports to the top court at the initial stages or “as and when found necessary”.The Bench asked heads of National Cadet Corps, National Service Scheme (NSS) and Bharat Scouts and Guides to provide young force to the panel for locating stubble burning and bringing it to notice of authorities concerned to prevent it.The order came on a fresh petition filed by two students—Aditya Dubey and Aman Banka—who suggested that Justice Lokur could be assigned the task.On behalf of the petitioners, senior counsel Vikas Singh pointed out that “there is a grave concern about the quality of air in the National Capital Region and that the quality is dropping rapidly. This is due to several factors, including the practice of stubble-burning in the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh and certain activities in the NCR of Delhi.”Singh said despite several measures taken, there was a reported increase in the amount of stubble-burning, leading to increased pollution in Delhi-NCR.On behalf of Punjab senior counsel PS Narsimha and for Haryana Additional Advocate General Anil Grover pointed out that several steps had been taken for stopping stubble-burning in the two states, including developing an App which can help in identification and notification of the particular field in which someone has burnt stubble.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Bench that the government had reservations about appointment of Justice Lokur committee for monitoring stubble-burning and the EPCA was already doing the job.  The court made it clear that appointment of the Committee was not intended to dilute the powers, functions and the authority of any authorities such as EPCA, already created.“The object of appointing a Committee is more to facilitate and coordinate the activities of different authorities so that the problem is resolved. The different authorities created by the States/Centre, shall also be free, to carry on their own activities, without feeling muted by the appointment of the Committee,” it said.The court will further hear the matter on October 26. The top court is already seized of a PIL on air pollution in NCR. It has been asking states of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi and the Centre to take measures to ensure farmers don’t indulge in stubble burning.Despite a ban on stubble-burning in Punjab and Haryana, farmers continue to do so because of lack of financial incentives to switch over to environment-friendly farm waste management practices.Last year, Punjab produced around 20 million tonnes of paddy residue of which farmers burnt 9.8 million tonnes of it, while the figures in Haryana stood at 7 million tonnes and 1.23 million tonnes, respectively.On October 6, the top court had agreed to examine a suggestion that a portion of Minimum Support Price (MSP) should be withheld from farmers and released later only after a verification that they didn’t burn stubble.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-appoints-ex-judge-mb-lokur-as-one-man-panel-to-monitor-steps-to-prevent-stubble-burning-156619

16-10-2020||New Delhi||India gained decade of life expectancy since 1990: Lancet study||India has gained more than a decade of life expectancy since 1990, but there are wide inequalities between states, according to a new study which assessed more than 286 causes of death and 369 diseases and injuries in more than 200 countries and territories across the world.The study, published in the Lancet journal, noted that life expectancy in India has risen from 59.6 years in 1990 to 70.8 years in 2019, ranging from 77.3 years in Kerala to 66.9 years in Uttar Pradesh.However, the researchers, including Srinivas Goli from the Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar, said the increase in 'healthy life expectancy' in India has not been as dramatic as the growth of life expectancy since "people are living more years with illness and disability".According to the international team of scientists, the current global crisis of chronic diseases and failure of public health to stem the rise in highly preventable risk factors such as high blood pressure, tobacco use, and air pollution have left populations vulnerable to acute health emergencies such as COVID-19."The main improvement we see in almost every country, including in India, is a decline in infectious diseases and more rise in chronic diseases," study co-author Ali Mokdad from the University of Washington in the US told PTI.  "In India maternal mortality used to be very high, but now it is coming down. Cardiovascular diseases used to be number five, and now it is number one, and cancer rates are increasing," Mokdad, Professor of Global Health at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), said.While many parts of the world have also controlled infectious diseases through immunisation and better medical care, he said some countries still struggle to manage these epidemics."The interaction of COVID-19 with the continued global rise in chronic illness and related risk factors, including obesity, high blood sugar, and outdoor air pollution, over the past 30 years has created a perfect storm, fuelling COVID-19 deaths," the scientists noted in a statement.In the South Asia region, they said non-communicable diseases (NCDs) now contribute to more than half of the years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death, which was dominated by infectious, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases 30 years ago.Citing an example, the researchers said 58 per cent of the total disease burden in India is now due to non-communicable diseases, up from 29 per cent in 1990, while premature deaths due to NCDs have more than doubled from 22 to 50 per cent.The study found that the largest contributors to increasing health loss in India over the last 30 years were NCDs like ischaemic heart disease, COPD, diabetes, stroke, and a group of musculoskeletal disorders.In 2019, the research noted that the top five risk factors for death in India were air pollution (contributing to an estimated 1.67 million deaths), high blood pressure (1.47 million), tobacco use (1.23 million), poor diet (1.18 million), and high blood sugar (1.12 million).The scientists said several of the risk factors and NCDs highlighted by the study, including obesity and diabetes are associated with increased risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19.They cautioned that urgent action is needed to address the synergistic epidemic of chronic diseases, social inequalities, and COVID-19, referring to the interaction of several epidemics that exacerbate the disease burden in populations who are already burdened."Most of these risk factors are preventable and treatable, and tackling them will bring huge social and economic benefits," said study lead author Christopher Murray, Director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in the US."We are failing to change unhealthy behaviours, particularly those related to diet quality, caloric intake, and physical activity, in part due to inadequate policy attention and funding for public health and behavioural research," Murray said.  Since 1990, the researchers said India has made substantial gains in health, but added that child and maternal malnutrition is still the number-one risk factor for illness and death in India, contributing to more than a fifth of the total disease burden in several states in northern India like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.According to the scientists, high blood pressure is the third leading risk factor after air pollution, responsible for 10-20 per cent of all health loss in eight states in India, primarily in the south.The researchers stressed that there is overdue recognition of the importance of social and economic development to overall health all over the world."Given the overwhelming impact of social and economic development on health progress, doubling down on policies and strategies that stimulate economic growth, expand access to schooling, and improve the status of women, should be our collective priority," Murray said in a statement.

We are preparing for elections to the remaining panchayat posts," he said.Gupta said the people of the region want peace, brotherhood and development."Whether it is Mehbooba Mufti (PDP chief ) or Farooq Abdullah or Omar Abdullah (NC leaders ), they can do whatever they want, but Article 370 is not coming back. They should also accept that abrogation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir will not be reversed and help people move forward."Regarding reports of support for the newly-formed alliance and the Gupkar declaration, the ex-Deputy CM told The Tribune: "Nothing will come out of it (the alliance). They are exposed. Anyone has the right to carry out political activities within the democratic system but anti-national activities/statements will not be allowed/ tolerated""They (Muftis and Abdullahs) have destroyed Kashmir, now they are fighting for political survival. Once elections are over, they will be scattered again. Most of their leaders have already left them, they have either joined the BJP or the Apni Party, " Gupta said.Notably, the BJP core group is scheduled to meet in Jammu on Friday to decide the course of action. State president Ravinder Raina has also termed Gupkar Declaration as an "anti-national agenda".Terming the Gupkar declaration an "anti-national and Pakistan’s agenda", he said: "People of Jammu and Kashmir have nothing to do with this agenda. They have already thrown the Gupkar declaration into the dustbin""West Pakistan Refugees, Gujjar-Bakarwal community, Valmiki community, Schedule Caste Community, Gorkha Community, women, all nationalist forces faced discrimination in past 70 years because of special status in J&K.

Anucheth, said that at around 9 pm, an incident of shooting occurred in the Cubbon Park police station limits."Shetty, aged about 45 years, was shot at by unknown bike-borne assailants in front of his bar located on RHP Road," he said in a statement released to the media.Shetty was shifted to the Mallya hospital for treatment but the hospital declared him brought dead.Meanwhile, Bengaluru city Police Commissioner Kamal Panth, who visited the spot, told reporters that the preliminary investigation pointed at the Managluru rivalry connection. "We have definite clues, we will arrest the culprits soon," he said.

16-10-2020||Washington||China, Russia and India spewing stuff into air: Trump||US President Donald Trump on Thursday blamed countries like China, Russia and India for adding to the global air pollution and asserted that his country has the best environmental numbers.Speaking to his cheering supporters at an elections rally in the key battleground state of North Carolina on Thursday, Trump said the US under his administration has achieved energy independence while protecting its pristine environment. “We have the best environmental numbers, ozone numbers, and so many other numbers. In the meantime, China, Russia, India all these countries they're spewing stuff into the air,” he alleged during the rally.He said the US has achieved energy independence while protecting its pristine environment. Trump in June 2017 announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris deal, saying the accord would have cost America trillions of dollars, killed jobs, and hindered the oil, gas, coal and manufacturing industries.He has continuously argued that countries like China and India are benefiting the most from the Paris agreement and the agreement itself was unfair to the US, as it badly hit its businesses and jobs.During Thursday's rally too, Trump said to the cheering crowd that it was a few nations that were contributing to global pollution.     “I keep telling my people you know, I love clean air but Russia and China, you look at a map you have all these spots and India and many others are spewing it in. What do you suggest?” he asked his thousands of supporters who had gathered at a city airport here to listen to his election speech.Trump also mocked at those who call for replacing plastic with paper.“Well, we don't think you should sell straws anymore. Oh great ok. You ever hear that, the straw, right? I say ok the straw is good, what about the plastic plate? What about the carton? What about the glass that's out of plastic? Well, we'll get to that later. These people are crazy,” he said.In his speech, Trump also talked about jobs for the Americans and mentioned that he recently fired the head of a semi-private company for replacing American workers with foreign workers. “The chairman of Tennessee Valley Authority was fired because he replaced American workforce with foreign workers. I told the board chairman, chairman, you're fired. Out. You're fired, chairman,” he said.       “And what happened is as soon as I said that they hired all the employees back from Tennessee and five other states, six other states. They're all back and they were great. They were great. So we do our little things, right? We did that one and it was great,” he said.Trump alleged that the immigration plan of his Democratic opponent Joe Biden is the most extreme in the history of the country.“Biden's plan would eliminate US borders by implementing nationwide catch and release that's catch, murderer comes over you catch him. What do you do? Well, not much. Most of them don't say they kill people right? You catch them. You take their name and you release them into our country. It was a big deal, it sounds easy,” he said, adding that he ended catch and release.“One of the worst things. Now we release them. You know where we release them? We release them back into their country. We don't release them into our country anymore. We say congratulations we got them,” he said. Biden in one of his rally on Wednesday said that if voted to power he would give citizenship to 11 million illegal immigrants. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-russia-and-india-spewing-stuff-into-air-trump-156597

When it rains, there is no range and we have to wait for showers to stop to resume our classes, Ekdo added.The area has mobile towers of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), but according to locals, Internet connectivity is often poor.Pravita Gaonkar, who studies at the Government College in Quepem, said they often come across snakes on the plateau.We have seen several snakes crawling on the plateau.But we have no other option but to come here as we can't miss our online classes, she said.When contacted, a senior official from the district administration said efforts are on to ensure that all BSNL towers in the area are functional.He said the issue of poor Internet connectivity and hardship faced by students has been discussed at review meetings held in the district collectorate.

A section of netizens claimed that the police had pulled his turban during the scuffle, following which it came off.The man was identified as 43-year-old Balwinder Singh, a resident of Bhatinda in Punjab.He was arrested with a loaded pistol."As per the National Database of Arms Licences, Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India; the Arms licence of Sh Balwindar Singh is valid only in Rajouri distt of J&K. He was arrested for being part of an unlawful assembly with a weapon," the Howrah city police tweeted."Please do not get carried away by fabricated social media posts. A thorough investigation is going on to unearth the truth," it further said.Singh's family members have arrived in Kolkata and met him twice in police custody. They have also visited the Raj Bhavan, and urged Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to make arrangements for his release."He will be in police custody till Sunday. Thereafter, Singh will be produced before court," a police officer said.The turban controversy has emerged as a political flashpoint between the TMC and the BJP, with the safrom camp accusing the ruling party of hurting religious sentiments.The state government had said that a political outfit was deliberately giving "communal colour" to the incident to serve its "narrow partisan interest".The state home department had also said Singh was arrested in accordance with the law for carrying illegal firearms during BJP's march to the state secretariat.Violence had erupted in Kolkata and adjoining Howrah on October 8, as BJP activists tried to go past barricades put up by the police to stop their rally at the secretariat.The police later said the rally was taken out by the saffrom camp without proper permission.

Even Pakistan and Afghanistan handled Covid better than India," Gandhi tweeted with the chart.The former Congress chief on Wednesday had also taken a dig at the government over IMF growth projections showing Bangladesh closing in on India in terms of per capita GDP this year and described it as a "solid achievement" of six years of BJP's "hate-filled cultural nationalism".The Indian economy, severely hit by the coronavirus pandemic, is projected to contract by 10.3 per cent this year, the International Monetary Fund had said on Tuesday.However, India is likely to bounce back with an impressive 8.8 per cent growth rate in 2021, thus regaining the position of the fastest growing emerging economy, surpassing China's projected growth rate of 8.2 per cent, the IMF said in its latest 'World Economic Outlook' report.
