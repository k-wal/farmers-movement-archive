21-09-2020||New Delhi||Print & electronic media rarely cross line, digital media is completely uncontrolled: Centre to SC||The print and electronic media ‚Äúrarely cross the line‚Äù by the very nature of their composition but the digital media is ‚Äúcompletely uncontrolled‚Äù and ‚Äúremains unregulated‚Äù by and large, the Centre has told the Supreme Court.The government said if the apex court considers it necessary to lay down guidelines for mainstream electronic and print media, it is the ‚Äúneed of the hour‚Äù that the exercise should start first with web based digital media.In a fresh affidavit filed by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting said the top court may leave wider issues to be decided the central government and the competent legislature or start the exercise with digital media.The affidavit was filed in a pending matter in which the apex court is hearing a petition which has raised grievance over Sudarshan TV‚Äôs ‚ÄòBindas Bol‚Äô programme whose promo had claimed that channel would show the ‚Äòbig expose on conspiracy to infiltrate Muslims in government service‚Äô.The Centre had last week filed a short affidavit in the matter and said that if the Supreme Court decides on the issue of media regulation then such an exercise should be undertaken with the digital media first as it has faster reach and information has the potential to go viral due to applications like WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook.The fresh affidavit further said: ‚ÄúBy the very nature of its composition, the print and electronic media would rarely cross the line which may need intervention of this court frequently. As against that, by its very nature the web based digital media, by and large, remains unregulated.‚Äù ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†It said as against the limitation in case of print media and mainstream electronic media, nothing is required for accessing digital media except a smart phone.‚ÄúThis shows its potential spread and its potential to harm the very fabric of any nation. The electronic media would normally have a geographical barrier and would rarely have a global presence. The digital media, on the other hand, has global presence both in terms of content coming from out of India and the content going out from within the country,‚Äù it said.‚ÄúAs against this, there is absolutely no check on the web based digital media. Apart from spreading venomous hatred, deliberate and intended instigation to not only cause violence but even terrorism it is also capable of indulging in tarnishing the image of individuals and institutions. The said practice is, in fact, rampant,‚Äù the affidavit said.It said any further regulation of electronic and print media by the court, either by way of guidelines or providing for any redressal mechanism, would incentivise broadcasters to use electronic media less and telecast/ publish the same thing on digital platforms which would remain unregulated despite having wider reach without any corresponding responsibility or obligation.‚ÄúHowever, if this court considers it necessary to lay down guidelines for the mainstream electronic and print media (which is not required as pointed out hereinabove), it is the need of the hour that this court starts the said exercise first with ‚Äòweb based digital media‚Äô which includes ‚Äòweb magazines‚Äô and ‚Äòweb-based news channels‚Äô and ‚Äòweb-based news-papers‚Äô as the same not only has a very wide reach but is completely uncontrolled,‚Äù it said.It reiterated that regulation of electronic and print media is substantially occupied by either legislative field or judicial pronouncements.‚ÄúBy and large the dividing line---what is freedom of expression and what is not--- is also capable of being culled out through various judicial pronouncements. The term ‚Äòhate speech‚Äô by its very nature is incapable of being precisely defined except by considering each case depending upon the facts arising therefrom,‚Äù it said.It said the court may not widen the scope of the plea by laying down any wider guidelines of general application and may leave the same to the competent legislature to provide the same.‚ÄúIt is also relevant to note that in case of electronic and print media, the security of the nation is also taken care of at the time of the registration and/or grant of license to the company or the organization intending to publish or broadcast either newspaper or a news-channel,‚Äù it said.It said that India has about 385 regular news channels which are registered or licensed by the central government under the Uplinking and Downlinking Policy Guidelines.It said that News Broadcasters Association (NBA) is not the sole association having all broadcasters as its members and as is a non-statutory voluntary body, its membership is also voluntary.It said another similar association News Broadcasters Federation (NBF) is also a voluntary organisation having several broadcasters including regional channels as its members.‚ÄúBoth these two associations have their own self-regulatory mechanism which is not only robust but can inspire confidence as both such self-regulatory mechanism are headed by a former judge of this court,‚Äù it said.It said self-regulatory mechanism for redressal of complaints in case of all the aforesaid organisations are, by and large, effective and ensures impartiality.It said membership of such organisations does require examination as no broadcaster can be compelled to become a member of any of the voluntary organisations compulsorily.‚ÄúThis question is under examination of the central government as regards the manner and procedure to ensure one statutory umbrella mechanism redressal of grievances while completely ensuring journalistic freedom..,‚Äù it said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/print-electronic-media-rarely-cross-line-digital-media-is-completely-uncontrolled-centre-to-sc-144562

21-09-2020||New Delhi||Privatise select PSU banks, dilute role of DFS: Raghuram Rajan||Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan on Monday suggested the government to privatise select public sector banks, set up a bad bank to deal with NPAs and dilute the role of Department of Financial Services.The reforms are necessary to ensure growth of the banking government without the periodic boom-bust cycles, said a paper titled ‚ÄòIndian Banks: A Time to Reform?‚Äô co-authored by Rajan and former Reserve Bank Deputy Governor Viral Acharya.‚ÄúRe-privatization of select PSBs can then be undertaken as part of a carefully calibrated strategy, bringing in private investors who have both financial expertise as well as technological expertise; corporate houses must be kept from acquiring significant stakes, given their natural conflicts of interest,‚Äù the paper said.Noting that the government obtains enormous power from directing bank lending, it said sometimes this power is exercised to advance public goals such as financial inclusion or infrastructure finance, sometimes it is used to offer patronage to, or exercise control over, industrialists.‚ÄúWinding down Department of Financial Services in the Ministry of Finance is essential, both as an affirmative signal of the intent to grant bank boards and management independence and as a commitment not to engage in ‚Äòmission creep‚Äô when compulsions arise to use banks for serving costly social or political objectives,‚Äù the paper noted.According to the paper, private asset management and national asset management ‚Äòbad banks‚Äô should be encouraged in parallel to the online platform for distressed loan sales.‚ÄúThe national public sector ‚Äòbad bank‚Äô could serve as a vehicle to aggregate loans, create management teams for distressed firms, and possibly buy and hold distressed assets in a sector like power till demand returns.‚Äù‚ÄúIt could provide fall-back prices for loans sold by PSBs,‚Äù the paper suggested.It also argued that state-linked banks can be a first step in altering the ownership structure of some public sector banks (PSBs), where the government brings down its stakes to below 50 per cent, creating distance from operations of banks, and improving governance along the way.‚ÄúApart from regulatory and market reforms, we propose reforms to bank governance and ownership, especially for public sector banks. With the current enormous strains on government finances, there may be a window of opportunity in which these reforms may be possible since the status quo is untenable,‚Äù the paper said.On dealing with bad loans, the paper said out-of-court restructuring frameworks can be designed for time-bound negotiations between creditors of a stressed firm, failing which the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) filing should apply.The two need to work in tandem as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Court‚Äôs (IBC) procedural threat serves as the fall-back, facilitating meaningful negotiation out of court, it added.On bank licencing norms, the paper pitched for on-tap licencing of banks to be kept open at all time.‚ÄúOn-tap licensing for banks can be kept open at all times ‚Äì with an annual invitation for applications ‚Äì to create more vibrant banking with entry of better players, especially allowing high-performing micro-credit institutions to become small finance banks, and similarly, high-performing small finance banks to become universal banks.‚ÄúConversely, poorly performing universal banks can be relegated to small finance bank status,‚Äù it suggested.The paper also stressed on the need of allowing PSBs to recruit laterally while retaining the talent they have.‚ÄúIncentive structures for management need to be strengthened with longer terms for senior management, better assessment of performance, performance-based promotions and extensions, as well as some reliance on lateral hiring, which would also bring in state-of-the-art banking ideas and practices,‚Äù it said.

21-09-2020||Mumbai||Didn‚Äôt make illegal alterations in my bungalow: Kangana to HC||Actor Kangana Ranaut on Monday denied the Mumbai civic body‚Äôs claim in the Bombay High Court that she had made illegal structural alterations at her Pali Hill bungalow, part of which was demolished on September 9.In a rejoinder affidavit filed in response to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation‚Äôs (BMC) reply to her plea, Ranaut stated she didn‚Äôt make any structural changes or repairs illegally.She also denied that her plea seeking that the demolition be declared illegal and that she be paid Rs 2 crore in damage by the BMC, was an abuse of the process of law.‚ÄúI deny that I have carried out unlawful additions and alterations as alleged or at all,‚Äù the affidavit said.Last week, the BMC, through its counsel Joel Carlos, had filed an affidavit before a Bench led by Justice SJ Kathawalla, responding to Ranaut‚Äôs petition.The civic body had said the actress had made major structural changes to the building without the civic body‚Äôs permission.It had said BMC officials were merely following the rule of law in razing these alterations on September 9.The civic body had urged the high court to dismiss Ranaut‚Äôs plea and impose a cost upon her for filing the petition, which it said was an ‚Äúabuse‚Äù of the process of law.In her rejoinder affidavit, Ranaut said the civic body had abused the statutory process by initiating the demolition of a part of her property without giving her adequate notice.She had said earlier that the BMC had given her only 24 hours to respond to the demolition notice and had hurriedly rejected her reply to its notice.Ranaut further said the BMC acted out of bias against her as on September 9, it had also issued a notice to fashion designer Manish Malhotra over alleged illegal alterations at his property adjacent to her bungalow. However, Malhotra was given seven days to respond, she stated.‚ÄúWhile the Respondent No. 1 (BMC) and its officials, malafidely issued me the Impugned Notice to seek personal vendetta, they, on the contrary on the same day, issued a Notice to an adjacent bungalow occupied by the famous fashion designer, Manish Malhotra, giving him 7 days‚Äô time to provide explanation,‚Äù Ranaut stated.‚ÄúThis conduct of the Respondent No.1 and its officials clearly demonstrates bias and further displays that the Impugned Notice issued to me is vitiated by malice and was issued as a counterblast to the statements made by me,‚Äù she said.The actress had previously alleged the BMC had carried out the demolition because she had made some comments that were adverse to the Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra.On September 9, the Bench led by Justice Kathawalla had stayed the razing and remarked that the civic body‚Äôs action seemed malafide.The HC is likely to conduct a final hearing on Ranaut‚Äôs plea on Tuesday.

21-09-2020||New Delhi||10 central trade unions to support nation-wide farmers protest on Friday||As many as 10 central trade union on Monday announced their support to the nation-wide protest on September 25 by peasants and farmworkers to oppose passage of two agri bills in Parliament, saying the BJP government should stop anti-farmers measures.The joint platform of central trade unions and sectoral federations declares its unstinted support to the initiative of Joint Platform of Peasants and Agricultural Workers Organisations ‚Äìthe All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee to hold countrywide protest and resistance on 25th September 2020, the central trade unions said in a joint statement.¬†"We also join them in protesting against the disastrous Electricity Amendment Bill 2020," the statement said.The ten trade unions are NTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF and UTUC.Two key farm bills, dubbed as the biggest reform in agriculture by the government, were on Sunday passed by Rajya Sabha with a voice vote.The Farmer's Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 have already been passed by Lok Sabha and will now go to the President for his assent before they are notified as laws.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has termed it as a "watershed moment" in the history of Indian agriculture, asserting that the bills will ensure a complete transformation of the farm sector and add impetus to the efforts to double the income of farmers.The Congress and other opposition parties have slammed the bills as "death warrants" of farmers.Central trade unions and sectoral federations have called upon workers and their unions of all affiliations and across the sectors to join actively in the programmes of protest and resistance being organised by peasants' organisations in and around their respective areas, the statement said.The trade unions alleged that the proposed laws are aimed at completely restructuring the management of the agricultural economy including farm trade in total favour of the big-landlord corporate nexus and multinational trading cliques on agricultural produce."They virtually kill the rights and entitlements of the agricultural population. The Essential Commodities Act and related anti-hoarding, anti-black-marketing regulations are going to be curbed," it said.They are of the view that the virtual withdrawal of government's role in ensuring fair and remunerative prices for farmers' produce will pave the way for ultimate doing away with government procurement of agricultural produce with minimum support price.¬†In totality, peasant agriculture will be ruined, on which survival of more than 60 per cent population is dependent, the statement said.¬†The new measures are also aimed to facilitate profiteering by big players like Adani, Wilmar, Reliance, Walmart, Birla, ITC etc and also large trading companies, both foreign and domestic, it alleged.The joint countrywide action on September 25 which may turn into total Bandh in Punjab and Haryana and series of blockades in every corner of the country, is, therefore, a necessary action to protect farmers, food security and the country's economy, the unions stated. ‚ÄîPTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/10-central-trade-unions-to-support-nation-wide-farmers-protest-on-friday-144507

The delivery of all 36 aircraft is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2021.A second batch of four to five Rafale jets are likely to arrive in India by November.The Rafale jets are India's first major acquisition of fighter planes in 23 year after the Sukhoi jets were imported from Russia.The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29, nearly four years after India signed an inter-governmental agreement with France to procure 36 of the aircraft at a cost of Rs 59,000 crore.

We are on agitation in Parliament, you should agitate outside. The BJP government has passed a black law against farmers. We were terminated for opposing the bill," said AAP MP Sanjay Singh."That is why we are sitting on dharna and will keep sitting till the BJP government explains why this black law was passed by strangling democracy," he added.The MPs came to the protest site carrying blankets, and pedestal fans were being fitted to help them fight the scorching heat.A number of non-NDA parties have also written to President Ram Nath Kovid over the manner in which the government ‚Äúpushed through its agenda‚Äù and urged him not to grant his assent to the proposed legislations.According to sources, leaders of various political parties including the Congress, the Left parties, NCP, DMK, SP, Trinamool Congress and the RJD have in a memorandum to the President sought his intervention in the matter and asked him not to sign the bills.The bills will become a law only after the President grants his assent to them.The two key farm bills, dubbed by the government as the biggest reform in agriculture, were passed by Rajya Sabha on Sunday with voice vote amid unprecedented unruly scenes by protesting opposition MPs.The Shiromani Akali Dal leadership will meet President Ram Nath Kovind separately on Monday to urge him not to sign on the bills.Sources said the memorandum of opposition leaders has been sent to the President. Congress MP and noted lawyer Abhishek Singhvi is learnt to have framed the memorandum.The opposition leaders wish to present their case in urging the President not to grant his assent to the bill after both the Houses of Parliament passed the two bills.

21-09-2020||New Delhi||Shaheen Bagh Protests: SC reserves order on petitions seeking guidelines||Maintaining that people can't claim an absolute right to protest, the Supreme Court on Monday reserved its order on petitions seeking certain guidelines to strike a balance between the right to protest and right to free movement and mobility.A Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul--which was seized of PILs were filed by Amit Sahni, Shashank Deo Sushi and others against anti-CAA protesters blocking roads in Shaheen Bagh in Delhi--said it would pass an order on the larger issue even as the protesters were removed by the Police on March 24 in view of COVID-19 lockdown.At the very outset, a Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul asked the petitioners, "Are you withdrawing it?""No," replied Sudhi.Sahni said in future the protest shouldn't continue."In the larger public interest, a decision may be taken," Sahni said requesting the Bench to pass an elaborate order.As advocate Mahmood Pracha contended that there was an absolute right to protest, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta objected to his submission, saying the right wasn't absolute."Right to take out a procession is never take out for a absolute right... You cant simply go and stop a vehicular movement," Mehta said.Pracha said there has to be a universal policy in this regard."It's difficult. There cannot be a universal policy because situations and facts are different every time. In a parliamentary democracy, there is always an avenue of debate. The only issue is how to balance it," the Bench said."Let us have the benefit of the report filed by the interlocutors also," it added.Led mostly by women, the Shaheen Bagh protest is an ongoing 24/7 continuous sit-in (dharna) against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) passed by Parliament in December last year.They were protesting the police action against students at Jamia Millia Islamia who allegedly indulged in violence during initial protests against the law.The Protesters were also opposing National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) since 15 December 2019.Notified on January 10, the CAA relaxes norms for grant of Indian citizenship by naturalization to Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Buddhist and Jain and Parsi victims of religious persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who came to India before December 31, 2014.The top court had on January 22 refused to stay the operation of the CAA and the National Population Register (NPR) and indicated that ultimately a five-judge Bench might have to decide these issues.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shaheen-bagh-protests-sc-reserves-order-on-petitions-seeking-guidelines-144493
21-09-2020||New Delhi||Army commanders of India, China hold over 12-hour-long talks to ease Ladakh standoff||India on Monday pressed for an early and complete disengagement of Chinese troops from friction points in eastern Ladakh as their senior army commanders held a sixth round of talks that primarily focused on implementing a five-point bilateral agreement to ease the prolonged border standoff, government sources said.The latest round of Corps commander-level talks that began at around 9 am in Moldo on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) across India‚Äôs Chushul sector in eastern Ladakh went on for over 12 hours and was still underway at 9 pm, the sources said.It is learnt that the Indian delegation insisted on a time-bound implementation of the agreement finalised during the extensive talks between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meet.The Indian delegation is headed by Lt Gen Harinder Singh, the commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps of the Indian Army. For the first time, the Indian team for the military talks also included a senior official from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).MEA Joint Secretary Naveen Srivastava, who has been engaged in diplomatic talks with China on the border row under the framework of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, was part of the delegation.The team also comprised Lt Gen PGK Menon, who is expected to succeed Singh as the commander of the 14 Corps next month, the sources said.The sources said the Indian team insisted on an early and complete disengagement of troops by Chinese People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) to end the four-and-a-half-month standoff, adding the agenda for the talks was to chart a specific timeline for implementation of the five-point agreement.The agreement aimed at ending the tense standoff included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC.At the previous five rounds of Corps commander-level talks, the Indian side has insisted on complete disengagement of Chinese troops at the earliest, and immediate restoration of status quo ante in all areas of eastern Ladakh prior to April. The face-off had begun on May 5.The fifth round of Corps commander talks on August 2 lasted for nearly 11 hours while the fourth round went on for nearly 15 hours on July 14.Military sources, meanwhile, said the newly-inducted Rafale jets started carrying out sorties in various forward areas in eastern Ladakh as part of measures to give a boost to the overall combat readiness in view of the ‚Äúprovocative actions‚Äù by Chinese troops in the last three weeks.The deployment of French-made Rafale jets in Ladakh came less than 10 days after they were formally inducted into the Indian Air Force (IAF).At a ceremony in Ambala on September 10 where five Rafale jets were inducted into the IAF, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said this was crucial considering the atmosphere being created along the frontier and was also a ‚Äúbig and stern‚Äù message to those eyeing India‚Äôs sovereignty.The sources said the Indian Army has made elaborate arrangements to maintain the current level of troop and weapons deployment in all forward areas in eastern Ladakh and other sensitive high-altitude sectors in the harsh winter months when the temperature drops up to minus 25 degree Celsius.They said the situation remained tense at both the southern and northern bank of the Pangong lake area as well as in other friction points.There have been at least three attempts by the soldiers of the PLA to ‚Äúintimidate‚Äù Indian troops along the northern and southern bank of Pangong lake area in the last three weeks where even shots were fired in the air for the first time at the LAC in 45 years.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of Pangong Lake on the intervening night of August 29 and 30.On September 7, the Chinese troops again made an unsuccessful bid to close in on the Indian position and even fired shots in the air in the Mukhpari area of Rezang-La ridgeline on the southern bank of Pangong lake.As Jaishankar and Wang were set to hold talks in Moscow, Chinese soldiers fired a barrage of ‚Äúwarning shots‚Äù in the air on the North Bank of Pangong lake to ‚Äúintimidate‚Äù the Indian troops, Indian Army sources had said.India occupied a number of strategic heights on the southern bank of Pangong lake and strengthened its presence in Finger 2 and Finger 3 areas in the region to thwart any Chinese actions.China has been occupying the areas between Finger 4 and Finger 8. The mountain spurs in the area are called Fingers. ‚Äî PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-commanders-of-india-china-hold-over-12-hour-long-talks-to-ease-ladakh-standoff-144487

21-09-2020||New Delhi||Farm Bills need of 21st century, mandis and MSP will stay: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted on Monday that the farm sector reform bills passed by Parliament were the need of 21 century India and again reassured farmers that the government purchase of their produce coupled with the minimum support price mechanism will continue.¬†With opposition parties vehemently criticising the legislations as "anti-farmers" and protests continuing in states like Punjab and Haryana, Modi again mounted a strong defence of these measures, saying farmers will now have the freedom to sell their produce at a place and price of their choice.¬†Attacking critics, he said a "clique" of people exploited farmers for long as they remained in shackles of rules regulating the sale of their produce and stated that this needed to change, which his government has done.¬†"After these historical changes in the agricultural sector, some people are losing their control of it. So now these people are trying to mislead farmers on MSP (minimum support price). They are the same people who sat for years on the recommendations of the Swaminathan committee on MSP," Modi said, in an apparent swipe at the Congress.¬†Describing the legislations as "very historic", the prime minister said if somebody says that government-regulated agriculture markets will be finished after these reforms, then he is "blatantly lying".¬†Noting that his government had brought the farm ordinances, which these legislations will replace, in June, he said farmers are already getting a better price for their produce in several states.¬†Modi made the comments at a virtual ceremony to lay foundation stones of nine highway projects in Bihar and to inaugurate optical fibre internet services through which all 45,945 villages in the state will be connected.¬†Seeking to dispel concerns among a section of farmers, he said he wanted to make it clear that the bills are not against agriculture 'mandis' (agricultural markets) and they will continue like they always have.¬†No government has done as much to boost MSP and government procurement of farmers' produce than his dispensation, the prime minister said.¬†During the coronavirus pandemic, a record purchase of wheat was made from farmers during the Rabi season, he said, adding that farmers were paid Rs 1.13 lakh crore at MSP for wheat, paddy, pulses and oilseeds.The money is 30 per cent more than the last year, Modi said, asserting that the government lifted a record amount of grains amid the pandemic and also made a record payment to farmers.¬†Highlighting his government's efforts to boost MSP and the purchase of farm produce, he said their quantity in the last five years and the five years before 2014, when he first came to power, are a testimony to this."If I talk about pulses and oilseeds, then government procurement of pulses and oilseeds has been increased almost 24 times more than before," he said.¬†‡§ï‡•É‡§∑‡§ø ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•á‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§á‡§® ‡§ê‡§§‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∏‡§ø‡§ï ‡§¨‡§¶‡§≤‡§æ‡§µ‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•á ‡§¨‡§æ‡§¶, ‡§ï‡•Å‡§õ ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ó‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§π‡§æ‡§• ‡§∏‡•á ‡§®‡§ø‡§Ø‡§Ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§£ ‡§ú‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•Å‡§Ü ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ñ‡§æ‡§à ‡§¶‡•á ‡§∞‡§π‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡•§‡§á‡§∏‡§≤‡§ø‡§è ‡§Ö‡§¨ ‡§Ø‡•á ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ó MSP ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡§æ‡§®‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ó‡•Å‡§Æ‡§∞‡§æ‡§π ‡§ï‡§∞‡§®‡•á ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§ú‡•Å‡§ü‡•á ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç‡•§ ‡§Ø‡•á ‡§µ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ó ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç, ‡§ú‡•ã ‡§¨‡§∞‡§∏‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§§‡§ï MSP ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§Æ‡•Ä‡§®‡§æ‡§•‡§® ‡§ï‡§Æ‡•á‡§ü‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§∏‡§ø‡§´‡§æ‡§∞‡§ø‡§∂‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§™‡•à‡§∞‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§®‡•Ä‡§ö‡•á ‡§¶‡§¨‡§æ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§¨‡•à‡§†‡•á ‡§∞‡§π‡•á: PM  Two key farm bills, dubbed as the biggest reform in agriculture by the government, were on Sunday passed by Rajya Sabha with a voice vote. The two bills were earlier cleared by Lok Sabha.Modi likened the proposed changes in the farm sector to the dairy business, saying as dairies help people rearing cattle to sell milk and take care of their interests, similar changes will happen in agriculture.¬†Noting that a majority of farmers have small landholdings, he said the changes will help them organise and get a better price of their produce. ‚ÄîPTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-bills-need-of-21st-century-mandis-and-msp-will-stay-pm-144479

Hence you are requested to kindly get the customs duty waived on his (her brother's) last memories and help the family in these difficult times.

21-09-2020||Dehradun||7 years after tragedy, skeletal remains of 4 people found near Kedarnath||Skeletal remains of four persons killed in the Kedarnath disaster have been recovered from above Rambara on way to the Himalayan temple, seven years after the tragedy.The remains were found during a joint search operation by the police and the SDRF personnel in the area on Sunday, Rudraprayag Superintendent of Police Navneet Singh Bhullar said.The DNA samples of the remains were taken by the health department personnel accompanying the joint team before they were cremated as per Hindu rituals at Nandprayag, he said.The DNA samples would be matched later with the family members of people who went missing after the tragedy to ascertain their identities, Bhullar said.The search operation launched on Wednesday on the orders of the Uttarakhand High Court has come to an end with the recovery of the skeletal remains, he said.With the latest recoveries, the number of Kedarnath victims whose remains have been found so far from areas surrounding the temple during successive search operations has risen to 703 while 3,183 people are still missing.The teams consisting of 60 police, SDRF and health department personnel together conducted the search operation at a height of above 14,000 feet from the sea level.Similar search operations conducted in areas near the temple in the past had also led to the recovery of skeletal remains of a number of people.The Kedarnath area in Uttarakhand had received unprecedented heavy rainfall between June 14, 2013, to June 17, 2013, and the Chorabari lake had collapsed due to cloudburst that had resulted in a major flash flood.Several roads, buildings and other structures were washed away and around 10,000 people were killed and over 3,000 went missing.

NLSIU had said it won‚Äôt accept CLAT scores for admissions to its law courses this year.However, NLSIU's decision to walk out of CLAT and to go for NLAT was challenged before the top court by former NLSIU Vice Chancellor Prof R Venkata Rao and some students and their parents.Prof Rao had contended the decision to go for a separate NLAT will make NLSIU an "island of exclusion" from an "island of excellence".Terming the decision to conduct a separate test as whimsical, baseless, manifestly arbitrary and illegal, Prof Rao had said, adding that ¬†the present NLSIU Vice-Chancellor did not have the requisite consent from the academic council for it.‚ÄúThe technical requirement of having a laptop and 1 Mbps of internet speed for taking home proctored examination, is onerous, arbitrary, discriminatory and illegal,‚Äù the petition submitted.¬†Unlike the general universities which admit only those having already completed a three-year BA, BSc or BCom course, admission to NLUs is open to candidates passing their class 12 examination, provided they clear CLAT.¬†The petitioners had submitted that the sudden unilateral decision of NLSIU had created unprecedented uncertainty, fear and confusion among the applicants who had been put to extreme pressure and mental stress.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-cancels-nlsiu-bengaluru-entrance-exam-144445

Do not consider people of the state weak," Gujral said, sounding a note of caution to the Union government.He said Punjab has contributed to the country in diverse ways, including its contribution to the food bowl."Farmers of Punjab feel that their interest has been sold to corporate houses," Gujral said.He said there is a trust deficit among the farmers concerning the government.

The RBI raised treasury bonds that were sold to the State Bank of India (SBI), Male, for handover to the Maldives Government, the Indian Embassy said in a statement.This was a reversal of the situation in 2013 when India fought tooth and nail to keep away the US from entering into a security partnership with the Maldives. The UPA government had then assessed that American entry would give rise to misgivings at a time when it thought India and China could co-exist in the Indian Ocean.Earlier in 1983, the Indira Gandhi government had kicked up a row when the US sought to renew lease on a Sri Lankan transmitter. Located in Trincomalee, New Delhi thought the CIA also used it for intelligence gathering.India was in an unfavourable situation in the Maldives after the 2013 elections when China began muscling in. The situation changed after an India-friendly regime won back power in 2018. But it was after the Galwan Valley clash that India tilted in favour of permitting the US to counter China with a defence framework agreement with the Maldives which will be fleshed out in due course, said the sources.India has had an extra sympathetic attitude towards the Maldives during the pandemic. A medical team reached Male in March to help with Covid preparedness and nearly 12 lakh tonnes of medicines and 580 tonnes of food aid was provided.Now, with the intention to deny space to China, which has embarked on a worldwide Covid diplomacy, medical teams will be sent to the Maldives on short-term contracts to reinforce the health system.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-extends-250-mn-aid-to-maldives-to-tackle-covid-144191

So far, only legislators, journalists, judges and election candidates were prohibited.The Bill gives the government powers to stop utilisation of foreign funds by a domestic NGO after conducting a summary trial on complaints of misutilisation of funds.Besides, through another change to the original 1976 Act, the government has allowed itself the power to suspend the FCRA certificate beyond the 180-day period provided in the present law.Opposing the introduction of the Bill, Congress‚Äô Manish Tewari said while the statement of objects of the draft legislation say the government has cancelled FCRA licences of 19,000 organisations between 2010 and 2019, ‚Äúthe Bill is silent on how many criminal investigations led to convictions‚Äù.Rai allayed apprehensions of Congress‚Äô Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and TMC‚Äôs Saugata Roy regarding submission of Aadhaar details saying the provision was in line with the spirit of the SC order on Aadhaar. He said the foreign contribution by any organisation could only be received in a dedicated FCRA account with the SBI, New Delhi, account, but ‚Äúdocuments for such registration can be submitted at the local SBI branch‚Äù.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-set-to-make-aadhaar-mandatory-for-foreign-funds-144194

It will be the sixth such meeting since June 6. The meeting will start at 9 am at the Chinese garrison of Moldo, located opposite Chushul on the Indian side.Sources confirmed that the meeting was planned to further the discussions that took place in Moscow on September 4 and 10.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had met their respective counterparts at these meetings.A five-point de-escalation programme was also released. The two sides will literally start from scratch. The previous efforts of five such meetings between June 6 and August 2 failed to break the deadlock as the China‚Äôs People‚Äôs Liberation Army backtracked on agreements to disengage and de-escalate along the LAC.Since August 2, dynamics have changed on multiple counts.
