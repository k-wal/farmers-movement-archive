14-06-2020||New Delhi||Monsoon progress likely to slow this week: IMD||Monsoon has covered a significant part of west and central India but its progress will be slower this week, the India Meteorological Department said on Sunday.The monsoon has advanced into the remaining parts of central Arabian Sea, some parts of northeast Arabian Sea, Gujarat, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, remaining parts of Maharashtra (including Mumbai), some parts of Madhya Pradesh, most parts of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand and some more parts of Bihar, the IMD said in a statement.“Conditions are becoming favourable for further advance of Southwest Monsoon into some more parts of North Arabian Sea, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, remaining parts of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar and some parts of East Uttar Pradesh during next 48 hours,” the IMD said.Thereafter, the progress will be slow for a week, IMD Director-General Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said.“The low pressure area that helped in the progress of monsoon last week is weakening. So, the progress of the monsoon will be slow for a week,” Mohapatra said.However, another low pressure area is likely to form over the Bay of Bengal next week which will help in the progress of monsoon, Mohapatra added.A low pressure area is a cyclonic circulation that helps in the progression of monsoon.Fairly widespread to widespread rainfall is very likely to continue over Maharashtra, Gujarat, most parts of central and east India during next 4-5 days with isolated heavy to very heavy falls over Konkan and Goa, Madhya Maharashtra, Gujarat, the IMD said.Isolated heavy over south Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh and Marathwada are likely during next 2-3 days, the IMD statement added.According to IMD data, the country as a whole has received 31 per cent more rainfall so far.

14-06-2020||Kolkata||IIT Kharagpur asks faculty not to write on topics critical of govt||IIT Kharagpur has asked its faculty members not to participate in radio broadcast or write on subjects critical of the state and central governments.However, they can write on literary or scientific topics, the premier institute said in a recent circular.Registrar B N Singh told PTI on Sunday, it was not a fresh notice and the authorities have been quoting excerpts from an old central government circular from time to time for the new recruits who “may not have an idea about certain service conduct rules for central government employees.”“It is not a gag order,” he said.The IIT Kharagpur notification, signed by the registrar on June 5, read: “It has been observed that many a time institute employees are offering their views/publishing information etc in the print/social media. It is true that media is a part of our daily lives....“However, a few cases are reported in the media which have the effect of adverse criticism of the policies or action of the institute and the Central govt/any state govt/ any other institute or organisation or members of the public.” The notification, quoting the conduct rules framed many years back, specified that no employee shall in any radio broadcast or in any document published anonymously or in any communication to the press in his own name make statement “which has the effect of an adverse criticism of any current policy or action of the institute or which is capable of embarrassing the relations between the institute and the Central government.”It said the staff of IIT Kharagpur is governed by conduct rules as laid down in the acts and statutes of the institute.“No employee shall, except with the previous sanction of the competent authority or any other authority empowered by it in this behalf, or in the bonafide discharge of his duties, participate in a radio broadcast or contribute any article or write any letter, in his own name or anonymously, to any newspaper or periodical..,” the notification said.No such sanction shall be required if such broadcast or contribution is “of a purely literary, artistic or scientific character”, the notification said.However, “members of the staff are at liberty, without any sanction, to publish their original scientific works in journals of repute in India and abroad...Such articles must be strictly confined to purely scientific subjects and should not touch administrative matters. They shall be free from all political tinge...,” the circular said.Claiming that no recent development has prompted the institute to come up with the circular, Singh said, “It has been issued to apprise the new recruits about the service rules.”An IIT Kharagpur source said a circular like this is issued from time to time.“However, with the proliferation of social media in recent years, it is important to make those having joined later to know about their responsibilities.“If they refer to their association with the organisation in their Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts, their comments and posts may be considered to be part of their official identity by followers on net, including media.“There is no monitoring as such but the authorities expect them to use their own discretion while posting in social media,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iit-kharagpur-asks-faculty-not-to-write-on-topics-critical-of-govt-99108

14-06-2020||Patna||Why? The question that haunts Sushant Singh Rajput’s paternal home in Patna||A mix of grief and incredulity engulfed the paternal residence of Sushant Singh Rajput after the news came that the 34-year-old actor, a chirpy young man at the pinnacle of his Bollywood career, was found dead at his Mumbai home.Relatives, neighbours and fans dashed to the two-storey house in Rajiv Nagar where Rajput—the youngest among five siblings—spent his childhood and where his father, a retired government servant, lives with a caretaker.The compound soon packed with well-wishers, taking turns to offer condolences to the grieving parent who, crestfallen by the tragedy, was fainting frequently.The caretaker, Laxmi, told media persons that Rajput’s eldest sister, who lives in Chandigarh, has conveyed over telephone that she would be arriving by flight later in the day and accompany the father to Mumbai.It was not known if the mortal remains would be brought back here for last rites.“I simply cannot believe that Sushant has taken such a step. He was such a lively boy who inspired others through his zest for life. His father, despite not being in a very good shape, used to come out for morning walks regularly and we used to talk about his son.“The father and the son used to talk over phone frequently but never did the boy exhibit any signs of being fed up with life,” lamented a middle-aged neighbour.A teenage girl from the neighbourhood who recalled having met the actor when he visited home less than a year ago, said, “He was so full of positivity. It is hard to believe he could do something like this. If we find the reality so hard to sink in, imagine what must have been the state of the family. The question that would keep haunting us is why?”          Lovely Anand, a former MP who is distantly related to the deceased actor’s family, also visited the home to offer her condolences.“There must be an inquiry. Only a few days ago his manager committed suicide, now it is our boy. I do not believe it can be a mere coincidence,” she said referring to celebrity manager Diya Salani who had Rajput as many of her former clients.Facebook pages run by alumni of the city-based St Karen’s High School, Rajput’s alma mater where he studied till Class XII before leaving for Delhi to pursue a degree in engineering alongside his passion for acting, were abuzz with images of the actor in his teens, donning the school uniform, captioned with messages of grief and shock.In a career that spanned barely over a decade, Rajput got nominated for many awards for his performances in movies and TV shows and won some of these.Rajput’s last notable venture ‘Chhichhore’ saw him portray the role of a sensitive, middle-aged father who resuscitates his son, after the young lad jumps off the window, shattered over flunking engineering entrance exams.Aniruddh Pathak, the character played by Rajput, revived his son by summoning friends from across the world and with them narrating the tale of their own not-so-perfect academic careers with the message that it was okay to not succeed, there was always another chance.In real life, ironically, Rajput made it big but the worldly success could not hold back the actor who betrayed a brooding, melancholic side of himself in his last Instagram post of a week ago which has gone viral.The actor shared an image of his mother, who passed away while he was in school and left him emotionally shattered for the rest of his life, alongside a black and white image of himself.“Blurred past evaporating from teardrops. Unending dreams carving an arc of smile. And a fleeting life, negotiating between the two.Maa,” the actor said by way of a caption that appears, in retrospect, a foreboding.

14-06-2020||Kathmandu||Nepal’s upper house endorses proposal to consider amendment to update new political map||Nepal Parliament’s upper house on Sunday endorsed a proposal to discuss the Constitution Amendment Bill to update the country’s new political map that includes three strategically key Indian territories, a day after the lower house unanimously voted in favour of the Bill.Nepal’s ruling and opposition political parties on Saturday voted in unison to amend the Constitution to update the national emblem by incorporating the controversial map incorporating Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura in India’s Uttrakhand, a move described by New Delhi as “untenable”.Of the total 275 lawmakers in the House of Representatives on Saturday, all 258 lawmakers present in the house voted in favour of the Constitution Amendment Bill.Also read: Nepal alters map, India terms move untenableNow, the Bill will undergo a similar process in the National Assembly, wherein the ruling Nepal Communist Party commands two-thirds majority.Rajendra Phuyal, secretary of the National Assembly Secretariat, tabled the Bill at the first meeting of the upper house on Sunday, The Kathmandu Post reported.During the second meeting of the National Assembly later on Sunday, Law Minister Shiva Maya Tumbahangphe tabled a proposal to consider the Bill for discussions, the paper said.After the discussions, the proposal to consider the Bill was unanimously endorsed, it added.The National Assembly will give lawmakers 72 hours to move amendments against the Bill’s provisions, if they have any.“We are making necessary preparations to endorse the bill within the next four days,” Phuyal was quoted as saying by the paper.After the National Assembly passes the Bill, it will be submitted to the President for authentication, after which it will be incorporated in the Constitution. After that, the new map will be used in all official documents, including the coat of arms.Meanwhile, the main Opposition Nepali Congress has urged the government to intensify diplomatic efforts to ensure the country’s rights in the Kalapani area after the country includes its updated political and administrative map in the Constitution, the Himalayan Times reported.In a press statement on Saturday, the party said the “campaign to reclaim encroached territories would enter the second phase after the revised map incorporating Limpiyadhura, Lipulek and Kalapani areas as its parts, gets endorsed and this would mark a significant solidarity in the issue of nationality.”Reacting to Kathmandu’s move, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said on Saturday “this artificial enlargement of claims is not based on historical fact or evidence and is not tenable. It is also violative of our current understanding to hold talks on outstanding boundary issues.” The India-Nepal bilateral ties came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.Nepal last month released the revised political and administrative map of the country laying claim over the strategically key areas, more than six months after India published a new map in November 2019.India had then sternly asked Nepal not to resort to any “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepals-upper-house-endorses-proposal-to-consider-amendment-to-update-new-political-map-99075
14-06-2020||Lucknow||‘Anamika Shukla’ case assigned to UP STF for probe||The case of withdrawal of salaries worth lakhs of rupees from several government schools across Uttar Pradesh for many months purportedly in the name of same woman teacher has been assigned to the state STF for probe, an official said on Sunday.“A probe by the STF was ordered in Anamika Shukla case almost three days ago. Investigations are going on in districts where cases have been registered. The STF is probing the larger conspiracy. We are trying to identify culprits. Arrests are likely very soon,” Inspector General Amitabh Yash of UP Police Special Task Force told PTI on Sunday.Other STF officials said the probe is underway in districts of Allahabad, Aligarh, Rae Bareli, Saharanpur, Kasganj and Ambedkarnagar.Also read: ‘Anamika Shukla’ case assigned to UP STF for probeIt seems to be the handwork of junior departmental staff, they added.The curious case of the fraud surfaced recently when it was reported that over Rs 1 crore had been withdrawn as salaries and allowances from 25 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas across the state in 13 months in the name of same woman teacher, identified as one Anamika Shukla,  purportedly working for all of them simultaneously.Within days of media reports on the case, a Kasganj resident, identified as Anamika Shukla and working for local Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, approached the district’s Basic Shiksha Adhikari Anjali Agarwal to tender her resignation, fearing arrest in the case.She was, however, arrested by Kasganj police on June 6.This was followed by UP Minister for State for Basic Education Datish Dwivedi’s statement on June 9 that the probe into the case by police has revealed that same set of documents were used to draw Rs 12.24 lakh from nine schools in several districts.He had said the same set of documents were used at Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas in Baghpat, Varanasi, Kasganj, Amethi, Aligarh, Raebareli, Allahabad, Saharanpur and Ambedkar Nagar.The same day another Anamika Shukla, a Gonda resident, appeared before the district BSA Indrajeet Prajapati’s office pleading innocence in the case and claiming that her educational qualification documents appeared to have been used by the tricksters.She had earlier passed the UP TET and had applied for a teacher’s job in Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya at Gonda, but despite making it to the list of successful candidates, she had not been able to join the school due to some personal reasons.Within days after meeting the BSA, Gonda resident Shukla was on Saturday appointed as an assistant teacher on ad-hoc basis by a local, state aided private school Bhaiyya Chandrabhan Datt Smarak Vidyalaya.

14-06-2020||Satya Prakash||Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind moves SC against Hindu outfit’s bid to open Kashi, Mathura disputes||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, June 14A day after a Hindu outfit sought to open Kashi, Mathura temple disputes by challenging the validity of the Place of Worship Act, 1991, that prohibits changing character of religious places, a Muslim organisation moved the Supreme Court against it, saying it will open floodgates of litigation against countless mosques.Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind — which works for Islamic causes — urged the Supreme Court not to entertain the petition filed by Vishwa Bhadra Pujari Purohit Mahasangh, that said the impugned Act protected the “barbarous action of invaders who had converted the Hindu places of worship”.“Even issuance of a notice in the present matter will create fear in the minds of the Muslim community with regard to their places of worship, especially in the aftermath of the Ayodhya dispute and will destroy the secular fabric of the nation,” Jamiat said in its intervention application filed on Saturday.It said: “If the present petition is entertained, it will open floodgates of litigation against  countless mosques in the country and the  religious divide from which the country is recovering in the aftermath of Ayodhya dispute will only be widened.”“It was pointed out during the hearing of the Ayodhya case...that there is a list of numerous mosques which is doing the rounds on social media, alleging that the said mosques were built allegedly by destroying Hindu places of worship,” it said.Seven months after the Supreme Court paved the way for construction of Ram Temple at Ayodhya, Vishwa Bhadra Pujari Purohit Mahasangh moved the Supreme Court on Friday seeking to open Kashi and Mathura temple disputes.Petitioner Mahasangh has challenged the validity of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, which says the character of religious places at the time of Independence can’t be changed.The petition is being seen as an attempt to start a legal battle to reclaim disputed religious sites at Kashi, Mathura and some other places where disputed mosques stand.In its unanimous November 9 verdict, a five-judge Bench headed by the then CJI Ranjan Gogoi had described the 1991 Act as a legislative instrument designed to protect the secular features of Indian polity.But the Mahasangh has sought directions to declare Section 4 of the 1991 Act unconstitutional. The petition said the Supreme Court’s remarks were mere observations without any judicial force as the Act was not under challenge before it.“The impugned Act has barred the right and remedy against encroachment made on the religious property of Hindus exercising might of power by followers of another faith,” it said.By making the impugned provision, the Parliament has without resolution of the dispute, through the process of the court, abated the suit and proceedings, which was unconstitutional and beyond its law-making power, it said.The plea said Parliament cannot restrain Hindu devotees to get back their religious places of worship through a judicial process and cannot make any law which takes away or abridges the vested religious right of devotees and cannot make any law with retrospective effect.It cannot make any law which takes away or abridges the vested religious right of devotees and cannot make any law with retrospective effect, it said, invoking the fundamental right to religion under Article 25 of the Constitution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jamiat-ulama-i-hind-moves-sc-against-hindu-outfits-bid-to-open-kashi-mathura-disputes-99073

She said Sushant Singh's elder sister who lives in Chandigarh is on the way to Patna.Sushant Singh hailed from Maldiha at Badhra Kothi of Bihar's Purnea district. He participated in a family event the last time he came to his village.

14-06-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 peak in India may arrive mid-Nov, paucity of ICU beds, ventilators likely: ICMR Study||The peak stage of COVID-19 pandemic in India has been delayed by the eight-week lockdown along with strengthened public health measures and it may now arrive around mid-November during which there could be a paucity of isolation and ICU beds, and ventilators, according to a study.The study conducted by researchers from an Operations Research Group constituted by the ICMR said the lockdown shifted the peak of the pandemic by an estimated 34 to 76 days and helped in bringing down the number of infections by 69 to 97 per cent, thereby, allowing time for the healthcare system to shore up resources and infrastructure.In the scenario of intensified public health measures with 60 per cent effectiveness after lockdown, the demand can be met until the first week of November. After that, isolation beds could be inadequate for 5.4 months, ICU beds for 4.6 and ventilators for 3.9 months, projections by the health researchers showed.Also read: Record single-day spike of 11,929 Covid cases takes India's tally to 3,20,922; toll reaches 9,195However, this shortfall is estimated to be 83 per cent less than what it could have been without the lockdown and public health measures.With sustained government steps at increasing the infrastructure and different pace of epidemic in different regions, the impact of unmet need can be reduced. If the coverage of public health measures can be increased to 80 per cent, the epidemic can be mitigated, the researchers stated.According to the model-based analysis for COVID-19 pandemic in India, with the additional capacity which has been built up for testing, treating and isolating patients during the lockdown period, the number of cases at the peak would come down by 70 per cent and the cumulative cases may come down by nearly 27 per cent.In terms of COVID-19 mortality, approximately 60 per cent deaths were prevented and one-third of this mortality prevention is attributed to the reduction in unmet need for critical care as a result of the intervention, the analysis showed.The researchers said the management of COVID-19 will involve a dynamic review of policies and significant strengthening of the healthcare system.“While lockdowns will delay the onset of peak and will give the much needed time for the health system to respond, strengthening the health system response in terms of testing, isolation of cases, treatment and contact tracing, as is being done currently, will have to be the mainstay to reduce the impact of the pandemic in India until a vaccine becomes available,” it said.The overall economic health system cost of this pandemic is estimated to be 6.2 per cent of India's gross domestic product (GDP).The country saw a record spike of 11,929 cases pushing India’s COVID-19 caseload to 3,20,922 on Sunday while the death toll rose to 9,195 with an increase of 311 fatalities, according to the Union Health Ministry data.India registered more than 10,000 cases for the third day in a row and is the fourth worst-hit nation by the COVID-19 pandemic.The Ministry, on June 9, said COVID-related health infrastructure in the country had been strengthened with the availability of 958 dedicated COVID-19 hospitals with 1,67,883 isolation beds, 21,614 ICU and 73,469 oxygen supported beds.Also, as many as 2,313 dedicated COVID Health Centres with 1,33,037 isolation beds, 10,748 ICU beds and 46,635 oxygen-supported beds have also been operationalised. Moreover, 7,525 COVID Care Centres with 7,10,642 beds are now available to combat COVID-19 in the country.The ventilators available for COVID beds were 21,494, the Ministry had said, adding that the order of 60,848 more ventilators had been placed.

Once more people per day are cured than infected, the proportion of people susceptible to the virus will drop causing a reduction in cases.India is slowly moving towards that direction but the daily rate of recovery is less than the per day rate of infections, which is a key parameter the disease responders are watching.In a single day for instance India saw 11,929 new cases of COVID and 8,049 recoveries. These figures just turn over for the epidemic graph to fall.As of today India’s death rate from COVID remains among the lowest worldwide at 2.8 per cent with 9,195 deaths.In the last 24 hours 471 people have died.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-covid-recovery-rate-crosses-50-mark-more-cured-than-infected-now-99058

It is also violative of our current understanding to hold talks on outstanding boundary issues,” a spokesperson said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/land-in-kalapani-lipulekh-belongs-to-indias-border-villages-official-99052

If my lords want, I can also play the video on screen.”Terming it a harassment of a journalist for speaking out against the government, Singh said, “If what my client has said is sedition, then only two channels will work in this country.”He said, “If this kind of content can attract sedition, then half of the country will be committing sedition.”Singh urged the court to order stay on further proceedings on the FIR lodged against Dua.On behalf of the Centre and Himachal Pradesh Government, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the complainant needed to be made a party to the case. He sought two weeks to respond to Dua’s petition.Dua moved the top court after being asked to join the investigation at Kumarsain Police Station in Shimla district.Earlier, the Delhi High Court had stayed summons issued to him in connection with an FIR against him for allegedly spreading fake news on communal violence in Delhi in February through his YouTube show. The Shimla FIR has been registered at the instance of Himachal Pradesh BJP leader Ajay Shyam who filed criminal complaint against Dua accusing him of instigating violence against the government by allegedly spreading fake news.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-stay-probe-into-sedition-case-against-journalist-vinod-dua-99023

14-06-2020||New Delhi||Petrol price hiked by 62 paise per litre, diesel by 64 paise; 8th straight daily increase||Petrol price on Sunday was hiked by a record 62 paise per litre and that of diesel by 64 paise as oil companies for the eighth day in a row adjusted retail rates in line with cost since ending an 82-day hiatus in rate revision.Petrol price in Delhi was hiked to Rs 75.78 per litre from Rs 75.16, while diesel rates were increased to Rs 74.03 a litre from Rs 73.39, according to a price notification of state oil marketing companies.Rates have been increased across the country and vary from state to state, depending on the incidence of local sales tax or VAT.The 62 paise a litre increase in petrol and 64 paise hike in diesel price is the highest surge in rates since the daily price revision was started in June 2017.This is the eighth daily increase in rates in a row since oil companies on June 7 restarted revising prices in line with costs, after ending an 82-day hiatus.In eight hikes, petrol price has gone up by Rs 4.52 per litre and diesel by Rs 4.64 -- a record increase in rates in any eight days since the daily price revision was introduced.The freeze in rates was imposed in mid-March soon after the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel to shore up additional finances.Oil PSUs Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), instead of passing on the excise duty hikes to customers, adjusted them against the fall in the retail rates that was warranted because of international oil prices falling to two-decade lows.The government had first raised excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 3 per litre each on March 14 and then again on May 5 by a record Rs 10 per litre in case of petrol and Rs 13 on diesel. The two hikes gave the government Rs 2 lakh crore in additional tax revenues.State-owned fuel retailers IOC, BPCL and HPCL had frozen petrol and diesel prices since March 16, as if anticipating the government move and set off gains they accrued from continuing drop in international oil prices against the excise duty hike.They, however, promptly passed the increase in local sales tax or VAT by state governments such as Rs 1.67 increase in VAT on petrol and Rs 7.10 in diesel by the Delhi government on May 4.The total incidence of excise duty on petrol has risen to Rs 32.98 per litre and that on diesel to Rs 31.83. The excise tax on petrol was Rs 9.48 per litre when the Narendra Modi government took office in 2014 and that on diesel was Rs 3.56 a litre.The government had between November 2014 and January 2016 raised excise duty on petrol and diesel on nine occasions to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices.In all, duty on petrol rate was hiked by Rs 11.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months that helped government’s excise mop up more than double to Rs 2,42,000 crore in 2016-17 from Rs 99,000 crore in 2014-15.It cut excise duty by Rs 2 in October 2017 and by Rs 1.50 a year later. But it raised excise duty by Rs 2 per litre in July 2019.It again raised excise duty on March 14 by Rs 3 per litre.

They have said that this is not the first time the colour change has happened, although it is more glaring this time. When contacted, Buldhana Collector Suman Chandra said, "Lonar lake comes under the jurisdiction of the forest department as it has been declared a sanctuary. The department has sent water samples to NEERI. Nonetheless, the institute will be sending a team of scientists to the site on June 15 to collect samples for analysis.""They will analyse the water to know the exact reason behind the change in its colour," she said.Lonar crater lake was identified as a unique geographical site by a British officer named C J E Alexander in 1823.

For instance, there is no uniformity in the procedures of decision-making by various sanctions committees, India stated at the UN last month.TS Tirumurti, India’s new representative to the UNThe UN needs to change to reflect the contemporary realities to enable them to remain effective and credible.There is a sense that too much of their work is being carried out without the full knowledge of all UNSC members. Neither is there any fixed practice in terms of their reporting cycles — there are differing time-periods and methodologies for reporting of similarly constituted bodies handling similar work.Another worrying aspect relates to lack of transparency and consistency in making public the decisions of these bodies. For instance, in many cases, decisions regarding delisting requests made to some of these bodies by sanctioned individuals and entities are not made public at all.Some subsidiary bodies do not even mention that any such request was received and declined from known and listed terrorist entities or individuals. In effect, the failed efforts of terrorists to get themselves de-listed are shrouded in secrecy.The non-permanent nations have already been making efforts in this direction and won a few minor victories. Due to one of them, India and the other non-permanent members will be invited to observe the meetings of the UNSC and its subsidiary bodies three months before they formally begin their terms on January 1, 2021.Ahead of the June 17 poll, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had outlined New Delhi’s priorities for its candidature. Under the rubric of ‘New Orientation For A Reformed Multilateral System’ (NORMS), he said India aims to create new opportunities in five key segments — general progress, effective response to international terrorism, reforming multilateral systems, comprehensive approach to peace and security and technology with a human touch.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-spells-out-priorities-for-unsc-candidature-98859

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) here accused Nepal of violating the “current understanding” to hold talks on outstanding boundary issues. “We have already made our position clear on this matter. This artificial enlargement of claims is not based on historical fact or evidence and is not tenable,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.Nepal’s map change was in response to two Indian moves over eight months. In early November, India released a new political map. Its basic aim was to reflect the new reality of the erstwhile state of J&K divided into two Union Territories, but it also included Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura. India handled that dissonance by promising dialogue.On May 8, the controversy was re-stoked when Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a road from Dharchula in Uttarakhand to the controversial spot of Lipulekh. This set in motion a political process that has led to changes in Nepal’s political map and while Nepal’s PM and Foreign Ministry publicly asked India to hold parleys, especially at the level of foreign secretaries, it was on Saturday that the MEA seemed to suggest that it had made an offer for talks.The amendment in the Lower House hung in balance as the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP) was 10 seats short of the needed two-thirds majority. But Madhesi parties, who were asked to display their nationalist credentials, and the Nepali Congress came on board, making the passage of the resolution a fait accompli.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-alters-map-india-terms-move-untenable-98828
