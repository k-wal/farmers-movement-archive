I want to ask the government where the national COVID19 plan. COVID is a national disaster and the Act clearly says that the National Executive Council under the NDM Act will formulate the plan which the National Disaster Management Authority headed by the PM will approve,” said Sibal reminding the government of its obligation under the law to come up with a plan to address the COVID 19 pandemic.“You can’t have a lockdown of people and a lockout of the economy. That is not the way to formulate a policy. We are not criticising; we are only saying it is time to rethink. We are with Government, we will support the Government in every possible way, but, we are making constructive criticism so that the Government responds to us and responds to the needs of the people of this country,” the former minister asserted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congs-sibal-cites-law-asks-wheres-national-covid-plan-76215
25-04-2020||New Delhi||Sonia Gandhi writes to PM Modi; seeks economic package for revival of MSMEs||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to announce a financial package of Rs 1 lakh crore for the revival of the MSMEs, saying if ignored, the financial crisis in the sector can have a devastating and expansive ripple effect on the country’s economy.In a letter to Modi, Gandhi suggested a five-point plan for the revival of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), which is reeling under the adverse impact of the lockdown due to coronavirus.She urged the prime minister to announce a Rs 1 lakh crore “MSME Wage Protection” package as also a credit guarantee fund of an equivalent amount, besides a 24X7 helpline for helping them out of this crisis.This is the seventh letter written by Sonia Gandhi to the prime minister highlighting several issues arising out of the lockdown, and making suggestions on problems faced by migrant workers and the poor, besides on revival of MSMEs.While highlighting the crisis, she said the MSME sector is suffering around Rs 30,000 crore loss every day due to the lockdown and efforts should be made to help revive them as they are the backbone of the economy.“If ignored, this issue has the potential of having a devastating and expansive ripple effect on our economy,” she said in the letter, and added it was an economic concern that needed immediate attention and intervention of the government.Gandhi said the MSMEs contribute close to one third of the nation’s GDP and account for almost 50 per cent of our exports while employing over 11 crore people.“At this moment, without appropriate support, more than 6.3 crore MSMEs stand on the verge of economic ruin. Every single day of the lockdown comes at a cost of Rs 30,000 crore to the sector. Nearly all MSMEs have lost sales orders, seen a complete cessation of their work, and have had their revenue negatively impacted by the lockdown,” she said.“Most worrying of all, the 11 crore employees...are at the risk of losing their jobs as MSMEs struggle to pay their wages and salaries,” she said.The Congress chief asked the government to announce a Rs 1 lakh crore “MSME Wage Protection” package, which would go a long way in shoring up these jobs, boosting morale as well as greatly alleviating the predicted economic crisis.“Establish and deploy additional credit guarantee fund of Rs 1 lakh crore. This is necessary to provide immediate liquidity to the sector and ensure adequate capital is available to MSMEs at a time when they need it the most,” she said.Gandhi also noted that the actions taken by the RBI must get reflected in actions by commercial banks to ensure adequate, easy and timely credit supply to MSMEs, and monetary action at the RBI’s end must be supported by sound fiscal support from the central government.  She also demanded that the measures need to be supported by an extension of the RBI’s moratorium on payment of loans for MSME beyond the stipulated period of three months.The Government should also explore a waiver/reduction of taxes for MSMEs and other sector specific measures, she said, adding that high collateral security is leading to denial of credit.“This is a case where timely and decisive action can make all the difference.” she told the PM, while extending her party’s continued constructive support in the fight against COVID-19.Meanwhile, former finance minister P Chidambaram tweeted: “We are still awaiting FAP II (financial package) promised by Nirmala Sitharaman exactly one month ago. Meanwhile, the MSME blueprint is Congress contribution to re-start the economy. I hope the government will act on the blueprint”.

Nomination of Uddhav sahib to the Upper House of the State Legislature should have been a mere formality, butthe Governor is playing politics on behalf of the BJP,” claimed a Mumbai-basedShiv Sena leader.Thackeray will complete six months in office on May 28 and needs to be elected to either House of the State Legislature before that date.Though there are nine vacant seats in Maharashtra Legislative Council, theelections to all of them have been put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Over the past few days, Congress and the NCP which are part of the MVA in Maharashtra had discussions on the matter and the strategy to be followed in this regard."There is still a month left and we will come up with something," said NCP leader and Thackeray's Cabinet colleague Nawab Malik.He though refused to comment on whether Thackeray would resign as ChiefMinister and be sworn in again after being re-elected by the legislators of all the three parties, a speculation which is doing rounds in political circles of the state.Meanwhile, the Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna is going on an offensiveagainst the Governor. Sanjay Raut, Sena's Rajya Sabha MP who editsthe newspaper, likened Koshiyari to former Andhra Pradesh Governor RamLal who earned notoriety for sacking then Chief Minister NT Rama Rao."Raj Bhavan should not become a centre for political conspiracy... Iam reminded of a shameless governor called Ram Lal," Raut tweeted.Though Raj Bhavan sources indicated that Koshiyari had sought legalopinion on nominating Thackeray, no details have been released yet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mva-mulls-legal-action-as-governor-keeps-thackeray-on-tenterhooks-76207
25-04-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus: BRICS Foreign Ministers to meet on April 28||While the G-20 is at a standstill due to a reported US-China dispute on the World Health Organisation, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar will participate in a conference of BRICS Foreign Ministers to mount joint efforts to combat the Covid.All five countries are at different stages of the epidemic curve and besides the ongoing cooperation on this front, BRICS is also providing financial assistance. India has already availed $ 1 billion from the BRICS-founded New Development Bank (NDB) and has sought another tranche of $ 1 billion. Headed by former ICICI Bank chief, KV Kamath, NDB is scheduled to open its regional offices in India and Russia this year.With two test runs, the BRICS $ 100 billion Contingency Reserve Arrangement, meant to alleviate short term balance of payment pressures, is an additional bulwark in addition to the IMF, against the sudden draining out of foreign exchange reserves.The BRICS Foreign Ministers’ video conference was being deliberated for some time and was clinched after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke to his counterparts including Jaishankar during which the possibility of a trilateral Russia-India-China cooperation was also discussed.Lavrov and Jaishankar also exchanged views on the prospects of an Afghan settlement where the common aim of both sides is to prevent the country from again becoming a hotspot for jehadi organisations.  Kashmiri terrorists targeting India as well as Central Asian and Chechen extremists targeting Russia’s underbelly were given arms training with impunity in Afghanistan during the Taliban rule.With Russia taking over the Chairmanship of BRICS from Brazil, the Foreign Ministers are also slated to touch on their joint activities during the year. Typically, various BRICS Forums hold 100 meetings from subjects ranging from counter terrorism to polar science.But the promotion of R&D in medicines and diagnostic tools to end epidemics as well as ensuring quality and affordable essential medicines has occupied a brief footnote in their extensive summit-end Joint Statements. However, with the epidemic breaking out, India has sent medicines to over 100 countries including Brazil, South Africa and Russia while China has promised to dispatch 35 plane loads of ventilators, testing kits and PPEs to India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-brics-foreign-ministers-to-meet-on-april-28-76206

The road opening is some three-weeks in advance of normal time, largely necessitatedThe road access from Ladakh to Lahaul Spiti, Himachal Pradesh, across the Rohtang pass near Manali was opened for summer traffic on Saturday. A team, led by a doctor, was the first convoy to pass through carrying essential supplies, and approx 150 farmers to Lahaul Valley.The Border Roads Organisation (BRO), a body under the Ministry of Defence, is in charge of the road opening.This will facilitate the Centre and State Government to bring much needed relief material and medical supplies for the local population. Also, the agriculture activities which are the backbone of the Lahaul district can now recommence.Work to open the pass was expedited April 11 after the Government of Himachal Pradesh approached MoD to expedite the snow clearance to facilitate return of farmers to start cultivation and movement of essential supplies & relief material to Lahaul Valley in wake of COVID-19.BRO inducted Hi-tech machinery from both ends of the pass. Snow blizzards, freezing temperatures and frequent triggering of avalanches at Rahala Fall, Beas Nallah and Rani Nallah did delay the operations, but the snow clearance teams kept on working relentlessly day and night with all COVID-19 precautions to provide relief.The opening of the pass means the Indian Army can start stocking up on rations for the winter period in Ladakh and Siachen, besides items of use by the civilian population of Union Territory of Ladkah.Ladakh has two access roads — one is the 475 kms Srinagar-Leh road over the Zoji-La and other is 477 kms Manali-Leh road via Rohtang, a 13,050 feet high massif. Both remain closed for six to seven months due to heavy snowfall.The road across the Zojila (11,570 feet high) opened last week.During winters, men and rations can only be moved onboard the military planes from Chandigarh, however, all equipment is moved during the summer months.Meanwhile, the ongoing work on the 8.8 Km long Atal Tunnel below the Rohtang Pass was also stalled when the lockdown came into force. Since, the construction of Tunnel is at a critical stage, proactive measures were taken to recommence the work and is expected to be ready by September 2020 as planned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rohtang-pass-opens-3-weeks-in-advance-first-convoy-carries-essential-supplies-76197

Once aerosol infection enters the air ducts of the central air-conditioning system, the same could potentially infect dozens if not hundreds present in the high court.The aforesaid is not an ideal speculation of the applicant, but is borne out by certain studies including World Health Organization (WHO) and other institutes, he submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-plea-against-possible-spread-of-coronavirus-through-centrally-air-conditioned-systems-76178

Due to the COVID-19 lockdown no paediatric surgeon was available at the civilian hospitals in Pathankot.Major Adil Abdul Kalam, surgical specialist at Pathankot Military Hospital performed the intricate and challenging operation of opening up the abdomen of the new born baby who was on a ventilator, repairing the tears in intestine and creation of stoma for diverting the stools. This is for the first time in the Armed Forces Medical Services wherein such an intricate operation on a newborn is done at a zonal hospital with no paediatric surgeon, paediatric anesthesiologist or neonatologist being available.The operation was performed in emergency, which if delayed by even a few minutes, could have resulted in exacerbation of multi-organ failure, leading to death. The doctor said it was an extremely challenging and stressful task to manage the case in the absence of super specialty facilities.Performing intricate surgery in the intestines of the newborn with associated septic infection was technically arduous and gruelling but the team of doctors and nurses effectively carried out the surgery. The baby is no longer on ventilator, tolerating breast feeds and is on the way to healthy recovery.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-doctors-perform-rare-surgery-on-day-old-newborn-under-challenging-conditions-76177

25-04-2020||New Delhi||NAFED to distribute about 5.88 LMT pulses to about 2 crore NFSA households||In order to distribute one kg of pulses to about 2 crore households for three months in the country, a massive operation for transport and milling of pulses is underway, says the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution.The scale of this operation is massive and far more complex than food grain movement, it said.  Each kg of pulse goes through at least three (in many cases four) trips by truck and as many cycles of loading and unloading. While for long distances, transport is being done through goods train, in most cases transportation is by road through trucks, said officials.About 8.5 lakh MT of un-milled pulses will be moved in this process to distribute about 5.88LMT milled / cleaned pulses to citizens. The government has allowed use of its stocks lying in about 165 NAFED godowns across the country for this scheme. Over 100 dal mills across the country have been pressed into service by NAFED so far. In order to meet the protein needs of people during this crisis, the Central government had decided to provide one kg of milled and cleaned pulses to each NFSA household for three months under the PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY).Executed by NAFED under guidance of the department of consumer affairs of the Central government, this operation entails lifting of un-milled pulses from the godowns of Central / State warehousing corporations, getting the pulses milled or cleaned as per quality standards prescribed by FSSAI and then reaching the milled pulses to the States.Thereafter, the milled pulses are carried to state government godowns and then to PDS shops for distribution. The millers are selected on the basis of Out Turn Ratio (OTR) bids by NAFED through online auctions. In OTR bidding, empanelled millers are required to quote percentage of milled pulses for every quintal of raw pulse considering the expenses involved in cleaning, milling, packing, transportation both inward and outward.No milling charges paid to the millers. Millers are grouped in clusters. In producing states, locally available raw material and millers are preferred. All costs in distribution including incidental charges to ration shops are being met by the Central government.Each month, 1.96 LMT of pulses are required to be distributed to NFSA households in the country through rations shops. About three-fourth of the milled / cleaned pulses (over 1.45 LMT) have already been offered to the State governments / UT administrations. Several States that have dal mills within their jurisdictions have been asked to lift the milled pulses by themselves to speed up the process. The States and UTs have taken one-third of the monthly requirement to final destinations for distribution. 17 States and UTs, namely—Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Andamans, Chandigarh, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Telangana have begun distribution.Several other States and UTs have decided to distribute pulses along with food grain distribution in the first week of May for reasons of social distancing and public safety. While, as on date, about 30,000 MT of pluses have been distributed, but this would speed up in the first week of May. Many states / UTs, particularly the smaller ones such as Andamans, Chandigarh, Dadra Nagar Haveli, Goa, Ladakh, Puducherry, Lakshadweep and even Punjab have been provided milled / cleaned pulses for all three months in one go. Department of Consumer Affairs has with the help of Ministry agriculture and farmers’ welfare set up five groups of officers headed by Joint Secretaries to coordinate with States / UTs, NAFED, Dal mills and warehousing corporations. Secretary, agriculture and secretary, consumer affairs have been jointly reviewing progress on daily basis and sort out ground level bottlenecks. The Cabinet Secretary is personally monitoring the distribution on day-to-day basis. This is the first time that the department of consumer affairs is carrying such a massive operation of pulses. This operation would involve about two lakh truck trips and loading and unloading operation over a period of 4 weeks. It is ambitious in normal times, but is very challenging during lock down with many of the dal mills and godowns located in the hotspot areas. Managing operations safely in such areas is crucial. In such areas, availability of trucks and labor for loading and unloading has been a huge problem.Most of the beneficiaries will receive the quota for the first month within April or latest by the first week of May. Several States / UTs would be able to distribute pulses for all three months in the first go itself. For the remaining States, the efforts are being made to complete the distribution for all three months within May itself, preferably within third week of May. Preparedness of the States and UTs was reviewed by secretary, consumer affairs on April 24.Expressing satisfaction on the preparedness, Secretary, consumer affairs thanked the States and UTs for their cooperation and support and hoped that the distribution would be stepped up in the coming week.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nafed-to-distribute-about-5-88-lmt-pulses-to-about-2-crore-nfsa-households-76174

We had placed two cages to trap the animal after a similar incident was reported in the area under Dungar (north) forest range last week," said chief conservator of Forests (Junagadh Circle) S K Srivastava.However, the leopard could not be trapped and officials caught hold of a lion instead, he said, adding that more traps will be placed in the area.The body of Omkar Giri (55) was recovered from some bushes at a distance of around 200 metres from the temple where he was sleeping, another official said.Further investigations were underway, he added.

25-04-2020||New Delhi||Manmohan Singh slams govt over dearness allowance freeze||Former prime minister Manmohan Singh has slammed the government over freezing of dearness allowance, asserting that it was not necessary at this stage to impose hardships on government servants and armed forces personnel.The finance ministry on Thursday froze inflation-linked allowance for 50 lakh central government employees and 61 lakh pensioners till June 2021 due to the COVID-19 crisis. However, DA and dearness relief (DR) at current rates will continue to be paid, it said.“We should be on the side of people whose dearness allowance is being cut. I sincerely believe it is not necessary at this stage to impose hardships on government servants and also on the armed forces people,” Singh said during the Congress’s consultative group meeting whose video was released by the party on Saturday.Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi also slammed the government over the issue, saying the problem was with the government’s going ahead with the central vista redevelopment project.“You are taking away money from the middle class, you are not giving money to the poor people and you are spending it on your central vista,” Gandhi told the meeting.Senior Congress leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram said, “When you (government) have not cut back expenditure on the bullet train, central vista development, those are the programmes which should be first put on halt before you halt people’s dearness allowance.” The Centre last month approved the land use change for execution of its ambitious central vista redevelopment project in Lutyens’ Delhi with the issuance of a notification by the Union housing and urban affairs ministry.The redevelopment project of the Central Vista—the nation”s power corridor—envisages a triangular Parliament building next to the existing one, common Central Secretariat and revamping of the 3-km-long Rajpath—from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said it would have been fine if the money was being transferred to migrant labourers.“But you are continuing  with the new Parliament House, new building for ministers, new house for PM, you are continuing with zero cut on expenditure of the government which could save you close to 2-2.5 lakh crore rupees. But, you are denying relief to your armed personnel, to your pensioners, to your government servants,” he said.Former Union minister Manish Tewari said the first thing the government should have done before cutting allowances, salaries, etc. was to set up an expenditure rationalisation commission.Congress general secretary, organization, KC Venugopal said there is a lot of anguish among the government employees over the dearness allowance issue as it will harm them very much.The Congress last week had constituted a consultative group with former prime minister Singh as its chairman to deliberate on “current concerns” and formulate views and policy of the party on important issues.Besides Singh, Gandhi, Surjewala, Venugopal and Tewari, former union minister Jairam Ramesh, Praveen Chakravarty, Gaurav Vallabh, Supriya Shrinate, and the party’s social media head Rohan Gupta are also part of the panel.

But sport can wait, feels the 61-year-old former India captain."I am looking at the larger picture. Do you think cricket is the only issue we can talk about? I am rather worried about the children who are not being able to go to schools and colleges because that is our young generation,' kapil told YouTube channel 'Sports Tak'."So, I want schools to reopen first. Cricket, football will happen eventually," Kapil said.The legendary all-rounder reiterated he is not in favour of a bilateral series between arch-rivals India and Pakistan to raise funds to deal with the pandemic as suggested by former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar.Kapil said if Pakistan is so desperate to resume bilateral cricket with India then the country first stop anti-India activities at the border and instead spent that money in noble causes."You could be emotional and say that yes, India and Pakistan should play matches. Playing matches is not a priority at the moment. If you need the money, then you should stop the activities at the border," he said."The money which will be spent can be used to build hospitals and schools. If we really need money than we have so many religious organizations, they should come forward. It is their responsibility. We offer so much many when we visit the religious shrines, so they should help the government."Akhtar had recently proposed a cricket match between India and Pakistan, always considered as a pie for broadcasters, to raise money for the sufferers of the pandemic in both the countries.

25-04-2020||Mumbai||Shiv Sena takes dig at Raj Thackeray over his demand to reopen wine shops||The Shiv Sena on Saturday took a dig at MNS president Raj Thackeray over his demand to restart wine shops in Maharashtra to boost revenues, and sought to know whether he was really concerned about the state’s treasury.It said that Raj Thackeray should know that due to the lockdown not just the wine shops, but even the liquor factories are shut.“You don’t get revenue just by starting the shops. The government gets revenue in the form of excise and sales tax when a distributor purchases the product from the factories.In order to start these units, workers are required. Besides, if the shops re-open, no social distancing will be followed,” the party said in an editorial in its mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.Raj Thackeray, in a letter to the Chief Minister’s Officer (CMO) on Thursday, had said that allowing wine shops to remain open does not mean trying to cater to the needs of alcohol consumers, but to ensure revenue inflow during difficult times.He had also called for allowing hotels and kitchens providing affordable foods to run saying that as a big chunk of Maharashtras population is dependent on them.The Uddhav Thackeray-led party, however, mocked the MNS chief for demanding reopening of liquor shops and eateries together.“Through his demand, he has pointed it out to the government that like food, alcohol is an essential commodity.He has given invaluable information that as a rice plate is important for people, they are also dependent on ‘quarter’ and ‘peg’,” it said.It sought to know whether he has made the demand out of the concern for the state’s revenues or on behalf of the tipplers.“The opposition leaders should advise the government on how to improve the economic situation in times of crisis, but the leader of opposition hasn’t been able to do so,” the ruling party said without naming Devendra Fadnavis.“Raj Thackeray has put forward the plight of the poor and the less privileged people and a section of the society will bless him for that. But the government will have to take a decision considering the overall situation,” it added.

25-04-2020||New Delhi||A girl without a jaw, her father with a back injury wait outside AIIMS for lockdown to end||During meal distribution every day, Sneha Kumari hopes that the volunteers will dole out khichdi rather than any other dish. The semi-solid rice and lentil stew is the only food she can swallow without having to chew, for the comfort of her dislocated jaw."My jaw hurts due to which I can't eat food. Because of the pain, I only prefer something light like juice," said the 16-year-old who has been staying in a tent outside the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here along with her father since the lockdown began.The father-daughter duo came to the national capital from Nepal's Parsa district in February for Kumari's jaw surgery at the premier medical institution.There was a tumour in her jaw which doctors at the AIIMS surgically removed two years ago along with her jawbone, which they had replaced with metal plates."In February 2018, we came to Delhi after the Cancer Hospital in Nepal referred my daughter to AIIMS. The doctors here took out the jawbone and placed a metal plate. They said that after one year, they will take a bone from her leg and place it in her jaw," said Nand Kishore, Kumari's father.Kishore, 39, himself cannot walk without support from a stick due to a backbone injury for which he underwent surgery in Nepal around four years ago.Kumari's surgery, initially scheduled for February 25, was postponed several times, finally being rescheduled for March 24."But the Prime Minister imposed a lockdown in the country after the Janta Curfew on March 22. We spoke to the doctors and they said nothing can be done about my daughter's condition till the lockdown is in place," Kishore said.The metal plates in Kumari's jaw have now dislocated. In need of an urgent surgery, she is mostly under enormous pain."I had Rs 15,000 when I left Nepal and thought it would be enough for us to sustain for around 15 days. But we are stuck here for so long and have run out of money. We can't even return to our country," said Kishore, who worked for an NGO in Nepal.Unable to travel back to their country because of restrictions in people's movement, they now live in a tent outside the hospital and depend on food distributed by the Delhi government, police and NGOs.Kumari feels lucky on the days when khichdi is on the menu as otherwise, she has to stay hungry. "If I try to eat dal-rice, my jaw hurts because of the effort made to chew," she said.Not having any idea about if and when his daughter's surgery will take place, Kishore longs to return home. "When the lockdown will be removed, I will ask someone in Nepal to put some money in my account so that we can go back," he said.

25-04-2020||Vibha Sharma||As air quality improves, experts advocate maintaining it even after lockdown||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 25With a recent COVID Air Quality report showing pollution levels falling by dramatic levels in 10 major cities across the world, including Delhi and Mumbai, during the coronavirus lockdown, experts are now advocating the need to maintain levels even after the lockdown is over, pitching for reaching the target of 10 pc blending of biofuel ethanol in vehicular fuel faster. India has a target to achieve 10 pc blend of ethanol in vehicle fuel by 2021. The current all-India is around 4.5 pc.According to UNICA, a sound and clear policy regime in terms of pricing, procurement and blending can help achieve this target. "Given the vast experience in production of sugarcane, India has the potential to become the leader in ethanol production in Asia,” says the Brazilian industry association of ethanol producers.A recent  report published by Swiss company IQ Air looking at 10 key global cities that normally suffer from high levels of pollution, Los Angeles, New York City, London, Madrid, New Delhi, Mumbai, São Paulo, Wuhan, Seoul and Rome found significant falls in nearly all the locations.The report compared measurements from ground-based monitoring stations regarding a type of pollutant known as PM2.5, the small inhalable particles emitted by various sources like vehicles and power plants. According to the report, Delhi’s ‘unhealthy’ and worse rated days at 68% in 2019 came to 17% during lockdown and both Delhi and Mumbai experienced their best March air quality on record in 2020 (49.8 μg/m³ and 34.5 μg/m³ PM2.5 respectively). While April 2020 is also on track to be the best April on record, the current trends should continue, as per the report. Given the fact that usage of public transport is expected to decrease and more private vehicles will be on road,  mandatory ethanol blend in vehicle fuel will be crucial to manage the pollution levels after the lockdown. The blend of ethanol in gasoline, when adopted through clear and long-term public policies, can provide an instant decrease in GHG emissions and air pollution, because biofuel reduces 90% GHG emissions when compared with gasoline and doesn’t produce particulate residues, it says.Brazil and India signed an MoU early this year to promote ethanol in India.According to WHO, an average resident is exposed to air pollution that exceeds the WHO target for annual PM2.5 exposure by more than 500%.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-air-quality-improves-experts-advocate-maintaining-it-even-after-lockdown-76136
25-04-2020||New Delhi||UGC panels recommend academic session in universities from September||The academic session in universities and higher educational institutions can be started from September instead of July in view of the COVID-19 situation in the country, a panel appointed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) has recommended.Two committees were constituted by the UGC to look into the issues of academic loss and online education in the wake of the lockdown in the country due to the coronavirus pandemic.One of the committees led by Haryana University Vice-Chancellor RC Kuhad was formed to look into the ways of conducting exams in universities amid the lockdown and work on an alternate academic calendar. The second committee, to suggest measures to improve online education, was led by Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) V-C Nageshwar Rao. Both the panels submitted their reports on Friday.“One panel has recommended that the academic session be started from September than July. The second panel has suggested that universities should conduct online exams if they have the infrastructure and means or wait for the lockdown to get over and then decide a date for pen-and-paper examinations,” a source said.According to HRD Ministry officials, the two reports will now be studied and official guidelines in this regard are expected to be notified by next week.“It is not binding that all the recommendations will be accepted. After deliberating on the feasibility issues and keeping the situation in mind, guidelines will be issued,” an official said.Another hurdle in starting the academic session is the delay in conducting entrance examinations as well as the pending board exams, the panel has pointed out.“As of now the plan is to conduct entrance examinations like NEET and JEE in June. But it is extremely important to keep reviewing the COVID-19 situation,” the official said.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16 when the Union government announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as one of the measures to contain the outbreak. Later, a nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24 which has now been extended till May 3.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has already announced that it will conduct pending board exams for only 29 subjects which are crucial for promotion and undergraduate admissions.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 775 and the number of cases climbed to 24,506 in the country on Saturday, according to the Union Health Ministry.The number of active COVID-19 cases stood at 18,668 while 5,062 people were cured and discharged, and one patient has migrated to another country, the ministry said.The total number of cases includes 77 foreign nationals.

25-04-2020||New Delhi||Ready to cooperate with Indian agencies: Chinese suppliers of rapid test kits||Two Chinese pharma companies, which supplied 5.5 lakh rapid testing kits for COVID-19 to India, said they are ready to cooperate with Indian agencies looking into allegations of poor accuracy of their products.In separate statements, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech and Livzon Diagnostics said they followed strict quality control of their products, asserting that specified guidelines must be followed in storage of the kits as well in their usages to get accurate results.India's apex medical research body ICMR on Tuesday advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits for next two days till it examines their quality following complaints that they are not fully effective in detecting coronavirus infection.Last week, India procured 5.5 lakh rapid antibody test kits from these two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection.While Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech supplied 3 lakh test kits, Livzon Diagnostics delivered 2.5 lakh.Livzon Diagnostics, in its statement said: "We are shocked to receive negative reports from India related to poor accuracy of COVID 19 rapid testing kits made in China including our brand. We have shown great concern on this issue, and we are willing to coordinate with the related government departments for investigation."The company said it fulfilled all required quality control standards prescribed by the Chinese government and that the company has been exporting the product to at least 10 countries including Brazil, Peru, Columbia and several European nations."The test kits should be stored at a temperature between 2 and 30 degrees Celsius and should not be frozen... If the storage temperature is too high, the accuracy of the test may be influenced," it said.In its statement, Guongzhou Wondfo Biotech said the company had been exporting the kits to more than 70 countries and that the product was validated and approved by the ICMR through National Institute of Virology in Pune."In the process of exporting the products to overseas countries, Wondfo fully cooperates with relevant health authorities in each country to carry out various verifications on the sensitivity and specificity of our products," it said.The statements by the two companies were released to the media by an official of the Chinese embassy here.At present, the government hospitals have been using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people.

Commercial flight services in the country remain suspended till May 3 amid the nationwide lockdown to curb spreading of Covid.29 LAKH jobs at riskThe passenger traffic has declined 47 per cent. The revenue impact for airlines operating to and from the Indian market is expected to be $11.221 billion (over Rs85,000 crore). The IATA wants financial support for the airline industry. Rahul Gandhi‘DA cut insensitive’Instead of suspending the bullet train and central vista projects, the govt has cut DA of central govt staff, pensioners and soldiers. This is a very insensitive decision.Besides, the pandemic and subsequent lockdown have significantly impacted economic activities, with aviation and tourism among the worst-affected segments.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said its latest estimates indicate a worsening situation in many countries of the Asia-Pacific region. About India, it said the pandemic is expected to potentially impact 29,32,900 jobs in the country’s aviation and its dependent industries. The passenger traffic has declined 47 per cent.Besides, the grouping noted that the revenue impact for airlines operating to and from the Indian market would be $11.221 billion (over Rs 85,000 crore). This refers to the fall in passenger revenue compared to 2019.The IATA is a grouping of nearly 290 airlines, including Air India, Vistara, IndiGo and SpiceJet. “Airlines are in survival mode. They face a liquidity crisis with a $61 billion cash burn in the second quarter,” Conrad Clifford, IATA’s Regional Vice President (Asia-Pacific) said.According to him, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka and Thailand are priority countries that need to take action. Further, the grouping called for a combination of direct financial support, loans, loan guarantees and support for the corporate bond market, and tax relief for the airlines industry. “Providing support for airlines has a broader economic implication. Jobs across many sectors will be impacted if airlines do not survive the Covid crisis. Every airline job supports another 24 in the travel and tourism value chain. “In Asia-Pacific, 11.2 million jobs are at risk, including those that are dependent on the aviation industry,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aviation-allied-sectors-to-be-hit-hard-iata-75727
