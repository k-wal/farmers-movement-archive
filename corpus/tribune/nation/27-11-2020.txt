27-11-2020||Ranchi||Jharkhand HC defers Lalu’s bail plea hearing in fodder scam case till December 11||The Jharkhand High Court on Friday deferred RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s bail plea hearing in a fodder scam case till December 11.Prasad’s lawyer Kapil Sibal and the prosecuting agency, the CBI, differed on the time he spent in judicial custody, prompting the court to direct the rival parties to verify their claims with the lower court and adjourn the hearing.Sibal contended that the former Bihar chief minister completed over 42 months in judicial custody, which is more than half the punishment handed down by the trial court in the Dumka treasury case.The CBI said the court sentenced him to seven years imprisonment under the IPC and another seven years under the Prevention of Corruption Act. It also claimed he had only spent 34 months in jail in three other cases in which he has been granted bail.The agency said since the court order didn’t specify that all sentences will run concurrently, he has technically not spent a single day in jail in the case relating to fraudulent withdrawal of over Rs 3.13 crore from Dumka treasury.Sibal also said Prasad was suffering from various ailments, and therefore, should be granted bail.Prasad has been convicted in four out of five fodder scam cases relating to illegal withdrawal of crores of rupees from Chaibasa, Deoghar, Dumka and Doranda treasuries.The high court also fixed December 4 as the date for hearing of a case involving Prasad’s alleged misuse of facilities at Rajendra Institute of Medical Science (RIMS), where he has been undergoing treatment for various ailments.

27-11-2020||New Delhi||Jaishankar meets new Seychelles president, Doval in Colombo, Shringla wraps up Nepal visit||India’s three leading foreign policy managers on Friday held talks with leaders of India’s extended neighbourhood to consolidate existing relationships.National Security Advisor Ajit Doval is in Colombo for a security trilateral with Maldives and Sri Lanka, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar concluded his visit to the UAE and is in Seychelles to meet its newly elected president, and Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla concluded his two-day visit to Nepal where he met the top leadership to turn the page on six months of acrimony.National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on Friday called on Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and also met with the country’s defence secretary to further advance the “valuable” bilateral cooperation which contributes to peace and security in the region.Doval arrived on Friday for trilateral maritime dialogue among India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. This format is being revived after six years and is aimed at consolidating the existing partnership between the three countries on maritime security against the backdrop of Colombo’s unwillingness to reduce the salience of China in its infrastructure development.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had visited both countries last month after participating in the 2 + 2 talks in India. While Maldives is receptive to partnering the US in defence cooperation, Colombo was cold to Pompeo’s suggestion that Chinese influence is malignant.In Seychelles, Jaishankar handed over a letter from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the newly elected president of Indian-origin Wavel Ramkalawan. Before being elected President, Ramkalawan’s party had combined with three others to reject a pact signed between PM Modi and his predecessor to take over Assumption island for building a naval base.Shringla in Nepal met the entire leadership and struck the right notes by promising to “work to Nepal’s priorities” and terming the country as “fundamental” to India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ approach.“India’s development and modernisation are incomplete and intrinsically and symbiotically linked to the development and modernisation of neighbouring countries such as Nepal,” he said in an address to a Nepalese think-tank.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-meets-new-seychelles-president-doval-in-colombo-shringla-wraps-up-nepal-visit-176740

27-11-2020||New Delhi||Court denies interim bail to Ishrat Jahan in Delhi riots case||A Delhi court has denied interim bail to former Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan in a case related to the northeast Delhi riots in February this year. Jahan had approached the court for bail citing COVID-19 outbreak in Mandoli prison and other medical issues.While dismissing accused's application, Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat on November 26 said, "Considering the gravity of the offences including Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 with which the applicant is charged, the discussion in the preceding paragraphs and the Jail Report, I do not deem it a fit case to grant interim bail to accused Ishrat Jahan."Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta, appearing for Jahan, had told the court that being jailed had taken a toll on her mental health and some of the inmates at the prison were tested positive for COVID-19. The counsel told the court that the applicant had a history of cervical, spine injury (lower back pain) and migraine prior to her arrest and she had been under continuous medication in the past for the said illnesses.He also submitted that around 15 days ago, the applicant fell inside the bathroom while she was in jail due to slippery floor and has suffered spinal injuries.  “Moreover, the COVID-19 situation inside the jail is precarious and the applicant has anxiety issues,“ he argued.In her application, Jahan had also argued that she was a practicing advocate and didn't have any criminal antecedents.The prosecution opposed the application, saying that the latest medical prescription dated June 14, 2020 relating to the applicant also got verified from the hospital and a report has been obtained which suggests that there was no urgent medical requirement for the applicant.It further argued that as per the report of the Jail Superintendent, Tihar Jail, Delhi, all the necessary protocols regarding the COVID-19 related precautions are being taken and the situation is totally under control."There is no COVID-19 scare inside the jail. The applicant is also being given proper treatment for her minor health issues and her condition is stable.

27-11-2020||Eilat (Israel)||Memorial plaque for Jewish victims of 26/11 Mumbai attacks unveiled at Israel synagogue||Jewish outreach movement Chabad has unveiled a plaque at its synagogue in this southern Israeli coastal city in memory of six Jews killed in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, demanding that the Pakistani perpetrators of the carnage be brought to justice.Rav Hecht and First Secretary at the Embassy of India in Israel Rohit Mishra unveiled the plaque mounted on a wall inside the synagogue."To the memory and rise of souls of Rabbi Gavriel Noah and Rivka Holtsberg, who were martyred during the time of their holy mission in a terror attack at Chabad House in Mumbai, India, from which the message of Torah was being spread all over the area."And for the four guests who stayed in Chabad House at the time of the attack, and were also martyred: Rabi Gavriel Taitelbaum, Mrs Norma Rabinovich, Rabi Ben Zion Kurman, Mrs Yocheved Orpaz. May their souls be bound up in the bond of eternal life," read the 3A paper size plaque that was unveiled on Thursday.Engraved on a hard plastic plate, the message was personally drafted by Rav Hecht.The Mumbai Chabad House at Nariman Point was one of the targets of the attacks. Ten terrorists of Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) carried out 12 coordinated shooting and bombing attacks lasting four days across Mumbai.Over 166 people, including 28 foreigners from 10 nations and nine terrorists, were killed and over 300 others were injured in the attacks which began on November 26, 2008. In November 2012, Ajmal Amir Kasab, the lone surviving gunman among the Pakistani group, was hanged to death in Pune.Israel has called upon Pakistan to bring the LeT "criminals" involved in the attacks to justice."Exactly 12 years ago the world was stunned by the news emerging from Mumbai: 178 Indian citizens and 29 foreign citizens, among them 8 Israelis were murdered in multiple terror attacks," Gilad Cohen, Deputy Director General incharge for Asia and the Pacific at the Israeli foreign ministry said in a tweet."I would like to convey my deepest sympathy to the families, and to praise the spirit of the citizens of the city of Mumbai. I call upon the government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to bring the criminals from the Lashkar-a-Taiba to justice," he wrote.The Chabad Movement and Jews of Indian origin in Eilat have also requested Mayor Meir Itzhak Ha Levi to set up a 26/11 memorial square in the city on the lines of the one dedicated to the victims of the 9/11 attack.The mayor has reacted favourably to the proposal, extending all help and support, representatives of the Sitar Organisation for Indian Immigrants in Eilat said.Fleur Hassan Nahoum, deputy mayor of Jerusalem for foreign relations, said those who masterminded and funded these brutal attacks should be punished."Today Israel mourns with India on the anniversary of the senseless acts of terror in Mumbai that took the lives of 166 people, including the Holtzberg family from Israel and other members of the Chabad House," Nahoum told PTI."India has always been a beacon of tolerance for Jewish communities and we should not stop until we find the masterminds and funders of these brutal attacks and bring them to justice," she said.Former Israel ambassador to India Mark Sofer, who was the envoy at the time of the Mumbai carnage described the "slaughter" as a "traumatic atrocity of the highest order"."I was Israeli Ambassador to India at the time of the slaughter and can say without compunction that this was a traumatic atrocity of the highest order," Sofer tweeted."Our hearts and prayers are with those killed by the terrorists and we send our deepest condolences to their families," he wrote.Ceremonies to pay respects to the victims of the 26/11 attacks were also held in the southern Israeli city of Beersheva on Thursday.At a separate ceremony held at Beersheva Cricket Club that was mostly attended by Jews of Indian origin and Rabbi Meir Simcha of the Chabad Movement, the attendees condemned Pakistan and called for India and Israel to stand together in the fight against terror."We are proud to have friends like India. Our scriptures say that the word 'Hodu' (Hebrew word for India) comes from Hodaya, which means thanks and gratefulness, and we genuinely feel thankful to have friends like you all. We share this pain and it strengthens our resolve to stay together," Rabbi Simcha said.Israeli lawmaker and former minister of defence Moshe Ya'alon also paid respects to the victims of 26/11."Some of those behind the attack, to this day, have not faced justice. Israel, India and the entire Western world are united in preserving the legacy of the victims, and in collaborating on the fight to eradicate terror throughout the world," Ya'alon said in a tweet.People had also gathered to pay their respects to the victims of the Mumbai attacks in Tel Aviv, Rehovot and Jerusalem on Wednesday. They held posters of victims, pictures of the mayhem in Mumbai and flags of India and Israel."Terrorists from Pakistan, who perpetrated these horrific attacks hoped that by striking the places where our countries and people come together, they would succeed in driving us apart. But they failed miserably in their attempts as this actually brought the people and governments of India and Israel closer than ever before," said Pramod Sharma, counsellor at the Embassy of India."India and Israel are now strategic partners cooperating in several spheres, including against terrorism," Sharma said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/memorial-plaque-for-jewish-victims-of-26-11-mumbai-attacks-unveiled-at-israel-synagogue-176730

27-11-2020||Chandigarh||AFT among other tribunals to see significant functional change after SC verdict||The character and functioning of quasi-judicial bodies like the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT), among others, would change significantly after the Supreme Court on Friday said that a National Tribunal Commission shall be created for administering all tribunals in the country.This ruling by a Bench comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat, would free the tribunals from the executive control of the ministry in relation to which they were mandated to hear cases.The apex court has further directed that till the commission is created, a separate wing shall be constituted under the Finance Ministry to look after all requirements of the tribunals, which from now on shall not be dependent upon ministries against which they may have to pass orders or judgments.The court has expressed displeasure that multiple decisions of Constitution Benches have not been implemented by the Central government till date.There are several tribunals in India that were constituted with the objective of delivering speedy, inexpensive and decentralised adjudication of disputes in various matters such as service, tax, railway claims, environment and defence service.The SC has also held that the secretary of the concerned department against whom orders are to be passed by the tribunal shall not have a say or vote in the selection of members for the tribunal.Legal experts said that the decision would finally free all tribunals from executive control and ensure their independence and boost confidence of litigants.The direct positive effect of the decision would be felt by tribunals such as the AFT and the National Green Tribunal (NGT), which were functioning under the same ministries which were the opposite parties in litigation before them and whose secretaries were selecting the adjudicating members of the said tribunals.A Bench comprising Justices AK Sikri and RK Jain of the Punjab and Haryana High Court had, in the case filed by high court lawyer Major Navdeep Singh in 2012, also directed the government to take the AFT out from the purview of the Ministry of Defence and to reconstitute the selection committee.“The high court’s decision had been challenged in the SC by the government but the SC had not stayed its operation. Only contempt proceedings had been stayed,” Navdeep Singh, when contacted, said. “Now the SC has in effect reiterated the same observations strongly”, he added.According to the SC’s orders today, members of the tribunals shall get an increased tenure of 5 years and the house rent allowance would also be hiked to Rs 1.25 lakh and Rs 1.5 lakh for the members and chairpersons respectively.The Madras Bar Association was the lead litigant in the judgment pronounced today and a similar petition filed by the AFT Bar Association through its Secretary, Rajiv Manglik, was also listed with it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aft-among-other-tribunals-to-see-significant-functional-change-after-sc-verdict-176726

27-11-2020||New Delhi||Farmers say entering Delhi is not the aim; a concrete decision on three Acts is the only way out||Facing widespread criticism over its handling of farmers ‘Delhi Chalo’ agitation, the BJP-led Centre blinked, allowing farmers to enter the National Capital.Though farmer jathebandis said entering Delhi is not the only aim as they also wanted a concrete decision on three “anti-farmer” central Acts.AIKSCC and Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, which earlier wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him to begin “sincere dialogue” on the issue, said the “Government of India had to surrender to the will and resolve of farmers of India, to march into the National Capital, to voice their demands and express their resistance against the three black central farm laws”.“The Union Home Ministry finalised Nirankari Grounds in Burari for farmers’ protest and allowed free passage of farmers into Delhi. This is as per the assertion of farmers that they have a right to come to the capital of the nation to air their grievances,” they said after the decision. Some farmers, including those who entered via the Tikri border following a stand-off with the police, trickled into the Nirankari Ground in north Delhi where the ruling Aam Aadmi Party has made “arrangements to facilitate farmers to raise their voice against BJP’s tyranny with ‘bulandi’”, those at the Singhu border appear to have decided to stay put for the night. Slamming the BJP for its “cruelty against farmers”, AAP leader Raghav Chadda said “we will treat farmers as our guests… let the BJP do what it wants, it will pay the price”, adding that AAP will provide the farmers whatever they require like water, toilet facilities etc.It is not just the Opposition, use of force on protesting farmers from Punjab and Haryana has also drawn criticism from Sangh-affiliate Bharatiya Kisan Sangh which asked the government to identify those “provoking and misleading” them and ensure the agitation is resolved peacefully and MSP guaranteed in open market as well. As ‘Jathebandis’ at Singhu border decide the next course of action (whether to stay at the national highway or move towards Burari tomorrow) several leaders said their aim is not just to enter Delhi but a concrete action on the three “anti-farmer laws” which the Narendra Modi-led Centre is calling “revolutionary decisions in favour of farmers”. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar urged farmers to come forth for talks.“Farmers across the country are satisfied while Punjab farmers are being misled for politics,” Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar insisted even as seeking “sincere dialogue”, farmers organisations urged the prime minister to “call the all-India/regional platforms of the farmers for sincere discussions with senior ministers of your Cabinet on demands to repeal the three Farm Acts and the Electricity Bill 2020”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-say-entering-delhi-is-not-the-aim-a-concrete-decision-on-three-acts-is-the-only-way-out-176722

As a consequence, the Union Home Minister was constrained to call another review meeting on November 15, where he reviewed the Covid19 situation in Delhi, it added.The Ministry of Home Affairs, in an affidavit, said currently 10 states contribute almost 77 per cent of the active case load in the country.

We stand at a total death count of 0.13 million," said the affidavit.The MHA said it will continue making efforts to bring the CFR (case fatality rate) down to less than 1 per cent, and accelerate efforts in reducing the positivity rate, which stands at 6.9 per cent, and India is now testing, on an average, almost 1.1 million samples daily.It submitted that as on November 24, a total of 15,454 dedicated Covid treatment facilities with 1,54,6983 dedicated isolation beds (including 2,67,886 101 oxygen supported beds) have been identified.

Yadav was then in the Aam Aadmi Party.The court was hearing an application filed by Yogesh Gaur, the legal heir of the complainant Surender Kumar Sharma, who died recently. In his application, Gaur has sought substitution of the name of complainant. “All the three accused persons are exempted through their counsel for today (Nov 25) only and they are directed to join the proceedings on the next date of hearing without any failure,” the court said.In their application seeking adjournment, the counsel for Kejriwal and Sisodia also told the court that their main advocate was suffering from COVID-19. The judge posted the matter for further hearing on December 3.Sharma, in his complaint, had alleged that in 2013 he was approached by volunteers of AAP who had asked him to contest the Delhi Assembly elections on a party ticket, saying Kejriwal was pleased with his social services.He said he filled up the application form to contest the polls after being told by Sisodia and Yadav that AAP's Political Affairs Committee had decided to give him the ticket. However, it was later denied to him.On October 14, 2013, the complainant claimed that articles in leading newspapers carried "defamatory, unlawful and derogatory words used by the accused persons" which have lowered his reputation in the Bar and the society.Opposing the complaint, the accused had submitted that cancellation or allotment of an election ticket was the prerogative of the party and the complainant had not divulged correct information regarding the cases pending against him.

He won the Lok Sabha election in 1984 uncontested as a Congress candidate.Lalduhoma, who lost his Lok Sabha membership after he resigned from the Congress, also became the first MLA of the state to lose his membership for defection."After a thorough study of the case and hearing the statements from the respondent (Lalduhoma) and the petitioners, it is clearly verified that the MLA has joined the ZPM in theory and practice, which the respondent himself admitted in his declaration on September 19," said the Speaker.Twelve MLAs of the ruling Mizo National Front (MNF) had petitioned the Speaker, seeking the disqualification of Lalduhoma for allegedly violating Para 2(2) of 10th Schedule of Constitution.The Speaker said that Lalduhoma had forsaken his character as an Independent and defected to the ZPM, which was clearly indicated by his actions."Now, therefore, on the basis of findings, I have no other option but to carry out my solemn duty under Constitution against the MLA, who was elected independently and was not set up by any political party.“The petitions filed by the petitioners seeking the disqualification of the MLA are allowed, and therefore Lalduhoma has been disqualified from being a member of Mizoram Legislative Assembly," said Sailo.The Speaker said he relied on the Supreme Court ruling on the case pertaining to 'Jagjit Singh versus state of Haryana and others'.In September, 12 MNF legislators had filed petitions seeking disqualification of Lalduhoma.The MLAs had alleged that it was unbecoming of a lawmaker to violate the law.Following the petition, the state Assembly on October 8 issued a show-cause notice to Lalduhoma to clarify as to why he should not be disqualified.In his reply, Lalduhoma said that he did not defect to any other party as he continuously maintained allegiance to the ZPM and had to contest the Assembly polls as an Independent because the ZPM had not obtained registration at that time.He had also said that the ZPM was formed by different parties in 2017 and all the candidates supported by the ZPM vowed their allegiance to the party, preached the same manifesto and used one symbol.Lalduhoma had also said that he should not be weighed on the same scale as Jagjit Singh nor should he be charged under Para 2(2) of 10th Schedule of Constitution, which clearly implies defection by those members elected as Independent, who have no support or sponsorship of any political party at the time of the election.In 2018, he had won the elections from two seats – Aizawl West-I and Serchhip where he defeated incumbent Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla of the Congress. Later, he vacated the Aizawl West-I seat to retain Serchhip.Speaking to reporters after the Speaker announced his disqualification, Lalduhoma said he had not decided whether to move court and his party's leadership would make the final decision.

It was also then directed by the government that this year APAR may be submitted as per the timeline without the medical report.Under the revised timeline for APAR, issue of blank forms or online generation of report for the previous fiscal was to be done by July 31 and the entire process, which includes review of controlling authorities as well as receipt and disposal of representations from aggrieved employees, is to finish by March 31, 2021.Generation of APAR in the Central government is now an online process only through a system called Smart Performance Appraisal Report Recording Online Window (SPARROW).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/group-a-officers-exempted-from-submitting-annual-medical-report-due-to-covid-19-situation-176707
27-11-2020||Patna||'Who made him Deputy CM?' Nitish Kumar erupts in anger in Bihar Assembly||The Bihar assembly Friday plunged into turmoil following an uncharacteristically angry outburst by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar after having stoically listened to barbs and allegations by opposition leader Tejashwi Yadav.Kumar, who is known for his composure and impeaccable manners all through his four terms in office, was seen standing up and screaming jhooth bol raha hai yeh (he is speaking a lie).Kumar, who chose not to react when the 31-year-old RJD leader made a series of personal attacks and allegations in his nearly an hour-long speecha, erupted in anger when the latter sought to interject during a statement made by JD(U) leader and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary.Chaudhary had voiced his disapproval of references made by Yadav in his speech to a murder case in which Kumar had been named an accused, a case of plagiarism lodged by a JNU scholar with regard to a book published by a Patna-based think-tank which was endorsed by the chief minister, besides the Srijan scam which is being investigated by the CBI.Yadav rose in his chair and said, "It was a serious matter that I raised on the basis of facts. Is it not true that the chief minister had to pay a fine in connection with the murder case".The interjection by the young leader proved to be the proverbial last straw for the chief minister, who got up and screamed: "He is speaking a lie. I challenge the Chair to get the veracity of his statement examined and take necessary action. I have been listening to his diatribe simply because he is the son of a friend whom I treat like a brother"."Does he know how his father (Lalu Prasad) became the chief minister? Has he forgotten who made him the Deputy CM? I had to part ways simply because he did not heed my advice to explain things," Kumar said trembling with anger.Notably, Kumar was among the leaders of the erstwhile Janata Dal who had supported Lalu Prasad in the election for the legislature party leader in 1990 wherein the latter's victory against veteran leaders Ram Sundar Das and Raghunath Jha had enabled the then Chhapra MP to become the chief minister of Bihar and script a political success story.After remaining bitterly opposed to each other for over a decade thereafter, Kumar and Prasad had joined hands with the objective of defeating BJP in 2015. The Grand Alliance they had formed taking the Congress along, won the assembly polls held that year handsomely.In 2017 Yadav's name cropped up in a money laundering scheme and the RJDs stout refusal to heed demands of resignations of the young leader, who had become the deputy chief minister at only 26 years of age, caused Kumar to walk out of the Grand Alliance and return to the NDA."When I had asked him (Yadav) to explain things, he did not because he could not. Now even a charge sheet has been filed against him. What nonsense are you (Yadav) talking? Do I not know you well enough," Kumar said as the House erupted in pandemonium.Speaker Vijay Kumar Sinha adjourned the House for 30 minutes.Later when the House resumed, Kumar gave a speech by way of the governments reply to the debate on the governors address to the newly constituted assembly.He said the opposition is entitled to having its aspirations but maryada (decorum) must never be violated.He also sought to dismiss misgivings about his ability to keep communalism under check in the face of his tie-up with BJP, which has returned with a greater tally than his JD(U).People might not remember that when I co-founded the Samata Party with late George Fernandes, our first coalition partner was CPI(ML), he said referring to the ultra-Left outfit which is now an RJD ally.I' know well that every political party has its own style of functioning, but my commitment to social harmony remains unaffected. And I will continue with my development agenda as well," Kumar said."Members of the House are welcome to draw my attention towards any shortcomings in the implementation of schemes. Needful action will be done," he added.The motion of thanks to the governor's address was thereafter passed by voice vote in the Assembly. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-made-him-deputy-cm-nitish-kumar-erupts-in-anger-in-bihar-assembly-176706
27-11-2020||Noida (UP)||BKU farmers from west UP headed to Delhi||Hundreds of western Uttar Pradesh farmers on Friday headed to the national capital in response to a “Delhi Chalo” call to protest against the three central farm laws.On a Bharatiya Kisan Union call to join the protest in Delhi, the farmers belonging to Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Gautam Buddh Nagar and other western UP districts reached the Eastern Peripheral Expressway in Greater Noida on Friday afternoon, when they were stopped by the police.Shortly later, they left the Peripheral Expressway as the announcement came that the protestors have been allowed to march to Delhi."We have started our onward march. But our route to Delhi is yet to be decided by our union leaders. We may take the UP Gate route (via Ghaziabad) or the Kalindi Kunj route (via Noida)," BKU's UP unit spokesperson Pawan Khatana told PTI.The BKU has lent its support to the "Dilli Chalo" call of Punjab and Haryana farmers protesting against the new farm laws, he said."These laws are anti-farmer and should be taken back or changed. There should be a new law on minimum support price of crops to benefit farmers," Khatana told PTI.Gautam Buddh Nagar's Additional Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Love Kumar said the protest was peaceful and the security was stepped up to ensure that the situation does not aggravate."The situation at the expressway is peaceful and under control. There has been no violence or untoward situation. The police are making efforts to ensure there is no law and order situation," Kumar said.Farmers have been protesting against the Centre's farm laws fearing that they would lead to the dismantling of the minimum support price mechanism, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.They have been demanding the repeal of the new laws.

27-11-2020||Mumbai||My govt stable, allies will contest polls together: Thackeray||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) allies will fight all elections, including the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) poll, together.Thackeray (60), who is heading the Shiv Sena-NCP- Congress alliance ministry, was speaking to select media at his official residence Varsha in south Mumbai, as the MVA regime completes a year in office on Saturday.“The MVA will fight all elections including the BMC poll (due in 2022) together,” Thackeray said, adding that he did not feel the need to react to speculation that the MVA partners will fight the polls separately.Asserting that his government is stable, Thackeray said the alliance partners are perceived to be ideologically different but the interests of the state and welfare of people binds the three parties together.“We were in an ideological alliance earlier but the very foundation of that ideology, (based on) trust and faith, was betrayed,” Thackeray said, alluding to the power his Shiv Sena party shared in the state with the BJP during 1995-1999 and again during 2014-19.Thackeray defended his party’s alliance with political rivals Congress and NCP to form government, saying Shiv Sena was in alliance with a partner (BJP) which had a dark mind.“You will now realise what we went through when we were in alliance with BJP. The pervert mind is now exposed,” he said, referring to BJP targeting his wife Rashmi in land deals and son Aaditya in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case.Thackeray said the most unforgettable moment last year was the “betrayal by a friend” of 25 to 30 years. “Perversion and being cultured are different. Pervert politics is being seen now,” he said, slamming the BJP.Shiv Sena had criticised BJP on policy matters and did not target family members, he said.On Hindutva, Thackeray said, “My definition of Hindutva hasn’t changed. It is cultured and not pervert like the BJP. Culture is very important in Hindutva.”“When we are with you (BJP), we are good. The land deals happened when you were in government,” Thackeray said, referring to BJP’s claim that Rashmi Thackeray had land deals with Anvay Naik, the architect who committed suicide in 2018.He said BJP leaders targeting him are all outsiders and do not belong to the ‘original’ BJP. “Is the BJP being run by outsiders now,” he asked.Asked about his national ambitions, Thackeray said the three-party alliance in Maharashtra against the BJP did send a message at national level.“I will keep walking. I took up this responsibility (chief minister’s post) out of anger over BJP’s betrayal.There is no point in keeping undue expectations. Let us see what happens,” he said.“He can keep dreaming. To dream is not a crime,” Thackeray said when asked about the claim by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis that he would return to power.Thackeray also rubbished reports that the Sharad Pawar-led NCP may go with the BJP. “I am confident that NCP will stay in the MVA,” he added.He also made light of criticism that the MVA regime was “remote-controlled” by Pawar. “Whenever he (Pawar) meets me, he shares his experiences and nothing else,” Thackeray said. “I don’t sit with a slate and chalk when he comes to me,” he added.Thackeray said tackling the coronavirus pandemic in the early days of his tenure was a daunting and challenging task.“Though I lacked administrative skills, my political allies and bureaucracy worked in unison with me. We are the first state to have a task force and guidelines for COVID-19 treatment. Field hospitals in Mumbai were created in 17 days,” he said.Despite the coronavirus-induced lockdown, Maharashtra signed several MoUs for investment in the state, Thackeray said.“Around 60 to 70 per cent of MoUs worth Rs 17000 crore were signed in June and are on path of implementation in terms of granting of permissions and land acquisition for the projects. MoUs worth Rs 35000 crore more were also signed recently,” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/my-govt-stable-allies-will-contest-polls-together-thackeray-176703
27-11-2020||---||India plunges into technical recession as GDP contracts 7.5 per cent in July-Sept quarter||New Delhi, November 27The economy contracted by 7.5 per cent in the second quarter (July-September) of 2020-21 as against a fall of 23.9 per cent during the stringent lockdown months of the first quarter (April to June), according to government data released on Friday.With the contraction in two successive quarters, India has entered into a technical recession but the Union Finance Ministry feels the latest data, especially the high frequency indicators, suggest a recovery is under way.The government, however, was not willing to commit that the fourth quarter could see positive growth after it was clear that the third quarter GDP growth will also be negative. “Recovery provides optimism but we urge caution on the pandemic. Winter months must warrant caution and safety protocols must be followed stringently as service to the nation,’’ said the Ministry’s Chief Economic Advisor Kris Subramanian.In a break from the past, the government used six new indicators in a total of 23 to project -7.5 per cent GDP growth. These include data of rice and fish, purchase of private vehicles, passenger traffic at airports and Centre’s revenue spending.There was V-shaped recovery in use-based industries in consumer goods, especially consumer durables, and investment, capital and infrastructure goods which suggest strong revival of both consumption and investment that together account for about 90 per cent of India’s GDP, said the Finance Ministry.The corporate sector seemed back on track in the second quarter after two quarters of contraction, with its level of operating profits similar to that in September 2018, said Subramanian. However, bank credit rose by a little over 5.2 per cent and gross fixed capital formation remained in the negative territory.The government also released the index of industrial production (IIP) which showed that core sector growth has remained in the negative zone at minus -13.0 per cent. In October the decline was minus 2.5 per cent after raising hopes in September about returning to positive territory with a contraction of 0.1 per cent.On the positive side, steel production and consumption gathered momentum, signalling revival of construction activity. Power consumption and e-way bills also registered double-digit growth in October, suggesting buoyancy in industrial and commercial activitiesAnalysts, however, pointed out that consumption remains low, industrial recovery is still weak and the traction seen in IIP growth lately is triggered largely by the festival demand which was also pointed out on Wednesday by the Reserve Bank chief Shaktikanta Das.Recovery ignites optimism, but a cautious optimism. Sustainability of the recovery critically depends on keeping the pandemic in control. — Union Finance MinistryWe are certain this trend will continue. Private consumption is weak and increased Government spending would help the momentum for a more robust growth in the coming months. — Chandrajit Banerjee, DG, CII.The growth in manufacturing, though very nominal, is something to cheer for. The real test would be in Q4 when the festive season gets to closure and sustaining the demand would be a challenger. — Divakar Vijayasarathy, DVS Advisors LLPWe believe personal safety and convenience is driving the demand in auto and durables in Q2. It is clear that the size of unaffected parts of the economy is far greater than stressed sectors.

27-11-2020||Patna||'I fear physical and mental harm', says BJP MLA who filed complaint against Lalu Prasad Yadav||BJP MLA Lalan Kumar Paswan, whom incarcerated RJD president Lalu Prasad had allegedly telephoned from Ranchi, told the Bihar Assembly on Friday that he feared "physical and mental harm" after having exposed the "powerful" leader.Paswan, who represents Pirpainti constituency, made the claim in a cleverly-timed interjection, while leader of the opposition Tejaswhi Yadav, the RJD supremo's younger son and heir apparent, was taking part in the debate on governor's address to the newly constituted Assembly.Rising from his seat, Paswan, who lodged a complaint against Prasad with the state vigilance department on the previous day, told the chair, "I have made a disclosure about a telephonic call by the national president of a political party. I fear physical and mental harm, to myself and my family, from the powerful people involved in the enticement offered to me".Prasad, who is serving sentence in Ranchi for his involvement in fodder scam cases, had made the purported call on Tuesday, when he had asked Paswan to remain "absent" during the election of the speaker scheduled the day after.In the audio clip of the conversation that has gone viral on the social media, Paswan can be heard expressing his inability to do so, pointing out that he was bound by the party discipline."We will take care of you......we will be having our own Speaker. This government will fall and you will be made a minister thereafter," the former chief minister can be heard as saying.Former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who had flagged the alleged telephone call on his Twitter handle on Tuesday night, also shared on social media the contents of the FIR lodged against Prasad.After making his statement in the House, Paswan said, in a deft play of the Dalit card, "as a member of this House, I seek protection. I feel insecure in the midst of such a vitiated political atmosphere. There is still a perception that those from weaker sections are always up for sale.The proceedings were drowned in pandemonium for a few minutes thereafter as minister Shravan Kumar rose and said "it is indeed a serious matter. The House must ensure safety and security of its members".Yadav, who had been flaying the government over its alleged mishandling of the COVID pandemic, quipped testily "the ruling dispensation is obviously angry with me. The anger is predictably being directed at our national president".Earlier, Yadav's repeated averment that the government was formed through the 'chor darwaza' (back door)—an allusion to alleged manipulations by pliant officials in closely-fought constituencies during the recent assembly polls—was strongly criticized by parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary."The government has been formed by a coalition which won majority in a legitimate electoral exercise. In this backdrop, the expression 'chor darwaz' shall be deemed unparliamentary," Chaudhary said.The RJD has been hurling the back door barb since 2017, when Nitish Kumar made an abrupt exit from the Grand Alliance and formed a government with the BJP within 24 hours of his resignation.Chaudhary, a senior leader of the JD(U), also expressed disapproval of references to the chief minister having been named in a murder case dating back to 1991 and some other "unsubstantiated allegations" and requested that these be deleted from the records of the proceedings. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/i-fear-physical-and-mental-harm-says-bjp-mla-who-filed-complaint-against-lalu-prasad-yadav-176685

Yet, our endeavours are meant to not only preserve and celebrate the past but also build and nurture the future," he said.Inauguration of three school by Foreign Secretary @harshvshringla in GorkhaWatch live here: https://t.co/ohN7SQJKFk#IndiaNepalFriendship @PMOIndia @MEAIndia  The foreign secretary said given the young population—both in India and Nepal—education is a crucial bridge."Seventy schools and 150 health facilities are coming up in 12 districts of Nepal with Indian support," he said, adding that few projects are as satisfying as those that promote learning and the health for the well-being of our citizens.In June, the Indian Embassy in Nepal said it will rebuild 56 higher secondary schools, replete with furniture and modern sustainable technology, in Gorkha, Nuwakot, Dhading, Dolakha, Kavrepalanchowk, Ramechhap and Sindhupalchok districts.These schools are being rebuilt as part of the Indian government's post-earthquake reconstruction works in Nepal with a grant of around Rs 184 crore.Apart from the reconstruction of the schools, the Indian government has also extended a helping hand in rebuilding houses damaged in the earthquake in the Himalayan nation."The outlay of Indian earthquake-related assistance is USD 1 billion but its true value is not in monetary terms. It lies in how it has helped communities on the ground. To cite an instance, 46,000 houses have been built in Gorkha and Nuwakot. They incorporate earthquake-resilient technologies in line with your motto of 'Build Back Better'," Shringla said at the AIDIA event.

27-11-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal transport minister Suvendu Adhikari resigns||In a blow to Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) government in West Bengal, Suvendu Adhikari, who held three important portfolios including transport, resigned from the cabinet on Friday.The resignation was accepted by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee who sent it across to the Governor for further action. Adhikari’s three portfolios---transport, water resources and irrigation---have been retained by Chief Minister for the time being.Adhikari, in the resignation letter addressed to Banerjee, thanked her for giving him “an opportunity to serve the people of the state” and added that he did his job “with commitment, dedication and sincerity”.Adhikari mentioned that he was forwarding a copy of the resignation letter to Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar.That Adhikari was considering quitting the cabinet became clear when he resigned from the post of chairman of Hooghly River Bridge Commission last evening. Banerjee retaliated by immediately replacing him with loyalist MP Kalyan Banerjee as the new chairman of HRBC.Adhikari also resigned from Haldia Development Council, a state government body under urban development department, on Friday.A well-known face of the Nandigram movement, Adhikari, who has the reputation of being a mass leader, is believed to be unhappy with TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and political heir Abhishek Banerjee.Adhikari has been holding independent political rallies for a while triggering off speculations about his growing differences with the party.Senior TMC leader Saugata Roy was tasked with holding parleys with Adhikari. Following Adhikari’s resignation from cabinet, Roy said he had not resigned from the Assembly yet nor had he quit the TMC. There was still hope that his “grievances” could be resolved, Roy claimed.A visibly elated BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said he had always maintained that it was not possible for a decent person to survive in TMC. He cited Mukul Roy, Saumitra Khan, Arjun Singh and others who left the TMC to join BJP.WBPCC chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said Adhikari was like a pillar of the TMC. “The pillars of TMC are leaving one after another ---the building is going to collapse soon,” Chowdhury said.Sujan Chakraborty, CPI(M) MLA and leader of Left Front in state assembly, said Mamata Banerjee had introduced defection by MLAs in West Bengal and now it had come back to haunt her.Suvendu Adhikari’s father Sisir Adhikari and younger brother Dibyendu Adhikari are both Lok Sabha members from TMC. Another brother Soumen Adhikari is chairman of Kanthi Municipal Corporation.Adhikari’s plan of action for future is still not clear. Both BJP and Congress have said that their doors are open for him.In another setback for TMC, party MLA from Cooch Behar Dakshin constituency Mihir Giswami turned up in Delhi to join BJP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-transport-minister-suvendu-adhikari-resigns-176670
27-11-2020||Satya Prakash||Centre blames Delhi govt for second wave of Covid in capital||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 27The Centre on Friday blamed the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government for worsening COVID-19 situation in the national capital, saying: “That no effective preventive steps to contain the infection.”In an affidavit in the Supreme Court, it said the Delhi Government was lax in containing COVID-19 and its failure to enforce measures led to a massive increase in the coronavirus infection and increasing strain on the capacity of medical infrastructure in the hospitals.“The 10 states contribute almost 77 per cent of the active caseload for the country. These are Maharashtra (18.9 per cent) Kerala (14.7 per cent), Delhi (8.5 per cent), West Bengal (5.7 per cent), Karnataka (5.6 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (5.4 per cent), Rajasthan (5.5 per cent), Chhattisgarh (5 per cent), Haryana (4.7 per cent) and Andhra Pradesh (3.1 per cent),” it stated.The affidavit has been filled in response to a suo motu PIL initiated by a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan.Noting that there were no effective steps to contain the infection, the Centre said: “Despite repeated exhortations in the wake of rising COVID-19 cases, the Delhi government did not take steps to enhance testing capacity, particularly for RT-PCR, which remained static at around 20,000 RT-PCR tests for a long time.”It said: “The containment measures, as prescribed by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) including house to house surveillance, contact tracing, quarantining and clinical management, were also not done properly, which has led to the spread of infection.”“Patients who were under home isolation were not properly traced and/or their contact were also not traced effectively,” the Centre stated.“GNCTD was aware that the confluence of winter, festival season and pollution were likely to witness a surge in cases. This foreknowledge ought to have led to strict enforcement and IEC measures being instituted well in time. However, this was not done. While there were regular advertisements on achievements of the Delhi government, including on dengue prevention and control, no ads on COVID-appropriate behaviour were to be seen. The people, at large, were also not apprised about this through regular outreach measures,” the Centre submitted.“The report of a high-power committee headed by Dr VK Paul, Member, NITI Aayog, had recommended that Delhi should plan for a surge of around 15,000 cases per day and accordingly provide for about 6,500 ICU beds. Against this recommendation, GNCTD did not take any timely measures to increase the ICU beds from the present level of around 3,500, thus causing a sudden pressure to come on the health and medical infrastructure in Delhi,” the affidavit reads.“As most of the countries are observing resurgence of COVID cases, given the size and density of our population, the country has done remarkably well in restricting the spread. Our recovery rate has gone up to 93.76 per cent, with almost 8.6 million recoveries made. The average cases per day have reduced by 50 per cent since the past eight weeks,” the Centre said.“Currently, only two states have more than 50,000 cases and they contribute to almost 33 per cent of the overall active cases. Our case fatality rate remains low at 1.46 per cent, when compared to a global average of 2.36 per cent. We stand at a total death count of 0.13 million. We will continue making efforts to bring our CFR down to less than 1 per cent, and accelerate our efforts in reducing the positivity rate, which stands at 6.9 per cent,” the Centre submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-blames-delhi-govt-for-second-wave-of-covid-in-capital-176661

27-11-2020||Mumbai||MVA govt can’t be intimidated by ED, CBI probes: Thackeray||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has hit out at the BJP for indulging in “politics of vendetta” and said his Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government cannot be intimidated by the ED and the CBI probes.He said this in an interview to Sena MP Sanjay Raut, who is also the executive editor of the party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, on the occasion of the MVA government completing a year in office on Saturday.“This government has the blessings of people and it cannot be intimidated by ED and CBI probes. There is no end to vendetta politics. I am not in favour in taking this path. Stop this political perversity,” Thackeray said.His statement comes three days after the Enforcement Directorates (ED) conducted raids at the premises linked to Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik in Mumbai and neighbouring Thane in connection with a money-laundering case.The Chief Minister expressed confidence that his government comprising Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress will complete the next four years in office and said that it was up to the people to decide after that.Thackeray said NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Congress president Sonia Gandhi showed political courage to join hands with the Shiv Sena to form the MVA government last year.“Some people thought these three parties will not come together and that the Shiv Sena had no option but to go behind them,” he said without naming the BJP.The Shiv Sena and the BJP had contested the 2019 Maharashtra Assembly elections together but the alliance fell apart after results following differences over sharing the chief ministerial post.The Shiv Sena, which won 56 seats, had said the two parties had reached such an understanding before the elections, a claim denied by the BJP. The Sena then joined hands with the NCP and the Congress to form the government.On the BJP’s claim that it would wrest the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) from the Shiv Sena in the 2022 civic polls, Thackeray said the BMC, which is controlled by his party, was a strong fortress of trust for the Sena.“Mumbaikars will not allow the fortress to crumble,” he said.Slamming the BJP out without naming it for targeting his son and state minister Aaditya Thackeray in the Sushant Singh Rajput death case, he said: “When I am challenged, I am encouraged. Don’t misjudge my demeanour of composure and patience.”“Even you have families and children and you are not clean. Not just me but the people of the state will teach you a lesson,” Thackeray said.“Politicisation of Sushant Singh Rajput’s death was cheap politics...worse than perversity,” he said.He admitted that he had no experience of running a government and administration but his family had a history of serving the people.“There is excellent cooperation from allies in running the administration. While presiding over cabinet meetings, what surprises me is that all colleagues from the Congress and the NCP give me so much respect, although we were political rivals till recently. There is no tightrope walk. We have gelled with each other very well. I was never under pressure of power. I had seen power from close, even though I had not experienced it,” he said.Replying to a query about him driving to Mantralaya (state secretariat) and his official bungalow ‘Varsha’ from his personal residence in Bandra, he said his feet were firmly on the ground.“The clutch, break, accelerator and the steering wheel are firmly in my hands,” he said.On the criticism that he had remained indoors during the pandemic, he said, “I am working from my office. If I had not ventured out, the Shiv Sena wouldn’t have grown. Even during the lockdown, investments worth crores of rupees were brought to the state,” he said.Speaking on “love jihad”, a term used by BJP leaders to describe religious conversions in the guise of marriage, Thackeray asked whether the BJP’s alliances with parties and leaders of different ideologies such as PDP, Chandrababu Naidu, Nitish Kumar and Ram Vilas Paswan weren’t “political love jihad”.Thackeray said being in the government he got less time to spend with Shiv sainiks in the last one year.“Then there is coronavirus, due to which political gatherings are not allowed,” he said.

27-11-2020||---||Farmers write to PM; request him to let them enter Delhi, protest peacefully||New Delhi, November 27The AIKSCC and the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Delhi Commissioner of Police, requesting him to let farmers enter Delhi and protest peacefully in the capital while upholding their democratic right to protest.The letter addressed to the Prime Minister of India reads: “At least now the Government of India should stop its confrontationist attitude of denying the largest section of our society an opportunity to be heard and sincere dialogue should be initiated. It becomes meaningless for the government to offer talks and not create a conducive atmosphere for such talks to happen.”Appending the letter to the PM, farmers told the Commissioner that “content of which is self-explanatory”.“You are aware of the march of farmers from all over India to Delhi and the status thereof. In view of the emergent and urgent situation that has emerged, you are requested to take necessary action and act accordingly, in terms of the submissions made to the Prime Minister of India. We are confident that you will do the needful to facilitate the peaceful and democratic protest of the farmers of India,” they wrote to the Commissioner of Police.In their letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, farmers ask him to “ensure that the farmers have a free and safe passage into Delhi without creating a situation where any untoward incident is justified later on, as having been necessitated, which will cause a completely avoidable break away from the very peaceful manner that we have adopted so far.”“Allot a space like Ramlila Maidan where we can gather and also hold talks with the government. Call the all-India/regional platforms of the farmers for sincere discussions with senior ministers of your cabinet on demands to repeal the 3 Farm Acts and the Electricity Bill 2020,” they added in the letter.The letter is signed by the coordination committee of Samyukt Kisan Morcha, which includes Balbir Singh Rajewal, Daljeet Singh Dallewala, Gurnam Singh Chaduni, VM Singh, Raju Shetti, Shivkumar Sharma Kakkaji, Yogendra Yadav.The letter reads: “As you are aware, determined and resolute farmers are marching towards Delhi in lakhs from different states of India, including Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and so on, under the leadership of various national and regional platforms of farmers organisations. A Samyukt Kisan Morcha was created in the recent past as a coordination mechanism for this Dilli Chalo program of the farmers.”“These farmers, including youth, have had to face unprecedented obstacles placed in their way by Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments presumably also at the behest of the Central Government, which tried every possible means to stop them – regular barricades, sand-laden trucks in multiple layers, barbed wire fences, huge boulders placed across the roads and even trenches on the road, water cannons and tear gas. All of this in the cruel winter in north India. We are still managing to march forward, and thankfully without any untoward incident so far. Thousands of farmers have reached the borders of the capital region of the country, and just like we have been resolutely moving forward, we shall continue to do so today as well,” it reads further.“The nation, and the Government of India, in particular, have reached a crucial juncture when they have to ensure that farmers should not undergo this, and to ensure that no untoward incident occurs in an unfortunate stand-off between our ‘annadatas’ and the government. It is because our voices were not heard and taken into account when framing the ordinances or passing them as Acts in the Parliament that has brought about this situation. The representations given to you multiple times in mounting agitations by farmers and their organisations across India are yet to receive replies from you,” the letter concludes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-write-to-pm-request-him-to-let-them-enter-delhi-protest-peacefully-176644
27-11-2020||New Delhi||SC extends by a week parole of Perarivalan serving life in Rajiv Gandhi assassination case||The Supreme Court Friday extended by one week the parole of AG Perarivalan, serving life term in Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, for medical treatment.A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat said the court had extended the parole by a week on November 23 and directed the state to provide escort to Perarivalan.It said that an interlocutory application has been filed by the petitioner seeking extension of parole by 90 days because of ailment and need for surgical intervention.The top court said that in view of the submissions of senior advocate Gopal Shankarnarayanan, appearing for the petitioner and advocate Balaji Srinivasan, representing Tamil Nadu, Perarivalan's parole is extended by one week from Friday.The bench clarified that it will be the last extension of parole and directed the state to provide police escort to Perarivalan for visiting the doctor.Perarivalan was first granted parole from November 9 to November 23 by the Madras High Court on medical grounds, which was extended by the top court.At the outset, Shankarnarayanan said that Perarivalan has 25 per cent blockage in kidney and needs surgical intervention.To this the bench told Shankarnarayanan that he is seeking extension of parole by 90 days but the senior counsel replied that they should not have asked for three months extension.The bench said that why doesn't the petitioner ask the government as it is the state which has also recommended his release.Shankarnarayanan said that it might not be proper as the last extension of parole was granted by this court.Srinivasan pointed out to the court that as per relevant rules Perarivalan is entitled to 30 days parole every two years but till now he has already availed of 51 days over and above his entitlement.He submitted that Perarivalain wants to go to a hospital which is 200 Km away and not to the CMC Vellore, which is only 25 km away from his house.Referring to the order passed by the High Court on November 6, Srinivasan said that while granting an extension of 14 days it has specifically observed that no further extension will be granted.He said that the hospital in which Perarivalan is seeking treatment also has a “background”.The bench warned the counsel for petitioner that he should not resort to his sharp practices and his counsels should take care of it.On November 23, the top court had directed the Tamil Nadu government to provide police escort to Perarivalan during his visit to the hospital.The CBI, in its affidavit of November 20, has told the apex court that the Tamil Nadu Governor has to take a call on grant of remission to Perarivalan.The CBI said Perarivalan is not the subject matter of further investigation carried out by the CBI-led Multi-Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA) which is conducting a probe on the aspect of “larger conspiracy” as per the mandate of the Jain Commission report.The top court is hearing the plea of 46-year-old Perarivalan seeking suspension of his life sentence in the case till the MDMA probe is completed.On November 3, the top court had expressed unhappiness over the pendency of a plea by a convict seeking pardon in the case for over two years with the Tamil Nadu Governor.The CBI, in its 24-page affidavit, said, “It is for the His Excellency Governor of Tamil Nadu to take a call on the issue whether remission is to be granted or not and in so far as relief is concerned in the present matter CBI has no role”.The state government had earlier told the top court that the Cabinet has already passed a resolution on September 9, 2018 and recommended to the Governor for the premature release of all seven convicts in the case.Perarivalan's counsel had earlier said his role was only limited to procuring nine-volt batteries, which were allegedly used in the improvised explosive device (IED) that had killed Gandhi.The top court had earlier dismissed a plea of Perarivalan seeking recall of the May 11, 1999 verdict upholding his conviction, saying the material brought on record does not inspire confidence to interfere with the verdict in which he and three others were initially awarded the death sentence, later commuted to life term.Gandhi was assassinated on the night of May 21, 1991 at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu by a woman suicide bomber, identified as Dhanu, at a poll rally. Fourteen others, including Dhanu herself, were also killed.Gandhi's assassination was perhaps the first case of suicide bombing which had claimed the life of a high-profile leader. In its May 1999 order, the top court had upheld the death sentence of four convicts -- Perarivalan, Murugan, Santham and Nalini.In April 2000, the Tamil Nadu Governor had commuted the death sentence of Nalini on the basis of the state government's recommendation and an appeal by former Congress president and Rajiv Gandhi's widow Sonia Gandhi.On February 18, 2014, the top court had commuted the death sentence of Perarivalan to life imprisonment, along with that of two other prisoners—Santhan and Murugan -- on the grounds of an 11-year delay in deciding their mercy pleas by the Centre.

The vaccine supplies for the global market will be produced by RDIF’s international partners in India, Brazil, China, South Korea and other countries, RDIF said.“We are delighted to announce the agreement between RDIF and Hetero that will pave the way to production of the safe and highly effective Sputnik V vaccine on Indian soil,” Russian Direct Investment Fund CEO Kirill Dmitriev said.The vaccine’s interim clinical trial results show 95 per cent efficacy on the 42nd day after the first dose, he added.“Thanks to our cooperation with Hetero, we will be able to significantly increase production capacity and provide people of India with an efficient solution in this challenging period of the pandemic,” Dmitriev said.The Gamaleya Center and RDIF on Tuesday had announced that the efficacy of its Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine is over 95 per cent and the cost of one dose of the shot for international markets will be less than USD 10 (around Rs 740).“We are pleased to collaborate with RDIF as a manufacturing partner for the most anticipated Sputnik V vaccine for... COVID-19. While we look forward to the clinical trial results in India, we believe that manufacturing the product locally is crucial to enable swift access to patients,” Hetero Labs International Marketing Director B Murali Krishna Reddy said.Meanwhile, on Monday, pharma major AstraZeneca had said an interim analysis of clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine in the UK and Brazil showed that it was 70 per cent effective on average.

27-11-2020||Satya Prakash||FIR against Arnab Goswami prima facie doesn’t establish abetment to suicide charge: SC||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 27Sixteen days after ordering release of Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami’s release, the Supreme Court on Friday delivered a detailed judgement which said the FIR against him prima facie didn’t establish abetment to suicide charge.A Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud said “a prima facie evaluation of the FIR does not establish the ingredients of the offence of abetment of suicide under Section 306 of the IPC.”It ordered that the interim bail granted to Goswami and  two other accused—Feroz Mohammad Shaikh and Neetish Sarda—on November 11 shall remain operational four weeks after the Bombay High Court disposed of their plea for quashing of the FIR. If rejected, they can move the top court.The top court criticised the Bombay High Court for failing to notice the contents of the FIR and making a prima facie evaluation and abdicating its role, functions and jurisdiction when seized of a petition under Section 482 of the CrPC.The high court should not have refused to exercise its powers “when a citizen has been arbitrarily deprived of their personal liberty in an excess of state power.”The top court lamented that 91,568 bail applications were pending in High Courts, while 1.96 lakh such pleas were hanging fire in district courts.Maintaining that “Liberty is not a gift for the few”, the top court asked high courts and District Court’s to monitor pendency of bail applications to ensure protection of personal liberty of ordinary people.“It is through the instrumentality of bail that our criminal justice system’s primordial interest in preserving the presumption of innocence finds its most eloquent expression. The remedy of bail is the solemn expression of the humaneness of the justice system,” it said.Noting that fair investigation of crime was an aid to it, the Bench said, “Equally it is the duty of courts across the spectrum – the district judiciary, the High Courts and the Supreme Court – to ensure that the criminal law does not become a weapon for the selective harassment of citizens.“Courts should be alive to both ends of the spectrum – the need to ensure the proper enforcement of criminal law on the one hand and the need, on the other, of ensuring that the law does not become a ruse for targeted harassment,” said the Bench which had on November 11 ordered Maharashtra Government to release Goswami forthwith.It would be a travesty of justice if personal liberty of a person was curtailed like this, it had said.Goswami and the two other accused had challenged the Bombay High Court’s November 9 order denying them interim bail in connection with the 2018 alleged abetment to suicide of an interior designer and had asked them to approach the sessions court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fir-against-arnab-goswami-prima-facie-doesnt-establish-abetment-to-suicide-charge-sc-176628
27-11-2020||New Delhi/Chandigarh||Delhi Chalo march: After clash, farmers allowed to enter Capital; Burari ground new epicentre of protest||After facing tear gas, water cannons and clashing with security personnel, hundreds of farmers entered the national capital on Friday to hold peaceful protest at a north Delhi ground, but there were still thousands at border points who were undecided to go to the identified demonstration site and a clarity in their decision is expected on Saturday.Around 600 farmers protesting against the Centre’s new farm laws headed to Sant Nirankari Ground, one of the biggest in the national capital, following several hours of confrontation with the police at different border points with Haryana.After a meeting between farmer leaders and senior police officers, the Delhi Police allowed protesters to hold demonstration peacefully at Nirankari Ground, but senior farmer leader Darshan Pal later said they would stay put at border points on Friday night and a decision on whether to go to the identified protest site or not will be taken on Saturday.At the Tikri border, some groups of farmers were escorted by police personnel around 3 pm amid tight security and taken towards the identified protest site. But those gathered at the Singhu border, one of the main routes used to access the city from Punjab, had not entered the city till late evening.Carrying flags and shouting slogans, thousands of farmers gathered at various entry points into the national capital in a determined bid to push their way through as part of their ‘Delhi Chalo’ march while police blocked them with barricades, tear gas shells and batons.Earlier, more Punjab farmers crossed the state’s border with Haryana, some of them after facing water cannons and teargas as they headed towards Delhi to join thousands who had already reached the national capital’s borders.But by evening, all Haryana Police barricades at the border with Punjab and along the highway to Delhi were lifted, allowing traffic to run as before.Traffic on the highway to Delhi and other roads was restored, with the Haryana Police removing barricades meant to thwart the “Delhi Chalo” protest against the Centre’s new farm laws.“The barriers which had been put up earlier have been lifted. Vehicular traffic is plying normally,” Karnal Range Inspector General of Police Bharti Arora told PTI over phone.After braving water cannons and clashing with security personnel, thousands of farmers started entering the national capital on Friday from the Tikri border following permission by Delhi Police to hold peaceful protests at the city’s Burari ground.Thousands of farmers gathered at various entry points into the national capital were allowed in on Friday to hold a peaceful protest at a north Delhi ground, defusing some of the tension building up since morning around the city’s edges and beyond.Also read: Protesting Punjab AAP MLAs detained from outside PM's residence in DelhiFarmers say entering Delhi is not the aim; a concrete decision on three Acts is the only way outFarmer climbs atop police vehicle during protest, turns off water cannon; photo goes viralThe concession came after hours of a standoff that saw police using teargas shells, water cannons and multi-layer barriers to block the protesters and the farmers pelting stones and breaking barricades in some places in their determination to push through as part of their ‘Delhi Chalo’ march against the Centre’s new farm laws.“After holding discussion with farmer leaders, the protesting farmers have been permitted inside Delhi to hold peaceful protest at Nirankari Ground in Burari. We appeal to all farmers to maintain peace,” said Delhi Police PRO Eish Singhal.At the Tikri border, farmers were escorted by police personnel amid tight security around 3 pm and taken towards the Nirankari Ground, one of the biggest in the city.                 But those gathered at the Singhu border, one of the main routes used to access the city from Punjab, had not entered the city till evening.                 As the issue snowballed, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said no government in the world can stop farmers fighting the “battle of truth”.In a tweet in Hindi, Gandhi said the prime minister should remember that whenever arrogance takes on truth, it gets defeated.“The Modi government will have to agree to the demands of the farmers and take back the black laws. This is just the beginning!” he tweeted with the hashtag ‘IamWithFarmers’.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday welcomed the Union government's decision allowing farmers to enter the national capital and hold peaceful agitation.Earlier in the day, agitating farmers at the Delhi-Haryana Singhu border had pelted stones and broke barricades as they clashed with Delhi Police which used tear gas shells to disperse them.Police said farmers have been allowed to hold peaceful protest at the Nirankari Ground in north Delhi."I welcome the Centre's decision to allow farmers to enter Delhi to exercise their democratic right to protest. They should also now initiate immediate talks to address farmers' concerns on the #FarmLaws and resolve the simmering issue," Amarinder Singh said in a tweet.Punjab farmers’ bodies claimed that the Union Government has allowed them entry into Delhi with a permission to hold their agitation at the Burari ground.Farm union leader Jagmohan Singh confirmed that farmers from 30 unions have reached near Delhi."Delhi police have given us an offer of holding a dharna at Burari Maidan in Delhi, but we will discuss this will all the unions," he added.BKU Ekta Ugrahan leader Shingara Singh Mann, who had entered Haryana from Dabwali, along with a farmers' convey, has crossed Sirsa as of now."Haryana police has not stopped us anywhere. Although there were hurdles on the highway, they have been removed by the farmers. We are moving ahead to Delhi. We have got information that Delhi police is planning to open borders for farmers and is offering them protest site in Delhi.”Delhi police removed barricades from the Tikri border and allowed protesting farmers to enter the national capital.Face-off between farmers, police near Delhi borderDespite heavy security deployment, groups of agitating farmers from Punjab and Haryana reached near two Delhi borders on Friday morning after breaking police barricades on the way as part of their protest march against the Centre's new farm laws.Clashes broke out at multiple places and Delhi's borders resembled a virtual battle zone with restless crowds of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, milling around and a sea of police personnel keeping them at bay. Drones circled the air and plumes of smoke from teargas shells could be seen from far.Beyond the border points, the tension spilled over on highways where groups of farmers squatted on the road, and stood in trucks and tractors, waiting impatiently to make their way to the national capital.  The Delhi Police has enhanced deployment of tear gas, security personnel, stationed sand-laden trucks and water cannons and used barbed wire for fencing at the Singhu border (Delhi-Haryana border) to prevent the protesters from entering the city. Police were also deployed on Delhi's border with Faridabad and Gurgaon.A faceoff occurred between farmers and police at the Singhu border near Kundli as the agitating farmers who want to move towards Delhi resorted to stone-pelting and the police used tear shells to disperse them.

27-11-2020||NEW DELHI||Restoration of H-1B visas on India’s agenda||While regional security issues and sale of defence equipment will continue to occupy prominent space in India’s confabulations with the new US administration, it will seek to restore H-1B visas and roll back trade disputes that have lingered unresolved through the four years of the Trump administration.India will be seeking the restoration of the H-1B visa programme that has been availed by lakhs of Indians in the past but was suspended by Trump on grounds that they were taking away jobs meant for locals. US President-elect Joe Biden, during his election campaign, had promised to reverse many restrictions imposed by Trump on documented migration.In this regard, India will again take up the issue of “totalisation agreement” which provides social security protection. India will be seeking to restore GSP, a scheme for duty-free tariff treatment of over 10 per cent of its exports to the US, estimated at nearly Rs 50,000 crores. What were zero duty exports now attract one to seven per cent cess on the top 15 GSP items.India’s walkout of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Cooperation (RCEP) partnership signed between 15 countries will come in useful in parrying the US demands for accommodation in agricultural trade, removal of price controls on high-end medical devices and lower tariffs in industrial sectors, said sources. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/restoration-of-h-1b-visas-on-indias-agenda-176376

27-11-2020||New Delhi||A-G bats for judicial reforms, four courts of appeal to cut pendency||As the pendency of cases in the Supreme Court keeps rising, Attorney General KK Venugopal on Thursday suggested structural change in the judiciary to set up four courts of appeal to hear appeals from the High Courts and make the top court a truly constitutional court.“The Supreme Court is the apex court of the country and it should be dealing with only matters of national and constitutional importance,” Venugopal said in his Constitution Day address at a function organised by the Supreme Court. The Constitution should be amended for this purpose, he added.KK Venugopal, Attorney GeneralEasing burdenAt present, the Supreme Court hears 400 types of cases, including matrimonial matters, landlord-tenant disputes, bail matters and land acquisition cases, which the apex court of other countries don’t even touch.The four courts of appeal with 15 judges each sitting in four parts of India would reduce the burden of the Supreme Court, the Attorney General said in the virtual presence of President Ram Nath Kovind, CJI SA Bobde, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, senior judges and Bar members.He pointed out that at present, the Supreme Court was hearing 400 different categories of cases, including matrimonial matters, landlord-tenant disputes, bail matters and land acquisition cases, which the apex court of other countries don't even touch. Because of this, there were arrears even in criminal matters, he added.“Now, we can start with a clean slate and the Supreme Court as the apex constitutional court of the country should be burdened with only constitutional cases. Then, as against the 75,000 cases at present, it would have to cater to only 2000 to 3000 cases per year,” Venugopal said. He said similar system of court of appeal was already functional in 20 to 25 common law countries. “Such a court shall hear the matter finally and there should be no further appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court. The judges of the court of appeal shall be selected by the collegium,” the Attorney General said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/a-g-bats-for-judicial-reforms-four-courts-of-appeal-to-cut-pendency-176471
