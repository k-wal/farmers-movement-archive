He later commanded the same battalion as a Lieutenant Colonel during the 1971 war.The 5/1 Gorkha Rifles was tasked to attack the well-fortified positions of Pakistan at Uthali and Darsana locations of Jessore in the Eastern Sector.These positions had a series of concrete pillboxes interconnected with communication trenches. Lt Col C Venugopal made a meticulous plan of attack and successfully captured two important positions which caused the enemy to withdraw.The 5/1 Gurkha Rifles pursued the retreating enemy without giving them any rest or time to regroup that led to the capture of Jhenida Post, Jessore within three days. For his leadership and aggressive battle planning resulting in large military gains, he was awarded the second highest gallantry award, Maha Vir Chakra, a defence statement said.Post retirement, the General had limited social interaction and led a bachelor’s life in the White House at Tirupati. The sad demise of the brave son of the soil of Andhra Pradesh is a great loss to the Army and the nation as a whole, the statement added.His last journey was curtailed due to the Covid pandemic and a ceremonial wreath laying ceremony was organised at Tirupati with limited attendance of relatives, civil dignitaries and the Armed Forces veterans.Major General Chittoor Venugopal donated his mortal remains to Sri Venkateshwara Medical College, added the defence statement.

28-04-2021||London||UK adds 3 oxygen ‘factories’ to life-saving supplies for India||The UK on Wednesday said it will send further vital oxygen equipment to India in support of the country’s fight against COVID-19, including so-called “oxygen factories” capable of high levels of oxygen production per minute.Three oxygen generation units will be sent from surplus stocks in Northern Ireland, with each oxygen unit capable of producing 500 litres of oxygen per minute, enough for 50 people to use at a time.The mini-factories, the size of shipping containers, have been organised to meet the ongoing massive demand for oxygen at Indian hospitals as one of the main requirements during a devastating second wave of the pandemic in the country.“We have all seen the harrowing pictures of what is happening in India. It pains each one of us who is seeing those scenes,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock, during a Downing Street briefing on Wednesday evening.“India is a stark reminder that the pandemic is not over and a reminder of the need to be vigilant,” he said, as he revealed that he had been working with the devolved Northern Ireland government to organise the supply of the oxygen production equipment.The supply will be over and above the equipment already sent and on its way to India, including 495 oxygen concentrators and 200 ventilators, also sent from surplus stocks.The first batch of the medical supplies arrived in Delhi around 0100 local time on Tuesday and the rest is due to arrive in Delhi by Friday.“We stand with our Indian friends in their fight against COVID-19. International collaboration is more essential than ever, and this additional UK support package will help meet India’s current needs, particularly for more oxygen,” said UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) said the support was sent in response to a request from India and a pledge from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the UK to do all it can to help.The assistance package has been sourced by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and funded by the FCDO.

28-04-2021|| New Delhi||People will keep dying and you will keep sitting, Delhi HC reproaches Centre on oxygen, Remdisivir||The Delhi High Court on Wednesday expressed its unhappiness with the Centre over non-supply of the full oxygen quota allocated to the national capital and objected to a "change" in COVID treatment protocol on Remdesivir use, saying "it appears you want people to die"."This is wrong. This is a complete non-application of mind. Now people who do not have oxygen will not get Remdesivir either," Justice Prathiba M Singh said when the central government submitted that under the COVID treatment protocol being followed now only patients on oxygen support were being given Remdesivir."It appears you want people to die," the judge said.Noting that the nation is facing an unprecedented crisis, the court also appealed to citizens and suppliers not to hoard oxygen cylinders and medicines to avoid creating an artificial shortage."People will keep dying and you will keep sitting," a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said, questioning the Centre's order which allots oxygen to the national capital from three far off plants in West Bengal and Odisha that consumes a lot of time in transportation."The allocation made by the Centre to Delhi is 490 Metric Tonnes per day. Not for a single day, Delhi has been able to get the complete quantity,” it said adding that this is primarily because three of the plants are situated in West Bengal and Odisha which are at a distance of 1300-1500 km from here.The bench, which heard the matter for four hours, asked senior advocate Raj Shekhar Rao, who was appointed amicus curiae, to study the national allocation order and give suggestions on optimal usage of tankers and minimisation of turn-around time.It said Rao may communicate the suggestions to Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who had initially opposed the idea of amicus looking into the national allocation plan.During the hearing, senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, said the issue was raised at the central war room.When the central government officer concerned denied it, Mehra said they would again do it and this time the communication would be in writing.“People will keep dying and you will keep sitting. So many lives we are losing because of your inaction. What about the promise of 480-490 Metric Tonnes of oxygen per day. How many states are facing the kind of shortage Delhi is facing,” the bench said to the central government officer.The bench said now Delhi government has even arranged the tankers and what was the point of allocating certain quantity of oxygen to Delhi when it was not being supplied.“It actually pains my heart. I don't know what to say now. At least take empty tankers back by air,” Justice Palli said.The bench further said, “You have to do it on SOS basis. You can't say one round of oxygen for Delhi will take 5 days. You can airlift empty tankers. If your turn around time is five days, we must say your allocation is bad.” To this, Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma said whatever is humanly possible is being done and there is a complete coordinated effort in this regard.During the hearing, Mehta assured the bench that the government will re-apply mind on mapping and said if the amicus looks at it, it will be counter-productive.The bench said the amicus will come up with suggestions and the Centre shall look into the logistic problems relating to transporting oxygen from the far away plants to Delhi.The court asked the Centre to file its response in this regard by April 30.Justice Singh also said the court will consider later whether a medical committee should review if the protocols or guidelines for administering Remdesivir need any modification."Don't change the protocol only to reduce the shortage. That is wrong. As a result, doctors are not able to prescribe Remdesivir," the court said and added, "This is complete mismanagement." The high court is handling multiple petitions relating to the pandemic with various benches conducting marathon hearings.The bench headed by Justice Sanghi appointed senior advocate Raj Shekhar Rao as amicus curiae to assist the court in dealing with the medical oxygen crisis and other issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.It also asked the Delhi government to place a report on the number of RT-PCR tests conducted in the last seven days and the reasons for the reduction in the tests.The court was informed that at the time of discharge of COVID-19 patients from hospitals, the process of a no-objection certificate by Third Party Administrators (TPA), attached to insurance companies, is taking a long time of 7-8 hours resulting in a delay in discharge and admission of new patients.The court said such delays are bound to result in more sufferings for patients and their attendants and directed the insurance companies and their TPAs to ensure that the time take to grant NOCs is reduced so that such a problem does not arise.The bench also asked the Delhi government to examine the suggestion by senior advocate Krishnan Venugopal for taking services of armed forces in this situation as they can set up field hospitals which will help a large number of COVID-19 patients in the national capital, and take appropriate steps.Venugopal said that there is a large section of medical practitioners, who on account of the pandemic, are confined to their homes and there is a huge number of COVID-19 patients who do not get immediate medical advice and treatment and the delay results in complications.He suggested that the medical officers, who voluntarily offer their services, can be contacted through a centralised system and the patients can consult them.The bench said his suggestion was worth consideration and directed the Centre and the Delhi government to examine the same and file replies.Another issue was raised that a large number of ambulances are carrying bodies of COVID-19 patients to crematoriums and due to the long queue, it takes time to complete the journey and the vehicles can't used for ferrying patients to hospitals.The court asked the Delhi government to consider the suggestion that old DTC buses be used to carry bodies to crematoriums and file its reply in two days.It also asked the government to consider the suggestion of senior advocate G Tushar Rao that mohalla clinics be used for providing immediate consultation and treatment to COVID-19 patients and also for the collection of test samples.The court was also informed that in pursuance of its Tuesday's direction, the Delhi government has issued orders relating to the allocation of medical oxygen to hospitals taking into account the requirement for ICU beds and other oxygen beds.It noted that the government's order mentions the names of oxygen refiller units that would supply the gas cylinders to the hospitals here and directed the state to implement it forthwith.Following a court's order, some of the refillers were present in the hearing and assured the bench that they will comply with the government's order in letter and spirit and also made some suggestions to streamline the supplies to hospitals and individuals.One of the suggestions was that few refillers can cater to the needs of oxygen cylinders by individuals who are being treated for COVID-19 at homes and the others can supply to hospitals.The court said that a meeting should be conducted between Delhi government officers and refillers on the issue today evening and in the meantime, the state shall provide cylinders to individuals.The court appealed to citizens not to hoard oxygen cylinders and medicines required for COVID-19 patients to avoid creating artificial scarcity and make them available to people in need.“The nation is facing an unprecedented crisis. It is in times like these that we the people need to stand up and showcase our qualities and virtues which all of us have. We appeal to the good sense of people not to resort to black marketing and hoarding of oxygen cylinders, flow meters or medicines and to make them available to the needy.“Hoarding of medicines or oxygen leads to artificial scarcity to an exte nt which may not be safe,” the bench said.Earlier in the hearing, the court observed, “All refillers… our understanding is that they are hoarding and selling oxygen cylinders in black. We will do something about it”. To this, some of the refillers assured the court that there was no hoarding at their end and non of the plants were indulging in black marketing.“Apke parivar ko sabki dua lagegi (your family will be blessed by everyone). We don't want to take any strict action against anyone. So you all comply with the government's order on refillers,” the bench said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/people-will-keep-dying-and-you-will-keep-sitting-delhi-hc-reproaches-centre-on-oxygen-remdisivir-245476

28-04-2021||Bengaluru||Asked to increase PDS rice supply, Karnataka minister tells farmer ‘to die’||Karnataka Food and Civil Supplies Minister Umesh Katti on Wednesday drew flak from Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa and opposition parties for reportedly asking a farmer to die when he requested enhanced supply of rice though the Public Distribution System.Katti later withdrew his statement, tendered an apology and said he never wanted anyone to die and that everyone should prosper.Ishwar, the farmer activist from Gadag in North Karnataka, rang up Katti on Wednesday and asked him how he expected people to survive on just 2 kg of rice a month when the lockdown has rendered thousands jobless.To Ishwar’s query, the minister replied that the Centre would be giving 5kg foodgrains in May and June in view of the lockdown.This did not satisfy the farmer, who then sought to know whether people should fast till that period or die.“It’s better to die. It’s better that you stop the business of selling rice. Don’t ring me again,” Katti said.The government had decided to give 2 kg of rice and 3 kg of ragi through PDS in South Karnataka, and 2 kg of rice and 3 kg of either maize or wheat in North Karnataka.The minister later clarified that he never meant anyone should die and that all 6.5 crore people in Karnataka should prosper and survive.He said the entire quota of food grains under the PDS for April, allotted by the Centre, had already been distributed.“What can I do if someone makes such a statement? We are giving the Central quota from May 1 to May 10. No one should die and no one should ask such questions.”  The Chief Minister’s Office, in a statement, quoted Yediyurappa as saying that he disapproved of the remarks and that it does not behove a minister to tell a farmer to die when the latter demanded 5 kg of rice.“Arrangements are being made to give five kg of rice to the people in the area who do not need wheat,” he said.Congress state chief D K Shivakumar slammed Katti’s remarks and demanded that the government remove him from his post.“BJP Minister Umesh Katti has abused a citizen & asked him to ‘go die’ just because he asked him why Karnataka Govt has cut Rice under PDS to just 2 kgs! “CM @BSYBJP (Yediyurappa) must immediately throw him out of the cabinet for this most insensitive statement.Does this Govt have any shame?” Shivakumar tweeted.Former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy too lambasted Katti for his statement.“The Food and Civil Supplies Minister, who is supposed to come to the aid of the starving people in this COVID-19 pandemic, has displayed his mental distortion,” he tweeted.He said it was ‘inhumane’ on the part of the Minister to make such a statement.

28-04-2021||Beijing||Melting glaciers threaten China’s plan to build massive dam over Brahmaputra in Tibet: Media report||Melting glaciers and barrier lakes could threaten China’s plan to build the world’s biggest hydroelectric dam over the Brahmaputra river in Tibet close to the Arunachal Pradesh border, a media report said on Wednesday.The proposed dam which one Chinese official said has “no parallel in history” will be built in Medog county, where the Brahmaputra Grand Canyon is located. Medog is the last county in Tibet which is located close to the Arunachal Pradesh border.The plan to build the mega-dam, which is part of China’s 14th five-year plan beginning from this year, was approved by China’s Parliament, the National People’s Congress in March this year.But the engineers are concerned about the threats posed by landslides and barrier lakes to the dam, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.“But an icy obstacle could put a halt to much of the plan. In 2018, a landslide caused by a melting glacier blocked the Yarlung Tsangpo – the upper stream of the Brahmaputra river – at the Sedongpu Basin in Milin county,” it said.It formed a lake containing about 600 million cubic metres of water. With the river spilling over the top at present, the dam could collapse at any time, it said.The Sedongpu lake sits just a few dozen kilometres upstream from the planned construction site of the super hydropower plant. With so much water hanging overhead, no construction workers can move in to clear the ground, it said.To build the big dam, they must get rid of the small dam formed by the landslide first, the report said.India and Bangladesh, the lower riparian states, have raised concerns over China’s plan to build the massive dam on Brahmaputra river. But China has downplayed such anxieties saying it would keep their interests in mind.As a lower riparian state with considerable established user rights to the waters of the trans-border rivers, the Indian government has consistently conveyed its views and concerns to the Chinese authorities and has urged them to ensure that the interests of downstream states are not harmed by any activities in upstream areas.Brahmaputra river is known as Yarlung Zangbo in Tibet.The Brahmaputra is the longest river in Tibet and its valley in southern Tibet is the world’s deepest with a 7,000-metre (23,000-foot) drop from the highest mountain peak to the lowest basin.China plans to build a hydropower plant in the valley with electricity generation capacity reaching 70 gigawatts, about three times that of the Three Gorges Dam, currently the world’s largest built by the country, the report said.Several teams of scientists and engineers have flown to Sedongpu in recent years, including some of the nation’s top experts in civil engineering, glacier study and landslide prevention. They collected a large amount of data on the site using drones and other advanced equipment and were asked by authorities to come up with a solution after finishing their assessment, it said.“The situation is very difficult. There is not an immediate solution yet,” Xing Aiguo, a professor of civil engineering at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University who was involved in one of the studies told the Post.The experts could not find a way to strengthen the landslide dam or remove it safely. Worse still, they found similar disasters would likely happen again in the same area, thanks to climate change.“The area is large and there are many glaciers,” Xing said. Even if there is a method, treating such a harsh natural landscape with engineering methods could be technically challenging and costly, he said.A quarter of the glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau have disappeared since the 1970s, and two-thirds of the remaining will be gone by the end of the century, the Post report quoted an estimate by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Studies have found that increased meltwater and rising temperatures could make the “roof of the world” more habitable with greater crop yields and advancing tree lines, but the risk of natural disasters, including flooding and landslides, also increased.And ice could turn a landslide into something more destructive. At Sedongpu, for instance, the icy debris travelled more than 10km with a top speed of 72km/h according to an estimate by Tibet autonomous region’s geological environmental monitoring station.The icy material also loosened the landslide dam and made it more prone to collapse. The sheer drop in elevation means even a relatively small amount of water could cause serious destruction downstream, it said.Liu Chuanzheng, a government researcher with the Consultative Centre of Geohazard Mitigation under the Ministry of Natural Resources in Beijing, said human activity in the Sedongpu area “should be avoided altogether”.“The development and utilisation of natural resources and energy in the Yarlung Tsangpo river must fully consider the situation of avalanches and debris flows in the Sedongpu valley,” he said in an official report about the landslide published in the journal Geology in China in 2019.Some Chinese scientists have proposed that instead of building a super dam, a 16km-long tunnel could be dug through one of the high mountains in the Yarlung Tsangpo valley.The water could be directed into the tunnel to push electricity generating turbines. This scheme would reduce the power output to 50GW – or about twice that of the Three Gorges Dam – but reduce the risk of damage from landslides or other natural disasters.

28-04-2021||Amethi||FIR against Amethi man for tweet asking for oxygen cylinder||Police have booked a man here under the Epidemic Act after he made an appealed on Twitter for an oxygen cylinder for his critically-ill grandfather. "Need oxygen cylinder, ASAP," Shashank Yadav had tweeted on Monday, and tagged Bollywood actor Sonu Sood. He made no mention of whether his grandfather had tested positive for COVID-19.On Tuesday, Union minister and Amethi MP Smriti Irani tweeted in response, "Called Shashank thrice...no response on the number shared by you in your tweet." She also said she had alerted the District Magistrate and Amethi Police to find the person and help him.When asked about the matter, Superintendent of Police Dinesh Singh said on Wednesday Yadav had tweeted for a distant relative."When he was called, he did not pick up. We thought he might be in some problem and therefore he was not picking up the phone. So we used surveillance and tracked his location and reached his house, where he was found sleeping," Singh said."Shashank's motive was to create sensation and fear," he added.The Amethi Police tweeted on Tuesday, "Neither the patient had Covid-19 infection nor did he require oxygen. He died due to cardiac arrest at 8 pm Monday. Making such tweets are not only condemnable but also an offence".An FIR was lodged against Yadav under relevant sections of the Epidemic Act, and he was served a notice under section 41 of the CrPC (requiring appearance before police to prevent the person from committing any further offence), the SP said.Yadav was taken to a police station for questioning, but was later let off, he said.Chief Medical Officer, Ashutosh Dubey said Yadav's relative was not COVID-19 positive and was receiving treatment under a private doctor.The patient was also not taken to the nearby community health centre and did not die due to lack of oxygen, he added. — Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fir-against-amethi-man-for-tweet-asking-for-oxygen-cylinder-245447
28-04-2021||London||As India helped others, so must we in their time of need: Prince Charles in COVID-aid appeal||Britain’s Prince Charles on Wednesday made an impassioned plea as he backed an emergency appeal launched by his charity, British Asian Trust, and urged people to help India as it copes with a “horrific” second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.The 72-year-old heir to the British throne spoke of his “great love” for India, where he has paid several visits, and said that those suffering the effects of this pandemic in the country are in his “thoughts and prayers”.“For well over a year the pandemic has had a devastating impact on so many of us around the world. This week, I have been deeply saddened by the tragic images we have all seen as COVID-19 takes its horrific toll in India,” read a statement by Prince Charles, released by Clarence House.“With support from the Indian diaspora, the British Asian Trust has launched an emergency appeal for India to channel this desire to do something about this terrible situation and help save lives. Many members of the diaspora, and others including businesses, trusts and foundations, have already come together behind this appeal. I do hope that even more of us might be able to provide support to help those in India in their time of need,” he said.“Like many others, I have a great love for India and have enjoyed many wonderful visits to the country. Indian aid and ingenuity has been a support to other countries throughout this immensely difficult time. As India has helped others, so now must we help India,” he said, adding that “we will win this battle” together.The British Asian Trust, founded by Prince Charles, had launched an emergency appeal entitled “Oxygen For India” to help meet the urgent needs of overrun hospitals in India.The appeal is being supported by the British International Doctors Association (BIDA) who have partnered with the British Asian Trust to help raise funds, with a target of raising GBP 100,000.“We have seen the terrible impact of the pandemic worldwide but the devastation in India currently is one of the worst points of the last 12 months,” said Hitan Mehta, Executive Director of the British Asian Trust.“The astronomical numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India are frightening and we fear there is still a peak to come. What we can do now is provide essential support as quickly as possible to help those most in need. Our ‘Oxygen For India’ emergency appeal has been set up to provide vital supplies and equipment to save lives. We simply cannot stand by and do nothing,” he said.The appeal says a donation of GBP 50 will provide oxygen for 40 patients struggling to breathe, GBP 450 will provide low-flow oxygen concentrator to help 900 patients and an GBP-830 donation will provide high-flow oxygen concentrator to help 550 of the most seriously ill patients.All funds raised by the “Oxygen For India” emergency appeal will go towards providing as many oxygen concentrators to hospitals as quickly as possible.Oxygen concentrators are alternate devices to oxygen cylinders – while cylinders contain a finite amount of oxygen supply, a concentrator continually recycles oxygen from the air and delivers it to the patient, it explains.Many British Indian Trust Ambassadors, including actors Sanjeev Bhaskar, Meera Syal and Nitin Ganatra and cricketer Isa Guha, have been vocal about the launch of the appeal across social media.“Devastating scenes in India where people are dying in the streets due to COVID-19, please take a look at the British Asian Trust’s emergency appeal. Please share. #OxygenForIndia Please give generously,” said Ganatra, in his Twitter appeal.India is struggling with a second wave of the pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days, and hospitals in several states reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds.India saw a record single-day rise of 3,60,960 coronavirus cases, which pushed the total tally to 1,79,97,267, while the death toll crossed two lakh following 3,293 fresh fatalities, the health ministry said on Wednesday.The death toll stands at 2,01,187, it said.

28-04-2021||New Delhi||Negative Covid-19 report or full vaccination must for candidates to enter counting halls: EC||Candidates or their agents will not be allowed inside counting halls without a negative coronavirus report or without having both Covid-19 vaccine doses, the Election Commission said Wednesday in its latest guidelines for counting of votes on May 2.             Issued amid spiralling coronavirus cases, the guidelines bar public gatherings outside venues during the counting process, but allow candidates to name a fresh agent if the first one tests positive for Covid-19.Counting of votes for assembly polls in Assam, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry, besides various other assemblies and Lok Sabha bypolls begins at 8 am on May 2.“No candidates or agents will be allowed inside the counting hall without undergoing RT-PCR/RAT test or without having two doses of vaccination against Covid-19 and will have to produce negative RT-PCR report or RAT report or vaccination reports within 48 hours of start of counting,” the guidelines read.The district election officers will organise Covid tests for candidates and their counting agents, it said.The Madras High Court had earlier this week made harsh observations against the EC for failing to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour during campaigning. The poll panel has to apprise the high court on April 30 about steps it has taken to ensure a Covid-safe counting process.The fresh EC guidelines go beyond the ones issued by poll panel for the Bihar assembly elections last year which were being used as a template for elections being held during the coronavirus pandemic.On Tuesday, the poll panel had barred victory processions after counting to check large gatherings amid rising coronavirus cases.It had also restricted the number of people who could accompany the candidate to collect his or her election certificate from the returning officer.As per the latest guidelines, there should be sufficient number of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits for counting agents and candidates.“The counting agents’ sitting arrangement shall be made in such a way that between 2 counting agents 1 agent shall be in PPE,” the guideline read.The counting hall, according to the EC, should be sufficiently big to maintain social distancing, and should have proper ventilation, windows, exhaust fan as per available protocol of the State Disaster Management Authority.The counting centres should be disinfected before, during and after the counting, while sealed outer boxes of electronic voting machines and paper trail machines should also be disinfected.The number of counting tables to be allowed in a counting hall should be as per the size of the hall and keeping in view safety norms prescribed for Covid- 19, the Commission said.The counting of votes of a constituency may be considered at 3-4 halls by appointing additional assistant returning officers, the EC said.The staff and security personnel deployed for counting will be provided with face masks and shields, sanitisers and gloves, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/negative-covid-19-report-or-full-vaccination-must-for-candidates-to-enter-counting-halls-ec-245444

In certain cases, there may be a requirement to administer oxygen to the patient,” a circular issued by the ECHS Central Organisation at Army Headquarters on April 27 states.“If an ECHS beneficiary who is having complaints of fever, cough, or diarrhoea, etc., and consults a doctor at a service, government, empanelled or non-empanelled hospital, where he is advised home isolation and RT-PCR test, he will be entitled to purchase a home isolation package,” the circular adds.The cost incurred on availing the package by a patient will be reimbursed by ECHS with a ceiling limit if Rs 1,000 per day up to 14 days from the date of advice for home quarantine.In addition, the use of oxygen cylinder or oxygen concentrator a home, provision of ambulance to shift a patient to hospital if the need arises and blood tests RT-PCR and CT-scan would also be reimbursable for home quarantine.ECHS provides medi-care to retired armed forces personnel, their dependents and some other entitled categories through a network of 427 polyclinics spread across the country. It has a scriber base of over 50 lakh beneficiaries.Following the recent surge in COVID-19 cases, ECHS polyclinics have been opened up for providing COVID-19 treatment to its beneficiaries. Yesterday, the Defence Minister, Rajnath Singh had also approved the hiring of additional contractual staff in 51 ECHS facilities to cater to the increased work load.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/echs-introduces-home-isolation-package-for-covid-19-affected-veterans-245431
28-04-2021||Kolkata||Kolkata’s dwindling Chinese Indians look for better future||It is early morning at Tiretta bazaar, the oldest China Town in the country. Only a handful Indians of Chinese descent have gathered to partake of the bazaar’s famous breakfast menu, a medley of Indian and Chinese cuisines.Elections and a COVID-19 surge have kept most people from the community, who normally throng the place, away from stalls selling momos, soups and an eclectic and delectable array of cooked and raw food.The minuscule population of around 2,000 Chinese Indians, who live scattered in the city from Burrabazar to Beleghata and from Tangra to New Town in Rajarhat, is being wooed by rival political parties jostling to win closely contested seats in the metropolis where even a few hundred votes could affect the results with graffiti in Mandarin script.“We are mostly an apolitical community but we follow news closely. People will vote as they see fit,” said David Chen, 59, the proprietor of Sen Fo & Co., an 84-year-old shoe manufacturing business on nearby Bentinck Street.The Choong Ye Thong Church on Meredith Street, a stone’s throw from Chen’s Bentinck Street shop, where many Chinese Indians gather in the evening, is a hub for discussing things and politics dominates the discourse these days.However, the close-knit community, whose number has dwindled from 60,000 before the 1962 war with China, has learnt over the years to keep its political beliefs close to its chest.The 1962 war saw the entire community, living in Kolkata for over two centuries, being labelled as “anti- national”. Many were dispatched to internment camps, including the notorious Deoli camp in the deserts of Rajasthan.Unlike the US government, which had similarly interned Americans of Japanese origin during World War II, the Indian government never apologised or compensated Chinese Indians, some of whom were detained for up to 5 years after the war had ended.Outbound migration started soon afterwards. “Some went to Hong Kong, later people started migrating to countries like Australia and Canada...they are now spread all over,” said Chen.The first recorded Chinese to arrive in Calcutta was Yang Tai Chow also known as Tong Achew, who arrived in 1778 to set up a sugar plantation and factory near Budge Budge.Though the factory no longer exists, the place still bears his name Achipur. Since then, waves of Chinese settlers came and made Calcutta and India their home.“Most of them came from Guangzhou province of China, but many also arrived from other parts, including dentists from Shanghai,” said Chen.Historically, opium dens, leather works, dry-cleaners, carpentry and tailoring establishments were run by early Chinese entrepreneurs in the city.Fortunately for them, the recent Sino-Indian tensions in Ladakh and calls for boycott of Chinese goods did not impact Kolkata’s Chinese Indians. “People have accepted us as Indians,” said Chen.“One common business which many Chinese went into was the food business...restaurants run by Chinese families are still popular in the city and we have come up with what is now known as Indian Chinese cuisine,” said Dominic Lee, 61, who runs Pou Chong Food Products, manufacturers of sauces which go into Indian Chinese dishes and Kolkata’s famous kathi rolls.Hakka noodles popular with many in India, is surprisingly an innovation by Kolkata’s Chinese Indians and is possibly unknown in mainland China.Said well-known restauranteur and expert on food history Sidhartha Bose, “Like tandoori chicken, Kolkata’s Indian Chinese has picked up popularity and become a national fare.”However, despite past laurels, the community now fears that like the Jews and the Armenians of Kolkata their numbers will dwindle further as greener pastures beckon their young.“We would like to say that whoever comes to power through these elections should provide good leadership...this is a great city, if more opportunities could be created here, more people with talent would come here rather than leave,” said Chen.

Hence he was murdered and the body burnt," Krishnakant told reporters.According to police, a charred and badly mutilated torso packed in a plastic bag was found dumped in the Devaragudihal forest area on April 12.Subsequently, a case was registered and special teams were formed to nab the culprit.The teams gathered lots of inputs and finally learnt that Rakesh Katve, a housekeeper in a bar, was missing.Probe revealed that the victim's sister Shanaya Katve was in a relationship with Niyaz and has been living with him as a paying guest.Further inquiry in the case led to the arrest of Shanaya Katve, Niyaz, his three friends who have been remanded in police custody.During interrogation it was found that Niyaz's family were also involved in the crime."Prima facie, it looks like a case of love affair. We have not come across their affiliation to any organisation but our investigations are on," Krishnakant said.Shanaya has worked in a yet-to-be released film ‘Chhota Bombay’.

The fault was detected and simultaneously 14 patients admitted in the casualty section were shifted on jumbo oxygen cylinders for breathing. The supply of oxygen was switched off for repairing the leak," he said.According to Kundetkar, the oxygen supply was interrupted for merely 2-3 minutes.He said technicians repaired the pipeline within two hours."No casualty was reported in this incident. The oxygen supply was restored around 4 am," the deputy collector added.On April 21, at least 22 patients died due to the interrupted supply of oxygen at a civic hospital for COVID-19 patients in Nashik following the leakage of the gas from a storage plant.

28-04-2021||London||Vaccines cut household COVID-19 transmission by up to a half, English data shows||COVID-19 vaccines deployed in England can cut transmission of the coronavirus in households by up to a half, data from Public Health England (PHE) showed on Wednesday, in addition to the protection the shots offer against symptomatic infection.The research offers insight on one of the big unknowns over COVID-19 vaccinations - the extent to which they prevent transmission of the coronavirus - and could strengthen the case for Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to end England's lockdown in June."We already know vaccines save lives and this study is the most comprehensive real-world data showing they also cut transmission of this deadly virus," health minister Matt Hancock said.New research showed that people who became infected with the coronavirus three weeks after receiving one dose of Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine were between 38% to 49% less likely to pass it on to household contacts compared to those who were unvaccinated.The shots also stop a vaccinated person developing symptomatic infection to start with, reducing the risk by around 60% to 65% from four weeks after one dose of either vaccine."While these findings are very encouraging, even if you have been vaccinated, it is really important that you continue to act like you have the virus," said Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE.The study included over 57,000 contacts from 24,000 households in which there was a lab-confirmed case that had received a vaccination, PHE said, compared with nearly 1 million contacts of unvaccinated cases.Britain has one of the fastest COVID-19 vaccine rollouts in the world, with over 33.8 million first doses given and a quarter of adults receiving both shots.That has generated real-world data on how Pfizer and AstraZeneca work outside the setting of clinical trials, and earlier this month PHE said the rollout had prevented over 10,000 deaths of people aged 60 and older by the end of March.Previous data that showed good effectiveness of vaccines in older people helped inform other countries who reversed age limits on AstraZeneca's shot.

This is exactly why we must work collectively to support each other,” the Channel quoted him as saying.Singapore and India share a close relationship, Maliki said, thanking the Indian government for continuing to work with Singapore throughout the pandemic by “keeping supply chains open and essential goods flowing”.“While our contribution is modest, we hope that it will bring comfort and relief to those in need and encourage those on the frontline in India, who are working tirelessly, to fight on.“I have no doubt that the fighting spirit of the Indian people will prevail,” Maliki said.Singapore investment firm Temasek has also sent medical equipment while India's Tata Group donated four cryogenic oxygen cylinders sourced from Singapore. That consignment landed in West Bengal over the weekend.India is struggling with a second wave of the pandemic with more than 3 lakh daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days, and hospitals in several states are reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds.

Amazon is coordinating ventilators distribution.FedEx on Tuesday flew 1,000 oxygen concentrators to India.Air Products announced plans to allocate resources and assets from its operations around the world to support and maximise the supply and distribution of oxygen within India during this period of crisis.“From IBM to Amazon to Chase all, I would say, most of them, have stepped up. The CEOs have stepped up and made tremendous contributions to ensure that lives are saved,” he said in response to a question.“What we have agreed, is basically look at multiple areas to support India. First is bringing in oxygen concentrators. As of now, we have almost 1,000 oxygen concentrator devices landing in India between today and tomorrow.

28-04-2021||Houston||Texas Indian-American Foundation shipping 50 ventilators to India||The US India Chamber of Commerce (USICOC) Foundation and its partner organisations are shipping 50 ventilators to India, besides other medical supplies, to help the country fight the deadly second wave of COVID-19.The foundation made arrangements to ship 20 ventilators on Tuesday. It will send 30 more in the next few days. These ventilators will be released to the Indian Red Cross Society in New Delhi for distribution to hospitals and field teams in hard-hit areas, the USICOC said.It added that the ventilators are battle-tested and are in use in several countries throughout the world.The Chambers of Commerce, which normally facilitates trade between the two countries, joined forces with the Texas Indian-American population to help the humanitarian crisis back home.Neel Gonuguntla, president of the USICOC DFW, Jagdip Ahluwalia, founding secretary and executive director of Indo-American Chamber of Greater Houston (IACCGH), and Padma Sri Ashok Mago, founding chairman of the USICOC, teamed up to lead the efforts through the USICOC Foundation.They raised funds from the Indian-American community to provide critical medical equipment like oxygen cylinders, concentrators, generators and ventilators to India."We are happy to help India in every way that we can during this time of extreme need," said Mago, who helped to coordinate many of the necessary funds for the effort.Aluwalia said they were coordinating with hospitals, NGOs, medical schools and government bodies in India to make sure the equipment was reaching trained professionals, who can put it to immediate use.Consul General of India in Houston, Aseem Mahajan, has been guiding and facilitating with the logistics part, Ahluwalia said.Spearheading the project on behalf of the USICOC Foundation and the broader community, Gonuguntla said, "This collective community effort on behalf of dozens of individual donors, community organisations, businesses like DFW International Airport, PGL Logistics, American Airlines, and others, came together like a beautiful symphony of genuine compassion to rise up and meet the need of the hour which is to help save lives and get the pandemic under control in India." The USICOC Foundation is a non-profit organisation founded by members of the US India Chamber of Commerce in 2008 to support community initiatives throughout North Texas and to support projects in India that are aligned with the foundation's initiatives.

28-04-2021||Washington||Hope Biden asks Pfizer CEO to allow India develop its vaccines: Congressman Ro Khanna||With millions of lives at stake amid a rapid spread of COVID-19, Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna said he hoped President Joe Biden would call the Pfizer CEO to let India produce its vaccine at least for six months or a year.Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley in the US House of Representatives, has been an ardent supporter of the move by India and South Africa at the World Trade Organization (WTO) for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) waiver of COVID-19 vaccines."Allow India to develop that vaccine, and this is good in your own long-term interests. It's good for the United States and our interests with the role with India and the rest of the world," Khanna told the media.Major pharma companies like Pfizer and Moderna and organisations like the US Chambers of Commerce are opposing such a move.A day earlier, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai spoke with the CEOs of Pfizer and AstraZeneca regarding the TRIPS waiver, which is slated to come up before the WTO on May 5."I do know there are very senior people in the administration who are supportive of it. We are making the case to the White House. And my hope is that the President would at least call the Pfizer CEO and say, look, your long-term strategy in India, a huge market, just in your economic interest, at least waive it for six months or a year," Khanna said.Microsoft founder and eminent philanthropist Bill Gates in a media interview on Monday opposed the move.Asked about it, Khanna said, "I rarely think Bill Gates is wrong, but this is a case I hope he will engage. The point that Bill Gates made about manufacturing capacity being restricted is absolutely correct. But what I said is why not have a global fund, USD25 billion, to help with manufacturing capacity and then allow the vaccine recipes to be shared." "You're not going to have a lack of quality control. I think it is patronising to say that 100 other nations can't have a regulatory process to make sure that manufacturing is safe. They can and the World Health Organization can," he added."No one is asking Pfizer to manufacture these vaccines, no one is saying they need to do it for free. It's important to understand, they will get paid. They will be able to sell it. The reason they're not doing it would be pure greed," Khanna said.The United States government gave a USD2 billion guarantee to Pfizer to purchase vaccines."If it weren't for that, Pfizer would have never been able to do what they did. Our NIH gave the IP that allowed Moderna to develop the vaccine," he argued."What we're now saying is that they should share the vaccine recipe with over 100 countries who want to do the manufacturing. They're willing to do the manufacturing themselves, they need to have contract manufacturing. Pfizer would still get paid. Moderna would still get paid. But it is just wrong, morally wrong, strategically wrong for them not to share the vaccine recipe, which was developed with US taxpayer support," Khanna further said.He applauded Biden for committing to help India in its fight against the virus."But we also ultimately need to get vaccines to India. The president has said that he will release the AstraZeneca vaccine, which Americans are not going to use after it's deemed safe. But more important is Pfizer and Moderna need to license the vaccine recipe to allow India and other countries to manufacture it," he added.

28-04-2021||Washington||Covaxin found to neutralise '617 variant' of Covid, says US expert||Covaxin, India's home-grown Covid vaccine, has been found to neutralise the 617 variant of the deadly virus, White House chief medical adviser and America's top pandemic expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said.Fauci was speaking to reporters during a conference call on Tuesday."This is something where we're still gaining data on a daily basis. But the most recent data was of people who received the vaccine used in India, the Covaxin. It was found to neutralise the 617 variant," he said."So, despite the real difficulty that we're seeing in India, the vaccination could be a very, very important antidote against this," Fauci added.The New York Times on Tuesday said Covaxin works by teaching the immune system to make antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The antibodies attach to viral proteins, such as the so-called spike proteins that stud its surface.Developed by Bharat Biotech in partnership with National Institute of Virology and the Indian Council of Medical Research, Covaxin was approved for emergency use on January 3. Trial results later showed the vaccine has an efficacy of 78 per cent.Responding to a question, Dr Andy Slavitt, White House Covid Response Senior Advisor, said a strike team from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention is headed over to India to help coordinate this response."We are making sure that we are locating some of the raw materials necessary to create more vaccines in India which, I think, is going to be an important help there," he said."We stand with India during this very trying and tragic surge. We are working to deploy resources and supplies, including therapeutics, rapid testing kits, ventilators, PPEs, and raw materials that are needed to manufacture vaccines in India, and the CDC, which has a long history of working with and in India on public health measures, will be deploying a strike team to the country to support the public health efforts there," Slavitt said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covaxin-found-to-neutralise-617-variant-of-covid-says-us-expert-245374

We must take every necessary step to ensure the Indian people receive the aid and assistance they need in order to emerge from this crisis," Congressman Brad Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Tuesday."My heart goes out to the people of India and neighbouring nations as they fight an uphill battle with Covid. I'm glad that the White House is providing these life-saving vaccines, but we will need a strong, coordinated global response in the days ahead," Congresswoman Carolyn Boudreaux said.Congressman Michael Waltz Press said India is an essential ally in America's global competition with China. "Its strength is important to stability in Asia and the United States. We must do what we can to help them curb their new wave of Covid cases," he added.Congressman Bill Foster said while America continues to make progress in battling this pandemic, the critical situation in India can't be ignored.Several other American lawmakers have also come out in support of India as its people battle one of the gravest challenges to its public health system."I am glad to see President Biden taking action to aid the people of India as they experience a devastating surge of Covid. This will save lives and bring relief to millions of Indian-Americans who are worried about the health and safety of their loved ones in India," Congressman Steven Horsford said.The United States and India have both suffered tremendously from Covid, and the countries will crush this virus together, he added.Congressman Joe Morell said the US has a moral obligation to help its global partners fight back against the COVID-19 pandemic."I stand alongside President Biden, the Congressional India Caucus, and our local Indian American community to support increased aid to India during their time of need,” he said.

28-04-2021||Prayagraj||Allahabad High Court issues notice to state election commission on 135 teachers' death on poll duty||The Allahabad High Court has issued notices to Uttar Pradesh State Election Commission (UPSEC), seeking an explanation on why it failed to check non-compliance of Covid guidelines during multiple phases of panchayat elections.Taking cognisance of reported deaths of 135 teachers, shiksha mitras and investigators assigned panchayat election duty, the Allahabad High Court on Tuesday issued the notices.The court asked why action should not be taken against the state poll panel and its officials and why those responsible for Covid violations should not be prosecuted.Hearing a PIL on Covid care, a division bench comprising Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar directed the State Election Commission to 'take immediately measures in the remaining phases of panchayat elections to ensure that the Covid guidelines are complied with, else action would be taken against officials involved in the election process'.While passing the directives, the court observed, "It is reported that during recent phases of panchayat elections, Covid guidelines were violated. It appears that neither police nor the State Election Commission did anything to save people on election duty from getting infected by the virus."On deaths due to the oxygen shortage, the court observed, "If after seven decades of attaining freedom, with so many heavy industries in place, we are unable to provide oxygen to our citizens, it is a matter of shame."While observing that the public health system is unable to cater to needs of the people, the court directed government hospitals in Lucknow, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Agra, Kanpur, Gorakhpur and Jhansi to display health bulletins twice a day, informing people on oxygen saturation levels of patients to avoid attendants visiting the hospitals."The situation in major cities of Uttar Pradesh is chaotic. As history of past pandemics tells us, those who are resourceful will survive and the others may die for want of proper health care," the court observed.The court directed the government to take urgent remedial measures and observed, "We make it clear that we will not tolerate paperwork or public announcements to show the account of steps taken and its sufficiency. "It's an open secret that the government had gone complacent due to weakening of the virus by 2020-end and got involved in other activities, including panchayat elections. Had it been vigilant, it would have prepared itself to face the onslaught of the second wave. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/allahabad-high-court-issues-notice-to-state-election-commission-on-135-teachers-death-on-poll-duty-245372
28-04-2021||Guwahati/Shillong/Itanagar||Pictures show damage due to earthquake in Assam||Seven back- to-back earthquakes jolted Assam and some other northeastern states on Wednesday morning, causing extensive damage to buildings and forcing people to scamper out of their homes.The first of the shocks of 6.4 magnitude with its epicentre at 43 km west of Tezpur, the district headquarters of Sonitpur district in Assam, was felt at 7.51 am, Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) Deputy Director Sanjay O'neil Shaw said.The effect was felt in almost the entire northeastern region and even parts of West Bengal.It was followed in quick succession by lesser-intensity tremors of 4.7, 4, 3.6 and 3.6 magnitudes at 8.03 am, 8.13 am, 8.25 am and 8.44 am, respectively.Another earthquake of 3.2 magnitude hit the state's Nagaon district at 10.05 am. A while later, another jolt of 3.4 magnitude hit Tezpur at 10.39 am.Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and enquired about the damage."Spoke to Assam CM Shri @sarbanandsonwal Ji regarding the earthquake in parts of the state. Assured all possible help from the Centre. I pray for the well-being of the people of Assam," he tweeted.Union Home Minister Amit Shah also spoke to Sonowal and assured him that the Centre stood firmly with the people of Assam.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, "To my sisters and brothers in Assam who are now dealing with the double blow of an earthquake and the rampaging second wave of Covid, I send you my love and prayers."Sonowal urged everyone to stay alert saying he is taking updates from all the districts.Tremors were felt in the entire region, including neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and northern parts of West Bengal.People ran out of their homes and other places in panic, obliterating social-distancing and other Covid guidelines amid a raging pandemic. No casualty was reported, but many people suffered minor injuries while running out in panic as the first quake struck.There were reports of widespread damage to buildings and other structures from across Assam, mostly in the central and western towns of Tezpur, Nagaon, Guwahati, Mangaldoi, Dhekiajuli and Morigaon.In Guwahati, the Chief Minister's block at the 'Janata Bhawan' complex, the state secretariat, witnessed some damage, sources said.The luxury Taj Vivanta in Guwahati also witnessed massive damage with several glass panes, ceilings and walls falling apart, but there was no injury to any employee or guest, hotel spokesperson Indranee Phukan told PTI.Health-care facilities such as Dispur Hospital, Apollo Clinic, Down Town Hospital and Excelcare Hospital also saw damage, hampering services amid the surge in Covid cases.A multi-storey building in Nagaon tilted on the adjacent structure, triggering panic.Dozens of homes, apartment buildings and shopping malls across the state also developed cracks. Many vehicles were damaged after concrete blocks fell on them due to the jolts.Dhekiajuli MLA Ashok Singhal tweeted pictures of land developing cracks and water seeping out of them, though these could not be immediately verified.In Shillong, the tremor woke up people and many ran outside their homes in panic.Although there was no immediate report of any damage caused in Meghalaya, the tremor was one of the strongest in the past few years, an official said. The last one of such intensity was in March-April 2016, he said.Strong tremors were also felt across Arunachal Pradesh. A few buildings developed cracks in state capital Itanagar, and the East Kemeng district, officials said.In West Bengal, strong tremors were felt in Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Coochbehar and parts of Darjeeling district but no major damage was reported, local authorities said.

28-04-2021||New Delhi||US  flays India directive on critical tweets||While the US Government is finalising a mega assistance package for India, the White House has disapproved of the Indian Government’s directive to Twitter and other social media platforms to take down posts critical of its handling of the current medical crisis.“That certainly wouldn’t be aligned with our view of freedom of speech around the world,” said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki. But for that disagreement, the US Government is “working nonstop” to urgently deliver supplies most needed within India, said US State Department spokesperson Ned Price.Price, however, found himself in a spot when asked why did it take the US so long to offer assistance. Asked whether it was because China had offered help or because of the media stories about India, Price said the US had offered $19 million in assistance (Rs 140 crore) from the earliest days of this pandemic.“So it is certainly not the case that this is the start of our engagement, but we recognise that as the outbreak has taken incredibly concerning turns in India, that there was more we could do,” he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-flays-india-directive-on-critical-tweets-245157

At private hospitals, these vaccines cost Rs 250 per dose.“Different manufacturers are quoting different prices. There are powers under the Patents Act. This is a pandemic and a national crisis,” a three-judge Bench Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice LN Rao and Justice S Ravindra Bhat told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.The top court sought to know how the Centre planned to meet the increased demand for Covid-19 vaccines once vaccination began for all above 18 from May 1, even as it clarified that it didn’t intend to enter the domain of the Executive.It also asked the Centre to inform it about the steps taken to form a panel of specialists that will be replicated at the state level.In view of senior advocate Harish Salve's decision to recuse himself as an Amicus Curiae, the Bench appointed senior advocates Jaideep Gupta and Meenakshi Arora to replace him.The top court sought to know the projected demand of oxygen in future, supply of drugs, steps taken to augment supplies to affected states and the monitoring mechanism.It also asked the Centre to apprise it about the modalities for seamless communication between district collectors with the Ministry of Health.In an affidavit filed in the court, the Centre said the PM was directly involved in the process of ensuring oxygen supply.Directing the states to file their replies by Thursday 6 pm, the court posted the matter for further hearing on Friday.It clarified that high courts can continue to hear the cases relating to Covid-19 as they were in a better position to monitor the situation in their respective jurisdiction.2,00,000 deathsThe total Covid cases stood at 1,76,36,307 on Tuesday morning and toll at 1,97,894 with addition of 2,771 deaths over the past 24 hours.

28-04-2021||Aditi Tandon||Makeshift spaces for last rites as Covid toll spirals||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 27The Covid 19 pandemic continued to surge on Tuesday with deaths nearing 2-lakh nationally and crematoriums across the capital returning bodies, unable to cope with the rush of last rites.With makeshift crematoriums coming up at some locations, scientists questioned the integrity of Covid data urging honesty in reporting lest future pandemic response is compromised.Leading virologist Shahid Jameel said the country was not counting Covid deaths properly. “Are we counting Covid deaths properly? The answer is no. Why do we say this? Because the normal death rate in India is roughly 7.3 per 1,000 people and that translates to roughly 28,000 deaths per day. If what we are seeing in this pandemic and the reported numbers are anywhere between 2,300 to 2,800 deaths per day -- that is barely 10 per cent of the normal death rate in India. If that was the case, you would not have burial and cremation grounds overwhelmed,” said Jameel at a discussion on the Indian Covid response organised by Ashoka University on Tuesday.The top virologist, actively involved in the genome sequencing of Sars-Cov2 samples, however, said underreporting of Covid deaths in India was not a case of massive devious design to fudge data but a systems issue.“The reason for underreporting is simple. A cousin passed away last week due to Covid. He was tested on April 13 and his test results had still not come out. His death was obviously not counted as Covid death. That is where part of the problem lies. This is also the case with infections,” Jameel said, flagging potential loss of home-based Covid death data, especially after hospitals across the capital have halted admission of new patients due to persisting oxygen crunch.Commenting on where India floundered having benefited from an early stringent lockdown last year, the experts pointed to poor pandemic messaging.“There was poor communication and a lot of mixed messaging, which made people complacent. We repeatedly heard that the infection rate per million population was very low in India, the death rate per million population was very low and the test rate was very high. This led people to believe that somehow Indians are special, that having taken the BCG vaccine, having been on hydroxychloroquine, they were better protected. This was wrong. You need to have communicated transparently and you can communicate transparently only if you know you are speaking the truth. Pandemics are controlled through people’s trust not through police action,” Jameel said hoping for better communication and reporting going forward.Health economist Ramanan Laxminarayanan, who found himself at the centre of a social media storm last year after he made massive Covid disease projections for India, said that countries honest with data reporting do better disease control.He cited South Africa ending up at a loss after hiding HIV data.“India showed leadership in the early phase of Covid by clamping a gutsy lockdown and buying time to prepare the health systems. But later self deception took over with no one paying attention to science and going only with this India has destroyed Covid message. It is impossible to spin your way out of the pandemic. If your message lacks seriousness, hospitals will not stock up essentials. No one will do anything. That is what happened here,” Narayanan said as India’s daily case fell marginally to 3, 23,144 today after setting world records for six days in a row.Total Covid 19 cases as of this morning stood at 1, 76, 36,307 and toll at 1, 97, 894 with 2,771 new deaths today. The toll had crossed the two lakh mark tonight.10-20 hour waiting for last rights Meanwhile, the relatives of Covid deceased across the capital spoke of how they have had to wait anywhere from ten to 20 hours to get the chance to perform the last rites of their loved ones.

28-04-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||Video from IIT-Kharagpur shows professor abusing SC/ST preparatory students||Multiple videos of an Indian Institute of Technology-Kharagpur professor abusing her Dalit, Adivasi, and disabled students have shocked the internet, with many demanding her immediate termination.Students of IIT-Bombay’s anticaste Ambedkar Periyar Phule Study Circle posted a video online the professor, whom the group identified as Associate Professor Seema Singh of the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, as referring to the group using some expletives as she takes the  IIT’s Preparatory Course for SC/ST (scheduled caste /scheduled tribes) and PD (physically disabled) candidates.She's heard repeatedly calling the students in her class names and dares them to report her to the Ministry of Women and Child Care and Ministry of SC/ST/Minorities. A second video, also doing the rounds online, shows her demanding that they say “Bharat Mata ki Jai”. A third video shows her yelling at a student who wants to be excused from the online class on account of her grandfather's death.The Instagram post of the APPSC demands her immediate dismissal and that she should be booked under the SC/ST Atrocities Prevention Act.“She is in complete cognizance of her actions and proclaims immunity from any disciplinary actions and consequences,” the post says. “She uses the hyper nationalism to cloud her casteist mentality and forces the students to stand up for the national anthem which the Supreme Court of India had declared is not mandatory. However, even when students complied to her demand, she still uses it to abuse and throw casteist slurs at them again and again,” the post says.A post shared by appsc (@appsc.iitb)  “Another video shows how she discarded a request from a student who lost her grandfather to COVID-19 to excuse her from attending classes for few days, asking how does it affect the student. This shows complete disregard to the student’s emotion and claims to be the apex authority of the course,” the post reads.NDTV quoted some sources as having said that the institute, IIT-Kharagpur, had taken cognizance of the incident. Prof Seema Singh of IIT Kharagpur calls Dalit students as idiots and bloody bastards! This woman must be immediately fired & booked under SC/ST act.

28-04-2021||New Delhi||Covishield, Covaxin effective against ‘Indian strain’ of coronavirus, study suggests||Covishield and Covaxin—the two coronavirus vaccines currently in use in India—have efficacy against the ‘Indian strain’ and show “milder” illness in case of infection post vaccination, a senior scientist said on Tuesday citing preliminary results of a study.Anurag Agrawal, the Director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), said the study on effectiveness of the available vaccines on the B.1.617 variant of SARS-CoV2 suggests that post vaccination, the infections are milder.The B.1.617 variant is also being called a ‘double mutant’ or the ‘Indian strain’.“Initial positive neutralisation studies of B.1.617, with both post-Covaxin or Covishield sera, are correlatable with milder disease during post-vaccination breakthrough infections. This is a positive while we get quantitative data for better understanding of infection protection,” Agrawal tweeted.IGIB is an institute under the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).Another study by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad under the CSIR suggests that early results using in-vitro neutralisation assay show that both convalescent (prior infection) sera and Covishield-vaccinated sera offer protection against the B.1.617 variant.“Very preliminary but encouraging result: #Covishield protects against #B1617. Early results using in vitro neutralization assay show that both convalescent (prior infection) sera and Covishield vaccinated sera offer protection against the B.1.617 variant, aka #DoubleMutant,” CCMB Director Rakesh Mishra tweeted last week.The B.1.617 variant has three new spike protein mutations. Two mutations—E484Q and L452R—are in the area important for antibody-based neutralisation.The third mutation—P681R—allows the virus to enter cells a little better.  These are defining characteristics of the variant.The B.1.617 variant of SARS-CoV2 has been found prevalent largely in Maharashtra and Delhi that have been severely hit by a devastating second wave of the pandemic. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covishield-covaxin-effective-against-indian-strain-of-coronavirus-study-suggests-244990

Immediate medical attention appropriate to her condition was given by a team,” the hospital’s spokesperson said in a statement.“Given the paucity of beds, the family was advised to shift the patient to another facility with available beds. Unfortunately, the patient died around 8 am, following which her family members resorted to vandalism, destruction of hospital property and assault on our doctors and staff,” it said.While the hospital deeply condoles the death of the patient, it is deeply shocked at the behaviour of the patient’s family against doctors and healthcare workers who are providing untiring services amidst the pandemic, the spokesperson said in the statement.Pictures circulating on social media showed blood on the floor, broken doors and furniture strewn around inside the hospital.A purported video clip of the incident showed the hospital staff and some people engaged in a pitch battle, hitting each other with sticks, near the hospital’s entry gate.

28-04-2021||Geneva||Rush to hospitals, big gatherings worsen India COVID crisis: WHO||People in India are rushing unnecessarily to hospital, exacerbating a crisis over surging COVID-19 infections caused by mass gatherings, more contagious variants and low vaccination rates, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.India’s death toll is now pushing towards 200,000, and hospitals that do not have enough oxygen supplies and beds are turning away coronavirus patients.The WHO is providing critical equipment and supplies to India, including 4,000 oxygen concentrators, which only require an energy source, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said.Less than 15% of people infected with COVID-19 actually need hospital care and even fewer will need oxygen, he said.“Currently, part of the problem is that many people rush to the hospital (also because they do not have access to information/advice), even though home-based care monitoring at home can be managed very safely,” Jasarevic said.Community-level centres should screen and triage patients and provide advice on safe home care, while information is also made available via hotlines or dashboards, he said.“As is true in any country, WHO has said the combination of relaxing of personal protective measures, mass gatherings and more contagious variants while vaccine coverage is still low can create a perfect storm,” he said.

28-04-2021||New Delhi||At time of national crisis, top court cannot be a mute spectator: SC||Maintaining that it can't be a mute spectator during a national crisis, the Supreme Court on Tuesday sought to know how the Centre planned to meet the increased demand for COVID19 vaccines once vaccination begins for all above 18 from May 1."As on date vaccination is for 45 years and above and from May 1 vaccination is to be opened to all ages who are above 18. The union shall clarify the projected requirements of vaccines due to enhancement of coverage," a three-judge Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.Asking the Centre to clarify the basis and rationale for pricing of COVID19 vaccines, it said the government could invoke the Parents Act to regulate the pricing of vaccines."Modality should be put in place to ensure that shortage and deficit would be looked into." It added."Comprehensive panel of doctors should be made available for a citizen to know steps to take during the pandemic. The Centre to apprise us about the steps taken to form an identified panel of specialists which will be replicated at all state levels," it said.In view of senior advocate Harish Salve's decision to recuse himself as an Amicus Curiae, the Bench appointed senior advocates Jaideep Gupta and Meenakshi Arora to replace him.The court wanted to know about projected demand for oxygen in future, steps taken to augment supplies to affected states and monitoring mechanism.It also asked the Centre to apprise it of the steps taken to ensure the supply of drugs such as Remdisivir and the modality put in place for seamless communication between district collectors with the Ministry of Health along with daily monitoring.Directing the states to file their replies by Thursday 6 pm, it posted the matter for further hearing on Friday. The Centre has already filed its affidavit.The top court had taken suo motu cognisance of the COVID-19 management last week and asked the Centre to present a national plan to deal with the health crisis concerning the supply of oxygen and essential drugs, method of vaccination and lockdown.On Tuesday it clarified that it didn't intend to enter the domain of the Executive. The top court said its platform should not be used to recriminate.It also said the high courts can continue to hear the cases relating to COVID19 as they were in a better position to monitor the situation in their respective jurisdiction."There is need for top court's intervention on certain national issues as there might be matters related to coordination between states," the bench said, adding it was playing a complementary role and if high courts have any difficulty in dealing with issues due to territorial limitations, it would step in to help.Mehta said the Centre would never oppose any constitutional court whether a high court or the Supreme Court."We are not questioning anyone's jurisdiction. You have to examine the steps taken by us. But there are certain issues of perception. This (COVID19) is from early 2020 and nobody anticipated the second wave," Mehta said.While informing the court that the Centre has filed its affidavit, Mehta told the Bench that "It's a fight for the nation...that is the spirit of the reply. if we succeed, the nation succeeds. It's not a time for political bickering.""We will take this case day to day basis and not keep pending for long. but let us go through the affidavit by the Centre," the Bench said.The top court also sought to know about the utilisation of central paramilitary forces' paramedics and army facilities, army doctors and railways which can be made available for quarantine, vaccination or beds.On behalf of the West Bengal Government, senior advocate Vikas Singh said for 73 years vaccine price for the centre and states had been the same and the first time it's different for the Centre and states.Senior advocate Siddharth Dave demanded a uniform policy for patients' admission in hospitals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-time-of-national-crisis-top-court-cannot-be-a-mute-spectator-sc-244925

At present, Tamil Nadu's oxygen demands are met. In case of any future need, they can approach us for changes."Noting that the order was passed only in view of the national need for oxygen, the top court made it clear that it would not create any equities in favour of Vedanta.Vedanta had sought the court's permission for producing medical oxygen to be supplied free of cost to hospitals needing it for treatment of Covid patients. Senior advocate Harish Salve, representing Vedanta, said it would be able to produce 200 MT of liquid oxygen within 10 days.Vedanta would not be allowed to enter and operate the copper smelting plant under the garb of this order, it said.It set up a panel to oversee the reopening of Vedanta's oxygen plant.Earlier, in an affidavit filed in the top court, the Tamil Nadu government had agreed to reopen Vedanta's plant temporarily for production of medical oxygen with sufficient safeguards.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-allows-vedanta-to-operate-its-tamil-nadu-plant-to-produce-medical-oxygen-244920

If it is determined to be illegal in a particular jurisdiction, but not in violation of the Twitter Rules, we may withhold access to the content in India only," the spokesperson was quoted as saying by the daily.
