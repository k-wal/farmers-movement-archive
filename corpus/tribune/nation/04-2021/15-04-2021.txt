There is no identification of the applicant either through independent public witness or any police witness of he being present at the scene of crime on the date of incident,” Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav noted in the order.Khalid, however, will remain in jail as he is accused in some other cases, including one related to the criminal conspiracy lodged under stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.The former JNU student leader was granted bail in the case in which the FIR was registered on the statement of Constable Sangram Singh, where he stated that on February 24, 2020 at about 2 PM, a large crowd gathered on the road in a locality in the northeast Delhi and started pelting stones in which he and other police officials got injured as they were thrashed by the mob.They set the vehicles in a parking area nearby on fire, including motorcycle of the complainant, he had said.Granting bail in the case, the court noted that even the CDR location of the mobile phone of applicant was not found at the scene of crime on the date of incident. The applicant has merely been roped in the matter on basis of his own disclosure statement, fourth disclosure statement of co-accused Tahir Hussain and disclosure statement of co-accused Khalid Saifi, it said, adding that no recovery of any sort has been effected from the applicant pursuant to his disclosure statement. The court rejected prosecution’s argument that the applicant had been in regular contact/touch with co-accused Tahir Hussain and Khalid Saifi over mobile phone and said that “prima facie that does not in any way go on to establish the criminal conspiracy alleged against the applicant in the matter.”   The court further noted that Khalid was made accused on the basis of his as well as co-accused Tahir Hussain’s disclosure statements.“Hussain is an accused in ten other cases of this cluster of Chand Bagh puliya, i.e, at or around his house, but in no other case the applicant has been made co-accused, even on the strength of material sought to be read against him in this matter. “I do not find any rationale in the act of police in involving the applicant in this solitary case for the offence of conspiracy. If principal accused Tahir Hussain was moved or actuated by the applicant in meeting dated January 8, 2020 then the applicant should have been made co-accused in ten other cases also which is not the case,” the judge noted.The judge further observed that neither any independent witness nor any police witness has identified the applicant to be present at the scene of crime.   “Prima facie, the applicant appears to have been roped in the matter merely on the basis of his own disclosure statement and disclosure statement of co-accused Tahir Hussain”, the judge noted.While observing that the investigation in the matter was complete and chargesheet had already been filed, the court said “the trial in the matter is likely to take long time. The applicant has been in judicial custody in the matter since January 1, 2020.”       “The applicant cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity merely on account of the fact that other persons who were part of the riotous mob have to be identified and arrested in the matter,” the court said.The court said the accused deserved bail on the parity with co-accused Khalid Saifi. The bail was granted on furnishing a Personal Bond in the sum of Rs 20,000 with one surety in the like amount, and the court directed that he “shall maintain peace and harmony in the locality”.It further said the accused shall not tamper with the evidence or influence any witness in any manner and appear before the court on each and every date of hearing to attend the proceedings in accordance.The court also directed that Khalid shall furnish his mobile number to SHO, PS Khajuri Khas upon his release from the jail and will ensure the same to be in working condition and further he shall also get installed “Aarogya Setu App” in his mobile phone. While seeking bail, the accused said that he deserved parity with co-accused in the case Khalid Saifi, who was granted bail on November 4, 2020, as  role assigned to him was on the same page/identical footing.  Some other co accused, including Riyasat Ali, Liyakat Ali and Shah Alam were granted bail earlier this month by the Delhi high court.The counsel for the accused also claimed that he was falsely implicated in the matter by the investigating agency on account of “political vendetta to muzzle the dissent”.  “The applicant was not physically present at the spot/scene of crime on the date of alleged incident and that is the reason he is neither visible in any CCTV footage/ viral video nor any of the witnesses have specifically named him to be part/member of the riotous mob,” the bail application said.

She is answerable to all the voters of our district,” Mia stated.At least four persons died outside a polling booth in Sitalkuchi assembly constituency on April 10 when CISF personnel opened fire in “self-defence” allegedly after coming under attack from locals.The Election Commission had suspended the voting exercise at the booth following the incident.In its statement, the EC said, “The joint report of the two special observers has been received ... wherein they inter alia stated that recourse to open fire by the CISF personnel became absolutely necessary in order to save the lives of the voters lined up at the polling booth, those of other polling personnel and their own lives as the mob had attempted snatching their weapons.”The poll panel had also banned political leaders from entering the district for three days.Banerjee met the family members of those killed in the firing on Wednesday.

I am perfectly ok. Yes, things are getting scary”.       Justice Chandrachud adjourned hearing in other matters, except in the case in which proceedings were undergoing, saying since Justice Shah is busy in managing things at his home, the court will only take one item and then rise for the day.              Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati said the court should take its own time to deal with the situation when the information about the infection was shared by the judge.Over 40 staffers of the apex court had tested positive for novel coronavirus infection a few days ago.Amid sudden rise in COVID-19 cases, the apex court and its registry have come out with notifications and office orders to curb the rise in such infections.One of the notifications suspended physical mentioning of cases for urgent hearing by advocates from April 12 till further orders.On April 13, the top court’s Registry came out with an office order which allowed officials to work from home if they were not required to attend office on a given day and authorised registrars to regulate attendance.It also said that if any employee or any member of his family is tested positive to the viral infection or has symptoms such as cough, cold and fever for more than three days, then he/she will have to intimate the concerned department for the purpose of contact tracing.The non-observance of the instructions may entail administrative action under the Conduct Rules, the apex court registry said in its order. Simultaneously, the top court also came out with additional precautionary measures for the entrants to its premises to contain the rapid spread of infection.Under the new set of guidelines, all the entrants to the Supreme Court premises, including the Registry staff, staff of the coordinate agencies, advocates and their staff, if showing any symptoms similar to those notified for COVID-19 infection shall be subjected to Rapid/RT-PCR test.The guidelines issued by the general administration section said all controlling officers shall ensure that the staff in their control wears masks, maintains physical distancing and frequently sanitizes/washes hands and follows the prescribed COVID appropriate behaviour.It said that there shall not be any crowding or loitering in the campus and movement in common areas should be only for specific purposes and be completed within the minimum time.The guidelines said the lift should not be used by more than three persons at a time and shall be used only for going upwards and for coming downstairs, stairs should be used. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-staffers-at-residence-of-sc-judge-justice-mr-shah-test-positive-to-covid-19-239477

Ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) candidate Nomula Bhagat and BJP candidate P Ravi Kumar Naik, too, had been booked for not abiding by the COVID-19 norms.  The Nagarjuna Sagar Assembly constituency bypoll is scheduled on April 17 as it was necessitated due to the death of sitting TRS MLA Nomula Narasimhaiah.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-minister-kishan-reddy-others-booked-for-violating-pandemic-norms%C2%A0in-telangana-239471
15-04-2021||New Delhi||Virus variants inciting India's second surge, epidemiologists say||The second surge of COVID-19 cases in India has swamped hospitals much faster than the first because mutations in the virus mean each patient is infecting many more people than before, epidemiologists and doctors say.India's daily infections skyrocketed more than 20-fold to more than 200,000 on Thursday since a multi-month-low in early February, though the government has played down the role of mutants in the latest rise, the worst anywhere this month.The world's hardest-hit country after the United States has reported about 950 cases of people contracting the variants first detected in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil."The point is that these variants of concern are still not on top of the discourse," said epidemiologist Rajib Dasgupta of New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University."Even if it is a new variant, you need to do the same things" to control it and treat patients "but it requires a different urgency to recognise that", he said.Doctors at New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences have found that one patient is now infecting up to nine in 10 contacts, compared with up to four last year.Scientists in Britain say the B.1.1.7 variant https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/UK-VARIANT/ygdpzgblxvw, widely known as the British mutant, is 70% more transmissible than previous variants, and much deadlier.The northern Indian state of Punjab, which has reported one of the highest recent fatality rates in the country, said late last month 81% of 401 COVID-19 samples it sent for genome sequencing were found to be the British variant."This virus is more infectious and virulent," said Dhiren Gupta, a senior consultant at New Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital."More children are reporting high-grade fever compared to last year. We have 35-year olds with pneumonia in intensive care, which was not happening last year." India has recorded 14.1 million infections and 173,123 deaths in total.MASS GATHERINGSThe government has mainly attributed the big rise in cases to a reluctance to wear marks and crowding.Still, it has refused to call off a mass gathering of Hindu devotees for a festival and its ministers are addressing tens of thousands of largely mask-less people in election rallies.A scientist at the National Institute of Epidemiology said more evidence was needed to directly link the rise in cases to the variants, but that anecdotally that seemed to be the case."There are in-vitro experiments which can also tell us about the infectivity, the severity, how lethal it is, etc, but those are not completed yet, they are ongoing," said Tarun Bhatnagar."We haven’t had a virus that has spread so rapidly, and we haven’t had the time to study it. Everything is on the go. We are dealing with it, being affected by it and studying it. The pace of every thing is too fast."But with crowding still common in many regions of India, "we are about to find out just how dangerous this strain is", said Om Srivastava, head of infectious diseases at Mumbai's Jaslok Hospital who also advises India's worst-hit Maharashtra state. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/virus-variants-inciting-indias-second-surge-epidemiologists-say-239467
15-04-2021||New Delhi||Delhi: Shortage of hospital beds, plasma donors triggers flurry of SOS messages on Twitter||A man desperate to find a hospital bed for his "extremely weak" 60-year-old mother, another looking for anti-viral drug Remdevisir and a woman looking for a plasma donor for a friend's uncle fighting for his life—the grim COVID-19 situation in Delhi triggered a flurry of SOS posts on Twitter on Thursday.Some claimed that while the Delhi Corona app showed that beds are available in certain hospitals in the city, the situation on the ground is different. Hospitals are not admitting patients as they have run out of beds, they said.Many even tagged Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia in their tweets to draw attention to their plight.The Delhi Corona app allows people to check the availability of beds in government and private hospitals in the national capital.The number of coronavirus cases has exploded in Delhi over the last few days, with the city recording a massive jump of 17,282 fresh infections on Wednesday -- the fifth record daily rise in as many days."URGENT: NEED A HOSPITAL BED IN DELHI FOR MOTHER (AGED 60), SHE IS EXTREMELY WEAK AND WE'RE TRYING FOR A BED BUT NO LUCK. PLEASE HELP," said a tweet posted by a Twitter user with the handle @Massey Erick."Any hospitals in #Delhi where beds are available? Asking for a friend. His wife has been calling up hospitals and even though the apps/website show available beds, the hospitals are saying no vacancy," tweeted @vibhurishi.Nishtha Sachdeva wrote, "URGENT: looking for a hospital bed for a senior citizen patient in #Delhi right now. The patient is my relative, and is very critical. #COVID19 @ArvindKejriwal @msisodia Anyone with leads Pls get in touch with me ASAP." These frantic messages for help came a day after the Delhi government released a list of banquet halls, schools and sports complexes attached to different hospitals to increase the number of beds for COVID-19 patients.According to the Delhi government's health bulletin issued on Wednesday, almost 9,300 out of 13,680 hospital beds, including those in Covid Care Centres and Covid Health Centre, are occupied.Some Delhiites complained that the Delhi Corona app did not offer an accurate picture of the ground situation."On Delhi corona app, it shows there are 65 beds with ventilator are available, on calling the helpline, they are saying beds are full. A patient admitted in Ansari hospital urgently need a bed with ventilator. O2 at 65 already. Kindly help @CMODelhi @ArvindKejriwal @SatyendarJain," tweeted one Ankit Kumar.Some residents also sought help to find plasma donors and Remdevisir injections."VERY URGENT PLASMA NEEDED IN DELHI. PATIENT IS ON OXYGEN SUPPORT. IF YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO RECOVERED FROM COVID, PLEASE ASK THEM. AMPLIFY THIS TWEET," tweeted @_Vanderwall."Need a plasma donor for a friend's uncle in Delhi who is admitted in Max Super Speciality Hospital, Patparganj. The donor can be of any blood group but has to be with 4 months after recovering and should have completed 14 days of quarantine after testing negative," wrote another Twitter user, Jahnvi."Urgently need #Remdesivir injection in Delhi, can someone please help? @ShaleenMitra bhai @Zebaism @sakshijoshii @KapilChopra72 @drriteshmalik @BDUTT. Six quantity," tweeted Mazhar Khan.Kejriwal had on Tuesday appealed to people who have recovered from coronavirus to come forward to donate plasma to save the lives of other patients.Plasma therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing them into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.Some criticised the Delhi government for its handling of the COVID-19 situation and demanded that a lockdown be imposed before things further worsen."Delhi: All non-ventilator ICU beds taken in 24 private and 1 govt hospitals. Sir need for lockdown else situation totally out of control the more we delay the longer curbs," tweeted Sharad."The situation with #COVID19India is so bad, it seems @ArvindKejriwal has left people of Delhi to die either on the road or at their home. No hospital is admitting patients. All beds full. No ICU beds but only place where beds are available is Delhi Government portal. @LtGovDelhi," posted Nishant Verma."Lockdown 2 is need of the hour. Delhi govt is blind can't see the number of cases rising and the death toll Delhi is facing. 14 days lockdown won't be more costly than a hospital bed, taking medicines and risking life with Covid 19. @AamAadmiParty #COVID19," tweeted Anurag Gautam.The total number of COVID-19 cases in Delhi stood at 7,67,438 on Wednesday. With 104 more fatalities, the death toll climbed to 11,540, the government bulletin said.The number of people under home isolation increased to 24,155 from 21,954 on Tuesday, while that of containment zones went up to 7,598 from 6,852 the day before, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-shortage-of-hospital-beds-plasma-donors-triggers-flurry-of-sos-messages-on-twitter-239466
15-04-2021||New Delhi||India at 49th spot on internet inclusion globally: Facebook||Despite the cheapest data plans and nearly 700 million internet users, India is at a dismal 49th spot globally when it comes to internet inclusion  and gender equality in accessing the World Wide Web, a Facebook-Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) study has revealed.India is tied with Thailand in 49th place this year on the scores of internet availability (77th position globally), affordability (20th spot), relevance (49th position) and readiness (29th) categories."India's glaring underperformance in the availability pillar is, in large part, the reason for its placement, and this weak performance is owed to low internet usage  and quality and widening gender gap in mobile phone and internet access in the country," the Facebook said in the 'Inclusive Internet Index' report.India is set to reach one billion internet users by 2025. There were over 687.6 million internet users in India in 2020.The Facebook 'Inclusive Internet Index' looked at 120 countries, representing 98 per cent of global GDP and 96 per cent of global population.Nearly 70 per cent of people around the world believed that their increased internet usage in all aspects of life signified a "new normal" that will continue indefinitely  in the future."Only 3 per cent said that no aspect of their lives had seen a dramatic shift online. Unable to meet in person, those under the most stringent lockdowns relied on the  internet for nearly every conceivable activity, including forging human connections," the study showed.The majority of countries (77 out of 120) saw improvements in internet inclusion overall, in part because of increased availability."However, the gap in availability is closing at an unacceptably slow rate, and other challenges are moving to the forefront, such as how many people are actually using  the internet when it is available," the Facebook-EIU study said.People in low-income and lower-middle-income countries relied on online education during the pandemic more than those in wealthier countries and predicted that they  will continue to use online channels for education even after the pandemic has subsided."Yet schoolchildren in low- and lower-middle-income countries lost nearly 16 weeks of schooling by October 2020 due to the pandemic and significantly lower internet  access and adoption, compared with only six weeks of loss in high-income countries," the report lamented. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-at-49th-spot-on-internet-inclusion-globally-facebook-239465

15-04-2021||Dehradun||Head of Maha Nirvani Akhara suffering from Covid-19 dies in Uttarakhand||The head of the Maha Nirvani Akhara from Madhya Pradesh Swami Kapil Dev who was under treatment for COVID-19 at a private hospital here has died, an official said on Thursday.The akhara’s Mahamandaleshwar, who had come to attend the ongoing Kumbh Mela in Haridwar from Madhya Pradesh, was admitted to the Kailash Hospital here after his RT-PCR test result, Haridwar’s Chief Medical Officer S K Jha said.Swami Kapil Dev passed away at the hospital on April 13, Superintendent of Police (City) Sarita Dobhal said.Over 1,700 people have tested positive for COVID-19 in the Haridwar Kumbh Mela area from April 10 to 14 confirming fears that one of the world’s largest religious gatherings may contribute further to the rapid rise in coronavirus cases.Medical workers conducted 2,36,751 tests over the five-day period in the mela site. Out of these, 1,701 came out positive for coronavirus.The numbers include both RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Test reports of devotees and seers of different akharas (ascetic groups) over the five-day period in the entire mela site extending from Haridwar to Devprayag,  Jha said.More RT-PCR test reports are awaited and the trend shows that the number of infected persons in the Kumbh Mela site is likely to climb to 2,000, he said.The Kumbh Mela area is spread over 670 hectares covering parts of Haridwar, Tehri and Dehradun districts, including Rishikesh.A majority of the 48.51 lakh people who took part in the last two ‘royal baths’ (shahi snan) held on the occasion of Somwati Amavasya on April 12 and Mesh Sankranti on April 14 were seen openly violating COVID norms like wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing.Despite their best efforts, the police could not impose the standard operating procedures (SOPs) on the seers of akharas and the ash-smeared ascetics thronging Har Ki Pairi ghat on the two major bathing days due to severe time constraints.

15-04-2021||New Delhi||HC allows 50 people to offer namaz 5 times a day at Nizamuddin Markaz during Ramzan||The Delhi High Court Thursday allowed 50 people to offer namaz five times a day at Nizamuddin Markaz during Ramzan, saying there is no direction in the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) notification to close down places of worship.The court also noted that there was "no clear stand" of the central government as to whether religious congregations or gatherings were permitted in other places of worship.Justice Mukta Gupta directed that namaz is to be offered on "the first floor above the basement" of the mosque, making clear that it has to be "strictly in accordance" with the DDMA's April 10 notification and other standard operating protocols."Considering the fact that religious places/places of worship are not closed by the DDMA notification, this court finds that the petitioner (Delhi Waqf Board) has made out a prima facie case for permitting devotees to offer namaz at Masjid Bangley Wali," the court said.It directed the Station House Officer of Nizamuddin police station to permit entry of 50 people five times a day to offer namaz only on the first floor of the Masjid Bangley Wali."Considering the fact that devotees require performing namaz five times a day during the holy month of Ramzan and at the same time care has to be taken that COVID-19, which is increasing exponentially in Delhi, does not spread and does not affect the health of the public at large and those who will visit the mosque to offer namaz, the SHO is directed to permit 50 persons five times a day to offer namaz on the first floor of the masjid," the court said, adding that social distance has to be maintained.The court declined to increase the number of people or allow use of other floors of the mosque for offering prayers as sought by senior advocate Ramesh Gupta on behalf of the Delhi Waqf Board, saying "day-by-day situation is getting worse in Delhi"."Please wake up to the grim situation in Delhi," the court said.However, on repeated requests by the senior lawyer that social distancing can be maintained on the other floors of the mosque, the court permitted the Board to move an application before the SHO to use other floors.It also said that its order would be subject to any notification issued by the DDMA in view of the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in the National Capital, which recorded the biggest single-day jump of 17,282 COVID-19 cases.With these directions, the court listed on July 15, the Board's plea seeking opening of the Nizamuddin Markaz where the Tablighi Jamaat congregation was held amid the COVID-19 pandemic and was locked since March 31 last year.Earlier in the day, in a status report filed by the Assistant Commissioner of Police Sub Division Lajpat Nagar, the central government said the court "in its wisdom and discretion" may permit such persons as it deems fit and proper to perform namaz only on the ground floor of the mosque at the Nizamuddin Markaz by strictly following all COVID-19 related protocols.Without specifying whether all places of worship were closed, as was sought by the high court, the report said the DDMA notification prohibiting all kinds of gathering in the wake of increasing COVID-19 cases was applicable to all religions.Justice Mukta Gupta, after perusing the report, observed that it was silent on whether all the places of worship in the national capital were closed in accordance with the DDMA notification."You have not stated in the status report whether other religious places are closed or open. We find most of the religious places (in Delhi) are open," the court said.Justice Gupta said her directions on April 13 were very clear that the court wants to know whether all places of worship were closed as per the DDMA notification.In the hearing during the second half of the day, advocate Rajat Nair, appearing for the Centre, told the court that Sacred Heart Cathedral was holding online mass on Sunday and at the Kalkaji Temple, the 'aarti' was being done online and only 'darshan' was being permitted."We are trying to control the aberrations wherever they are happening," he said, adding that any congregation in the present situation could have a disastrous effect.The court had directed the Centre to file an affidavit indicating  as to how the DDMA order was being followed and whether any kind of social, religious, political or festive congregation or gathering was being permitted.The court had called for the affidavit after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on April 13 said that no gathering can be permitted at the mosque for offering prayers during Ramzan in view of the DDMA order.He had also said that only the five persons who were already permitted to pray there each day could be allowed inside the Nizamuddin Markaz mosque.The board, in its plea filed through advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, has contended that even after unlock-1 guidelines permitted religious places outside containment zones to be opened, the markaz—comprising the Masjid Bangley Wali, Madarsa Kashif-ul-uloom and attached hostel—continues to be locked up.It has further contended that even if the premises was part of any criminal investigation or trial, keeping it "under lock as an out of bound area" was a "primitive method" of enquiry process.Several FIRs have been registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act, Foreigners Act and various provisions of the penal code in connection with the Tablighi Jamaat event held at the markaz and the subsequent stay of foreigners there during the COVID-19 lockdown last year. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-allows-50-people-to-offer-namaz-5-times-a-day-at-nizamuddin-markaz-during-ramzan-239458
15-04-2021||New Delhi||COVID surge: International Baccalaureate cancels exams in India||The International Baccalaureate (IB) on Thursday cancelled its examinations across the country following a surge in COVID-19 cases.There are 185 schools in India following the IB’s curriculum. Students who seek admission in schools abroad or those whose parents are mostly transferred to foreign countries, usually opt for exams under this board. According to the board, India will follow the non-examination route for the diploma programme, the career-related programme and the alternative task for the middle years programme.“The IB has informed schools of our decision not to hold examinations in India due to rising cases of COVID-19, and following ongoing conversations with our schools, associations and education boards,” an official statement by the International Baccalaureate said.“We intend that the results of students in India should be awarded using coursework marks and predicted grades for the May 2021 session, as described in the awarding model outlined in February. For more details on the May 2021 session, students, parents and teachers are encouraged to talk to their school’s IB coordinator,” it said.The development came a day after the central government announced the cancellation of class 10 exams and the postponement of class 12 exams conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) following a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

15-04-2021||New Delhi||With unprecedented COVID surge, Delhi surpasses Mumbai to become worst-hit city in India||Battling the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic, Delhi recorded over 17,000 cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday to become the worst-affected city in the country, leaving financial capital Mumbai far behind in the daily tally.Mumbai's single day peak so far is 11,163, registered on April 4, according to officials figures.On Wednesday, Bengaluru recorded 8,155 cases, Chennai 2,564, their highest daily surge. Pune's highest single-day since the pandemic began was 12,494 cases, recorded on April 4.Delhi recorded 17,282 fresh cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, the highest single-day surge in the national capital since the onset of the pandemic, while over 100 fatalities were reported, according to data shared by the health department.Thus, Delhi has eclipsed Mumbai in the daily infection tally by a huge margin.The unprecedented surge in cases, especially in the last few days, has also left doctors and medical experts baffled, with some conjecturing that the virus has mutated and assumed so many different strains, some of which are far more transmissible than others."It is an absolute rampage in the city, young and old, vaccinated or not vaccinated, the virus is just hitting everyone. Delhi's situation is grim," said Suranjit Chatterjee, a senior consultant at Apollo Hospitals here.According to the Wednesday bulletin, 104 new fatalities were recorded, pushing the death toll to 11,540.These new positive cases came out of record 1.08 lakh tests conducted on Tuesday, the bulletin said, adding, the positivity rate mounted to 15.92 per cent, also the highest so far.The highest single-day spike in Delhi till the third wave of the pandemic -- 8,593 cases -- was reported on November 11 in 2020, while on November 18, the city had recorded 131 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day fatality count till date.The positivity rate on November 14 last year had stood at 15.33 per cent, according to official data.Delhi had recorded 10,774 cases on April 11, overtaking the highest daily surge here till the third wave, registered on November 11 -- 8,593 cases -- was reported on November 11, while on November 18, the city had recorded 131 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day fatality count till date.The cases in Delhi have since April 11 been  on an upward spiral, 13,468 cases on Tuesday, and eventually 17,282 cases on Wednesday.Mumbai in April till Wednesday has recorded 1,30,228 cases and 464 deaths. In March, 88,710 cases in total and 216 fatalities have been recorded in that month in the financial capital of the country, according to official data.In March, Delhi registered 23,141 cases in total and 117 deaths, according to official figures.Richa Sareen, consultant, Pulmonology and Critical Care Medicine, Fortis hospital here, said, "Given the pace of spread, it definitely seems there is a different variant in circulation and it is more infectious than the previous one." She said the younger population was getting more infected as elderly have mostly got vaccinated, and the older population is more at home, but younger demographic segment is gong out and meeting others or socialising, partying or travelling, which increases the chance of infection.A senior doctor at the Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, which has been turned into a fully COVID hospital again, said there has been a massive surge in number of patients at the facility in the last few days.From April 4 to April 13, Delhi has recorded a total of 77,775 COVID-19 cases, witnessing a massive rise of 234 per cent. During the same period, 376 people have died due to the disease.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday announced sweeping restrictions, including a weekend curfew and the  closure of malls, gyms, spas and auditoriums, in a bid to break the chain of COVID infections in the city.There will be no in-house dining in restaurants and cinema halls will be allowed to operate with only 30 per cent capacity, the chief minister said at an online press conference a day after the city recorded the biggest single-day jump 17,282 new COVID-19 cases.Kejrwal said essential services and weddings will not be affected during the weekend curfew and passes will be provided to those attending weddings. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/with-unprecedented-covid-surge-delhi-surpasses-mumbai-to-become-worst-hit-city-in-india-239451

15-04-2021||Dehradun/Rishikesh||Over 1,700 test positive for COVID-19 in Kumbh Mela over 5-day period||Over 1,700 people have tested positive for COVID-19 in the Haridwar Kumbh Mela area from April 10 to 14 confirming fears that one of the world's largest religious gatherings may contribute further to the rapid rise in coronavirus cases.Medical workers conducted 2,36,751 tests over the five-day period in the mela site. Out of these, 1,701 came out positive for coronavirus.The numbers include both RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Test reports of devotees and seers of different akharas (ascetic groups) over the five-day period in the entire mela site extending from Haridwar to Devprayag, Haridwar's Chief Medical Officer Shambhu Kumar Jha said on Thursday.More RT-PCR test reports are awaited and the trend shows that the number of infected persons in the Kumbh Mela site is likely to climb to 2,000, he said.The Kumbh Mela area is spread over 670 hectares covering parts of Haridwar, Tehri and Dehradun districts, including Rishikesh.A majority of the 48.51 lakh people who took part in the last two 'royal baths' (shahi snan) held on the occasion of Somwati Amavasya on April 12 and Mesh Sankranti on April 14 were seen openly violating COVID norms like wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing.Despite their best efforts, the police could not impose the standard operating procedures (SOPs) on the seers of akharas and the ash-smeared ascetics thronging Har Ki Pairi ghat on the two major bathing days due to severe time constraints.As the 13 akharas had to take their holy dip at Har ki Pairi in accordance with their allotted time slots before sunset, the police and paramilitary personnel were hard-pressed to ensure each of them vacated the ghat before the arrival of the next akhara in line to prevent chaos.As seers were averse to undergoing RT-PCR tests till the Mesh Sankranti Shahi Snan of April 14, both testing and inoculation in the Kumbh Kshetra including the areas allocated to the akharas are likely to be stepped up in the coming days, Jha said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-1-700-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-kumbh-mela-over-5-day-period-239435
15-04-2021||Chandigarh||Army moves to identify Indian partners to develop advanced protection system for tanks||With the Ministry of Defence (MoD) having recently approved the procurement of advanced protection and counter-measure system for its fleet of T-90 tanks, the Army has moved to identify Indian partners to develop the system that would enhance the survivability of armoured vehicles against incoming missiles and projectiles in the battlefield.Contemporary combat vehicles have onboard protective-cum-warning systems that warn the crew of impending attacks and create a physical interference between the platform and hostile threat to significantly degrade the effectiveness of hostile weapons.“T-90 S/SK tanks are the mainstay of the mechanised forces and are likely to remain in service beyond 2050. Hence, the tanks must be periodically upgraded to cater for the futuristic warfighting capabilities as also facilitate obsolescence management,” an Expression of Interest (EoI) invited by the Army this week states.“There is a requirement to provide enhanced protection and survivability to these assets in addition to the intrinsic protection of the tanks by way of soft and hard kill measures,” the EoI adds. The Army could initially procure over 800 protection systems.The Army has about 2,000 T-90 tanks in its inventory, which were initially procured in batches from Russia and later built by Heavy Vehicles Factory at Avadi near Chennai. India is expected to manufacture T-90s till 2028. These were also airlifted to Ladakh last year and deployed along the Line of Actual Control during the stand-off with China.In February, the Defence Acquisition Council, MoD’s apex procurement body had cleared various proposals worth Rs 13,700 crore for acquisitions from domestic sources. This included Rs 5,300 crore for protection systems for armoured vehicles.The hard skill and soft skill measures proposed to be retrofitted on the tanks are required to detect and then degrade or defeat incoming hostile projectiles. With advances in anti-tank weapons, armour alone is considered insufficient for protection.The system’s soft kill component will provide an audiovisual warning on being targeted or engaged by a hostile platform, use decoy smoke to counter lasers and camouflage against detection and lock-on by the enemy. It is aimed at degrading or defeating in-coming laser, infra-red or radar-guided missiles by means of electro-optical signals or jamming. The hard kill component will use sensors to detect incoming projectiles and use countermeasures like grenades to destroy them before they can hit the tank.The Army’s requirement is for a system that can detect more than one direction of attack simultaneously and protect armoured vehicles against threats from guided missiles and projectiles fired up to a velocity of 1000 meters per second. It should be capable of all-weather day and night operations at temperatures up to 45 degrees Celsius.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-moves-to-identify-indian-partners-to-develop-advanced-protection-system-for-tanks-239434
15-04-2021||New Delhi||Supreme Court asks CBI to probe wrongful arrests in ISRO spying case||The Supreme Court on Thursday accepted the Justice DK Jain Committee report on lapses on the part of Kerala Police officers in the ISRO spying case and asked the Centre to hand it over to the CBI for further probe.A Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar -- which asked the CBI to submit its report in three months -- made it clear that the committee's report can't be made public and can't be shared with anyone, including former ISRO scientist S Nambi Narayanan.It said the report's copies can't be given even to officials named in it or those named in the petition.Appointed by the top court in 2018, the committee is said to have found "acts of omission and commission" by "responsible officials" in Kerala Government in the ISRO spying case, which was proved to be a false case.The Bench directed the CBI to treat the Jain Committee report as a preliminary inquiry report and proceed further.It said the private respondents were free to exercise all legal options available to them.Almost two-and-a-half-years after the Supreme Court asked it to look into the lapses on the part of the Kerala Police officers in wrongfully arresting scientist S Nambo Narayanan in the 1994 ISRO spy scandal, the Justice DK Jain Committee had submitted its report to the Supreme Court recently in a sealed cover.The three-man Committee also included DK Prasad and VS Senthil -- representing the Centre and the Kerala Government respectively.The Jain Committee inquired into the roles of police officers Siby Mathews, KK Joshua and S Vijayan in wrongfully framing Narayanan -- a Padma Bhushan awardee.The Centre has sought strict action against delinquent police officials who had framed Narayanan in the case.The Supreme Court had on September 14, 2018, ordered the Kerala Government to pay a compensation of Rs 50 Lakh to the former ISRO scientist whose life got ruined after he was falsely implicated in the ISRO spying scandal.It had set up a three-member panel led by Justice (Retd) DK Jain “to find out ways and means to take appropriate steps against the erring (Kerala Police) officials.”“The entire prosecution initiated by the State police was malicious and it has caused tremendous harassment and immeasurable anguish to the appellant said the Bench which had reserved its verdict on July 10 on his petition seeking action against former Kerala DGP Siby Mathews and other police officers who allegedly falsely implicated him in the case.“The liberty and dignity of the appellant which is basic to his human rights were jeopardized as he was taken into custody and, eventually, despite all the glory of the past, he was compelled to face cynical abhorrence” the top court had said granting him compensation for “the suffering, anxiety and the treatment” meted out to him that withered away his fundamental right to life and liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.Narayanan (79) had challenged a Kerala High Court verdict that said no action was needed against former DGP Mathews and two retired Superintendents of Police, K K Joshua and S Vijayan for his illegal arrest.The Kerala police had arrested Mariam Rasheeda -- a Maldivian woman on October 20, 1994, for overstaying in India after the expiry of her visa. It turned into a sex-spy scandal allegedly involving two senior ISRO scientists, some businessmen and others. They were accused of passing on ISRO's cryogenic programme secrets to the women who in turn supplied the same to Russia and Pakistan’s ISI.In 1996, the CBI probe cleared all the accused. It concluded that the entire scandal was fabricated by Kerala Police officers who had investigated the case. All the accused were discharged in May 1996. Along with the closure report, the CBI had also sent a confidential report indicting the state police officials.But following a change of guard in Kerala, the state government withdrew the consent given to the CBI to probe the case and asked the state police to re-investigate it.However, the Supreme Court in April 1998 quashed the state government’s decision and all the accused were freed. Rasheeda too was released in 2001. The Kerala High Court had in September 2012 ordered the state government to pay Rs 10 lakh as interim relief to Narayanan.Acting on his petition, the Kerala High Court had in October 2014 ordered action against the state police officials based on the CBI’s confidential report. But a Division Bench of the High Court reversed the order in March 2015.It’s this Division Bench verdict that Narayanan had challenged in the top court.The Supreme Court had said, “...there can be no scintilla of doubt that the appellant, a successful scientist having national reputation, has been compelled to undergo immense humiliation. The lackadaisical attitude of the State police to arrest anyone and put him in police custody has made the appellant suffer the ignominy.“The dignity of a person gets shocked when psycho-pathological treatment is meted out to him. A human being cries for justice when he feels that the insensible act has crucified his self-respect. That warrants grant of compensation under the public law remedy, it had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-asks-cbi-to-probe-wrongful-arrests-in-isro-spying-case-239428

15-04-2021||Washington||US remains non-committal on India's move to get TRIPS waiver to Covid vaccines at WTO||The US remained non-committal on the move by India and South Africa to get Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) waiver for Covid vaccine before the WTO so that the doses are accessible and affordable to low- and middle-income countries.The move by India, South Africa and several other countries has been supported by more than 60 top American lawmakers, most of whom are progressives.US Trade Representatives Katherine Tai, in her address to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) virtual conference on Covid vaccine equity on Wednesday, however, did not weigh in on the request made by India and South Africa.The virtual conference was attended and addressed by her Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal, Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis of the European Union, and Minister Ebrahim Patel of South Africa on Wednesday.“I have had a chance already to have very meaningful preliminary conversations with each of you. I am committed to finding ways to partner with you on the issues before us today and more broadly,” Tai said.Acknowledging that there is still a gaping divide between developed and developing countries when it comes to access to medicines, she said that this was seen during the HIV/AIDS epidemic, where various policies and actions constrained access to medicines, contributing to unnecessary deaths and suffering.“We must learn from, and not repeat, the tragedies and mistakes of the past. The Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, for example, was born out of the HIV/AIDS crisis, and we all – both in government and in the private sector – need to do our parts to live up to its spirit,” Tai said.But there are many aspects of the institution of the WTO and its rules that have not adapted to a changed world, a changed membership, changed practices and expectations.“We must ensure that this time of crisis and suffering leads to breakthroughs and progress,” Tai said in her address.“We hope to hear more today about how the market once again has failed in meeting the health needs of developing countries.  As part of that we have to consider what modifications and reforms to our trade rules might be necessary to reflect what we have learned,” she said.Later at the end of the conference, WTO Director General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said the speakers agree that it's not acceptable for people and countries to have to wait indefinitely for vaccines.“We do not want to repeat experiences of the past,” she said.“It was agreed that production capacity needs to be expanded, particularly in developing and least developed countries and emerging markets. And that vaccine distribution needs to be more effective and more equitable,” Okonjo-Iweala said.

15-04-2021||United Nations||India for blacklisting individuals, entities involved in sexual violence against women||India has called for strengthening the sanctions regimes of the UN Security Council to ensure blacklisting of individuals and entities involved in sexual violence against women in armed conflicts which it said is used as a weapon to subjugate the people.Speaking at the Security Council open debate on Sexual Violence in Conflict on Wednesday, India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador TS Tirumurti said it is vital for the member states to develop a comprehensive legal framework in line with international standards to ensure the effective prosecution of sexual violence as a self-standing crime.“Sexual violence in armed conflicts, perpetrated by state and non-state actors, is a weapon used to subjugate the people. It fuels displacement, destabilises and traumatises communities, weakens governance and imperils the opportunities for post-conflict reconciliation and stability,” Tirumurti said.“National governments have the primary responsibility for prosecuting and deterring such crimes in conflict situations on their territories, even if these are alleged to have been committed by non-state actors. Where required, the UN could assist member states in augmenting their capacities to deal with this issue,” he said.With a view to preventing atrocities, ending the culture of impunity and rehabilitating and reintegrating the survivors, India also said that sanctions regimes and other targeted measures by the Council need to be strengthened to utilise their full potential to advance women's protection from sexual violence in situations of armed conflicts, “including by listing individuals and entities involved in sexual violence against women in armed conflicts”.With the COVID-19 pandemic threatening to put women and girls in armed conflicts at even higher risk, Tirumurti called for nations to work together to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on sexual violence in armed conflicts and to “preserve our hard-won progress in this field”.

15-04-2021||Washington||India, Pakistan among others with stake in stable future of Afghanistan: Biden||US President Joe Biden has said that India, Pakistan, Russia, China and Turkey have a significant stake in the stable future of Afghanistan and these regional stakeholders should do more to bring peace in this war-torn country, from where he will withdraw all American troops by September 11."We will ask other countries in the region to do more to support Afghanistan, especially Pakistan, as well as Russia, China, India and Turkey. They all have a significant stake in the stable future of Afghanistan," Biden said in a nationally televised speech from the White House on Wednesday.In less than 100 days after taking over as the president of the US on January 20, Biden announced to begin to withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan by September 11.The US currently has a little over 2,500 troops, which is far less than the 100,000-plus during the Barack Obama administration.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that there is no military solution to the current situation in Afghanistan, rather a diplomatic solution is required.“Even as we are withdrawing our troops, we will continue to support diplomatic and humanitarian work. We will ask other countries to step up, whether that's Pakistan, Russia, China, India, Turkey - countries in the region that certainly have a stake in stability. We will continue to provide significant humanitarian resources,” Psaki said in response to a question.“We will continue to be engaged. This is the president's assessment about whether having troops on the ground, a military presence in the same way - in a version of the same way it has been over the last two decades -- is in our national interest. And he has made the decision it is not,” she said.Biden said the war in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi-generational undertaking. "We were attacked. We went to war with clear goals. We achieved those objectives. (Osama) Bin Laden is dead, and al Qaeda is degraded in Iraq, in Afghanistan. And it's time to end the forever war,” he asserted.The Biden administration on Wednesday did not give details of its expectations from India on the latter's role in Afghanistan after the complete withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.In the past, successive US administrations have praised India's role in peace and development in Afghanistan.“India has been the largest regional contributor to Afghan reconstruction, but New Delhi has not shown an inclination to pursue a deeper defence relationship with Kabul,” said a recent report on Afghanistan by the independent Congressional Research Service.

It later came to light that Sharique's aunt, Tabassum Qureshi, had used them to transport the drugs. The trip had been sponsored by Tabassum, the official said.At that time, while Sharique was employed with a Japanese company, Oniba had just learnt that she was pregnant. She delivered a girl, Aayat, in jail last February. The couple's family members approached the Indian Government, asking it to intervene in the matter.Following this, the NCB got in touch with the authorities in Qatar and the family challenged the lower court order convicting the couple. Eventually, the couple was cleared of all charges. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-couple-convicted-in-drug-case-in-qatar-returns-home-239401

Their intent is to undermine the established rule of law in the Indian Ocean and also the South China Sea.Earlier, Admiral Karambir Singh said the Indian Navy recognised the expanse of the Indo-Pacific and no one could do it alone, it was best to do it together. “We could see that freedom of navigation gets converted into contested water,” he said.‘Forces already enjoy interoperability’At the Raisina Dialogue, on being asked where he saw Quad, whether it could take a military form and was it ready for joint military operations, Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh said Quad navies already enjoyed a high degree of interoperability and highlighted that the Malabar exercise started with the US in 1992 and it predated the Quad construct.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quad-navies-can-come-together-if-need-arises-says-navy-chief-239155

15-04-2021||London||Boris Johnson reduces length of India visit due to COVID-19||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has reduced the length of his visit to New Delhi at the end of this month due to the COVID-19 situation in India, Downing Street said on Wednesday.Johnson was to spend a few days in India starting April 26 as part of a planned itinerary, which is expected to include finalising a UK-India Enhanced Trade Partnership.However, with the pandemic crisis in India taking a turn for the worse, the itinerary has had to be reworked and the major part of the high-level bilateral interactions, including bilateral talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are now scheduled to be limited to New Delhi on April 26.“We have been in close contact with the Indian government about the Prime Minister's upcoming visit in light of the Covid situation in India. As a result of these discussions, the Prime Minister has made the decision to reduce the length of the visit, due to take place at the end of this month, to a shorter programme in New Delhi,” the Prime Minister's spokesperson at 10 Downing Street said.The programme will be focused on high-level discussions with the Indian government and Indian business leaders, the official said.“We'll set out more details in due course, but the visit will include a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Modi."As with all the Prime Minister's visits, his trip to India will prioritise the safety of those involved. All elements of the visit will be Covid secure,” the spokesperson said.Addressing the virtual International Conference on Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (ICDRI) inaugurated by Prime Minister Modi last month, Johnson had said that the UK and India's shared vision for a sustainable future will be among the issues on the agenda for talks during his upcoming visit.“We have a shared vision for a sustainable future for our nations and global community and I very much look forward to discussing this and many other issues with Prime Minister Modi on my upcoming visit to India,” he said at the time.The announcement of the visit, which had been postponed from a planned Republic Day tour in January due to the escalating COVID-19 crisis in the UK, came as the UK launched the conclusions of its integrated review of defence, security, development and foreign policy – a post-Brexit policy vision that falls within a wider Global Britain agenda.A central foreign policy shift included in the review is a definitive tilt towards the Indo-Pacific region as the “geopolitical centre of the world”.“I am delighted to announce that I will visit India next month to strengthen our friendship with the world's biggest democracy,” he said in a House of Commons statement on March 16.British High Commissioner to India, Alex Ellis, recently said that the visit promises to be a very significant marking of a new kind of relationship across trade and investment as well as the exchange of people and ideas between India and the UK.The envoy, who is in charge of finalising the prime ministerial visit agenda, highlighted several pillars of focus for the bilateral engagement, covering areas such as defence and security and climate action and healthcare, including cooperation in the area of COVID-19 vaccines.“This is the first major bilateral visit that this Prime Minister would have made to any country outside the UK, that says quite a lot about the significance of the India relationship which he seeks,” Ellis said last month during a seminar organised by the London-based think tank International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).“It is very exciting that he is coming. He was planning to come in January, but the Covid situation in the UK put paid to that, but he is very keen to come and we are really looking forward to what we hope will be a very significant marking of a new kind of relationship,” he added.

In touch with Pakistani authorities and Sikh Jatha. Will do utmost to ensure security and safe return of pilgrims,” External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar tweeted.The minister’s response came after president of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management committee Manjinder Singh Sirsa, in a tweet, requested Jaishankar to look into the matter of stranded Sikh pilgrims in Pakistan.Over 800 Indian Sikhs travelled to Pakistan to attend the Baisakhi festival. The Indian pilgrims had reached Lahore via Wagah border on Monday to attend the festival.On Tuesday afternoon, the visiting Indian Sikhs left for Gurdwara Panja Sahib in Hassanabdal in 25 buses which were escorted by the police and the Pakistani Rangers.“Owing to the TLP protest that blocked roads, the Sikh yatrees reached Hassanabdal at 4 am on Wednesday after over 14 hours of journey which otherwise is covered in three hours,” an official of the Punjab government told PTI in Lahore.  Protests are taking place in several parts of Pakistan by supporters of Tehreek-i-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) demanding the expulsion of the French envoy over the publication of blasphemous caricatures in France.The Indian pilgrims attended the main event on Wednesday in which several local Sikhs also participated.The visiting pilgrims are scheduled to visit other holy places in the Punjab province of Pakistan during their 10-day stay in the country.

India has become the fastest nation to reach the landmark of 10 crore vaccinations.”Noting the positive impact of Tika Utsav in the last four days, the PM said in this period, the vaccination drive was expanded and new vaccination centres came up.Addressing governors, the PM said along with the vaccines, Indian values and sense of duty were biggest national strengths at this critical time.“The feeling of janbhagidari we saw last year needs to be encouraged again. The role of the governors becomes all the more critical to achieve this. The governors are an important link to ensure better coordination between states and society and to harness the combined power of community organisations, political parties, NGOs and social institutions,” the PM said on a day when painful images of COVID patients dying from lack of medical attention streamed across social media and India’s active caseload rose to 13,65,704 making up 9.84 per cent of the total 1,38,73,825 cases. Daily toll of 1,027 today was the highest since October 18, last year.The PM said governors could engage to ensure that social institutions helped states with micro containment.“Social networks can help ensure an increase in the capacity of ambulances, ventilators and oxygen in hospitals,” the PM said.He also urged the youth an important part of the economy, to follow Covid protocols and said the governors’ role was critical in ensuring greater engagement of university students towards janbhagidari.“We also need to focus on better utilisation of facilities at university and college campuses,” the PM said stressing the need to raise RT-PCR testing capacity and noting that all test equipment was not available on the government e-portal.RT-PCR testing needs to be increased from 60 per cent to 70 per cent, the PM said.The vice president stressed COVID appropriate behaviour and called for “test, track and treat” strategy with renewed vigour. He urged states to “keep political differences aside and act together as a team”.82.04 % DAILY CASES IN 10 STATESTen states—Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Rajasthan have accounted for 82.04 pc of new COVID cases today. Maharashtra also reported 60,212; Uttar Pradesh 17,963 and Chhattisgarh 15,121.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/committed-to-adequate-covid-19-vaccine-supplies-pm-modi-as-daily-cases-top-1-84-lakh-239091

15-04-2021||New Delhi||Access to higher, professional education is not a governmental largesse:  SC||Maintaining that access to professional education is not a governmental largesse, the Supreme Court has said the state had an affirmative obligation to facilitate access to education at all levels.“While the right to pursue higher (professional) education has not been spelt out as a fundamental right in Part III of the Constitution, it bears emphasis that access to professional education is not a governmental largesse. Instead, the state has an affirmative obligation to facilitate access to education, at all levels,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said.The court was dealing with a case of admission of Farzana Batool and another candidate of Ladakh in a medical college in Delhi against the central pool. In November last year, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MHFW) had allotted one seat each at Lady Hardinge Medical College and Maulana Azad Medical College to the Union Territory of Ladakh from the central pool.UT of Ladakh nominated Batool for admission to the two medical colleges.  She moved the top court after being refused admission despite the nomination, contending that other similarly placed students were admitted to other colleges.The top court directed that both the candidates be granted admission to the respective colleges within a week. It also directed that the other seven candidates, selected and nominated for the central pool medical seats under the February 19 notification issued by the Director of Health Services, Ladakh should also be given admission to the institutions concerned.It asked the MHFW and the DHSL to consider appointing a nodal officer tasked with the responsibility of ensuring that students who are duly nominated under the central pool seats are in fact admitted in their chosen course of study.“Financial hardship should not prevent the students from getting admission in terms of the allocation which has been made in their favour legitimately under the central pool seats,” the Bench said on April 9.It underscored the importance of creating an enabling environment to make it possible for students to pursue professional education.“This obligation assumes far greater importance for students whose background (by virtue of such characteristics as caste, class, gender, religion, disability and geographical region) imposes formidable obstacles on their path to accessing quality education,” said the Bench which also included Justice MR Shah.Noting that India ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) in 1979, the top court asked the MHFW and the DHSL to ensure proper coordination so that students allocated colleges under the central pool seats are not put to hardship in enrolling once they have been duly allocated their seats.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/access-to-higher-professional-education-is-not-a-governmental-largesse%C2%A0-sc-239085
15-04-2021||Mumbai||Double mutation found in 61% of 361 COVID-19 samples: Expert||Double mutation has been detected in 61 per cent of the total 361 COVID-19 samples tested between January and March this year, a genome sequencing expert claimed on Wednesday even as he raised doubts over the methods of sample collection being adopted by authorities in Maharashtra, which is worst affected by the pandemic.However, experts in the fields of genome sequencing and cell science have observed that such a small sample size cannot be considered as an indication of the spread of the mutated virus.These 361 samples were tested at the genome sequencing laboratories in Maharashtra.On the other hand, authorities and officials of civic bodies that are collecting COVID-19 samples daily have complained about the lack of communication from the genome sequencing laboratories in Maharashtra as well as from the Centre about their findings on the sample analysis.This lack of communication is resulting in civic bodies and state health officials remaining in the dark and thus unable to come up with a better strategy to curb the rapid spread of coronavirus in Maharashtra, they said."I am told that out of 361 COVID-19 samples tested by the National Institute of Virology in Pune, 61 per cent had the double mutation. However, this sample size is too small to conclude as Maharashtra has been conducting nearly two lakh tests per day. One should not take such a small sample size as an indication that the mutated virus is widespread," a senior genome sequencing expert told PTI.Maharashtra is witnessing an unprecedented spike in coronavirus positive cases for the last few weeks.As of Tuesday, the cumulative tally of the infections in Maharashtra, the worst-hit state in India, stood at 35,19,208 while the death toll stood at 58,526, as per the state health department.Maharashtra had 5,93,042 active cases as of Tuesday."Concerns were raised recently about the methods of sample collection being adopted by civic bodies and local health officials who are conducting daily COVID-19 tests," the expert said.Stressing that the sample collection has to be random, he said the double mutation was found in all samples from a particular set of samples sent from Nashik."Some 10 samples were sent from Nashik. When we inquired about the method used in collecting these samples, we found that local officials had sent 10 consecutive samples for genome sequencing. The sample selection has to be random to assess where exactly the mutated virus is found," he said.In the case of Nashik, it means that these samples could be of the members of a big joint family."Another possibility is that the people could be from the same area. (sample collection  which is done in such a manner) completely defeats the purpose of random sampling and the genome sequencing efforts," he added.The expert PTI spoke to works with a genome sequencing laboratory.Genome sequencing is the process of determining the entirety, or nearly the entirety, of the DNA sequence of an organism's genome at a single time.Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Additional Commissioner Suresh Kakani said that samples are being sent regularly to genome sequencing laboratories, "but we are not receiving any communication from them"."We still do not know whether the sent samples contain the double mutation of the novel coronavirus or whether it is the earlier variant. If genome sequencing identifies the presence of double mutant virus (technically known as B.1.617) in the samples, in that event, we can issue revised guidelines to minimise its spread as it is more infectious," Kakani said.He said the need of the hour is a regular update from the Centre or the consortium of ten laboratories set up for genome sequencing (by the Union government).Known as the "Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), it has identified two important mutations in the coronavirus variant dubbed as a "double mutant".So far, the double mutant has been reported in various countries.Meanwhile, another senior scientist in the field of genomic sequencing claimed the consortium is still not fully operational "as there is a huge communication gap among the member laboratories"."Unless the communication is smooth, it will take a longer time for the state machinery to know whether they are dealing with an old variant of COVID-19 or an infectious one.We are lucky that the virus is not mutated yet and not become lethal."We cannot afford to learn about the status of the virus so late due to the lack of communication between these laboratories that have a common goal of genome sequencing," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/double-mutation-found-in-61-of-361-covid-19-samples-expert-239039

The Modi government has jeopardised the lives of Indians by its negligent conduct," he said at a press conference."The government has been completely careless and cruel when it comes to ensuring life-saving drugs, oxygen and availability of beds, ramping up health infrastructure and ramping up vaccine production. It has proved incompetent in handling COVID-19," he told reporters.Surjewala asked how the government could export vaccine when it is in acute shortage in the country and when there is no vaccine for Indians.He said when Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi gave the suggestion to grant emergency approval to foreign vaccines, the government agreed but Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Smriti Irani targeted them with baseless allegations."This is a national emergency happening and we know that the prime minister is busy campaigning, but the prime minister must follow raj dharma. There is no 'you versus us' debate. It is 'we versus corona'," he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-negligent-callous-in-tackling-covid-must-follow-raj-dharma-congress-239022

He said the Centre would ensure that the health of students is taken care of and their academic interests are not harmed. The result of Class 10 will be prepared on the basis of an objective criterion to be devised by the Board. Any candidate who is not satisfied with the marks allocated to him/her on this basis will be given an opportunity to sit in an exam as and when the conditions are conducive, the statement said. Owing to the increasing Covid cases, schools have been shut in 11 states. Unlike state boards, the CBSE has an all-India character, and, therefore, it is essential to hold exams simultaneously throughout the country. Looking at the present situation and also taking into account the safety of the students, the decision was taken, it said.Glad the government has finally cancelled the 10th standard exams however a final decision MUST be taken for the 12th grade too. Keeping students under undue pressure until June makes no sense. It’s unfair.

15-04-2021||Washington||India under Modi more likely to respond with military force to Pak provocations: US intelligence report||India, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is more likely than in the past to respond with military force to perceived or real Pakistani provocations, the US intelligence community has told Congress in a report.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) in its Annual Threat Assessment report to the US Congress, said although a general war between India and Pakistan is unlikely, crises between the two are likely to become more intense, risking an escalatory cycle."Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is more likely than in the past to respond with military force to perceived or real Pakistani provocations, and heightened tensions raise the risk of conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, with violent unrest in Kashmir or a militant attack in India being potential flashpoints," it said.India and Pakistan are without high commissioners in each other's capital since the relations between the two countries nosedived after India withdrew the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated the state into union territories in August 2019.India has said it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence and that the onus is on Islamabad to create an environment free of terror and hostility.According to the ODNI report, the fighting in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria has a direct bearing on US forces, while tensions between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan remain a concern for the world.The iterative violence between Israel and Iran, the activity of foreign powers in Libya, and conflicts in other areas—including Africa, Asia, and the Middle East—have the potential to escalate or spread, it said.On Afghanistan, the ODNI report assessed that prospects for a peace deal will remain low during the next year."The Taliban is likely to make gains on the battlefield, and the Afghan Government will struggle to hold the Taliban at bay if the coalition withdraws support. Kabul continues to face setbacks on the battlefield, and the Taliban is confident it can achieve military victory,” it said."Afghan forces continue to secure major cities and other government strongholds, but they remain tied down in defensive missions and have struggled to hold recaptured territory or re-establish a presence in areas abandoned in 2020,” the report said.
