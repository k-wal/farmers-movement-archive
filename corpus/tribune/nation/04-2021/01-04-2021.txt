01-04-2021||New Delhi||India for comprehensive, expert-led mechanism to investigate origin of COVID-19||India on Thursday said it shares the need for a comprehensive and expert-led mechanism to expeditiously investigate the origin of the coronavirus, days after the World Health Organization (WHO) came out with a report on it.WHO officials said data was withheld from its investigators, who travelled to China to study the origin of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.“We share the need for a comprehensive and expert-led mechanism that would expeditiously investigate the origin of COVID-19 in cooperation with all stakeholders,” Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.He was replying to media queries on the issue.Bagchi said the WHO report represents an important first step in establishing the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.“It has listed four pathways concerning the emergence of the disease but has stressed the need for next-phase studies across the region. The report also stresses the need for further data and studies to reach robust conclusions,” he said.The MEA spokesperson also mentioned the WHO director general’s comments on delays and difficulties in accessing raw data by the team conducting the study.“It is pertinent to note that the director general of the WHO has separately raised the issue of delays and difficulties in accessing raw data for the team conducting the study,” he said.“We fully support the director general’s expectation that future collaborative studies will include more timely and comprehensive data-sharing. In this connection, we also welcome his readiness to deploy additional missions,” Bagchi added.

01-04-2021||New Delhi||Samyukt Kisan Morcha asks BJP MPs, allies to support farmers' agitation||The Samyukt Kisan Morcha on Thursday appealed to the BJP MPs and its allies to extend their support to the farmers' movement.The SKM also noted that they would continue their "peaceful social boycott" of leaders of the BJP and its allies."We request the BJP MPs and its allies and other elected representatives to support the farmers' movement. The SKM appeals to these leaders that they can support the movement in any form, including resignation from their posts," according to a statement released by the SKM. It claimed that Haryana Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala was met with "fierce opposition" by the farmers during his visit to Hisar on Thursday."Farmers did not let the helicopter of the anti-farmer Dushyant Chautala take off," the statement claimed.Chautala, whose Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) is the coalition partner of the ruling BJP in Haryana, has faced repeated protests from farmers over the past few months for supporting the agricultural laws.In Rajasthan's Hanumangarh too, farmers "gheraoed and protested against Pilibangan MLA Dharmendra Singh at Dabli toll plaza"."At the time of the vote, they (leaders) become very friendly to the farmers and other people, but today when the farmers are struggling, he (Singh) is standing against them," the statement said.The Centre has said the new farm laws will benefit farmers by freeing them from the clutches of middlemen and ushering in new technology in the sector.However, farmers say these legislations will remove the safety net of the minimum support price (MSP) and leave them at the mercy of big corporates. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/samyukt-kisan-morcha-asks-bjp-mps-allies-to-support-farmers-agitation-233254
01-04-2021||---||PIL in SC seeks directions to check black magic, superstition, forcible conversions||New Delhi, April 1A BJP leader has filed a PIL in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Centre and states to take measures against black magic, superstition and forcible religious conversions.Highlighting incidents of forceful religious conversion by “carrot and stick” and use of black magic “reported every week throughout the country", petitioner Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay – a Delhi BJP leader and an advocate – pointed out that the Supreme Court had in the Sarla Mudgal Case (1995) directed the Centre to ascertain the feasibility of enacting an anti-conversion law.“The law may provide that every citizen who changes his religion cannot marry another wife unless he divorces his first wife. The provision should be made applicable to every person whether he is a Hindu or a Muslim or a Christian or a Sikh or a Jain or a Buddhist. Provision may be made for maintenance and succession etc. also to avoid clash of interest after death...This would go a long way to solve the problem and pave the way for a unified civil code,” the petitioner submitted quoting from the Sarla Mudgal verdict.In fact, the victims of such forcible conversions were often socially and economically under privileged people, particularly belonging to the SC-ST, Upadhyay contended.Terming forceful as a violation of right to equality, right to life and liberty and right to religion guaranteed under Articles 14, 21 and 25 of the Constitution, he said it was also against the principles of secularism – an integral part of basic structure of Constitution.Accusing the Government of having failed to take any concrete action against these menacesof the society, he said, the “Centre is empowered to make special provisions for the benefit of women and children under Article 15(3) and freedom of conscience, free profession, practice & propagation of religion under Article 25 is subject to public order, morality, health and other provisions of Part-III.”Alternately, he demanded that the Law Commission of India should be asked to prepare a report on “Black Magic, Superstition and Religious Conversion within three months in spirit of the Judgment in Sarla Mudgal Case.”He said being custodian of the Constitution and protector of fundamental rights, the court should use its plenary constitutional power to pass directions to stop conversion by carrot and the stick.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-in-sc-seeks-directions-to-check-black-magic-superstition-forcible-conversions-233252

01-04-2021||Mumbai||We can't go back to last year: Multiplex, retail associations urge Maharashtra govt to avoid lockdown||Cinema, retail, and shopping industries won't be able to bear another lockdown, industry associations said on Thursday, urging Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to not impose a lockdown in Maharashtra where COVID-19 cases continue to rise.Multiplex Association of India (MAI), Retail Association of India (RAI), and Shopping Centres Association of India said they were following all the safety protocols of the government but a lockdown will hit the business, which was in the recovery process.Maharashtra, whose capital Mumbai is home to Hindi cinema, on Wednesday reported as many as 39,544 new coronavirus cases, its second-highest single-day rise in infection tally since the pandemic began, a health official said.With this, the state's cumulative caseload mounted to 28,12,980.Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope recently said people should be ready for stringent measures in the coming days to curb the spread of COVID-19 and that imposing a lockdown is the last option for the state government.Kamal Gianchandani, CEO PVR Pictures and president of MAI, said the cinema industry is mentally reconciled with the fact that they will have to "co-exist with the virus for some time"."There's a sensor deja vu for sure because we all have painful memories of the lockdown," he told PTI in an interview, emphasising the need for stricter enforcement of safety protocols and faster vaccination of people.Gianchandani said businesses should be permitted to function because that's the only way for them to sustain."If we can't function, the whole cycle comes to a stop and then we cannot sustain ourselves. So, if at all, they're thinking of a second lockdown, we would urge them to reconsider their decision and take a much more long-term and pragmatic approach."Businesses, the economy and the virus have to co-exist. You can't manage and contain one at the cost of the other. It's not an either-or situation anymore. It has to be an 'and' situation," he added.Several films like "Haathi Mere Saathi" (Hindi version), "Bunty Aur Babli 2", and "Chehre" that were up for release in March and April have been pulled by the makers from the calendar due to uncertainty amid the pandemic.Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, RAI, told PTI that a lockdown would be a non-analytical and knee-jerk reaction."Because it means we have given up hope that we can control the situation, that in the last one year, we have not learnt anything new. So, this is a really non-tenable situation and who can survive."If retail does not get money, then the suppliers do not get money and if suppliers do not get money, then the factories cannot operate. And if the factories do not operate, then it has an overall effect all across the system. The government does not get taxes and the employment will also go down," Rajagopalan said.Mukesh Kumar, chairman and director on board, Shopping Centres Association of India, said the industry is already suffering because of the previous government decisions such as mandatory testing for the mall and reducing the timings."We are just recovering. We have reached almost 60 per cent of the footfall and 90 per cent of sales in March but then it started going downhill once the notification came about checking people coming to the mall and that they must have a negative RT PCR report... Then the second news came about reducing the timings, so these were all bad news."Let's hope that this doesn't happen because we will not be able to take another lockdown. Another shut down will be discriminatory only for the malls, theatres and F&B," Kumar told PTI.According to SCAI, they cater to just one per cent of the population and follow stringent safety protocols with malls ensuring that they don't have more than one person per square foot."If you look at the number of people in the mall, it is very limited. They are being monitored and you can't get a safer place than the mall where everything is controlled, monitored, reviewed and audited. You can't have this in markets, railway stations, airports or any other crowded place. In the event, any action is taken, the first casualty is the mall, theatres and the F&B," Kumar claimed.Despite the rising COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra, setting the alarm bells in the business community, Gianchandani is cautiously optimistic about the future provided theatres are allowed to operate in Maharastra, a crucial state for business."I remain confident as at this point, there is no change of dates as we speak. 'Sooryavanshi' is coming on April 30 and 'Radhe' is scheduled for May 12 or 13, depending on the Eid. So as we speak, these films are releasing on the dates that they have announced, but at the same time, the cases continue to worsen, there would be concerns."But firstly, I remain optimistic. I do think that government machinery and administration in districts are doing everything possible to contain the spike in cases. And my sense is they would be able to show results fairly quickly. So we remain quite optimistic that these films will release on time," Gianchandani noted.Unlike other countries where businesses were given subsidies on wages, soft loans and other such initiatives, businesses in India have been left to fend for themselves, which he said was understandable given India's resource crunch, but the cycle of recovery must not stop. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-cant-go-back-to-last-year-multiplex-retail-associations-urge-maharashtra-govt-to-avoid-lockdown-233240

The incident happened around 1:30 pm when the victim was seen moving alone on a two-wheeler in the area. The accused used a machete on the victim causing multiple injuries. Due to the manner in which the killing happened, police suspect it to be a revenge killing.The victim has been identified as Asad Khan, a resident of Mailardevpally in Rajendranagar division. Giving details, the police said Asad was travelling on a two-wheeler when a group of assailants attacked him on Shastripuram road.A video was recorded by an eyewitness, in which a youth can be seen using a machete to land blows on Asad, who was lying on the road bleeding. After the attack, the youth threw the machete and fled.R Sanjay Kumar, ACP, Rajendra Nagar, told the media that police suspected a personal enmity to be behind the murder.“We are in the process of verifying the CCTV footage. We have already received some crucial leads. Two teams have been formed to investigate the murder. In 2018, Asad Khan was involved in a murder of a person called Amjad Khan. It is likely that Amjad Khan’s people are behind this murder. The investigation is underway,” he said.Asad was moved to Osmania General Hospital by some good Samaritans, but the doctors declared him brought dead.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hyderabad-man-hacked-to-death-in-full-public-view-233238

01-04-2021||Joynagar/Uluberia (WB)||Modi makes Hindutva pitch in Bengal, slams TMC over antipathy for ‘chotiwalas’||Making a strong Hindutva pitch at the hustings in West Bengal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday attacked TMC leaders for calling those wearing saffron, sporting tilak and choti as “rakshas”, and declared he does not believe in “seasonal faith”.He also asserted a BJP wave was blowing across West Bengal where the party will win over 200 of the state’s 294 assembly seats.“Earlier, Mamata Didi had issues with chants of “Jai Shri Ram,” over immersion of Durga idols. Now TMC has problems with people wearing saffron, sporting tilak and choti (tuft of hair), they are calling them ‘rakshas’ (demons),” Modi told an election rally in Joynagar.He was referring to the recent public declaration by Banerjee of her “gotra” (clan), an unusual thing for the Bengal leader to do, during the campaigning for the Nandigram seat.The revelation had prompted Union Minister Giriraj Singh, who sports a choti, to ask,” Do you consider Rohingyas and other infiltrators as “Shandilya” (Banerjee’s gotra) and offer them the red carpet”.Singh’s comment invited a sharp retort from TMC MP Mohua Moitra.“Giriraj says Mamata’s from Rohingya clan. Proud of it. Far better than being from the chotiwala rakshasa clan,” Moitra tweeted.Singh often identifies himself as “Shandilya” on social media.Claiming that Mamata Banerjee’s exit from power is certain on May 2, the day votes will be counted, he said, “People of Bengal are not only participating in an election but are preparing the road for resurgence of the state.”     “Didi has to go,” he declared at another rally at Uluberia in Howrah district, claiming “the people of Nandigram have already fulfilled the dream”.“Read the writing on the wall...the people of Bengal will punish you in the elections,” Modi asserted, claiming that Banerjee is also aware of the fate that awaits her after the first phase of polling.The TMC chief is pitted against BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari, her one-time close aide-turned-foe in Nandigram, where an anti-land acquisition movement had catapulted her to power in 2011 and also placed Adhikari in an exalted position in state politics.Modi asked Banerjee to clarify whether there is truth in the rumour that she is going to file nomination for another seat in the last phase of election.“If you go anywhere else (to contest), the people of Bengal are prepared,” he said.The prime minister also hit back at the TMC for calling his Bangladesh trip unethical and violative of the model code of conduct for elections and defended his visits to temples there.The TMC had written to the Election Commission alleging that Modi’s recent visit to Bangladesh violated the model code of conduct in place for the West Bengal Assembly polls and some of his programmes there were “intended to influence the voting pattern” in certain constituencies.“I visited one of the 51 Shaktipeeth Jeshoreshwari Kali temple in Bangladesh. TMC has taken umbrage. Is it wrong to pay obeisance to Shri Harichand Thakur (founder of the Matua sect) at Orakandi?“I don’t believe in showing seasonal faith (shraddha).We always take pride in our faith and tradition,” he asserted.The Matuas, a Dalit community, wield considerable influence in several districts of West Bengal and can tilt the scales in favour of any party in quite a few seats in an election.He mounted a scathing assault on the TMC supremo for her accusations against “people of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh”.“You have taken oath of the Constitution which doesn’t permit you to speak against other states or people of other states,” he said, obviously referring to Banerjee’s claim that BJP has brought goons from UP and Bihar to influence the ouctome of the election in Nandigram.Taunting Banerjee for her decision to relinquish her Bhawanipore seat and contest from Nandigram, Modi said she is now realising that she committed a mistake.The prime minister said Banerjee’s appeal to 13 leaders of non-BJP parties to unite against the BJP stemmed from her anxiety over impending defeat.“She is seeking support from people who in her eyes are outsiders and tourists and whom she would not have the time to meet earlier,” Modi said.In Joynagar, the prime minister referred to the death of Sova Majumder, the octogenarian mother of a BJP worker who died days after being allegedly assaulted by TMC supporters.“Her face doesn’t go away from before my eyes. After such a crime and atrocity, Didi asks people to be cool. TMC is not cool, its ‘shool’ (a spike) that’s causing unbearable pain to the people of Bengal,” he said.Accusing Banerjee of pursuing appeasement politics, he said, “Illegal immigrants are your own, but you feel people of India are tourists and outsiders.

One COVID-19 patients can infect at least 400 people. Hence, there is no alternative to wearing mask, hygiene and social distancing," the senior health official said.Symptoms such as common cold, mild body ache and fatigue have emerged among patients and people tend to postpone their visit to a doctor when they notice these signs, he said."In the current situation, any such symptom should be treated as COVID-19 infection and medicines should be given accordingly," he said.Oak also alleged that the Centre was not providing enough support to undertake vaccination for all."There are some challenges in mass vaccination. We want permission for door-to-door immunisation. The state government is ready to implement it, but we cannot do it without the Centre's permission," he said.A sizeable population can't move outside their homes easily and such people can be inoculated at home, the official said, adding that the side effects of the vaccines are nothing compared to the protection they offer from the virus."There are reports that some states have started door-to-door vaccination, and Maharashtra should also be allowed to do so. The state should be able to vaccinate maximum population by June for better control on the virus and its spread," he said.Speaking about the line of treatment, Oak said, "Treating every symptom as COVID-19 and starting the treatment as soon as possible is the need of the hour."There have been cases where people with a common cold and mild body ache come to COVID-19 centres very late and succumb to the disease within a couple of days from the date of admission, he said."This means when they approach us, the infection has been spread widely," he added.When asked about the surge in infections in the state, he said, "It is true that the number of cases in Maharashtra is drastically increasing. Maharashtra is reporting the number of COVID-19 cases honestly, and hence, our figures appear high."Genome sequencing of samples in the state has been increased to ascertain the strain of the virus, he added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/one-covid-19-patient-can-infect-400-people-maharashtra-health-official-233227

It is dedicated to the welfare of villages, farmers, youths, poor and downtrodden,” he said.Naqvi said that the Modi government has worked effectively to ensure socio-economic empowerment of all needy, including minorities.Before 2014, a total of 3 crore minority students had been given scholarships while over 4.5 crore minority students have been given different scholarships after 2014. Only 20,000 people belonging to minority communities had benefitted through employment-oriented skill development before 2014, nearly 6.9 lakh of them benefitted through employment-oriented skill development programme after 2014, he noted.

01-04-2021||New Delhi||Novel technique for tracking eruptions from sun to be used in India's first solar mission||Scientists have developed a new technique to track the huge bubbles of gas, threaded with magnetic field lines, which are ejected from the sun disrupting space weather and causing geomagnetic storms, satellite failures, and power outages, the Department of Science and Technology said Thursday. The new technique will be used in India's first solar mission Aditya-L1.As the ejections from the sun, technically called Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), cause various disturbances of the space environment, forecasting their arrival time is very important. However, forecasting accuracy is hindered by limited CME observations in interplanetary space, the DST statement said.A software named Computer Aided CME Tracking Software (CACTus) based on a computer vision algorithm was so far used to detect and characterise such eruptions automatically in the outer corona where these eruptions cease to show accelerations and propagate with a nearly constant speed, it said.However, this algorithm could not be applied to the inner corona observations due to the vast acceleration experienced by these eruptions.This severely limited the capability to track the eruptions as CMEs accelerate in the lower corona. Moreover, with the advancement in space technology, there has been a tremendous increase in the amount of data obtained from spacecraft, according to the statement.Identifying and tracking solar eruptions in a huge number of images can become tedious if done manually, the statement said.A research led by Ritesh Patel, Vaibhav Pant, and Prof. Dipankar Banerjee from Aryabhatta Research Institute of observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital, an autonomous institute under the Department of Science and Technology, along with their collaborators from Royal Observatory of Belgium, has led to the development of an algorithm, CMEs Identification in Inner Solar Corona (CIISCO), to detect and track the accelerating solar eruption in the lower corona, the statement said.CIISCO has been successfully tested on several eruptions observed by space observatories, including Solar Dynamics Observatory and Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory, PROBA2/SWAP launched by NASA and ESA, respectively.The parameters determined by CIISCO are useful to characterise these eruptions in the lower corona, a region where the properties of such eruptions are less known.An implementation of CIISCO on the large volume of data available from space observatories mentioned above will be helpful to improve our understanding of eruptions in the inner corona.As India's first solar mission, Aditya-L1, will be observing this region of the solar corona, implementation of CIISCO on the Aditya-L1 data will provide new insight into the CME properties in this less explored region.The research was published in the Solar Physics journal. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/novel-technique-for-tracking-eruptions-from-sun-to-be-used-in-indias-first-solar-mission-233208
01-04-2021||Bengaluru||Indian researchers develop nanozymes that can block HIV reactivation||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) here have developed artificial enzymes that they said can successfully block reactivation and replication of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in the host's immune cells.Made from vanadium pentoxide nanosheets, these "nanozymes" work by mimicking a natural enzyme called glutathione peroxidase that helps reduce oxidative stress levels in the host's cells, which is required to keep the virus in check, an IISc statement said on Thursday.The study, published in 'EMBO Molecular Medicine, was led by Amit Singh, Associate Professor and Wellcome Trust-DBT India Alliance Senior Fellow at the Department of Microbiology & Cell Biology and Centre for Infectious Diseases Research (CIDR), and Govindasamy Mugesh, Professor at the Department of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry."The advantage is that the nanozymes are stable inside biological systems and do not mediate any unwanted reactions inside the cells," Mugesh said. "They are also quite easy to prepare in the lab."There is currently no way to eliminate HIV from a patient's body completely, according to the statement.Anti-HIV drugs are only successful in suppressing the virus; they fail at eradicating HIV from infected cells. The virus hides inside the hosts immune cells in a "latent" state and stably maintains its reservoir.When the levels of toxic molecules such as hydrogen peroxide increase in the host's cells, leading to a state of increased oxidative stress, the virus gets "reactivated" - it emerges from hiding and begins replicating again, it said.A few years ago, Amit Singh's team developed a biosensor to measure oxidative stress levels in HIV-infected immune cells in real-time, it was stated."We found that to come out of latency and reactivate, HIV needs very little oxidative stress," he said.One way to prevent reactivation is to keep the oxidative stress constantly low, which would "lock" the virus in a permanent state of latency.Enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase are essential for this process; they convert toxic hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. However, inducing the host cells to produce more quantities of these enzymes could disrupt the tightly regulated cellular redox machinery.Around the same time, Mugesh's group published a study showing that nanowires made of vanadium pentoxide can efficiently mimic the activity of glutathione peroxidase.Singh's lab, therefore, decided to collaborate with them.The researchers prepared ultrathin nanosheets of vanadium pentoxide in the lab and treated HIV-infected cells with them.The sheets were found to reduce hydrogen peroxide just as effectively as the natural enzyme and prevent the virus from reactivating."We found that these nanosheets were having some sort of direct effect where the expression of the host genes essential for virus reactivation is reduced," said Shalini Singh, first author and Research Associate at CIDR.When the team treated immune cells from HIV-infected patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART) with the nanozymes, latency was induced faster and subsequent reactivation was suppressed when therapy was stopped, indicating that combining the two was more effective, she added.Combining ART with the nanozymes also has other advantages.Some ART drugs can cause oxidative stress as a side effect, which can damage heart or kidney cells, Amit Singh said."Adding a nanozyme like this can help in reducing the side effects caused by such ART drugs." This can improve the quality of life of HIV patients undergoing treatment.Although the nanozymes were found to be harmless to normal cells in lab tests, Mugesh said further studies are needed to understand if they can have other effects once they are introduced inside the body."Where will they go? Which organs will they enter? How long will they stay in the body? We need to look at all these aspects," he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-researchers-develop-nanozymes-that-can-block-hiv-reactivation-233205

The unregistered ones can take the jabs from 3 pm to 9 pm. They just need to carry their Aadhaar card or any other valid identity proof, an official said.The third phase of the COVID-19 vaccination drive will span 192 health facilities, including 136 private hospitals in the national capital.The vaccines will be administered free of cost at government hospitals and health centres, while up to Rs 250 per dose will be charged at private health facilities.Dr Sahar Qureshi, Medical Superintendent, Max Smart Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, said, "We commenced with phase three of the vaccination drive. The footfall was lesser than expected (if we compare with March 1) since it was a working day. However, this will rise during the upcoming long weekend, starting Friday." "There are 10 vaccination centres being run here. We have enough vaccines in stock and can easily go up to 2,000 shots daily," she said.Apart from online registrations, the hospital is also taking walk-in beneficiaries and registering them on the spot, Qureshi said.At some vaccination centres, a rush of beneficiaries was witnessed, but at many other sites the response was moderate.On Wednesday, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain had said that 65 lakh eligible beneficiaries (aged above 45) will be given coronavirus vaccine at 500 sites, starting Thursday."We have enough vaccines available. The number of eligible beneficiaries is quite large. We will make efforts to complete the inoculation as soon as possible," he had said.According to North Delhi District Magistrate Isha Khosla, training has been imparted to ASHA and anganwadi workers, who will visit areas in their district, to encourage people to take the vaccine.Appointment for vaccination can be booked through the Co-WIN 2.0 portal. A mobile number cannot be used for making more than four registrations.People eligible for vaccination also have to carry their photo identity cards, including Aadhaar card and voter card.The city has seen a surge in case in the last two weeks.Delhi reported 1,819 coronavirus cases on Wednesday with a positivity rate of 2.71 per cent, while 11 more people succumbed to the infection. The number of cumulative cases on Wednesday stood at 6,62,430.

01-04-2021||New Delhi||COVID-19: Another session begins in Delhi, but schools still empty, students at home||Schools in Delhi moved to another academic session from Thursday, but campuses are still without the fragrance of new books and the myriad shades of new uniforms as students remain closed in view of the recent spike in COVID-19 cases.Schools here closed in March last year, just days ahead of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of novel coronavirus. Classes moved online last April, and they remain so this April as well. While the academic session at all government schools and few private schools began on Thursday, few schools have planned the resumption of classes from Monday, April 5. "We were hopeful that at least the new academic session will begin offline, and it will not be a story of students not getting to visit school, be with their classmates and be involved in activities that are not possible online. But with the cases rising again, that looks like a bleak possibility now," a Tagore International School teacher said, requesting anonymity.The Directorate of Education (DoE) had last month issued a circular asking all government schools to begin the new academic session from April 1 for students up to Class 9 online. It is yet to issue any such notification for private schools.Private schools say their is no clarity whether students of class 9 to 12 should be called to campuses, or the earlier directives allowing the same were only for students who are appearing for board exams next month."There are no clear guidelines yet whether academic session for senior classes has to be online or offline," said Jyoti Arora, the principal of Mount Abu Public School.When contacted, DoE officials said that for now the new academic session will have online classes for all grades. The earlier directive for classes 9 to 12 was to facilitate students to complete their practicals and prepare for board exams in May.Private schools including Springdales School, Delhi Public Schools, Tagore International, The Indian School, Birla Vidya Niketan, Bal Bharti Public School, among others, are continuing with online sessions for all classes.While schools were closed in all states from last April to September, few states started with partial reopening from October onwards. However, some of them have again started closing schools briefly in view of the surge in cases.In Delhi, the government had allowed schools to reopen for students in classes 9 to 12 for practical works and remedial lessons, from January 18 and February 5. Delhi reported 1,819 coronavirus cases on Wednesday with a positivity rate of 2.71 percent, while 11 more people succumbed to COVID-19.The caseload in Delhi on January 1 was over 6.25 lakh and the total fatalities were 10,557.The number of daily cases had started to come down in February. On February 26, the month's highest daily count of 256 cases was recorded.However, the daily cases began to rise again in March and have been steadily increasing. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-another-session-begins-in-delhi-but-schools-still-empty-students-at-home-233185

01-04-2021||Nandigram/ Kolkata||Mamata slams EC for inaction on poll complaints, threatens to move court||Heavy voting amidst sporadic violence marked the second phase of polling to the West Bengal Assembly, as Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee slammed the Election Commission over inaction to complaints filed by her party.Sporadic violence and minor clashes were reported from various constituencies, including the high profile Nandigram, where Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is locked in a high-stakes electoral battle with her former lieutenant Suvendu Adhikari now with the BJP.An agitated Banerjee slammed the Election Commission for not taking any action despite lodging several complaints and threatened to move court over it. Amongst the complaints were allegations of “booth capturing” and massive fake voting in Boyal.“We have lodged 63 complaints since morning. But not a single action has been taken. We will move court over it. This is unacceptable. The EC is working as per Amit Shah’s instructions,” she said while sitting outside booth number 7 in Boyal in Nandigram, where her partymen alleged many voters were unable to cast their ballot.“Goons from other states are creating ruckus here,” she said.Banerjee also rang up the West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to complain about the situation. Dhankar tweeted soon afterwards to state “Issues flagged @MamataOfficial a while ago on phone have been imparted (sic) to the concerned.”“We have recorded 58 per cent voter turnout recorded till 1 pm in the 30 seats where polling is underway for the second phase,” an Election Commission official said.The constituencies where polls are being conducted include nine seats each in Purba and Paschim Medinipur districts, eight in Bankura and four in South 24 Parganas. Strict adherence to COVID-19 protocols has been ensured in all places, officials said.Both Banerjee and Adhikari fanned out to various polling booths in Nandigram to take stock of the situation after reports of stray violence and booth ‘jamming ‘, a bid by workers of one party to crowd out voters from a polling booth by forming long queues.Surprisingly these incidents occurred despite Nandigram constituency being placed under Section 144 to contain possible violence.In the Boyal area in Nandigram, villagers alleged that BJP supporters had stopped them from going to the polling booths.As soon as Banerjee reached Boyal, BJP supporters greeted her with “Jai Shri Ram” slogans. Supporters of BJP and TMC allegedly indulged in violence, as TMC leaders demanded re-polling in booth number 7 of the village.Police and Rapid Action Force were rushed to the spot to control the situation, amidst incidents of alleged stone pelting.However, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh dubbed the allegations as baseless. “The allegations are baseless. It seems she has accepted the defeat,” he said.According to EC officials said they would look into the complaints. Around 57 per cent of electors exercised their franchise till 1 PM in the agrarian constituency in Purba Medinipur district, an Election Commission official said.A TMC election agent’s mother was seen pleading before the EC officials not to ask her son to go to the election booth and alleged that he has been “threatened last night by opposition parties”.Protesters also blocked the road in Nandigram’s Block 1, alleging Central forces stopped them from going to the polling stations. “The CRPF personnel accompanying Suvendu Adhikari stopped us from casting our votes,” a protester said.On the other hand, Suvendu Adhikari’s car, was attacked, and stones were pelted while he was visiting booths in the assembly constituency.Two separate stone-pelting incidents took place in Takapura and Satengabari in Nandigram. His vehicle was gheraoed at various locations as TMC supporters shouted slogans against the BJP leader. Security forces patrolling the area dispersed the mob.“I am used to such protests by TMC goons. They are all followers of Mamata begum (Mamata Banerjee). Let them do whatever they want till the results are out on May 2,” Adhikari told reporters.Meanwhile, BJP candidate from Keshpur assembly constituency Tanmay Ghosh’s vehicle was vandalised allegedly by the Trinamool Congress supporters, police said.Three persons have been arrested in connection with the incident, they said.More than 75 lakh voters will decide the fate of 191 candidates in the 30 constituencies for which voting ends at 6.30 pm.Meanwhile, protesters blocked the road in Nandigram’s Block 1, alleging, central forces stopped them from going to the polling stations. “The CRPF personnel accompanying Suvendu Adhikari stopped us from casting our votes,” a protester said.In the Gosaba area of South 24 Parganas, clashes were also reported between TMC and BJP supporters.While in the Mahisadal seat, the TMC alleged that BJP workers had stopped voters from going to the polling stations.

April 1-9, 2021,?for consultations on increasing climate ambition?..." the State Department said.Kerry will take part in a climate dialogue for the Middle East and North Africa hosted by Abu Dhabi on April 4, the UAE state news agency WAM said on Thursday.It said the Regional Climate Dialogue would provide a platform for countries to "unite around progressive, practical solutions" to help reach global climate goals.Kerry is leading efforts to get countries to commit themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by about the middle of the century.President Joe Biden has called a summit of 40 leaders including India and China on April 22-23.Later this year world leaders will gather for the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow to build on a 2015 Paris accord to halt the increase in global temperatures at levels that would avoid the worst impacts of climate change."Looking forward to meaningful discussions with friends in the Emirates, India, and Bangladesh on how to tackle the climate crisis," Kerry tweeted.India says it will not only stick to the Paris accord to reduce its carbon footprint by 33-35% from its 2005 levels by 2030 but will likely exceed those goals as it ramps up use of renewable energy. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-envoy-kerry-heads-to-india-to-try-and-lift-climate-ambition-233181

01-04-2021||New Delhi||Experts recommend scaling up capacity with pvt providers to contain 2nd COVID wave||As India begins vaccinating people above the age of 45 against COVID-19 from Thursday, experts have recommended speeding up the drive by scaling up capacity in collaboration with private providers to contain the rapidly increasing second wave.India is facing an increasingly severe and intensive situation in some districts, but the entire country is potentially at risk, the Centre said on Tuesday."All efforts to contain the virus and save lives should be taken," Dr VK Paul, Member NITI Aayog (Health) told reporters on Tuesday.  Dr Paul heads the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 and is a core member of the Centre's COVID-19 response team."The private sector needs to come forward and participate in the vaccination drive. We were told there are 20,000 private vaccination centres in the country. But less than 6,000 vaccination centres are being run by the private sector in India. We request the private sector to make the remaining vaccination centres functional and increase their number," he said.In the wake of the surging new cases, the Centre may be forced to recalibrate its vaccine diplomacy, Dr Girdhar Gyani, Secretary General, Association of Healthcare Providers- India (AHPI) said.There should be lesser exports till the time the Indian situation stabilises, he said."The government shall not take such a big chance at the moment as our country needs to be vaccinated at utmost priority."The private sector has created world-class systems and integrating continuous learnings on this. Hence we have urged the government to ramp up the vaccination strategy by leveraging the private sector's full strength and also urge the people of India to practice basic hygiene," said Dr Gyani.In India, the cases peaked in September after which they started declining and the per day cases were less than 9,000 in early February.The numbers started increasing exponentially again in March.Rajneesh Bhandari, Founder NeuroEquilibrium, said, "In India, our air-conditioning and cooling start during the summers and people stay and work in closed spaces. Thus, as the temperature increases, we are seeing the number of COVID cases increasing. COVID-19 has not spread much in rural areas because people are not living or working in closed spaces. However, the drive needs scale with the help of private providers." Bhandari said the spread of coronavirus is a very complex phenomenon, and science is still grappling with the multiplicity of parameters."Some parameters that may influence the spread include social distancing, proper use of masks, virus variants, temperature, humidity, vaccination, etc. Various studies have found an inverse correlation between temperature and the daily number of cases."One US study estimates that every one-degree increase in minimum temperature leads to a decrease in the cumulative number of cases by 0.86," added Bhandari. The second wave of COVID-19 in Europe and the US was much more severe than the first wave and peaked during winters when people stayed closed doors, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/experts-recommend-scaling-up-capacity-with-pvt-providers-to-contain-2nd-covid-wave-233175

Football is a popular sport in Assam. In football parlance, the people of Assam have shown the Congress-led alliance the red card," he said addressing an election rally in Kokrajhar.Modi alleged the Congress governments in the state and at the Centre did nothing to check violence in Bodo areas."In the long years of its rule, the Congress threw Bodoland into bomb, gun and blockade culture. The NDA gifted Bodoland peace and respect," he said.Targeting the Congress over its alliance with Lok Sabha MP Badruddin Ajmal's AIUDF, Modi said the main opposition party had surrendered before "tala-chabhi wale".Padlock and key are the election symbol of the AIUDF.Several top BJP leaders, including Union Home Minister Amit Shah, have accused Ajmal and his party of encouraging illegal immigration from Bangladesh, a hugely contentious and divisive issue in the north-eastern state."The Congress and its alliance will be punished for it. We will never allow them to loot the hard-earned peace," he asserted."Peace, progress and protection is our mantra for the Bodoland territorial region," he added.

He was made an approver in the case and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.

01-04-2021||Washington||Indian IT professionals to benefit as Biden lets Trump era H-1B visa ban expire||US President Joe Biden on Thursday let the ban on foreign workers visa, in particular H-1B, lapse as the notification issued by his predecessor Donald Trump expired, a move which is likely to benefit thousands of Indian IT professionals.Amidst a national lockdown and the COVID-19 crisis, Trump in June last year issued a proclamation that suspended entry to the US of applicants for several temporary or “non-immigrant” visa categories, including H-1B, arguing that these visas presented a risk to the US labour market during the economic recovery.On December 31, Trump extended the order to March 31, 2021, noting that an extension was warranted as the pandemic continued to disrupt American lives, and high levels of unemployment and job loss were still presenting serious economic challenges to workers across the US.Biden did not issue a fresh proclamation for the ban on H-1B visas to continue after March 31.He had promised to lift the suspension on H-1B visas, saying Trump's immigration policies were cruel.The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.The expiry of the Trump's proclamation would now result in the issuing of H-1B visas by American diplomatic missions overseas that would result in US companies bringing in talented technology professionals inside the country.No new proclamation was issued by Biden till Wednesday midnight, resulting in the automatic end to the ban on issuing of fresh H-1B visas.The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House would not renew a ban on H-1B and other work-based visas imposed last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that is set to expire on Wednesday.Meanwhile, a Republican Senator from Missouri on Wednesday urged Biden to issue a fresh proclamation to continue with the H-1B visa ban.“I write today to urge you to extend the freeze on temporary foreign worker entries into the United States that, without intervention, will expire today,” Senator Josh Hawley wrote in a letter to Biden.“The presidential proclamation suspending entry of certain temporary workers into the US has protected Americans suffering from the pandemic-induced economic crisis. With millions of struggling Americans out of work – and millions more desperate to make ends meet – now is not the time to open the floodgates to thousands of foreign workers competing with American workers for scarce jobs and resources,” he wrote.

Noting that the decline also took place on the economic participation and opportunity sub-index, albeit to a lesser extent, the report said India’s gender gap on this dimension widened by 3 per cent this year, leading to a 32.6 per cent gap closed till date.Most of the decline occurred on the political empowerment sub-index, where India regressed 13.5 percentage points, with a significant decline in the number of women ministers (from 23.1 per cent in 2019 to 9.1 per cent in 2021). “Among the drivers of this decline is a decrease in women’s labour force participation rate, which fell from 24.8 per cent to 22.3 per cent. In addition, the share of women in professional and technical roles declined further to 29.2 per cent. The share of women in senior and managerial positions also remains low: only 14.6 per cent of these positions are held by women and there are only 8.9 per cent firms with female top managers,” the report said.Further, the estimated earned income of women in India is only one-fifth of men’s, which puts the country among the bottom 10 globally on this indicator, it said.Discrimination against women is also reflected in the health and survival sub-index statistics.

Over 20,000 acres of prime defence land can now be used for upcoming ground-based missile storage, aviation, new raisings and even housing for troops.All its officers and workers have been redeployed within the Ministry of Defence. The future use of 20,000 acres has not been decided yet, sources said, maintaining the move to hand over the land to the Director General Defence Estates has not been okayed yet. As of now, the land is under the control of the Army.In February 1889, the British had set up first such farm to produce quality milk and 130 farms were opened later. Earlier, cantonments were largely isolated from towns and cities. But with rapid urban growth, most cantonments are now located within population clusters. The White Revolution of the 1970s changed everything. Milk availability is a non-issue now. For almost 20 years, India has been the largest producer of milk in the world.The original decision to close the Military Farms was taken in 2013 after a meeting of Army Commanders and the process had been on since.Military Farms are spread across Ambala, Jalandhar, Pathankot, Jammu, Srinagar, Kargil, Udhampur, Meerut, Ranikhet, Ahmednagar, Gwalior, Jabalpur, Secunderabad, Mhow, Jhansi, Dimapur, Guwahati, Jorhat, Panagarh, Kolkata, Agra, Prayagraj, Lucknow and Kanpur among others.These farms supplied 3.5 crore litre of milk annually.

Governments in Delhi, regardless of political colour, have been hostile to overseas bodies judging India’s human rights quotient. For instance, the report quoted the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances as listing seven cases. This US body has not been allowed access into India by the UPA and NDA governments since 2010.But of late, the US State Department has been noting the spread of issues such as unjustified arrests, censorship and restrictions.But the report also noted that separatist insurgents and terrorists in J&K, Northeast, and Maoist-affected areas committed serious abuses, including killings and torture of armed forces personnel and recruitment and use of child soldiers.The report also noted that the government continued taking steps to restore normalcy in J&K by gradually lifting some security and communications restrictions.‘Arbitrary killings, arrests’A US State Department country report on human rights practices in India has taken note of unlawful and arbitrary killings, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, restrictions on freedom of expression and the press, site blocking, excessive curbs on NGOs and widespread corruption.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-state-dept-report-flags-human-rights-abuses-in-india-232947

The GDP of other South Asian nations is also expected to grow — Bangladesh by 3.6 per cent, Nepal’s by 2.7 per cent and Pakistan’s by 1.3 per cent, said the World Bank days ahead of its spring meeting that will shape up the policy responses of Bretton Woods Institutions towards debt, climate, vaccines and economic recovery.The World Bank, however, sounded a warning on two fronts —growth was not just uneven, but it was also fragile.As economic activity is well below pre-Covid-19 estimates, businesses need to make up for lost revenue and millions of workers, most of them in the informal sector, still reel from job losses and falling incomes, said the World Bank’s twice-a-year regional update.The improved economic outlook reflects South Asian countries’ efforts to keep their Covid caseload under control and swiftly roll out vaccine campaigns, it noted.But the pandemic laid bare South Asia’s deep-seated inequalities and vulnerabilities, the report said, while recommending universal social insurance to protect informal workers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/world-bank-raises-indias-growth-forecast-to-10-1-232937

I was a volunteer at their homes in Delhi”, Gandhi said while narrating her experience as a volunteer at the sisters of Mother Teresa’s order. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-pm-mum-on-nuns-harassment-priyanka-gandhi-232936

Nandigram decides today||Kolkata, March 31Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee today wrote to 10 Opposition leaders, including Congress’ Sonia Gandhi, suggesting a get-together for chalking out a strategy to take on the BJP after the current round of Assembly polls.The strongly worded seven-point letter — sent on the eve of her battle with Suvendu Adhikari in Nandigram — said the time had come for a “united and effective struggle against the BJP’s attacks on democracy and the constitution” and “presenting a credible alternative to the people of India”.Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal CM ‘BJP wants to dilute powers of state govts’The BJP wants to make it impossible for non-BJP parties to exercise their constitutional rights and freedom. It wants to dilute the powers of state governments and downgrade them to mere municipalities.Starting with the controversial new law that gives more powers to Delhi’s Lieutenant-Governor, Mamata presented seven instances of what she called the BJP’s “assaults” on democracy and cooperative federalism.The list included misuse of the office of the Governor, central agencies like the CBI and ED, withholding states’ funds, disbanding bodies like the National Development Council and Planning Commission, using money power to topple non-BJP governments, privatisation of nation’s assets and deterioration in the relations between the states and the Centre.Besides Sonia, the letter was sent to NCP chief Sharad Pawar, DMK’s Stalin, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, YSR Congress chief Jagan Mohan Reddy, BJD chief Naveen Patnaik and others.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cm-mamata-banerjee-or-adhikari-nandigram-decides-today-232934

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is also Minister-in-Charge of Commerce and Textile, had approved the proposals put before the EEC.The imports are being framed as a necessity. Azhar said Indian sugar was currently the cheapest in the world and Indian cotton imports would bridge the raw material shortfall for the textile sector.The first signs of resumption of trade will bring relief to the region as well as the eco-system around Wagah that became a hostage to the rising tensions. Trade had begun declining even before Pakistan banned all trade with India on August 10, 2019, after the change in status of J&K. India retaliated a day later by imposing 200% duty on Pakistani trade.Pakistan had lifted the ban on import of medicines and raw material from India in May last year but today was the first biggest step in reversing the suspension of trade between the two countries.However, this is a symbolic gesture because the largest share of Indian exports to Pakistan is accounted for by polypropylene, reactive dyes, pharma and tea. Some of the items going through Wagah to Pakistan such as pharma and chemicals are manufactured in the region, which would get a fillip once trade of these items also resumes. It remains to be seen whether India will reduce the heavy duty on import of fresh fruits, cement, sesame seeds and gypsum, some of the main Pakistani items consumed here.On Tuesday, Imran Khan had replied to PM Narendra Modi’s greetings on Pakistan’s National Day and expressed the hope that both countries would be able to close the chapter of over five years of acrimony. Though both leaders kept up this civility even when tensions had peaked after Pulwama, their letters this time had centrally positioned the desire for peace. A few days earlier, the Indus Commissioners of both countries had met after over a year, in part because of Covid-related restrictions. However, there is no word on reopening of pilgrimage through the Kartarpur corridor.But a Pakistani sports team had travelled here to take part in an international competition after a long time. These rapprochement measures are undergirded by a surprise joint statement by military commanders from both countries on February 26 that decided to re-implement the ceasefire agreement on the border.India yet to take call on Pak goodsPakistan had banned trade with India on August 10, 2019, after the change in status of Jammu and Kashmir.
