18-04-2021||---||UAE had played a role in bringing India, Pakistan together: UAE diplomat||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 18Foreign Ministers of both India and Pakistan landed in Dubai on Sunday but both sides insisted they had left their countries at short notice to separately meet their UAE counterpart and no bilateral between them was planned.A senior UAE diplomat has owned up to his country’s role in brokering peace between India and Pakistan that began with a ceasefire along the line of control (LoC) in February. But the talks hit a hurdle after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan walked back on his decision to resume partial trade with India.UAE is the hub of the “bouncing trade” between India and Pakistan estimated at several billions of dollars every year. Goods that are prohibited from being traded between the two countries are sent to UAE where the label of origin is changed to satisfy both sides.India’s ties with the UAE had improved after the end of the cold war and have now progressed to the point where both sides are considering a defence relationship.  Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi’s visit was the first to be announced on Saturday. It was followed a few hours later by Jaishankar also announcing his visit. If that appeared like a coincidences, sources insisted it was not.Earlier UAE’s ambassador to the US Yousef Al Otaiba had said Dubai had played a key role “in bringing Kashmir escalation down and created a ceasefire, hopefully ultimately leading to restoring diplomats and getting the relationship back to a healthy level”.“They (India and Pakistan) might not sort of become best friends but at least we want to get it to a level where it is functional, where it is operational, where they are speaking to each other,” he had added.India always insists that all issues of discord with Pakistan are bilateral in nature and there is no scope for mediation. Jaishankar, while speaking extensively at the recent Raisina Dialogue, had skirted the issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uae-had-played-a-role-in-bringing-india-pakistan-together-uae-diplomat-240889

The Government of India will extend all possible support for COVID-19 vaccination which is an important strategy for mitigating the impact of the ongoing pandemic,” the official said.He said that the world’s largest vaccination drive currently underway in India has now completed three months wherein 12.26 crore doses have been administered to beneficiaries prioritised by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC).

Doctors declared the three brought dead, the DSP said adding the three persons were stated to have died of excessive bleeding.The police lodged a case under section 302 and 34 of the IPC against Balu Mogya, Hansraj Mogya (35) and two others of Tonk district.

He was waiting near the station to deliver a huge consignment of FICNs to his Delhi-based contact.“FICNs with a face value of Rs 8 lakhs in the denomination of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500 was recovered from his possession,” the officer said.Interrogation revealed that in 2018, while working as a mason at the house of a man named Nasruddin, Rahim was asked to deliver fake Indian currency notes to make easy money. He initially earned Rs 3,000 per delivery, the officer said.“Nasruddin used to collect FICNs from suppliers based near the Indo-Bangladesh border, who smuggled them from Bangladesh. After sometime, Rahim started accompanying Nasruddin for collecting FICN from the Indo-Bangladesh border.“They both collected several consignments of FICN from there and further supplied to their associates based in different parts of India during past three years. For the last few months, Rahim was getting Rs one lakh of FICN as his share on delivery of Rs eight lakhs or more to their different contacts,” Yadav said.During his visit to Bangladesh, Rahim also came in contact with a man named Tiku and started smuggling FICNs from him, he said. During the lockdown period, Nasruddin, Rahim and other members of their network could not smuggle FICNs. However, after the lockdown was over, both of them collected huge amount of FICN and supplied them with the help of their contacts in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and other parts of India, the officer said.

The health department confirmed that there was no vaccination was given on Sunday. If the state gets supplies of the vaccine, then it hopes to resume the vaccination on Monday. Most big hospitals in the state capital Hyderabad said they had so far not received any fresh consignment. Telangana Public Health Director Dr G Srinivasa Rao said that the state was experiencing a shortage of vaccine for the past two days. Addressing the media, Rao said that the state has administered around 28 lakh vaccine doses so far, of which around 25 lakhs were the first dose.   “We are able to vaccinate around 1.5 lakh people per day. By the end of June, all targeted population can be reached,” he said. The state government intends to vaccinate around 1 crore beneficiaries by the end of June.  The Public Health Director asked people to strictly follow COVID-19 protocol till June and to adhere to health department advisories.  Meanwhile, people continue to violate the COVID protocol by staying without masks, even as the state government has imposed a challan of Rs 1,000 on those found without masks. In Hyderabad after announcing all four-wheeler drivers to wear a mask even when alone, the police have started taking checking easy, reportedly under political pressure. In northern Telangana city of Nizamabad, sanitation workers were reportedly slapped and threatened by two men, who were asked to wear a mask. The incident was caught on video by another sanitation staff member, who was inside the municipal sanitation vehicle. But so far, no action has been taken against the culprits, which has greatly demoralised the sanitation workers. House owners have started putting up hoardings saying “Daya chesi maa intiki raakandi, me intiki raanivvakandi” (Please don’t come to our house, don’t allow us to come to yours). Such board have been seen in Padmashali colony in Hyderabad.  Telangana has recorded its the largest surge of Covid cases and fatalities since the pandemic started last year with authorities reporting 5,093 new cases and 15 fatalities in the past 24 hours.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shortage-forces-a-stop-in-telanganas-vaccination-drive-240868

Declined messages from ‘ATM Switch’ are altered to successful cash withdrawal transaction responses, and subsequently cash is withdrawn from the ATM. The attacker first inserts a device between the ATM machine and the router or switch in the ATM premises. This device has the capability to modify the responses back from authorisation host (ATM Switch) which is connected to ATM through network. The attacker then uses restricted cards (or blocked cards) to submit a withdrawal request.When the ‘ATM Switch’ sends a declined message, the attacker in the middle alters the response to approve the transaction and subsequently withdraws cash, the official said.In view of this modus operandi, the banks have been directed to ensure end-to-end encryption in the communication between the ‘ATM Terminal’ or PC and the ‘ATM Switch’, another official said.Network cables, input/output port within the ATM premises should be concealed and physically secured or protected, the banks have been told.A similar advisory has also been issued by the Reserve Bank of India.As per the information reported to and tracked by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), altogether 1,59,761 cyber security incidents pertaining to digital banking were reported in 2018, a total of 2,46,514 incidents in 2019 and 2,90,445 incidents were reported in 2020.These incidents include phishing attacks, network scanning and probing, viruses and website hacking.There has been a 46 per cent rise in digital transactions in 2019-20 in comparison to 2018-19.The Ministry of Home Affairs holds regular interactions with state governments and Union Territory administrations and advises them to expedite the disposal of cyber crime incidents, with a special emphasis on those relating to women and children, the official said.The CERT-In is the national technology arm to combat cyber attacks and guard the Indian cyber space.

We are ready to provide things like PPE kits and oxygen which will be needed. I also request you to deploy maximum medical infrastructure and manpower,” he said.The chief minister thanked the municipal corporations for the way they have handled crematoriums under their jurisdictions and hoped they will continue to do so.          “We will give you whatever else you require. If you have beds, we will ensure that the rest of it—PPE kits, oxygen cylinders and other things—are provided. So, if you can increase the number of beds that would be of immense help.”“We are preparing beds in Yamuna complex and in the commonwealth games village. But we need doctors and nurses to monitor patients,” Kejriwal said.The municipal corporations may spare their medical staff for the next 20-25 days and help the Delhi government overcome this wave, he said.           Delhi recorded 24,375 coronavirus cases on Saturday, the highest single-day spike since the pandemic began ravaging countries, and a record number of 167 deaths.Kejriwal said the current number of fresh cases is “extremely overwhelming” compared to mid-March when 100-150 COVID-19 positive cases were being reported daily.“Currently, the crisis is because of the rate at which the virus is spreading; 24,000 is a very big number. Beds are limited and it is natural that if such big numbers continue, a time might come when beds will not be available.“If this pace continues then within the next two to three days, we will face a shortage of beds and other facilities. In a way, this is a race against time,” he said.The chief minister warned that if the situation continues, the health system will reach a point of collapse where beds, oxygen and ventilators will not be able to meet the overwhelming demand.

18-04-2021||Tehatta (WB)||BJP leaders from outside campaigning in Bengal responsible for spike in COVID-19 cases: Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday said BJP leaders “from Delhi” who are bringing “outsiders” for campaigning without COVID-19 tests are responsible for the spike in coronavirus cases in the state.The Trinamool Congress supremo also blamed the Election Commission (EC) for curtailing her campaigning time, for the ongoing assembly polls, by five days while turning a blind eye to her plea to club the last three phases of the polls in the wake of the surge in coronavirus cases.“Leaders from Delhi are bringing in outsiders infected with the virus during campaigning without bothering to conduct COVID-19 tests.“I am not saying being infected with the virus is a crime. But the reckless act of the BJP has triggered the sudden rise in the number of coronavirus cases in recent times,” the chief minister said.Claiming that a BJP candidate in Howrah district went on campaigning despite being infected by the virus, Banerjee asked “Why couldn’t he sit at home and desist from campaigning?”“Our party never takes such a risk,” she added.Alleging that the EC is showing an “unfavourable attitude” towards her, the chief minister said: “Earlier they had taken away an entire day of my campaigning. Now in the last three phases, it has curtailed campaign time by 4 days”.“As a result, I will not be able to address 20 meetings in south Bengal districts,” he said.Cautioning people against allowing “outsiders to occupy Bengal”, the TMC supremo said: “This election is for saving the honour of the womenfolk of Bengal and safeguarding the integrity of the state”.Reminding the electorate that she did not allow the National Population Register (NPR) exercise in Bengal, she said: “Remember your vote is important to prevent them (BJP) from coming to power, to prevent them from introducing NPR, National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)”.“When people protest against misdeeds and oppression, the BJP instigates firing and kills people. BJP only knows to loot, instigate riots and kill people,” Banerjee alleged.Wishing people on the occasion of the approaching Annapurna Puja, Basanti Puja, Ramnavami, and Ramadan, she chanted ‘Chandi shlokas’ and then wished members of the Muslim community.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-leaders-from-outside-campaigning-in-bengal-responsible-for-spike-in-covid-19-cases-mamata-240850

18-04-2021||Patna||Jail release likely on Monday but Lalu to return home from Delhi hosp after recovery: Family||RJD president Lalu Prasad, who is likely to walk out of jail on Monday having secured his bail in the multi-crore-rupees fodder scam cases, will, however, take time to return home as treatment for his various ailments is still underway at AIIMS Delhi.Supporters of the RJD, after getting to know about his bail, had been busy making preparations to greet him on his arrival, but Prasad's family clarified that he would return only after full recovery.The Jharkhand High Court granted bail to Prasad in the Dumka treasury case on Saturday, noting that he has already served half the tenure of his sentence, and paved the way for his release from jail after 39 months and 25 days.Prasad's younger son and political heir apparent Tejashwi Yadav wished the former chief minister a speedy recovery, and said that his treatment, as of now, will continue at AIIMS Delhi.He is a diabetic and suffers from heart ailments, kidney infection and breathing problems, Yadav pointed out, adding that he and other family members are in touch with the doctors attending to him.Sources close to Prasad said the RJD supremo, on hearing about the Jharkhand High Court bail order, maintained that he had always had faith in the country's judicial system.His wife Rabri Devi, a two-time chief minister, and daughter Misa Bharti, who is a Rajya Sabha MP, met him in Delhi on Saturday. Prasad has seven daughters and two sons.Bharti's younger sibling Ragini, who had earlier announced that she is observing Ramzan and 'chaiti' puja, said her prayers have been answered.The RJD leader's lawyer, Devarshi Mandal, had told PTI on Saturday that he will move a special CBI court in Ranchi after it opens on Monday to seek his release.The central investigation agency had been probing the fodder scam cases.Asked about the release procedure, Mandal said that an application has been sent to Prasad for his signature, which will then be submitted to a CBI court on Monday along with a copy of the high court order.Prasad need not appear in person before the CBI court, he explained.An order will be duly sent by the CBI court to Birsa Munda Jail in Ranchi, where Prasad was originally sent after his conviction in the fodder scam cases, Mandal said.Authorities at Birsa Munda jail will forward necessary papers to Tihar jail in the national capital, where Prasad was subsequently shifted, to ensure his release, he stated.All formalities are expected to be completed expeditiously and the release, most likely, will be secured on Monday, the lawyer added.      Earlier, Prasad had acquired bail in three other fodder scam cases pertaining to Deogarh, Chaibasa and Ranchi's Doranda treasuries. He was waiting for the court's verdict in the Dumka case.The high court, while granting the RJD supremo bail, directed him to submit his passport and not leave the country without permission.It also instructed him not to change his address and mobile number during the bail period.The court further ordered him to deposit Rs 5 lakh each as penalties in two cases—one under an IPC section and another under the Prevention of Corruption Act—and two sureties of Rs 1 lakh each.Prasad, who has also served as the railway minister from 2004 to 2009, was airlifted to AIIMS, Delhi on January 24 in view of his ill health.The Rs 950-crore fodder scam had taken place in the animal husbandry department when Prasad was the chief minister of undivided Bihar.The RJD boss was sent to jail on December 23, 2017 following his conviction in the Deogarh treasury case. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jail-release-likely-on-monday-but-lalu-to-return-home-from-delhi-hosp-after-recovery-family-240843

18-04-2021||New Delhi||Delhi govt requests railways to deploy COVID-care coaches at two station||The Delhi government has urged the railways to arrange up to 5,000 beds by deploying COVID-care coaches at the Shakur Basti and the Anand Vihar stations in view of the rising number of coronavirus cases in the national capital.Over 25,000 new COVID-19 cases have been reported in Delhi and the positivity rate has increased to nearly 30 per cent in the last 24 hours, according to data shared by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.He also said that less than 100 ICU beds are vacant in Delhi hospitals, and the situation is worsening every moment.  In a letter to Railway Board Chairman Suneet Sharma, Delhi Chief Secretary Vijay Kumar Dev said there has been a tremendous increase in COVID-19 cases in the national capital in the recent past, resulting in high number of serious cases requiring treatment in hospitals. "In the GNCTD (Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi), as of now, the facilities at government and private hospitals available are getting strained and there is an urgent need for more number of COVID bed facilities to cope up with the ever increasing demand of COVID-19 patients who require admissions in hospitals," he said. "I therefore, request you to kindly arrange COVID bed facilities at the Anand Vihar and the Shakur Basti railway stations with full logistical support, requisite medical and paramedical staff and oxygen facilities etc. on an emergent basis," Dev said. Further, it would be grateful if the railways identifies more such facilities "up to a level of 5,000 beds, as was done last year, so as to meet the huge demand of beds arising out of an ever increasing surge in positive cases this time in the NCT of Delhi," he said in the letter dated April 17.Last year, the railways had deployed 813 coaches with 12,472 beds in July—Delhi (503), Uttar Pradesh (270) and Bihar (40).However, most of these coaches were not used and complaints were raised about the heat and mosquitoes inside them. According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare guidelines, the responsibility of maintaining the coaches will be shared by the railways and the state government.The national transporter will be responsible for the basic infrastructure and maintenance of the premises like cleaning and sanitisation of platforms, providing housekeeping materials such as linen and blankets, management of bio-toilets, power and electric supply arrangements, watering, communication facilities and signage and marking of different areas, it said. It will also provide catering and oxygen cylinders in the coaches.The Railway Protection Force (RPF) will provide security on station premises and the platform area where the coaches have been placed, the ministry stated in the guidelines. The district administration will be responsible for refilling oxygen cylinders, waste disposal, catering, doctors and paramedical staff, ambulance and overall supervision. These railway coaches can be used for very mild cases that can be clinically assigned to COVID care centres, it said.These modified coaches for coronavirus patients have been divided into eight bays or 'cabins' with each having 16 beds. Every coach has three toilets—one western and two Indian style—and a bathroom with hand showers, buckets, mugs and bathroom stools.The coaches also have mosquito nets, bio-toilets, power sockets and oxygen cylinders. Space has been created in these coaches to hold IV fluid bottles and extra bottle holders, and clamps have been provided to hang them. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-govt-requests-railways-to-deploy-covid-care-coaches-at-two-station-240837

I would advise all political leaders to think deeply about the consequences of holding large public rallies under the current circumstances.”He advised all other politicians to think about the consequences of holding large public rallies.

18-04-2021||New Delhi||Thank you for sparing time for COVID amidst urgent war to conquer Bengal: Chidambaram’s dig at Modi||Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Sunday took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, thanking him for sparing “a little time” amidst the “urgent war to conquer West Bengal”, to review the coronavirus situation in the country.He also criticised the Prime Minister for his “Didi O Didi” remark, asking if this is the manner in which the Prime Minister should refer to a chief minister.“Thank you Prime Minister for sparing a little time for Covid amidst the urgent war to conquer WEST BENGAL and annexe it to the BJP’s empire,” Chidambaram said on Twitter.His remarks came after Modi chaired a COVID-19 review meeting with government officials on Saturday, amid a big surge in infection cases in the country, with over 2 lakh cases being reported everyday for the past four days.Referring to the PM’s remarks on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Bannerjee, the Congress leader asked, “Is this the manner in which a prime minister should refer to a chief minister?”         “I cannot imagine a Jawaharlal Nehru or a Morarji Desai or a Vajpayee speaking that language,” he said.In another tweet, Chidambaram said while “no vaccine” boards hang on the doors of most hospitals, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan claims that “there is no shortage in the supply of vaccines”.“Believe the minister, there is no shortage of vaccines, oxygen, Remdesivir, hospital beds, doctors and nurses. There is only a shortage of patients!,” he said, taking a dig at the health minister.The former Union minister alleged the central government which assumed all powers and authority, failed to ensure adequate production and supply of COVID-19 vaccines.“Central government is solely responsible for the catastrophe faced by the nation,” he said after the prime minister’s review meeting on Saturday.The spread of the infection can only be contained with massive vaccination, he noted.Tragically, vaccines are in short supply and states have run out - or are running out - of vaccines, Chidambaram claimed.“Media is reporting that PM said ‘we defeated Covid last year, we can do it again’, WRONG. Covid was not defeated in 2020. Covid exacted a heavy toll and waned on its own, no thanks to the central government, because the central government did little or nothing,” he said in another tweet on Saturday.

Why didn't the government wake up even after deaths in Bhopal, Indore, Ujjain, Sagar, Jabalpur, Khandwa, Khargone due to shortage of oxygen? After all, how long will deaths continue due to lack of oxygen in the state?Terming the situation as scary, Nath also said there was a shortage of Remdesivir injections used in the treatment of coronavirus, and alleged that the key anti-viral drug and oxygen were available only on paper and not in reality.The state government has not yet reacted to the Shahdol incident.According to the state's health bulletin, 142 fresh cases of the viral infection were detected in Shahdol on Saturday, taking the caseload in the district to 4,528.Till Saturday, the district reported 38 fatalities due to the infection since the pandemic began.

18-04-2021||New Delhi||Amid raging second COVID-19 wave, the elderly battle loneliness and anxiety||For 72-year-old Rehana Sarin her two-bedroom flat in a Noida high-rise has been her "world" since her husband passed away 15 years ago, but she has never felt more lonely and secluded before as in the months following the coronavirus outbreak."I have taken the vaccine, but I know I am still susceptible to the disease. The way the coronavirus is spreading, and in view of my age, I have kind of locked myself in my flat. Earlier too, I was not going out much," said Sarin.Dependent on her neighbours and friends for her groceries, medicines and other requirements, she asked," How long can I be dependent on them like this." "My husband left me a two-bedroom apartment which has been my world ever since he passed away. I have a good neighbourhood in which I have friends, their children and grandchildren. But I cannot be dependent on them all the time for essentials," said Sarin, who feels more anxious by the day as cases rise across the country.On Sunday, health ministry data showed, a record single-day rise of 2,61, 500 cases. The data for Uttar Pradesh's Gautam Budh Nagar district, in which Noida falls, on Saturday showed 402 new cases.The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly difficult for people like Sarin who have been living independently and are elderly. Besides being highly susceptible to the virus, their old age has also made it difficult for them to commute and socialise, adding to their loneliness and anxiety."Though I manage to get essential items, it is the loneliness and anxiety that has been really bothering me," said Sarin, who became eligible for anti-coronavirus vaccination last month after the health ministry said people aged 45 and above account for about 88 per cent of all COVID-19 deaths in India making them the most vulnerable section of society.The septuagenarian said, "I am not very tech savvy but I learnt to buy basic items online." However, she said she fears that those delivering her order could be a carrier of the virus. "Even delivery of essential items makes me anxious," Sarin said.According to NGOs, there are around 25 million elderly who live independently in India.The situation for elderly couples is no different from those staying alone, and Rajesh Singh, 66, who has been living with his 61-year-old wife Sudha in west Delhi, said, "It feels like our life stopped in 2020." "We try our best not to step out, and whenever we have to, we take proper precautions, but (since last year) it has been very depressing. After the first wave ( of the coronavirus) subsided, we thought normalcy will return in some time but now with the second wave there seems to be no end in sight," said Singh, whose children stay abroad. Sudha said despite all precautions she fears that they will contract the infection."The very thought has been giving me sleepless nights. Moreover, we are at such an age that we need regular health check-ups but that has been very difficult too. The coronavirus pandemic feels like being caught in an endless cycle of despair," she said.Archana Sinha, 65, a resident of Mayur Vihar in Delhi, said she hardly speaks to anyone."It is after 3-4 days that I am speaking to someone. I have been living alone since 2010 but have never felt this lonely," said Sinha, who has been living alone since her mother passed away."Before the coronavirus, I had a good support system of friends and neighbours but now we are scared to meet. We used to talk over phone but that also gradually reduced," she said.Sinha said her old age and co-morbidities make her highly vulnerable to the infection and for that she got vaccinated."But the fear of COVID still remains and more than that it is the gloominess all around that has been daunting. It feels like people of our age now have nothing to look forward to," she said.NGOs working with the elderly said a lot of senior citizens especially those living alone have been battling depression, anxiety and a sense of abandonment since the onset of COVID-19 and the situation worsened during the second wave.Himanshu Rath, founder chairman of Agewell Foundation, said about 25 million old people live alone in India and a larger number of them are women who are widows.Rath said mental health of old people is a bigger issue during the coronavirus pandemic."Old people have invested a lifetime into their present lives and they feel that now that I have retired and will live comfortably, but now corona has hit them," he said. "They first thought that it is getting over but now it has come back in a big way so now every old person is thinking that the world is coming to an end and all their dreams of the last 60-70 years are crashing down which is leading to a sense of depression and anxiety and abandonment," Rath said.He said that another problem is that all of them are now extremely concerned about their children too, "thinking what will happen to them in view of the pandemic". "They are also worried for their grandchildren who are very young, so they worry a lot. This applies more sharply to those living all alone, they are more desperate because they have no one to communicate with," he told PTI.Rohit Prasad, CEO, Helpage, said there is a need for having a very specific approach towards elderly who are living alone and the government has got the system going but the last mile organisation support is what matters."Even during the COVID relief phase the civil rights organisations came for that connection (last mile). On our helpline, we are getting many calls just to understand things and the biggest fear is that if something happens, who will take care of me," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-raging-second-covid-19-wave-the-elderly-battle-loneliness-and-anxiety-240800
18-04-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||'Telling their 22-year-old son died, lying to patients': Delhi doctor talks about 'horrors' of 2nd COVID wave; urges to 'wear masks'||The ongoing pandemic has been extremely challenging for all of us, especially the medical workers. A heartbreaking post shared by a young doctor has left social media in tears.  Dr Saandhra Sebastian, an anaesthesiologist from New Delhi, recently took to Instagram, to talked about the horrors and woes working during the pandemic.  She revealed how difficult the past two weeks have been amid the second COVID wave. The young doctor highlighted that even though they are witnessing pain every minute—instead of breaking down—they are forced to carry on their duties. "To the very few who'll take the pains to read this, I want to give you a glimpse of the past two weeks of my life... I've been telling people that their 22 year old son has died, lying to patients, telling them theek ho jaoge, when I know to my bones vo theek nhi honge..., hearing breathless women crying allah allah in anguish all night, watching people break down in front of me... the last words of one of our patients before my friend intubated her was that she has an 11 and 4 year old at home, not to let her die (she died), telling children that they may not get their mother's body, mother's standing before us with folded hands asking us to save their childrens' lives, looking at packed bodies and telling myself to stop thinking and go on with my work… Working as hard as I can wishing other healthcare workers would do the same for my parents if they were to be hospitalized with covid… Coming back from my duty and crying about all of that I am forced to do/forced to watch… Crying about how I could have been a little more patient and a lot more loving to people who are suffocating to their deaths.. (6 hours in PPE all the while anxious about being exposed, anxious about dying just like our patients does not exactly leave you the sweetest person). To think that the pain I feel as a spectator is not even a quarter of the pain that our patients/their relatives feel.My overthinking has reached heights where I ask myself if I should tell my folks that I do not wish to be intubated if I were to die of covid. Trust me your lockdowns are not difficult…You haven't seen the horrors we see… I wish I could show you videos of the pain I see, just to scare everyone enough for you to stay inside…Saying that it's difficult is the understatement of the century... I do not want to see this pain... None of us do. Do not put us through this.Do us a favor, I am not asking you to stay home, I understand that not everyone has the luxury to do that... Just wear your masks when you are out…," read her post.A post shared by Saandhra (@_saandhra_)  The post comes when the nation is reporting over 2 lakh coronavirus cases. Her post went viral on all social media platforms. She insists on being careful, follow protocols, and easing the pressure on healthcare workers. Several doctors said the post resonated with them, while some thanked doctors for their service also asking them to take care.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telling-their-22-year-old-son-died-lying-to-patients-delhi-doctor-talks-about-horrors-of-2nd-covid-wave-urges-to-wear-masks-240796

18-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai cops grill pharma director over ‘excess’ Remdesivir stock; BJP fumes||Mumbai police questioned a pharma company director over alleged excess stock of the Remdesivir drug and allowed him to leave after he produced necessary documents, a police official said on Sunday.“He had stocked at least 60,000 vials. The state and central governments had allowed him to sell the stock, originally meant for export, in the domestic market due to scarcity of the drug used to treat coronavirus patients,” the police official said.The opposition BJP in Maharashtra objected to the pharma executive’s grilling by Mumbai police, saying the Shiv Sena-led government in the state was playing politics amid the pandemic.“Four days ago we had requested Bruck Pharma to supply us Remdesivir but they couldn’t until permission was given. I spoke to Union minister Mansukh Mandaviya and we got FDA’s permission,” former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said.The BJP leader claimed that a Maharashtra minister’s officer on special duty called the pharma executive and asked him how he could provide Remdesivir on the appeal of opposition parties.The pharma executive was picked up from his house on Saturday night by 10 policemen, Fadnavis said, describing the action as “beyond his imagination”.The Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Assembly said the state government was harassing the Daman-based pharma as BJP leaders approached him for the supply of the antiviral medication to the state.“We (BJP leaders) had contacted Bruck Pharma to supply the stock to Maharashtra as the state is facing a shortage of Remdesivir vials. We even informed the state FDA minister about it and approached the Union government seeking necessary permissions.”  Some Maharashtra BJP leaders went to Daman recently to meet Bruck Pharma officials, requesting them to sell their exportable stock in Maharashtra, Fadnavis said.“They were told by the company that if the Centre and state government approve, they will sell their entire stock to Maharashtra,” Fadnavis said.A senior Mumbai police official said, “A director of a pharma company, which supplies Remdesivir, was questioned by the police in connection with the stock of the vials.”  “Based on specific information, police held the pharma company director at Vile Parle,” he said.After export was banned, he had stocked up at least 60,000 vials of the drug. The state and central government has allowed him to sell it in the (domestic) market, he said.“As we found he did not violate any laws, we did not take any legal action against him. He was questioned about the stock, following which he produced necessary documents,” the official said.The political slugfest started on Saturday morning when Maharashtra minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik alleged the Centre was pressurising some Remdesivir producers to not sell their stock in Maharashtra.Joining state BJP leaders, two Central ministers hit back at the Maharashtra government, calling these allegations “a lie” and termed them an attempt to politicise the pandemic.Fadnavis said, “Malik and some ministers have nothing to do with the troubles of people suffering from coronavirus pandemic. They are more interested in indulging in politics.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-cops-grill-pharma-director-over-excess-remdesivir%C2%A0stock-bjp-fumes-240771
18-04-2021||New Delhi||Goyal slams Thackeray over oxygen, Remdesivir supply||A vicious war of words erupted today between the BJP-led Centre and the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra over the supply of medical oxygen and Remdesivir to the state, with the two accusing each other of propagating “half-truths, lies and falsehoods” and being inept at handling the situation.Maharashtra Cabinet Minister Nawab Malik also alleged that the Centre had asked 16 export companies “not to supply” Remdesivir to the state. Terming it a “dangerous precedent”, Malik said the state government would have no choice but to seize the stock of Remdesivir from these exporters and supply to the needy. Meanwhile, reports quoting CMO sources claimed that when CM Uddhav Thackeray called the PMO for an urgent supply of medical oxygen and Remdesivir, “he was told that PM is in Bengal and will contact him when he is back”. Union Minister Piyush Goyal said, “Maharashtra is suffering from an inept and corrupt government and Centre is doing its best for the people.” He said Maharashtra had so far received the highest quantity of oxygen in the country.“The government has diverted all available oxygen from industrial to medical use. In the review meet, the PM said the Centre and states should work in synergy in this crisis,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/goyal-slams-thackeray-over-oxygen-remdesivir-supply-240526

Explaining the release procedure, Mandal said, they had sent an application to Prasad for his signature which would be submitted to the CBI court here on Monday along with the HC order.“Since his signed application will be there so Prasad need not appear in person before the CBI court,” he said.

Senior BJP leader Swapan Dasgupta, who led the delegation to the CEO office, said he had apprised Aftab of the conversation that apparently took place between Banerjee and the TMC’s Sitalkuchi nominee, and pointed out that it could lead to untoward situations in the next three phases of the Assembly elections. PTIIn the clip, allegedly made viral by the BJP, Banerjee is heard telling Partha Pratim Roy, TMC candidate from Sitalkuchi, that an FIR must be filed in connection with the deaths and family members of the slain men should do it. A lawyer should be consulted for this purpose so that the in charge of the central forces deployed at the polling booth and also the SP of Cooch Behar could be named in the FIR.At Asansol, Prime Minister Narendra Modi broached the subject of the leaked audio tape featuring Mamata’s conversation with Roy and remarked that he was aware of the Bengal CM’s reputation of doing politics over corpses.“The death of four persons in firing was tragic. But ‘Didi’ wanted to politicise the deaths. How far can you go for your vote bank politics, Didi?” Modi asked. Mamata did not deny the authenticity of the taped conversation. Speaking at a rally in Katwa, she claimed that there was nothing new in the audio tape as she had already announced on April 10 (when the firing took place) that she would visit the affected families the following day. She failed to go there the next day owing to the EC order making the area out of bounds for politicians for 72 hours, she said.The CM, however, objected to the tapping of her phone. “How dare you intercept phone conversation of a Chief Minister,” she said, adding that she had ordered a CID probe into the matter. Even Modi would not be spared, the TMC supremo said. The BJP submitted a memorandum to the CEO, alleging that the tape was released by TMC insiders.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/audio-clip-war-erupts-in-bengal-240530

The verdict came from a Bench headed by Justice UU Lalit which said recovery of a banned substance from a private vehicle parked on a public road wouldn’t be covered under Section 43 of the NDPS Act – the provision used for recovery of the banned substance.However, such cases can be covered under Section 42 of the Act, the Bench said allowing an appeal against an order of the Punjab and Haryana High Court that had upheld the conviction and sentence awarded to the accused under the NDPS Act. While Section 43 of the NDPS deals with the power of seizure and arrest in a public place, Section 42 gives a designated officer powers of ‘entry, search, seizure or arrest’ in a suspected narcotics case.Two bags of poppy straw were recovered from the accused while they were sitting in a jeep at a public place at Rori-Jatana road in Haryana. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pvt-vehicle-not-a-public-place-under-ndps-act-supreme-court-240570

Keeping the surging COVID 19 in view, we have concluded the ritual of immersing the Gods to mark the conclusion of the Kumbh,” Giri said on Twitter.Giri’s announcement came hours after the PM posted details of his appeal to the saints on Twitter.“Spoke to Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Avdheshanand Giri ji and enquired about the health of the saints. The saints are cooperating in every way with the administration. I have requested them to now keep the Kumbh symbolic since two shahi snans have already concluded. This will strengthen the battle against COVID 19,” said the PM, urging that the Mela be concluded now.Over 3,000 saints attending Kumbh tested positive in recent days with experts warning the government of a massive super spreading potential of the congregation that left one prominent religious leader dead.Top government sources said health experts had warned of the pandemic blowing over if religious and election congregations continued the way they are going.Earlier this week, the Niranjani Akhara and the Tapo Sidhi Anand Akhara had announced that they are concluding the Kumbh rituals.With Juna Akhara too pulling out, three of the 13 Akharas attending the Kumbh have now called off the festivities in the wake of a surging COVID virus.Kumbh was always feared as a potential super spreader event.The fears that it could blow over in terms of infections have grown further in recent days with the Lancet reporting that super spreader events were the prime movers of the pandemic across the world. भारत की जनता व उसकी जीवन रक्षा हमारी पहली प्राथमिकता है। #कोरोना महामारी के बढ़ते प्रकोप को देखते हुए हमने विधिवत कुम्भ के आवाहित समस्त देवताओं का विसर्जन कर दिया है। #जूनाअखाड़ा की ओर से यह कुम्भ का विधिवत विसर्जन-समापन है।@narendramodi @AmitShah@ANI @z_achryan @TIRATHSRAWAT pic.twitter.com/rOUaqL1egU||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-surge-juna-akhara-ends-kumbh-rituals-after-pms-nudge-240434

These remarks assume significance in the backdrop of reports of COVID-19 patients and their families accusing the authorities in several states of apathy in providing treatment.Modi said there is no substitute for ‘testing, tracking and treatment’, and that early testing and proper tracking remain key to reducing mortality.“Together India had defeated COVID-19 last year and India can do it again, with the same principles but faster speed and coordination,” he said.Directing officials to ensure close coordination with states, he said all necessary measures must be taken to ramp up the availability of hospital beds for COVID patients and that additional supply of beds through temporary hospitals and isolation centres should be ensured.He also spoke about a need to utilise the full potential of India’s pharmaceutical industry to meet the rising demand of various medicines and reviewed the status of the supply of Remdesivir and other medicines.On the issue of vaccination, the prime minister directed all officials to make efforts to utilize the entire national capacity, in the public as well as the private sector, to ramp up vaccine production.Later in a tweet, Modi said, “Reviewed preparedness to handle the ongoing COVID-19 situation. Aspects relating to medicines, oxygen, ventilators and vaccination were discussed. Like we did last year, we will successfully fight COVID with even greater speed and coordination.”The meeting came in the midst of a huge surge in COVID-19 cases across the country with reports pouring in from many states about the shortage of hospital facilities and essentials like oxygen supply.The prime minister has been holding meetings with chief ministers and officials on a regular basis to discuss the situation and take measures to curb the pandemic.A record single-day rise of 2,34,692 cases and 1,341 fatalities have pushed India’s COVID-19 tally to 1,45,26,609 and the death toll due to the viral disease to 1,75,649, the health ministry said earlier on Saturday.The number of active coronavirus cases in the country has also surpassed the 16-lakh mark, the ministry’s data updated at 8 am showed.Registering a steady increase for the 38th day in a row, the tally of active COVID-19 cases has climbed to 16,79,740 in the country, accounting for 11.56 per cent of its total caseload, while the national COVID-19 recovery rate has dropped to 87.23 per cent.In the meeting, Modi was joined by Cabinet Secretary, Principal Secretary to PM, Union Home Secretary, Union Health Secretary and the Pharmaceutical Secretary, among others while Dr V K Paul, Member, Niti Aayog, was also present.An official statement said Modi was briefed on actions taken to address the issue of the availability of Remdesivir.“Through the efforts of the government, capacity and production augmentation for manufacturing of Remdesivir has been ramped up to provide around 74.10 lakh vials/month in May while the normal production output in January-February being just 27-29 lakh vials/month,” it noted.Supplies have also increased from 67,900 vials on 11th April going up to over 2,06,000 vials on 15th April 2021 which are being particularly focused on states with high caseload and high demand, it added.Modi took note of the ramped-up production capacity and directed that issues relating to real-time supply chain management to states.The prime minister directed that the use of Remdesivir and other medicines must be in accordance with approved medical guidelines and that their misuse and black marketing must be strictly curbed.On the issue of the supply of medical oxygen, Modi directed that the installation of approved medical oxygen plants should be sped up.According to the statement, 162 PSA oxygen plants are being installed in 32 states and UTs from the PM CARES fund.Modi was informed that one lakh cylinders are being procured and will be supplied to states soon.The statement said officials told Modi that they are in constant touch with 12 high burden states in assessing the current and future requirement of medical oxygen.A supply mapping plan for 12 high burden states till April 30 has also been undertaken. Modi also said the supply of oxygen required for the production of medicines and equipment necessary to handle the pandemic should also be ensured.Reviewing the status of availability and supply of ventilators, Modi noted that a real-time monitoring system has been created, and directed that state government concerned should be sensitised to use the system pro-actively.Daily cases crossed 2.34 lakh today, registering more than 2 lakh additions every day for the last three days. Hospitals are bursting at the seams, oxygen supplies dwindling and ICU beds in short supply even as the Centre assures adequate availability of everything.The Centre-state coordination has also come under severe strain with the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra repeatedly accusing the government of not sending enough supplies of oxygen or Remdesivir.Maharashtra continues to contribute more than 50 per cent to the daily new case basket.This morning the PM had to personally call up the head of Juna Akhara to appeal to him to curtail the ongoing Kumbh mela which has emerged as a super spreading event.The PM, who addressed a rally in Bengal today, was earlier criticised by opposition Congress leader P Chidambaram for "not being at his desk"."The PM is displaying shocking callousness by campaigning in Bengal when he should be at his desk, coordinating with ministries, ensuring medical oxygen supplies and handling the situation. That is the job of the PM," said Chidambaram.

The explanation to Section 43 shows that a private vehicle would not come within the expression ‘public place’ as explained in Section 43 of the NDPS Act. On the strength of the decision of this court, the relevant provision would not be Section 43 of the NDPS Act but the case would come under Section 42 of the NDPS Act,” the top court said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/private-vehicle-is-not-public-place-under-ndps-act-says-sc-acquits-three-men-240416

We have diverted all available oxygen from industrial use to medical use," said Goyal."Maharashtra is suffering from an inept and corrupt government and the Centre is doing its best for the people. The people of Maharashtra are following ‘Majha Kutumb, Majhi Javabadari’ dutifully. It is time the CM also follows his duties in the spirit of ‘Majha Rajya, Majhi Javabadari’," he said. The Minister said the Centre was in daily touch with state governments to assess their needs and help them in best possible manner "With this background, shocked and saddened to see petty politics being played by @OfficeOfUT. He needs to stop his daily dose of shameless politics and take responsibility," he said in a series of tweets.Highlighting challenges in battling the second wave of Covid-19 infections in Maharashtra, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has requested PM Modi to “press in” the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and make use of all options, including airlifting of medical oxygen, for rapid movement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/piyush-goyal-accuses-uddhav-thackeray-of-playing-petty-politics-claims-maharashtra-has-received-maximum-quantity-of-oxygen-240397

Special Judge Neelofer Abida Perveen granted relief to the accused on Friday on a personal bond of Rs 30,000 and two sureties of a like amount.The court noted that the accused was in custody since February 9, 2021, with 14 days of remand in police custody.It said that a police plea for further incarceration for the sole purpose of voice sampling was not justifiable.While granting the bail, the judge directed the accused to deposit his passport with the investigating officer and appear before the police station as well as the court as and when required.On January 26, thousands of protesting farmers who reached ITO in Delhi from the Ghazipur border clashed with police, the agency claimed in its FIR registered in connection with the Red Fort violence, adding that many of them who were driving tractors reached the Red Fort and entered the monument, where a religious flag was also hoisted.

On the contrary, some other states have received preferential treatment and relief. Instead of listening to the constructive suggestions of the opposition, Union ministers are pressed into service to target leaders of opposition for giving the suggestions. This convoluted “me versus you” debate is childish and totally unnecessary,” she said.Gandhi said India had already exported nearly 6.5 crore Covid vaccine dosages to other countries, adding, “Considering the highest infection rate in the world in our own country, shouldn’t vaccine export be held back and priority given to protect our citizens? Isboasting about our generosity to other countries going to help the thousands of our people who are dying?”Gandhi said the government must reconsider its priority for vaccine candidates by reducing the immunisation eligibility age to 25 and also to those young people with at-risk health disorders like asthma, angina, diabetes, kidney and liver diseases.She said that in the course of her talks with chief ministers, the question of GST came up.“They felt that as a preliminary measure, all equipment, instruments, medicines and support required to prevent and treat Covid should be made free from GST. It is a matter of grave concern that lifesaving drugs like remdesivir and medical oxygen as also other basic supplements are subjected to GST at 12 per cent. Even basic equipment like oxymeters and life-saving critical equipment like ventilators are subjected to 20 per cent GST. In the current state of affairs, this is inhuman and untenable,” the Congress chief said.Noting that partial curfews, travel restrictions, closures and lockdowns would again restrict economic activity that would hit the already beleaguered people, especially the poor and the daily wagers, Gandhi said, “It is imperative to provide monthly income support and transfer an amount of Rs 6,000 into every eligible citizen’s account.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonia-asks-pm-to-lower-covid-vaccination-eligibility-age-to-25-240350
