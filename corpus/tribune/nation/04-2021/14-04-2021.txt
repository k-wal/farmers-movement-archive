This pattern is dangerous for both the economy and society. The present farmers' movement has not only tried to save the Constitution but it is another effort to fight for the strong implementation of the Constitution," the SKM, a joint front of farmer unions, said in a statement.It also accused the government of implementing a "divide and rule policy" by splitting the working class into several classes, and asserted that farmers and labourers are united against the present "corporate-government nexus"."The marketing system and proper minimum support price (MSP) is the biggest freedom for farmers. In the same way, minimum wage and respectful work of workers protect them from exploitation. At present, both sections have been targeted by the central government."Not only the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act but the other two farm laws will also affect the economy of Dalit Bahujans broadly. Today, labourers and farmers understand this well and they are fighting unitedly against these policies," the statement said.The Centre says the new farm laws will free farmers from middlemen, giving them more options to sell their crops.The protesting farmers, however, say the laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the 'mandi' (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.

14-04-2021||New Delhi||Climate change: India will complete commitments, raise climate ambitions but not under pressure, says Javadekar||Strongly reiterating India’s commitment towards climate change goals, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Wednesday India will complete its commitments and raise ambitions and goals but not under any pressure. In a strong statement at an international event “From Paris to Glasgow: Stepping up global action on Climate Change”, Javadekar said historical responsibility is important and India will “not forget it and not let anyone forget it”.Asking nations to provide finance and technological support they promised at Copenhagen in 2009, Javadekar said the World is suffering today because of what was caused 150-100 years ago.“Countries… European, America, China emitted and therefore the World is suffering, India is suffering. In climate debate historical responsibility is important. We will not forget it and not let anyone to forget it.  “We are not responsible for climate change still India is on the right path following the principal of Common but Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR)”, he said. The statement assumes importance amid international pressure on carbon neutrality/net zero targets commitments.Earlier at a bilateral meeting with French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also Javadekar said India is the only G-20 country to walk the talk on the Paris climate agreement and had done more than it had promised. Speaking at the panel debate, Javadekar said despite contributing only 3% in historical emission, India has taken numerous ambitious measures for climate action, including reduction in emission intensity, increase in forest area, biodiversity conservation and aspirational target of 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030.“Many countries say don’t use coal, but the alternative has to be much cheaper than coal, only then India will do away with coal,” he said.“We must also take into consideration climate justice to poor nations, they have the right to develop. Developed countries should finance what they committed. What they committed in Copenhagen ($ 100 billion) it is now $ 1.1 trillion dollars. Where is the money? There is no money in sight. You have polluted, you have destroyed the world and are now saying that do not use coal. Nobody wants to use coal, but alternative comes at a cost,” he said.Asserting that “climate change not a business and one should not profit from it”, Javedekar said: “There is something called climate justice. Countries responsible for bringing climate change should make available technology at affordable cast and finance they committed. Climate change is not business, fighting climate change is our duty. If climate change is a disaster, we should not profit from it”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/climate-change-india-will-complete-commitments-raise-climate-ambitions-but-not-under-pressure-says-javadekar-239063
14-04-2021||Bhubaneswar||Congress candidate for Odisha Assembly byelection dies after contracting COVID-19||Congress candidate for the byelection in Odisha’s Pipili assembly constituency, Ajit Mangaraj, died at a private hospital in Bhubaneswar on Wednesday, three days before the polling scheduled on April 17, family sources said.However, the byelection is likely to be postponed.Mangaraj, 53, was hospitalised after falling ill during campaigning in Pipili last week. He had announced on Saturday that he tested positive for COVID-19.Odisha Governor Ganeshi Lal, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan and senior Congress leaders condoled his death.“The hon’ble Governor condoled the passing away of senior Congress leader and Pipili assembly bypoll candidate Ajit Mangaraj and extended his condolences to his family members. Om Shanti,” a Raj Bhavan statement said.“I am sad to know about the demise of Congress candidate Ajit Mangraj who is contesting the Pipili assembly by-election. I extend my condolences to the bereaved families at such a sad time,” the chief minister said in a tweet.Patnaik had called up Mangaraj’s family members to enquire about his health condition on Monday.Union Petroleum Minister Pradhan, who hails from the state, visited the hospital and expressed his condolence over the death of Mangaraj.“He was infected with corona and passed away today. I pray to Lord to give peace to his soul and strength to his family members,” Pradhan said.Senior Congress leader Pradeep Majhi said that Mangaraj’s blood oxygen level dropped to below 30 per cent and he could not recover from it.“It is our fault to hold elections during the pandemic. The Congress candidate became a victim of the infection. There should be no election during the pandemic,” the former MP said.The April 17 polling is likely to be postponed due to the death of a candidate, Majhi said.Congress MLAs Taraprasad Bahinipati and Ramesh Jena said that Mangaraj died due to respiratory problems.Former state Congress president Jaydev Jena also expressed grief over the untimely demise of Mangaraj.The bypoll in the constituency was necessitated due to the death of senior BJD MLA Pradeep Maharathy in October last year.

14-04-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi to attend Leaders' meet in Portugal on May 8||The resumption of the ad hoc India-EU human rights dialogue earlier this week has paved the way for more substantial talks on trade.The dialogue, only one that India holds with an entity, held after eight years has led to India and the EU deciding to resume formal negotiations for a trade and investment agreement on May 8, the day PM Narendra Modi attends the Leader’s Meeting during the EU summit in Porto, Portugal.The need for holding the dialogue had become more pressing after both sides agreed on the need for its resumption during the virtual summit in July last year. This was after External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had staved off a potentially embarrassing vote at the European Parliament on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) by citing assurances.The dialogue was co-chaired by MEA’s Joint Secretary (Europe-West) Sandeep Chakravorty and the EU Ambassador to India Ugo Astuto.The dialogue was held in New Delhi more or less annually since its inception in 2004.  But it began stuttering during the UPA era. There were eight postponements to the eighth round. Thereafter, the dialogues kept getting postponed.Trade talks have followed a similar trajectory. After 16 rounds of talks between 2007 and 2013, negotiations had got stalemated over import duties on European automobiles and wine.Following the human rights dialogue, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman held a virtual meeting with Portugal’s Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva on Tuesday. ``The resumption of formal negotiations on both Trade and Investment agreements at the Leaders’ Meeting of India and EU in Porto, Portugal would be a notable success for the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the EU,’’ tweeted the Finance Ministry.It is necessary for both sides to rearrange their trading ties because of Brexit. India and the UK are also exploring the feasibility of a trade agreement though the issue is unlikely to be clinched during UK PM Boris Johnson’s India visit later this month.

14-04-2021||New Delhi||Global warming making Indian monsoon seasons stronger, more chaotic: Study||Climate change will make summer monsoon rainfall in India stronger and more erratic, according to a study that predicts extremely wet years in the future, with potentially grave consequences for over a billion people's well-being, economy, food systems and agriculture.The study, published in the journal Earth System Dynamics, compared more than 30 state-of-the-art climate models from all around the world."We have found robust evidence for an exponential dependence: For every degree Celsius of warming, monsoon rainfalls will likely increase by about 5 per cent," said study lead author Anja Katzenberger from the Potsdam-Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany."Hereby we were also able to confirm previous studies but find that global warming is increasing monsoon rainfall in India even more than previously thought. It is dominating monsoon dynamics in the 21st century," Katzenberger said.The researchers noted that more rainfall is not necessarily a good thing for the farming sector in India and its neighbouring countries."Crops need water especially in the initial growing period, but too much rainfall during other growing states can harm plants—including rice on which the majority of India's population is depending for sustenance," said study co-author Julia Pongratz from Ludwig-Maximilian University (LMU) in Germany."This makes the Indian economy and food system highly sensitive to volatile monsoon patterns," said Pongratz.A look into the past underlines that human behaviour is behind the intensification of rainfall, according to the researchers.Starting in the 1950s, human-made forcings have begun to overtake slow natural changes occurring over many millennia, they said.At first, high sun-light blocking aerosol loadings led to subdued warming and thus a decline in rainfall.However, from 1980 onwards, greenhouse gas-induced warming has become the deciding driver for stronger and more erratic Monsoon seasons."We see more and more that climate change is about unpredictable weather extremes and their serious consequences," said group leader and co-author Anders Levermann from PIK and Columbia University in the US."Because what is really on the line is the socio-economic well-being of the Indian subcontinent,” Levermann said.He explained that a more chaotic monsoon season poses a threat to the agriculture and economy in the region and should be a wakeup call for policymakers to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/global-warming-making-indian-monsoon-seasons-stronger-more-chaotic-study-239050
14-04-2021||New Delhi||2 govt employees among 10 people held for using Bluetooth devices in exam||The Delhi Police have busted a gang allegedly involved in cheating during an entrance exam for a court job using Bluetooth devices and arrested 10 people including, two government employees, officials said on Wednesday.The matter came to light after one of the examination centres informed police on February 28 that some candidates appearing for a job at Tiz Hazari Court were found using Bluetooth devices. Later, police caught them and seized three Bluetooth devices from accused candidates—Rahul Jatain, Kunal Sharma and Rajesh Kumar, they said.The accused candidates disclosed the name of the main accused, and he was later nabbed after several raids at Sant Nagar in north Delhi's Burari, police said.Taking advantage of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing protocol, as instructed by the main accused, the three candidates hid Bluetooth devices under their face mask and clothes at the examination centre, police said, adding that the candidates were provided with answer keys during the test over a WhatsApp call.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer North) Rajiv Ranjan Singh said the main accused, currently posted as a peon in the Irrigation department at Bhiwani, also got selected for the post through illegal practices. He disclosed during interrogation that he created a nexus of such persons to earn huge money. He also created a YouTube channel and used fake SIM cards with unknown ownership to operate this nexus.“He was also in touch with other government employees who allegedly provided aspirants to him for Rs 7 lakh per candidate, which gets further distributed between them after the joining of the candidate. The candidates were also provided with a micro-Bluetooth device that would help them to hear the answers and not get caught as these devices were almost undetectable without a metal detector,” the officer said.Based on his disclosure, police found that two more candidates who appeared in the particular exam had also cheated the same way. He also disclosed the name of another employee working in the Irrigation department, who provided him with the candidates.Subsequently, he was also nabbed from his native village in Bhiwani, Haryana, the police said, adding that four other candidates and members of the gang were arrested based on his disclosure.Ten mobile phones, 16 SIM cards, and three Bluetooth used in the offence have been seized by the police, and they are looking to trace other members of the gang involved in the case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2-govt-employees-among-10-people-held-for-using-bluetooth-devices-in-exam-239049
14-04-2021||Mumbai||No Bombay HC nod for mass prayers at Mumbai mosque during Ramadan||The Bombay High Court on Wednesday refused permission to a city-based trust to allow people to offer Namaz at its mosque in south Mumbai during the Ramadan period, saying the COVID-19 situation was “serious and critical” and the safety of citizens was more importance.A vacation bench of Justices R D Dhanuka and V G Bisht noted that the Maharashtra government found it expedient to impose restrictions to break the chain of transmission of the coronavirus.“The right to celebrate or follow a religious practice is important, but what is more paramount and of importance is public order and the safety of citizens,” the court said.It was hearing a petition filed by the Juma Masjid Mosque Trust, seeking permission to allow people from the Muslim community to offer the prayers five times a day at its mosque in south Mumbai.The petitioner said the mosque is spread over an acre and around 7,000 people can assemble at a time.However, considering the COVID-19 situation, only 50 persons would be allowed at a time to offer prayers during the Ramadan period and all safety precautions would be followed, it said.Additional Government Pleader Jyoti Chavan, appearing for the Maharashtra government, opposed the plea and said the situation in Mumbai and Maharashtra is alarming.“We cannot make an exception to any religion, especially in this 15-day period. We cannot take a risk at this stage and all citizens should cooperate,” Chavan said.She said the government was not prohibiting any person from practising his or her religion, but they should do it in their homes.The court while dismissing the plea said it cannot consider the petitioner’s request in view of the COVID-19 situation which is “serious and critical in nature”.“In our view, the restrictions imposed by the state government are due to the COVID-19 circumstances. Considering the prevailing situation and ground reality in Maharashtra, we cannot permit the petitioner to perform prayers at the mosque,” the HC said.The government’s order of restrictions is in public interest and for the safety of all residents of Maharashtra, it said.The bench noted that in the past, several courts across the country refused permission to many other religious congregations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Reeling under an unprecedented COVID-19 wave, the Maharashtra government on Tuesday announced severe restrictions on public movement over the next 15 days across the state.As part of the curbs, all religious places and malls shall remain shut.The restrictions, which exclude essential services, will come into effect from 8 pm on Wednesday and remain in force till 7 am on May 1.Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), prohibiting assembly of five or more people at one spot, will be in force during this period, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Tuesday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-bombay-hc-nod-for-mass-prayers-at-mumbai-mosque-during-ramadan-239047

Among all Covid-19 patients, 8.6 per cent were  hospitalised, 2.4 per cent were admitted to the ICU, and 1.6 per cent died."What surprised me the most from this study was the strength of the association between inactivity and poor outcomes from Covid-19," said Deborah Rohm Young from the Kaiser Permanente Southern California."Even after we included variables such as obesity and smoking in the analysis, we still saw inactivity was strongly associated with much higher odds of hospitalisation, ICU admission, and death compared with  moderate physical activity or any activity at all," Young added.The results showed that inactivity is strongly associated with poor Covid-19 outcomes, Sallis said, while suggesting walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week at a moderate pace, to prevent  Covid-19."Exercise is medicine that everyone should take -- especially in this era of Covid-19," Sallis said. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/people-who-exercise-regularly-have-best-chance-to-beat-covid-239042
14-04-2021||New Delhi||NGT forms National Task Force to combat air pollution||Noting that about 1.5 million people in India die annually due to air pollution, the National Green Tribunal has formed an eight-member National Task Force (NTF) to monitor remedial steps to improve the status of air quality.A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice A K Goel said holistic and coordinated efforts at all levels in the government is dire need of the hour.  Accountability in terms of adverse entries in the Annual Confidential Reports and recovery of compensation for non-compliance are imperative for fixing accountability, the tribunal said.“This requires authorities at higher level to function as trustees for discharge of constitutional and statutory obligation to the citizens. There is no other magic wand to protect people against acknowledged sorry state of affairs. India has world’s highest death rate from chronic respiratory diseases,” the bench said.The NTF is to be headed and coordinated by the Secretary Ministry of Environment and Forests with nominees (not below the rank of Joint Secretaries) of Ministries from Housing and Urban Development, Road Transport, Petroleum, Power, Agriculture, Health and Chairman of Central Pollution Control Board.“NTF may also monitor enforcement of laid down air quality standards beyond Non-Attainment Cities’ in other identified air polluted areas where air quality is poor and above.“The NTF may hold its first meeting within one month and thereafter evolve mechanism for monitoring by quarterly meetings with Chief Secretaries of concerned States/UTs. The NTF may coordinate and work in tandem with the Committees already constituted under NCAP at National and State levels,” the bench said.The tribunal said that consistent with Digital India initiatives, MoEF or CPCB may consider setting up and periodically updating National Environment Data Grid (NEDG) linked to the State Environment Data Grids (SEDGs) and District Environment Data Grids (DEDGs) and further linked to available portals like online air quality, Sameer and other monitoring stations to facilitate analysis, research and planning on the subject.“The Chief Secretaries of all States/UTs may continue tomonitor progress in execution of action plans at State level with the assistance of monitoring cells in their offices and the Air Quality Monitoring Committee.“The State level monitoring must include action at the ground as per directions to be implemented by the District Magistrates or other concerned departments,” the bench said.The green panel said the matter has been monitored by the tribunal for about two and a half years and primarily the tribunal is an adjudicatory body and beyond giving directions necessary for protection of environment under section 15 of the NGT Act, execution has to be by administrative authorities. “Under public trust doctrine, the State authorities are under obligation to take effective measures to control pollution. Tribunal monitoring cannot be for indefinite period. Road map has crystalised to an extent.        “The ownership of monitoring must be now taken over by the statutory and administrative authorities for enforcement of rule of law for which a national level task force needs to be constituted,” the bench said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ngt-forms-national-task-force-to-combat-air-pollution-239040

14-04-2021||New Delhi||Ramping production of Remdesivir to meet demand: Pharma firms||Several manufacturers of Remdesivir, that is being used in treatment of COVID-19, said they have ramped up production of the drug to meet its rising demand across the country.In view of increased demand for the medicine due to a spike in COVID-19 cases, the Centre on Sunday prohibited the export of Remdesivir injection and its active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) till the situation in the country improves.A Zydus Cadila spokesperson said, “The current spike in COVID-19 cases has led to a higher demand of Remdesivir. We are currently producing Remdesivir at three of our facilities. To cater to the demand, we have ramped up our production from the earlier 5-6 lakh vials a month to 10-12 lakh vials a month, which we will scale towards 20 lakh vials a month.”     In a few weeks the supply situation will be a far more stable one, the company said.In similar vein, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories said it is making every effort to ensure that its Remdesivir reaches as many patients in India, as possible.“We are ramping up production and are also bringing to market a liquid product that is faster to make and supply. We have also reduced our MRP by 50 per cent so that price is not a barrier to access, and a much larger number of patients can access it,” Dr Reddy’s said in a statement.The company expects market situation on supplies to ease in the next few weeks, it added. “We will continue in our endeavour to make medicines available wherever they are required, and whenever they are required,” Dr Reddy’s said.Rakesh Bamzai, President—India, Emerging Asia and Access Markets and Commercial Expansion and Biosimilars -Emerging Markets, Viatris (formerly called Mylan), said: “We are closely partnering with the government to meet the patient needs in India and ensure access to this critical medicine.”                Drug firm Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said it, in collaboration with Syngene, is increasing capacity for Remdesivir to fulfil the increase in demand.“Sun Pharma has already increased the production and is now manufacturing Remdesivir at two plants. The decision to add one more manufacturing site was taken recently to help boost our production. We are continuously monitoring the situation and working relentlessly to ensure patients across India get access to COVID-19 medicines,” a Sun Pharma spokesperson said.The company is manufacturing and distributing Remdesivir in India in partnership with Syngene, the spokesperson added.Pharma firm Cipla has also said that it has significantly increased the production of Remdesivir from the last wave of the pandemic.“We have scaled up the production of Remdesivir by 2x from the last wave of the pandemic. Given the unprecedented demand for the drug, we have now further ramped up our capacities through our network, to service the demand,” Cipla has said.There are seven manufacturers of Remdesivir in the country.“They have an installed capacity of about 38.80 lakh units per month,” the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had said on Sunday.The Department of Pharmaceuticals has been in contact with the domestic manufacturers to ramp up the production of the drug, it added.The Centre on Tuesday said doctors should ensure “rational and judicious” use of antiviral drug Remdesivir, underlining it is to be given only to serious COVID-19 patients in hospitals and is not to be used in home settings.

14-04-2021||New Delhi||There is need for positive regulatory framework for internet cos: Facebook India head||Facebook India Head Ajit Mohan said there is a need for a "forward-looking and positive regulatory framework" for internet companies, and that organisations also need to be more transparent about how they use customer data.The executive noted that India has seen an "explosive shift" in terms of access to the internet and this expanded access gas-driven the emergence of entirely new models, a feat that no other country has managed to do so much in such a short period of time."We absolutely do believe that the internet needs new rules, not just in India but around the world. We operated for a very long time with not enough clarity on the traffic lights. And this is the moment when we should think especially in democratic societies, think about how we navigate complex issues where there are competing trade-offs. I'm hoping that we can emerge with a very forward-looking and positive regulatory framework," he said at the Raisina Dialogue.Mohan, Vice President and Managing Director, Facebook India, said that there are a few areas that the regulations can focus on."One is transparency mandates. Make it the company's to be more transparent about how data is used. Second, there's a lot of concern about algorithms, and how machines are controlling people's lives. I think we would be very keen to lean in and say how do we protect user agency where people have the opportunity to make explicit choices that drive algorithms," he said.Mohan added that a lot of the conversation has been about how large tech companies benefit from large sets of data."I think we have been very forward in saying we are open to creating frameworks that still protect the interests of privacy and safety when data moves around, but make it easier for users to move data between competing platforms. I do believe that we are a partner in this. But I agree with the framework that we need rules and we hope those will be forward-looking and positive," he said.The top executive also noted that having an open Internet is an area where the US and India can work together."I think democracies will have to decide the future of the internet, and in particular, US and India, and I do believe that it's an explosive opportunity for the two countries to work together, and a lot of the classical models of trade that has influenced the debate over the last few decades may not be relevant here," he pointed out.Mohan emphasised that facebook's mission in India is to be an ally for the country and to be a very positive force for good in India's transformation for the next few decades.Facebook has drawn flak in the past for its handling of hate speech on the platform in the country. India is among the biggest markets for Facebook and its group companies, WhatsApp and Instagram. According to government data, India has 53 crore WhatsApp users, 41 crore Facebook users, and 21 crore users of Instagram.Mohan said the company is focused on investing in people and systems to make sure that harmful content doesn't get distributed on our platform and that users have greater control."The company has been leaning in on safety and security to make sure that harm is reduced to the extent possible... much of our energy is focused on how do we make sure that we reduce harm but equally, how do we continue to expand the canvas for people and businesses to make sure that they are able to use platforms like ours to move from an idea to a company that is relevant around the world, to build communities in the middle of the pandemic," he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/there-is-need-for-positive-regulatory-framework-for-internet-cos-facebook-india-head-239031

Now, looking at the rush, we allowed another eight crematoriums two days back," he said.Patel said in seven crematoriums, where there has been a huge rush, they have installed 35 additional metal pyres, on which bodies are placed along with wooden logs."We have also supplied 75 additional metal trays for the collection of ashes under the pyres. This will speed up the cremation process," he said.With this, the waiting period has come down significantly, he added.In Surat, two new crematoriums have been operationalised to ease the burden on three major facilities, including the city's oldestAshvini Kumar Crematorium, which handles around 90 bodies daily."In view of the huge rush and long waiting time, two defunct crematoriums, one at Pal and another in the Limbayat area, were opened a few days back," the crematorium's manager, Prashant Kabrawala, said.This has reduced the waiting time from five hours to about two hours, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/long-wait-at-crematoriums-in-gujarat-amid-covid-19-surge-239030

14-04-2021||New Delhi||India is a trusted partner; limited cooperation with Pakistan: Russia||Describing India as a "trusted partner", Russia on Wednesday said there were no divergences or misunderstandings between the two countries and that it has "limited cooperation" with Pakistan based on "independent" relations.Deputy Chief of the Russian mission Roman Babushkin also welcomed the recent commitment by India and Pakistan to follow the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control and said these are "very important steps" for regional stability.At a joint media briefing with Babushkin, Russian ambassador Nikolay Kudashev criticised the Indo-Pacific strategy by the western countries describing it as "dangerous" and an effort to revive the cold war mentality.Babushkin said India must be part of the process of shaping regional consensus on Afghanistan and that New Delhi and Moscow have similar approaches for the Afghan peace process.Asked about reports of bad optics during Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov's recent visit to India as he travelled to Islamabad from Delhi, Babushkin said Russia has independent ties with Pakistan and that it does not "target any relations against anyone"."We believe that there is absolutely no reason to see that there are divergences or any misunderstandings between us. It is not the case in Russia-India ties," he said.Kudashev said India is a trusted partner of Russia and ties between the two countries were "equal, solid, comprehensive, coherent and forward-looking".He also mentioned that the visit by Lavrov to India on April 6 contributed a lot to the ties."It was a very important and remarkable event, which contributed a lot to the special and privileged strategic partnership between our two friendly nations. Our ties remain equal, solid, comprehensive, coherent and forward-looking despite any global turbulence," he said.The ambassador said the visit was aimed at preparations for the India-Russia summit which is expected to take place in the second half of the year.Babushkin said Russia has independent relations with India, Pakistan and other countries and the relations are based on their own merits."We are all members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and develop cooperation in various fields including regional security, fight against terrorism and to deal with other threats," he said."Russia has limited cooperation with Pakistan as compared to India. However, the fight against terrorism is our common agenda. So we also help Pakistan in providing anti-terrorism equipment and holding dedicated exercise," he added.After visiting India, Lavrov on Tuesday travelled to Islamabad where he said Russia was ready to supply special military equipment to Pakistan to boost its counter-terror capabilities.Babushkin said Russia respects the Simla agreement of 1972 and Lahore declaration of 1999 and that it has no intention to interfere in issues between the two sides.The ambassador said Russia was very satisfied with the detailed discussion on a wide range of bilateral and international matters between India and Russia during Lavrov's visit."It confirmed the proximity of our approaches and exceptional level of mutual understanding and trust as well as goodwill to maintain our traditional open-minded and forward-looking dialogue," he said.

14-04-2021||Jalpaiguri (WB)||BJP brought outsiders in Bengal for poll campaign, contributed to COVID surge: Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday alleged that the BJP has contributed to the recent rise in COVID-19 cases in the state by bringing "outsiders in large numbers" for campaigning during the ongoing assembly elections.Addressing a poll rally here, Banerjee also accused the BJP-led government at the Centre of not responding to the state's plea to vaccinate a majority of people, which could have helped contain the spread of the disease."They (BJP leaders) have brought outsiders for campaigning and contributed to the rise in COVID cases. We had managed to get hold of the COVID situation, they made it complicated," she said at the public meeting.Speaking on the Election Commission's decision to prohibit her from campaigning for 24 hours, she said, "Is it a fault to ask Hindus, Muslims and others to vote together? What about Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is mocking me at every election meeting? Why is he not banned from campaigning?" she asked.The Election Commission had barred Banerjee from campaigning for 24 hours from Monday 8 pm for her remarks against the central forces and a statement that had alleged religious overtones.Accusing the prime minister and Amit Shah of peddling lies at poll rallies, the TMC supremo said, "The Centre has kept the NRC and the NPR bills alive, but the home minister had claimed at a meeting at Lebong in the hills that he had no plans to enforce the National Register of Citizens.""Don't trust them. If they come to power, you may face the same experience like the 14 lakh Bengalis in Assam (referring to the final NRC in the northeastern state).

14-04-2021||New Delhi||Access to professional education no government largesse, says SC||Access to professional education is not a “governmental largesse” and state has an affirmative obligation to facilitate its reach at all levels, the Supreme Court has said.This obligation assumes far greater importance for students whose background imposes formidable obstacles on their path to access quality education, the apex court said.A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah made these observations in a verdict on separate pleas filed by two students from Ladakh who were not admitted to MBBS degree course in medical colleges here despite due nomination by the Union Territory and in terms of the seats notified by the Centre. “While the right to pursue higher (professional) education has not been spelt out as a fundamental right in Part III of the Constitution, it bears emphasis that access to professional education is not a governmental largesse. Instead, the state has an affirmative obligation to facilitate access to education, at all levels,” the bench said in its judgement delivered on April 9.“This obligation assumes far greater importance for students whose background (by virtue of such characteristics as caste, class, gender, religion, disability and geographical region) imposes formidable obstacles on their path to accessing quality education,” it said.While allowing the petitions filed by the two students, the top court directed that the admission formalities be completed immediately and, in any event, within a week.The bench noted that both the petitioners were nominated by the Ladakh administration for admission to MBBS degree course under the ‘central pool' seats set apart by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.It noted that one of them has been allocated seat at Lady Hardinge Medical College while the other has been assigned to Maulana Azad Medical College.“We have been constrained to take up the issue under Article 32, since the fundamental rights of students from Ladakh to pursue professional education are implicated,” it said.“We will in the course of this judgment deal, of course, with the grievance of the two students. But we intend to deal with the issue on a systemic basis so that other students who may lack resources, or simply the knowledge about legal remedies, are not deprived of education,” the bench said.It noted that Additional Solicitor Generals R S Suri and K M Nataraj, representing the Centre and Ladakh, have stated that since due allocations have been made in favour of the petitioners, there is no reason and justification to deny them the benefit of admission.The bench noted in its verdict that through a communication dated February 19 this year issued by the UT administration, the Director of Health Services Ladakh (DHSL) had forwarded the list of selected candidates from Ladakh to be admitted in the central pool medical seats for the year 2020-2021.“In order to obviate the hardship which has been caused to these students, we also direct that all the students who are referred to in annexure A to the notification dated 19 February 2021, as extracted above, be granted admissions to the concerned institutions, if not already given so far,” it said.“We are issuing these general directions in order to obviate the possibility of each of the similarly placed students being required to move this court. Financial hardship should not prevent the students from getting admission in terms of the allocation which has been made in their favour legitimately under the central pool seats,” the bench said.In its verdict, the bench referred to the committee on economic, social and cultural rights (ICESCR) which was formed to monitor the implementation of International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which was ratified by India in 1979.“The ICESCR committee pertinently notes that disparities in spending policies that result in differing qualities of education for persons residing in different geographic locations may constitute discrimination under the Covenant,” it said.The bench said that pursuant to these obligations which India has undertaken by being a signatory to the Covenant, the health ministry and DHSL shall ensure proper co-ordination so that students allocated colleges under the central pool seats are not put to hardship in enrolling once they have been duly allocated their seats.It said they can consider appointing a nodal officer tasked with the responsibility of ensuring that students who are duly nominated under the central pool seats are admitted in their chosen course of study.“Such an institutional framework will ensure that students are not left in the lurch due to lack of help in securing their legitimate admission to the appropriate course.

14-04-2021||New Delhi||Disrespect shown must be addressed diplomatically: Tharoor on US Navy's operation in India's EEZ||The US did not break international law when its Navy ship carried out a freedom of navigation operation in the Indian exclusive economic zone last week, but it did show "disrespect" which must be addressed diplomatically, senior Congress leader and former UN under-secretary general Shashi Tharoor said on Wednesday.India on Friday had conveyed concerns to the United States over its Navy ship carrying out a freedom of navigation operation in the Indian exclusive economic zone (EEZ).India's reaction came after the US Navy, in an unusual move, announced that one of its ships conducted patrols in the Indian EEZ on April 7, without seeking consent from India.Responding to the episode, Tharoor put out a series of tweets in which he argued that the best way forward was for India to extract an explicit undertaking from the US to inform it in advance as a courtesy before undertaking such operations and not to publicise the "fact that they have thumbed their noses at us".  "There's understandable anger in India over the US Seventh Fleet sailing near Lakshadweep in waters that are part of our exclusive economic zone (EEZ). However, there is nothing in UNCLOS (the Law of the Sea) that supports India's stand on freedom of navigation through the EEZ," he said.The Americans are essentially doing near Lakshadweep exactly what they are insisting on doing in and through the South China Sea under the same Freedom of Navigation principle (FoNoPs), Tharoor said.  The US can be accused of not respecting our sensibilities but not of breaking international law, the former Union minister said."Some ask why the US has done to India what it hasn't done to Canada/UK/Australia etc. by exercising FoNoPs through their EEZs. Since those are treaty allies, they have consultation agreements already in place with the US. India (is) not, & is unlikely to ever be, an ally," he argued."So the best we can hope for is an explicit undertaking to (1) inform India in advance as a courtesy and (2) not to publicise the fact that they have thumbed their noses at us. Our diplomacy should have negotiated this; nothing better would have been possible," Tharoor said.The US hasn't signed UNCLOS, but since FoNoPs is not in UNCLOS, the legal position is irrelevant, the Lok Sabha MP from Thiruvananthapuram said.  "We need a pragmatic political approach rather than outrage about a legal breach that hasn't occurred. There has been discourtesy & disrespect, which must be addressed diplomatically," Tharoor asserted.The US Navy, in a statement, had announced last week that it asserted navigational rights and freedoms inside India's EEZ without seeking the country's prior consent."This freedom of navigation operation upheld the rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging India's excessive maritime claims," the US 7th fleet said in a statement.In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs had said, "The USS John Paul Jones was continuously monitored transiting from the Persian Gulf towards the Malacca Straits. We have conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the government of the USA through diplomatic channels." It had also said India's stated position has been that the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea does not authorise other countries to carry out military exercises or manoeuvres in an EEZ and on the continental shelf without the consent of the coastal nation.

The officer said the event was going on without any hindrance.He said the crowds at the Ganga ghats were much smaller than expected at the third shahi snan - considered the most important in the series - and attributed this to the Covid restrictions in place.Police personnel were seen distributing masks among people in the Mela area.However, social distancing norms were violated openly by the seers when they and their followers descended the steps at Har ki Pairi to wade into the river.No masks were worn by a large proportion of them.The seers from the akhadas took the dip along with their revered deities carried in ornate palanquins at Har Ki Pairi, which was reserved exclusively for them.Lakhs of common devotees bathed at the other ghats of the river in Haridwar and Rishikesh.Seers and Naga sanyasis of the Niranjani Akhada led by Acharya Kailashanand Giri were the first to bathe in the river along with Anand Akhada seers. They were followed by the Joona Akhada, which has the highest number of sadhus led by Swami Avadheshanand.The Mahanirvani Akhada seers came next, as the batches followed one another according to their allotted time slots.All akhadas have to finish taking a dip at Har Ki Pairi before sunset so time management is very important, Mela IG Sanjay Gunjyal said.The shahi snans, and the Kumb Mela, have raised concerns over their role in possibly adding to rising coronavirus cases in the country.Uttarakhand recorded its highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases on Tuesday with 1,925 people testing positive.Dehradun with 775 cases and Haridwar with 594 were the biggest contributors to the day's tally.On the initial hours of the third shahi snan, the DGP said there was no disorder anywhere. He said this was because of the expansion of infrastructure in Haridwar over the past few months, including the addition of more ghats which has helped in better crowd management.

14-04-2021||Mumbai||Making FASTag mandatory won't breach right to freedom of movement: Centre||The Union government has informed the Bombay High Court that making FASTag mandatory for all vehicles plying on national highways does not breach a citizen's fundamental right to freedom of movement in any way.The Centre made the submission in an affidavit filed in the High Court last week in response to a public interest litigation challenging its decision to make FASTag, the electronic toll collection chip, mandatory for all vehicles at toll plazas on national highways.The plea filed by one Arjun Khanapure, also challenged the government's norm of imposing fines on vehicles flouting the FASTag rules.The Centre, however, submitted that FASTag had been made compulsory on national highways to ensure seamless traffic movement, cut travel time short, and that all decisions had been taken in accordance with the Central Motor Vehicles (CMV) Rules."The mandate of using FASTag does not violate a citizen's fundamental right to freedom of movement," the Centre's affidavit stated.The petitioner had said that as vehicles without FASTag are prevented from plying on national highways, making the chip compulsory breached a citizen's fundamental right to freedom of movement.However, the Union government said that as per its notification dated February 14 this year, provisions had been made at all toll plazas along national highways to fit the chip in vehicles that did not have FASTag.In cases where it was not possible to fit vehicles with FASTag on the spot for any reason, the vehicle was permitted to still ply on highways, on the extreme left of the FASTag lanes.However, such vehicles were required to pay twice the toll amount.Traffic marshalls had also been deployed along national highways to guide vehicle movement and prevent traffic jams or inconvenience to other commuters because of such vehicles, the government said.In its affidavit filed in the High Court on April 6, the Union government urged the court to dismiss the PIL.It said that allowing prayers made in the plea would cause "irreparable loss" to the National Highways Authority of India.The government further said that it did not make FASTag mandatory overnight and had given incentives, including a 10 to 25 per cent cashback to users from 2016 to 2020.The government said it had amended the CMV Rules in 2017 to make FASTag mandatory for all vehicles sold after December 1, 2017.In November 2020, it further amended the CMV rules to make FASTag compulsory for all vehicles on toll plazas along all national highways beginning January 1, 2021.The government also said that the double user fees or penalties imposed on vehicles without FASTag on national highways were in accordance with the National Highway Fee (determination of rates and collection) Rules, 2008.It also contended that unlike what was claimed in the PIL, Aadhar and linking bank accounts were not mandatory for obtaining FASTag.The Centre further said the RBI has announced the enhancement of national electronic toll collection and will allow easy payment options, including UPIs.Currently, 119 state toll plazas also have FASTag and the Centre has provisions of financial assistance for state governments to help make all highways suitable for FASTag vehicles, it said in its affidavit.A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni will hear the matter further later this month. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/making-fastag-mandatory-wont-breach-right-to-freedom-of-movement-centre-239011

It led to a scuffle between the two following which he attacked the girl, but she strangled him using earphone wire." The SP said that on Thursday night, the Dalmau police station received information about a missing nine-year-old boy and instantly launched a manhunt."Two days later, a foul smell started emanating and the parents of the girl opened the storeroom of the house to find the body of their son. After this, the victim's father lodged a named FIR against a neighbour who was also detained by the police," said Kumar.However, during interrogation and surveillance, it surfaced that the man rounded up was not near the spot of crime which was also corroborated by physical evidence.Thereafter, all members present on the day were interrogated."Also, family members were examined as abrasions, cuts and wounds on the body of the boy indicated that a scuffle had taken place between the deceased and the accused," said the SP.Samples of as many as 25 persons were taken and only his elder sister had bruises on her stomach, neck, hands," said the officer.Later, in front of parents and the child welfare officer, the girl was questioned and she confessed to her crime. She also said that she did not want to kill her brother, but he used to complain to parents against her when she would talk to a male friend.The girl has been sent to the juvenile home. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-girl-strangles-9-year-old-brother-with-her-earphone-cable-dumps-body-in-storeroom-239009

14-04-2021||Mumbai||Election Commission biased against Mamata Banerjee: Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Wednesday alleged that the Election Commission was "biased" against Mamata Banerjee, after the poll panel recently barred the West Bengal chief minister from campaigning for 24 hours over certain remarks made by her.The stature of a constitutional body like the Election Commission (EC) should not be demeaned for political benefits, an editorial in the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said.Assembly elections are currently underway in West Bengal and the Shiv Sena, which is not contesting the polls, has extended its support to Trinamool Congress head Banerjee."The Election Commission is biased against Mamata Banerjee. It is our request to the EC with folded hands that it should not listen to the BJP alone, but to everyone. It should not be biased," the Marathi daily said.Everyone has lost the sense of decorum (during the campaign) in West Bengal, but Banerjee alone is being punished for it, the editorial claimed."The EC has busted the myth of everyone being treated equal before law and it chose the land of West Bengal to do so. It seems to have forgotten that West Bengal is the land of revolutionaries and rebels," it said.Mamata Banerjee's lone battle will be remembered in history, irrespective of the outcome of this election, the editorial said.The EC seems to be really irked with Banerjee for dubbing the model code of conduct as the "Modi code of conduct", it said.But, the ground reality in West Bengal is concerning as the Centre-deployed CRPF jawans opened fire on a mob instead of controlling the violence, the Sena said.The Centre should take the responsibility for the violence, it said."There is no doubt that the reputation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah is at stake, but their path to win the state (polls) is against the democracy and freedom of people," the editorial alleged.The stature of a constitutional body like the EC should not be demeaned for political benefits, it added."Why is the EC not noticing that after Modi's Bangladesh visit, there has been a rise in violence in West Bengal?" the Marathi publication asked."Mamata Banerjee has alleged that the reason behind Modi's visits to the US and Bangladesh was same political benefit," it said.The editorial also backed Banerjee over her strong criticism of the Centre and BJP leaders who have been making controversial statements during campaigning in West Bengal.A video clip of a BJP leader's appeal to locals to not be afraid of the (West Bengal) state police has gone viral, it said, adding that what happened in Cooch Behar and Sitalkuchi was not different from the leader's comments.What wrong did Mamata do if she strongly criticised it? the Sena asked."The EC has lost its stature and it is surrounded by a fog of suspicion over its role," the editorial claimed.It is surprising that BJP leaders, who have allegedly said there would be more incidents like Cooch Behar and Sitalkuchi violence, are not charged with violation of the model code of conduct, the Sena said.

It aims to link Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Gulf region, Africa and Europe with a network of land and sea routes."China-India border tensions remain high, despite some force pullbacks this year. China's occupation since May 2020 of contested border areas is the most serious escalation in decades and led to the first lethal border clash between the two countries since 1975,” the report said."As of mid-February, after multiple rounds of talks, both sides were pulling back forces and equipment from some sites along the disputed border,” it said.The border standoff between the armies of India and China erupted on May 5 last following a violent clash in the Pangong Lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of Pangong Lake in February in line with an agreement on disengagement. India has been insisting that a resolution of outstanding issues, including in Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra, is essential for overall ties between the two countries.According to the report, China seeks to use coordinated, whole-of-government tools to demonstrate its growing strength and compel regional neighbours to acquiesce to Beijing's preferences, including its claims over disputed territory and assertions of sovereignty over Taiwan.In the South China Sea, Beijing will continue to intimidate rival claimants and will use growing numbers of air, naval and maritime law enforcement platforms to signal to Southeast Asian countries that China has effective control over contested areas. China is similarly pressuring Japan over contested areas in the East China Sea.China has been fast expanding military and economic influence in the Indo-Pacific region, triggering concern in various countries of the region and beyond. It is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and East China Sea.Beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are vital to global trade. China claims almost all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter-claims over the strategically vital area.Beijing will press Taiwan authorities to move towards unification and will condemn what it views as increased US-Taiwan engagement, the report said.China views Taiwan as a rebel province that must be reunified, even by force."We expect that friction will grow as Beijing steps up attempts to portray Taipei as internationally isolated and dependent on the mainland for economic prosperity, and as China continues to increase military activity around the island,” it said.China's increasing cooperation with Russia on areas of complementary interest includes defence and economic cooperation, it added.China will try to increase its influence using “vaccine diplomacy,” giving countries favoured access to the COVID-19 vaccines it is developing. It will also promote new international norms for technology and human rights, emphasising state sovereignty and political stability over individual rights, the ODNI said.

Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act or CAATSA is a tough US law which authorises the administration to impose sanctions on countries that purchase major defence hardware from Russia.Senator Todd Young, a key member of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in the Foreign Policy magazine that if the Biden administration imposed sanctions on India, it would not deter New Delhi’s purchase of the S-400 missile system from Russia, but would weaken two strategic fronts at a critical time — undermine Washington’s relationship with India. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/republican-senator-for-caatsa-waiver-to-india-238758

14-04-2021||New Delhi||NATO for strong ties with India||NATO is keen on a closer relationship with India, said its Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg during a virtual address at the Raisina Dialogue that began here on Tuesday. NATO has already formalised a strong partnership with South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand in the Indo-Pacific region. It can also work more closely with countries like India, a like-minded democracy, sharing the same values and standing up for the rules-based order,” he suggested. NATO has a formal dialogue mechanism with its strategic adversaries, Russia and China, but not with India. The NATO Secretary General suggested that a formalised dialogue structure could be the first step. “It’s never too late to deepen dialogue and work more closely with India to strengthen the cooperation between India and NATO,” he said. NATO and China have had an annual military dialogue since 2010. It was interrupted in 2016 due to the restructuring in the Chinese armed forces and the terror attacks in Brussels. Stoltenberg had made observations about strengthening ties with “like minded democracies” during US Secretary of State Tony Blinken’s first visit to Brussels last month. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nato-for-strong-ties-with-india-238764

She was seen painting and showing her works to those gathered at the venue. She left the site past 3 pm.Hundreds of TMC supporters and artists arrived at the venue but were prevented from joining the Chief Minister by the police.The area, where the TMC supremo was protesting, belongs to the Army’s Eastern Command.Whether she had got the permission for the sit-in is uncertain as Army officers stated that they received the request at 9.40 am and were in the process of examining it.Soon after the EC ordered the ban, Banerjee had announced her decision to protest.“To protest against the undemocratic and unconstitutional decision of the Election Commission, I will stage a dharna at Gandhi Murti, Kolkata, from 12 noon," she had tweeted.The EC order forced the TMC supremo to cancel two of her election rallies slated to take place on Tuesday. Two other rallies – one at Barasat and the other at Bidhannagar – were rescheduled and held at 8.15 pm and 9 pm on Tuesday.

14-04-2021||Vibha Sharma||India to have normal monsoon this year||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 13For 2021, private forecaster Skymet Weather has predicted “normal” monsoon rains for the country at 103 per cent (907 mm) of the Long Period Average (LPA) rains this year. The rains will be “normal”, ending in the upper half of the normal range, the spread being 96-104% of LPA, said Skymet president GP Sharma.The prediction comes with an error margin of 5 per cent.While most parts of the country are expected to see "normal" rains, some parts of plains of the northwest (Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana) and eastern parts may witness "some deficiency" during the season. In terms of geographical risk, plains of North India along with few parts of the Northeast are likely to be at risk of being rain deficient through the season, the Skymet said.However, September is expected to bring “above-normal" rains (116 percent of the LPA) in most parts of the country, including the Northwest. Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather said the monsoon usually reaches Northwest around June-end. In those terms, June is generally dry apart from some pre-monsoon build-up.“Last year, while Punjab reported rain surplus, Haryana recorded deficient rainfall. This year, the two states may report some deficiency between 10 to 15 per cent in July and August. However, September seems to be rain surplus ,” Palawat said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-have-normal-monsoon-this-year-238784

The GDP is still likely to grow in double digits in 2021 given the low level of activity in 2020,” Moody’s said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-may-clock-double-digit-growth-moodys-238765

Section 144 of the CrPC will be in force till the “lockdown-like” restrictions are in place, Thackeray said.The state will provide 3 kg of wheat and 2 kg of rice free for the next one month to poor and needy persons, he said.Under pressure from states to expedite vaccine supply, the government on Tuesday waived regulatory condition of local bridging study data for foreign-made jabs seeking emergency use approval.The government modified national clinical trial rules after the expert group recommended that vaccines developed and manufactured in foreign countries and approved for restricted emergency use by credible regulators be granted emergency use approval in India without prior bridging studies here.Post approval, these vaccines would need to undergo parallel bridging clinical trials and related data would have to be shared with the Indian regulators.Also, the first 100 beneficiaries of such foreign vaccines would be assessed for seven days for safety outcomes before the said vaccine is rolled out nationally.This would mean early approval and import of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines, which don’t have India-specific data, but have proven safety profiles in clinical trials abroad.VK Paul, Member, Health, NITI Aayog, said, “We invite vaccine makers such as Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson to seek licensure for their vaccines and ready to come to India as early as possible.”The move came on a day when India recorded 1,61,736 new cases, now growing at an average of 10 per cent.At 13.5K cases, Delhi sees highest surgeDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday announced that the Capital registered more than 13,500 Covid cases in the past 24 hours, the highest-ever single-day spike since the onset of the pandemic early last year.

14-04-2021||Mumbai||As Maharashtra's COVID cases spiral, CM orders curfew for 15 days||As Maharashtra reels under a severe COVID-19 wave, the MVA government on Tuesday announced over a 15-day-long statewide curfew from April 14, entailing stricter curbs on public activities, to stem the infection spread and flagged a "shortage" of medical oxygen and beds.Stopping short of announcing a full-scale lockdown, as was being speculated, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his address to the state via social media, said the curfew, which excludes essential services, will come into effect at 8 pm on April 14 and remain in force till 7 am on May 1.Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), dealing with gatherings and assembly of people, will be in force till the "lockdown-like" restrictions are in place, he said.The fresh curbs build on the existing weekend and night curfews in the state.He refrained from terming the new curbs, announced on a day when Maharashtra recorded 60,212 fresh coronavirus cases and 281 fatalities, as a lockdown.There is a shortage of medical oxygen and beds and the demand for Remdesivir, a key COVID-19 drug, has increased in Maharashtra, he said, adding the Centre should help supply oxygen for coronavirus patients in the state by using Air Force planes."The war against coronavirus has begun once again," he said.There is a severe strain on Maharashtra's health infrastructure due to a spike in COVID-19 cases, he added.Painting a grim picture of the infection spread, the chief minister said, The situation is horrifying at present in Maharashtra. The state is carrying out 2.50 lakh COVID-19 tests daily, while the number of COVID-19 care centres has increased from 2,600 the last year to 4,000 as on today." The number of beds has also increased from 3.25 lakh to 3.50 lakh, he added.Underscoring the need for more supply of oxygen, used for treating critical COVID-19 patients, Thackeray sought help from the Centre."I am putting up a request with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to deploy military planes to ferry oxygen stocks from West Bengal or North-Eastern states to Maharashtra to bridge the demand-supply gap," he said.Maharashtra consumes more than 1,200 tonnes of oxygen daily and the entire production of the life-saving gas has been diverted for medical purpose to meeting the growing demand, the chief minister said.The production of Remdesivir was scaled down because of lower demand a few months back. But the injection requires 2-3 weeks period to get mature."Hence, despite the states demand of around 4,000 dosages daily, we have limitations of its supply," he said.Thackeray said it is not clear whether the second COVID-19 wave has peaked.It is not clear whether we are at the peak of COVID- 19 cases or not. But we need to follow the route taken by Britain which underwent a strict lockdown and built capacity to vaccinate its population at mass scale."We need to increase vaccination in the country to slowdown a possible third wave of COVID-19, he said."I have to unfortunately swallow the bitter pill of announcing strict measures though I am not calling it a lockdown. I am prioritising lives and livelihoods," he said.Thackeray said the fresh curbs were announced after advanced warning."I have been hinting to people about possible strict measures for the last one month to curb the rising COVID-19 cases," he added.Seeking to minimise the adverse impact of the curbs on a large population, the CM announced a sort of relief package.The state government will provide three kg wheat and two kg rice free for the next one month to every poor and needy person, Thackeray said.The CM announced a complete ban on movement of people for non-essential works during the restriction period.All essential services, including medical stores hospitals, supply of medicines, among others will remain operational. The local transport will also function for those involved in essential services, he said.The CM made an emotional appeal, seeking people's support for successful implementation of the curbs.I appeal to people to help the state. I want to know whether people are on the side of coronavirus or the state that wants to break the chain of its spread, he said.A range of other essential services will also remain out of the purview of the curfew.Services such as vaccination, oxygen production, home delivery of food, operation of e-commerce firms, work at construction sites with residential facility and industrial activities, where accommodation or transportation of personnel is available, will remain unaffected, he said.All banking and financial services, the RBI and its affiliated offices, insurance offices and pre-monsoon works will remain operational, he said.However, there will be a complete ban on religious, social, cultural and political functions in the state till May 1, the CM said.For political rallies ahead of elections, not more than 200 people can attend an event or 50 per cent of the seating capacity of the hall, Thackeray said.Number of participants at marriage and funeral was capped at 25 and 20, respectively.Saloons, spas, schools, colleges, private coaching classes, beaches, clubs, swimming pools, gyms, drama theatres and cinema halls will remain close during the curfew period, the chief minister said.Though roadside eateries are allowed to operate, buyers can not consume food on the street and only take away will be available, said Thackeray.He announced a financial package of Rs 5,476 crore for the poor whose earnings will be impacted.He said, The Shiv Bhojan service of offering a meal at Rs 5 will be offered for free during the period. The state daily feeds around two lakh people. They will now get the food for free.""Similarly, under the Food Security Act the registered beneficiaries will get three kg of wheat and two kg of rice for free.

Migrant children will be denied their fundamental rights to education, health and nutrition if the matter is not heard and appropriate orders passed by this Court,” the PIL submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-sc-asks-states-to-furnish-data-on-migrant-children-their-condition-238633
14-04-2021||New Delhi||Problem not of COVID vaccine shortage but of planning: Govt||Over 1.67 crore COVID-19 vaccine doses are still available with states and UTs, the Centre said on Tuesday, underlining that the problem is not of vaccine shortage but of better planning.Addressing a press conference, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said so far states and UTs have received 13,10,90,370 vaccine doses, out of which the total consumption, including wastage, has been 11,43,69,677.“As per 11 am data, unutilised doses available with states and union territories for administration is 1,67,20,693. From now till April end, 2,01,22,960 doses are in supply pipeline to states and UTs,” he said.“This clearly shows that the problem is of lack of better planning, not of vaccine doses shortage. We have made available vaccine doses to states and UTs from time to time and as we told you earlier that to bigger states we give supply of four days at once and on fourth and fifth day we replenish the supply. For smaller states, at once we supply 7-8 days vaccine doses and on seventh or eighth day their supply is replenished,” he added.Bhushan said each state government needs to ascertain at cold chain points how many unutilised doses are lying and if necessary, then from one cold chain point to another, the doses have to be reappropriated based on the consumption patterns.“In any state, the case might be that in one district more consumption is taking place while in another there is less consumption. Our request to state governments to ascertain where the doses can be reappropriated from,” he added.Bhushan also said Kerala has zero wastage of vaccine doses while on the other hand there are states which are registering 8-9 per cent wastage.Giving details of coronavirus situation in the country, Bhushan said the previous highest surge has already been crossed and the trend is going upward and that is a cause for worry and that is something they continuously share with the states and UTs and try to help them tackle the pandemic in a more effective manner.“The previous highest surge was 94,372 daily cases in September which is now 1,61,736 every day. There are 53 central teams which are camping in 53 districts of the country which are showing a surge in cases and these central teams are helping the district administration as well the state administration, particularly health department and revenue officials, in tackling the pandemic,” he added.The daily deaths are also showing an increasing trend. But the previous surge was 1,104 and it is presently 879 deaths.He said Maharashtra, UP, Delhi, Haryana and Gujarat are among states of concern.NITI Aayog member (Health) VK Paul said a serious situation is emerging. While the situation is worse in some states it is a countrywide problem and there has to be continued focus on test, track, trace and treat strategy and following COVID appropriate behaviour as well as embracing the vaccine, he said.“Everyone should wear a mask,” he said.Amid reports of shortage of remdesivir, he said the drug is to be given only to hospitalised, serious patients and those on oxygen support, and there is no question of its use in home setting and it is not to be procured from chemist shops.“As shortage of remdesivir was reported in some areas, its export was banned. This medicine is now available in plenty. We appeal to physicians to do rational, judicious use of remdesivir in hospitalised patients,” he said.Paul also stressed on embracing Ayush products for boosting immunity.

However, no decision has been taken so far. In case of any change, students will be informed well in advance,” they said, adding that the Education Ministry is “monitoring” the situation and is also in regular touch with the CBSE on the issue. “Both the Ministry and CBSE officials are considering whether the exams need to be deferred. There is still some time. All factors are being discussed. The safety of students and teachers will not be compromised,” they said.Meanwhile, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has also appealed to the CBSE to cancel the board exams. “Around six lakh children will write these exams and 1 lakh teachers will be involved. The examination centres can become hotspots. The health and well-being of children are very important. “I appeal to CBSE with folded hands that the exams be cancelled. Some other methods of evaluation can be thought of, either online or internal assessment perhaps. But cancelling these exams is crucial. Many countries have also cancelled exams, some Indian states have done it too. These exams should be cancelled too,” Kejriwal said. Notably, Maharashtra has already postponed the state board exams and so has the Uttar Pradesh Madhyamik Shiksha Parishad.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-growing-clamour-for-postponing-exams-cbse-and-govt-rethink-board-dates-238602

I had already informed senior health officials about the shortage of staff in the Sanchi civil hospital," she said.Halke Ram said he was assigned the task of sample collection by the BMO.He collected the swab samples on Tuesday as well.Meanwhile, Choudhary on Tuesday posted pictures of him campaigning for the April 17 Damoh assembly byelection.He was not available for comment.Madhya Pradesh on Monday logged the highest 6,489 coronavirus positive cases in a day, taking the tally of infections in the state to 3,44,634 while the death toll is 4,221. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gardener-collects-swabs-at-madhya-pradesh-hospital-due-to-staff-shortage-238596
14-04-2021||New Delhi||Indian economy may clock double-digit growth in 2021: Moody's||The second wave of COVID-19 infections presents a risk to India's growth forecast as the reimposition of measures to curb the spread of the virus will hit economic activity, but a double-digit GDP growth is likely in 2021 given the low level of activity last year, Moody's said on Tuesday.Moody's expects that given the focus on 'micro-containment zones' to deal with the current wave of infections, as opposed to a nationwide lockdown, the impact on economic activity would be less severe than that seen in 2020."India's very low coronavirus death count (only about 1,70,179 deaths have been recorded as of April 12) and relatively very young population also help mitigate risks. GDP is still likely to grow in  double digits in 2021 given the low level of activity in 2020," Moody's Investors Service said.In its commentary on India, Moody's said the countermeasures to combat the second wave – some of which are due to remain in place at least until the end of April – risk weakening the economic recovery. However, the targeted nature of containment measures and rapid progress on vaccinating the population will mitigate the credit-negative impact.In February, Moody's had bettered India's growth projection for the current fiscal year, which began on April 1, to 13.7 per cent as economic activity gathered pace. For the calendar year 2021, Moody's has projected economic growth rate at 12 per cent.As per official estimates, the Indian economy contracted 8 per cent in 2020-21 fiscal year, which ended on March 31, 2021."The second wave of infections presents a risk to our growth forecast as the reimposition of virus management measures will curb economic activity and could dampen market and consumer sentiment," Moody's said.Retail and recreational activity across India had dropped by 25 per cent as of April 7 compared with February 24, according to Google mobility data. This was mirrored in the Reserve Bank of India's March consumer confidence survey which showed a deterioration in perceptions of the economic situation and expectations of decreased spending on nonessential items, it noted.Moody's said vaccination will be a key element in controlling the second wave of COVID-19 as the authorities balance virus management against maintaining economic activity.India began its vaccination drive against COVID-19 in mid-January and has administered 100 million doses of the vaccine as of April 10, becoming the fastest country to reach that threshold so far.However, a shortage of vaccines and India's nearly 1.4 billion population, which includes many people living in rural, more remote locations, could slow the progress of the vaccine rollout, it added.As of early April, around 7 per cent of the population has been inoculated. The vaccination drive was expanded to all citizens aged 45 years and above, which is about 25 per cent of the population– from April 1.Workplace vaccination centres were also launched on April 11, through which the government expects to facilitate inoculation among workers, while minimizing risk."India has prioritized domestic vaccine distribution, delaying exports, amid the resurgence in coronavirus infections," Moody's said.The government also placed a temporary prohibition on the export of remdesivir, which is used in the treatment of coronavirus patients.India has been experiencing a second wave of coronavirus infections since March 2021."Daily new reported cases for the month totalled 1.1 million, jumping from the 0.4 million cases reported in February, which was the lowest since the country's 2.6 million peak in September 2020 during the first wave," Moody's said.Maharashtra, the epicentre of the second surge, accounted for close to 50 per cent of the active caseload as of April 12. Besides,  Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi and Karnataka have reported a sharp rise in daily cases. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-economy-may-clock-double-digit-growth-in-2021-moodys-238559
14-04-2021||Aditi Tandon||Govt to waive 'bridging study' to allow foreign-approved vaccines for emergency use||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 13Faced with growing pressures to hasten the delivery of COVID vaccines at home, the government on Tuesday agreed to waive the requirement of prior India bridging study to grant emergency use authorisation approval to foreign-made and -approved vaccines.This could mean early India approvals for Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines which have not done India-specific studies but have proven strong safety profiles in clinical trials abroad.The decision had been taken to allow for emergency use in India COVID vaccines approved by the drug regulators of the US, the EU, Japan and the UK.The government accepted a recommendation in this respect by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration headed by Member Health NITI Aayog VK Paul.The NEGVAC, after comprehensive deliberation, recommended that vaccines for COVID, which have been developed and are being manufactured in foreign countries and which have been granted emergency approval for restricted use by USFDA, EMA (European Medicines Agency), UK MHRA, PMDA Japan or which are listed in WHO (Emergency Use Listing) may be granted emergency use approval in India, mandating the requirement of post-approval parallel bridging clinical trial in place of conduct of local clinical trial as per the provisions prescribed under Second Schedule of the New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019.NEGVAC said the first 100 beneficiaries of such foreign vaccines would be assessed for seven days for safety outcomes before it is rolled out for further immunisation programme within the country.The Centre, after due consideration, has accepted the recommendation of NEGVAC.This decision, government said, would facilitate quicker access to such foreign vaccines by India and would encourage imports, including import of bulk drug material, optimal utilisation of domestic fill and finish capacity which will in turn provide a fillip to vaccine manufacturing capacity and total vaccine availability for domestic beneficiaries.India is following a comprehensive approach to tackling COVID-19 pandemic in a proactive and pre-emptive manner. In this context, as early as May 2020, India constituted a Task Force headed by the Principal Scientific Advisor to encourage research and development for vaccine manufacture and constituted in August 2020 an Expert Group headed by member, NITI, to assist in rollout of the Covid vaccination programme. It was because of these strategies that India became the first country to have two ‘Made in India’ Covid vaccines for domestic vaccination drive.Vaccination is one of the critical pillars of COVID control and management strategy adopted by the Centre. At present, two vaccines, that is, Covaxin by Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) and Covishield by Serum Institute of India (SII), have received Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the National Regulator (Drugs Controller General of India).The matter of augmenting the Basket of Vaccines available for fighting the pandemic as well as to accelerate the pace and coverage of domestic vaccination programme was discussed in the 23rd meeting of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) held on April 11 , chaired by VK Paul, Member (Health), Niti Aayog.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-to-waive-bridging-study-to-allow-foreign-approved-vaccines-for-emergency-use-238551

So, in the SOP released for the industry, we have put in place a mechanism to monitor it accordingly. Tourists and other visitors will not be harassed by stopping for corona reports on the state's borders because it causes a lot of inconvenience and difficulty to them," he told reporters here.As majority of the visitors will stay in hotels, the administration has put in place a mechanism to check the visitors from the seven states on their arrival at the place of their stay, he added.The Himachal Pradesh government on Sunday made it mandatory for people coming from seven states which have witnessed a spike in coronavirus cases to show a COVID-19 negative test report on entering the state.Thakur had said then that people coming from Punjab, Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh need to carry a negative RT-PCR report not earlier than 72 hours while visiting Himachal Pradesh from April 16.The chief minister arrived here this morning from Shimla on a day's visit.

14-04-2021||New Delhi||India to produce 850 million Sputnik V doses annually: RDIF||The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) has said more than 850 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine are going to be produced annually in India, which has also given approval for the emergency use of the vaccine against coronavirus infections in the country.The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has registered the vaccine under the emergency use authorisation procedure. This is based on results of clinical trials in Russia as well as positive data of additional Phase III local clinical trials in India conducted in partnership with Dr Reddy's Laboratories.The vaccine has been approved for use in countries with a total population of 3 billion people or about 40 per cent of the global population, and India has become the 60th country to approve Sputnik V, RDIF, Russia's sovereign wealth fund, said in a statement.India is also the most populated country to register the vaccine and also the leading production hub for Sputnik V, it added.On Monday, sources said DCGI has granted permission for the restricted emergency use of Sputnik V with certain conditions.Sputnik V will be the third vaccine to be used in India against coronavirus. In January, DCGI had given the emergency use authorisation for two COVID-19 vaccines -- Covaxin of Bharat Biotech and Covishield of Oxford-AstraZeneca manufactured by Serum Institute of India in Pune.RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev said approval of the vaccine is a major milestone as both countries have been developing an extensive cooperation on clinical trials of Sputnik V in India and its local production."The Russian vaccine has efficacy of 91.6 per cent and provides full protection against severe cases of COVID-19 as demonstrated by the data published in one of the leading medical journals, The Lancet," he added.Noting that India is a vaccine-manufacturing hub and a strategic partner for production of Sputnik V, he said RDIF has created partnerships with a number of India's leading pharmaceutical companies for production of Sputnik V which will provide for both vaccination of the population in India and global distribution of the vaccine."Over 850 million doses of Sputnik V are going to be produced in India annually sufficient to vaccinate more than 425 million people around the world," he said.According to the release, RDIF has agreements with India's Gland Pharma, Hetero Biopharma, Panacea Biotec, Stelis Biopharma and Virchow Biotech aimed at production of more than 850 million doses per year.As per RDIF, Sputnik V has a number of key advantages, including that there are no strong allergies caused by Sputnik V.The price of the vaccine is less than US$ 10 per shot and it uses two different vectors for the two shots in a course of vaccination, providing immunity with a longer duration than vaccines using the same delivery mechanism for both shots, it added.Other countries that have approved use of Sputnik V include Argentina, Bolivia, Hungary, UAE, Iran, Mexico, Pakistan, Bahrain and Sri Lanka.

14-04-2021||New Delhi||Fourth Covid wave: Infection spreading faster, high-grade fever, affecting younger population more in Delhi||The fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Delhi is causing high-grade fever, spreading faster and affecting the younger population, especially those in the age group of 30 to 50, more, according to experts.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said the fourth wave is more dangerous than the previous ones and according to data available with him, 65 per cent of patients infected this time are below 45 years.Experts: New Covid strain more dangerous for youthThe sudden spike in COVID-19 cases in Delhi over the last few days and across the country has baffled medical experts.Some doctors said the reason behind a large number of people contracting the infection this year vis-a-vis last year could be that the “virus has mutated” and the current strain is more infectious.“The younger population goes out for work, uses public transportation and hence, there are more chances of coming into contact with others. Many people are still not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing, which has contributed to the rise in cases,” said Suranjit Chatterjee, a senior consultant at Apollo Hospitals here.He, however, pointed out that the number of deaths in Delhi is still much lower compared to what was recorded during the previous waves in June, September and November.Chatterjee, a COVID-19 survivor himself, said doctors in their 40s and 50s and other younger healthcare workers, say in their 30s, are getting infected in the current wave despite most of them having taken both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.Thirty-seven doctors at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi have tested positive for COVID-19 during the fourth wave of the pandemic. Of these, five have been admitted for treatment, hospital sources had said last Thursday.Many of them had taken both doses of the Covishield vaccine, they had said.Richa Sareen, consultant, pulmonology and critical care medicine at Fortis hospital, said, “Given the pace of the spread of the infection, it definitely seems there is a different variant in circulation and it is more infectious than the previous one.”     She said the younger population is getting infected more. The elderly have mostly been vaccinated and largely stay at home but the younger population goes out for socialising or travelling and that increases the chance of getting infected.A senior doctor at the Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, which has been turned into a dedicated COVID-19 hospital again, agreed that the coronavirus infection is spreading rapidly among the younger population.The number of patients at the hospital has suddenly increased, he said.In the last week of March, when cases began to rise in the country, the Union health ministry had said the new “double mutant” variant of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in Delhi, Maharashtra and some other places in addition to the three “variants of concern”—first noticed in the UK, South Africa and Brazil—that have been found in at least 18 states and union territories.Various strains of SARS-CoV-2, including the UK, South Africa and Brazil variants, have been termed as highly transmissible by experts.Recently, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain also told reporters that it seemed that the younger population is getting infected more in the fourth wave of the pandemic.The Delhi government imposed a night curfew in the national capital from April 6 after reports were coming in that many people were holding parties and social gatherings, he had said.Delhi recorded its biggest daily rise of 10,774 COVID-19 cases on Sunday, prompting Kejriwal to issue a stark warning to residents that they should not step out of their homes unless it is urgent.
