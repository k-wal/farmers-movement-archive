From India, External Affairs Minister S.

10-04-2021||Ahmedabad||COVID-19: Gandhinagar municipal corporation polls postponed||The Gujarat State Election Commission (SEC) on Saturday decided to postpone the elections to the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation, scheduled to be held on April 18, due to the rise in COVID-19 cases, an official statement said.The elections are postponed for an indefinite period following a request made by the main political parties, including the BJP, the Congress and the AAP, and many social groups, it said.“Taking in view the grave situation caused by the pandemic, to maintain public health and to ensure that voting is done in a free and fair environment, the State Election Commission (SEC) has decided to postpone this election till further orders,” the SEC said.As per the earlier programme, the elections were scheduled to be held on April 18 and the counting of votes was to be taken up on April 20.Candidates had also filed their nomination papers.“We had received representations from all the political parties to postpone the elections,” it said, adding that other groups like NGOs and citizen organisations had also opposed holding elections at this time.“We had held a detailed review meeting in which we realised that a large number of people have been infected by the virus in this urban area and many people are living in containment zones. All those people and many others will not be able to vote freely due to the fear of the pandemic,” it said.The SEC further said it had reviewed the legal aspects of the decision and gone through many judgements of courts in such matters.Chief Minister Vijay Rupani had on Friday urged the SEC to postpone the Gandhinagar civic polls.In a letter to the SEC, Rupani had said that it’s natural that political leaders and their supporters would gather in large numbers for poll campaigning.“Moreover, a large number of government employees would also be engaged in the election-related work. In such a scenario, it is very much possible that COVID-19 infection would spread further. Thus, I urge the SEC to consider these factors and postpone the election to GMC in a larger public interest,” the CM had stated.Gujarat’s overall caseload stood at 3,37,015 and the death toll at 4,697 as on April 9, as per the state health department.

The birth anniversary of Jyotiba Phule is on April 11 and on April 14, there is the birth anniversary of Baba Saheb. Can we organise a ‘Tika Utsav: or vaccine festival and create an atmosphere of ‘Tika Utsav’?” he had said.“We should vaccinate as many eligible people through a special campaign and decide on zero wastage. If there is zero wastage in four days during ‘Tika Utsav’, it will also increase our vaccination capacity,” Modi had asserted.He has also called for making optimum utilisation of vaccination capacity.“Let’s see how we can mobilise things from April 11 to 14 and there will be satisfaction of achievement. It will greatly help in changing the situation. I have also told the Indian government to provide as many vaccine doses as possible,” he said.This should be our endeavour to vaccinate maximum eligible people during the ‘Tika Utsav’, Modi had asserted.The daily count of positive cases reached new record highs in the last few days despite having dipped to about 20,000 a few weeks back.While some states have flagged a “shortage” of vaccine doses, the Centre has maintained that a sufficient quantity of the jabs have been allocated to all the states and that many of them have been unable to inoculate all eligible beneficiaries.

10-04-2021||New Delhi||Tomar appeals to farmers to call off protest as COVID cases surge, says govt ready for talks||Amid a spike in COVID-19 cases, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar Saturday appealed to the farmers protesting at Delhi borders to call off their long-running agitation, saying the government is ready for a discussion whenever they come with a concrete proposal.Thousands of farmers have been protesting against the three new agri-marketing laws for nearly five months now, braving the raging pandemic. There has been no headway in the logjam over the issue since January 22, when the 11th and the last round of formal talks happened between the Central government and the protesting farmer unions.Read also: In pictures, cops forcibly remove protesters at Tewasan toll plaza to clear KMP expressway in HaryanaTomar expressed concerns about the farmers’ health and wellbeing as India witnessed a record surge of over 1.45 lakh coronavirus cases on Saturday. “Now in the second wave of pandemic, the entire nation and the world is following COVID-19 protocols. Even protesting farmers should follow the protocols. Their life is important for us,” Tomar said.“In the current COVID-19 situation, I urge them (agitating farmers) to call off their protest. The government is ready for a discussion whenever they come with a proposal,” he told reporters.Stating that there is no “dissatisfaction” among the farming community across the country over the new farm laws, the minister said many farm bodies in fact are in the favour these legislations, while some are opposing them.“Ours is a democratic country, be it farmers or citizens, if they have any doubt, the government believes it is its responsibility is to clear doubts and find a solution,” he said.The minister said the three laws were not drafted all of a sudden, but there was a long discussion in the past and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken it forward, he said.He said that normally any protest continues if the government is not ready for talks. But this government has held with open heart 11 rounds of discussion with representatives of protesting farm unions, yet their agitation did not stop, he said.In these meetings, the government had identified their concerns and offered them a proposal to suspend the laws for 1.5 years and set up a committee to examine them.“We proposed that a committee be set up to look into these laws and the MSP (issue) also. After the committee submits its report, the government will discuss. This proposal was welcomed across the country, but the protesting farmers rejected it without citing any reason,” he said.Farmers could have resumed their protest had they found the proposed committee’s recommendations unsatisfactory, he added.“We had told farm unions to come up with their own proposal and we were ready for discussion on that also,” the minister said, asserting the government is ready for talks even today.Tomar reiterated that he had appealed to the farmer unions in all 11 rounds of meetings to send back senior citizens and children from the protest sites in view of the pandemic.The minister also said the agitating farmers should understand that ordinary citizens are facing difficulty due to their sit-in protest at the border.India reported a record 1,45,384 fresh cases Saturday, pushing the tally to 1,32,05,926.The number of active cases also breached the 10-lakh mark again after around six-and-a-half months, while the death toll due to the viral disease has gone up to 1,68,436 with 794 more fatalities, the highest since October 18 last year.Delhi, meanwhile, reported 7,897 cases and 39 new fatalities Saturday.

10-04-2021||New Delhi||COVID-19: A year on, India's situation grimmer with 'more infectious' variants, surge in cases||When millions of Indians switched off lights and lit candles and earthen lamps in the early days of the pandemic in solidarity with COVID warriors, many probably though the fight will be over soon, but a year on, the situation has become grimmer.On April 10 last year, five days after millions responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's appeal to show the nation's "collective resolve and solidarity" in the fight against the coronavirus, the number of confirmed infections stood at 6,761, while the death toll was 206.Cut to the present, India registered a record 1,45,384 fresh COVID-19 cases on Saturday, pushing its infection tally to 1,32,05,926, while the death toll stood at 1,68,436.Delhi alone recorded over 8,500 new cases on Friday, while Maharashtra reported more than 58,000.As per the health ministry, 10 states -- Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan -- are showing a steep rise in daily COVID-19 cases at present. They accounted for 82.82 per cent of the new infections on Saturday, it said.The number of active cases has breached the 10-lakh mark again after around six-and-a-half months, and the country recorded 794 more fatalities in a day, the highest since October 18 last year.India crossed the grim milestone of one crore COVID-19 cases on December 19 last year. The spread of the virus slowed down briefly and there was an improvement in the situation in January 2021. The country's lowest daily spike of just 8,635 infections was reported on February 2.But the ebbing did not last long, and the infections began surging again in March 2021.A large number of healthcare workers have contracted the virus too, including those who have taken both doses of the vaccine.Over 9.78 crore COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered in the country so far to healthcare and frontline workers, and people above 45.India is racing against time to contain the second wave of the coronavirus by again imposing restrictions like night curfews and vaccinating over 20 lakh people daily.Making matters worse, several more infectious variants of the coronavirus have surfaced, and many experts believe it might be behind the surge of cases in the country.Three variants of concern have been identified – the UK variant, Brazil variant and the South African variant.India has also detected a new "double mutant" COVID-19 variant in states like Maharashtra and Delhi, where a surge of cases is being recorded. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-a-year-on-indias-situation-grimmer-with-more-infectious-variants-surge-in-cases-237326
10-04-2021||---||Remarks on central forces: Mamata tells EC have not violated model code, IPC||New Delhi, April 10Defending her remarks, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is learnt to have told the Election Commission on Saturday that she had the highest regard for central armed police forces, but there have been serious allegations of CAPF intimidating voters and influencing the electorate to cast their vote for a particular political party.Responding to a notice issued by the poll panel on Thursday seeking explanation over her “prima facie completely false, provocative and intemperate statements” against the central armed police forces deputed on election duty in the state, the Trinamool Congress chief denied the contents of the EC communication.Banerjee also urged the poll watchdog to rescind its notice, contending she has not violated the model code or the various sections of the Indian Penal Code.She claimed that a girl was allegedly molested by an unidentified CRPF personnel in the early hours of April 6 at Ramnagar, under Tarakeshwar police station and the matter was reported to the police which lodged an FIR.The TMC had complained with the state chief electoral officer. But to date, no tangible action has been taken nor an advisory or instruction issued by Election Commission to the central forces in this regard, she claimed.“I have the highest regard for the Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) and commend and laud their contributions to the safety and security of the country,” she said in her reply.But during the first three phases of polls in West Bengal, there have been serious allegations of CAPF resorting to intimidation of voters by exerting force, influencing the electorate to cast their votes for a particular political party, Banerjee is learnt to have alleged her reply.Her party has also lodged several complaints but only a few were redressed, she claimed.To drive home her point that she did not instigate people to carry out violent acts against the central forces, Banerjee also reproduced certain portions of her speech in her reply to the EC.“I tell you ladies, a group of you go and restrain (gherao) them while another group will go to cast their votes. One group will restrain them and another group will go to cast their votes. Don’t waste your vote if you engage yourself only in restraining them, they will be happy that you did not cast your vote. This is their plan. It is the plan of the BJP.”“And your plan will be that you will not be scared if they try to intimidate you coming to your village on the one hand, on the other you just talk to them. Talking to them will tantamount to restraining them. You don’t have to gherao them literally,” according to the portion of her speech cited in her reply.She said in her speech, she had only called upon the voters, specifically women voters, “to protest democratically by gherao if and when somebody (including CAPF) created any obstruction in their right to vote”.She said “gherao” is one of the democratic ways of registering public protest and there is no reason why gherao should be considered illegal. Banerjee said the term “gherao” has been a part of the political lexicon of West Bengal since late 1960.She said it has been used to connote peaceful “satyagraha” against authorities and she referred to “gherao” in her speech by way of verbal engagement and not a literal gherao.The TMC chief again targeted the Centre and the CAPF on Saturday, after four people were killed in firing by CISF personnel allegedly after coming under attack from locals who “attempted to snatch their rifles” in West Bengal’s Cooch Behar district.Banerjee said her government will initiate a CID probe into the incident and questioned the central forces’ version of firing in self-defence. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/remarks-on-central-forces-mamata-tells-ec-have-not-violated-model-code-ipc-237323

There are only three states that have received over 1 crore vaccine doses in the country. They are Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajashtan," Javadekar told reporters after attending a review meeting with Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar here.When asked about the blame game between the Centre and the state government over the availability of vaccine doses, the BJP leader said this is not the right time to do politics."When we will have to do politics, we will give a proper answer to these allegations. There is nothing greater than the interest of the people in the current situation," he said.    Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope had alleged that many states, which are smaller than Maharashtra in terms of population and the number of patients, have received more doses of vaccine.The state government had feared that the healthcare system will be overwhelmed if the cases continue to rise.A shortage of ventilator beds is being reported from various parts in Maharashtra, which has 5,34,603 active cases at present.Acknowledging the shortage of ventilators in Maharashtra, the Information and Broadcasting minister said: "I held a detailed discussion with concerned officials and ministers. 1,121 ventilators will be made available for Maharashtra in the next three to four days. 700 ventilators would be coming from Gujarat and 421 from Andhra Pradesh".Javadekar also said that oxygen supply has also been routed from the industrial production units and the Centre would help the state to get this oxygen supply.He said the Centre would provide funds for the manpower required for testing, tracking, tracing and treating patients from the National Health Mission."We consider this (pandemic) as a national calamity. All the states and people belong to us, so attention and solutions will be provided to those areas where the situation is critical," he said.Javadekar said more than 30 teams were sent to Maharashtra for reviewing the pandemic situation in various districts and they are considering measures to tackle the prevailing situation."In Pune also, a team under IAS officer Kunal Kumar has arrived and held a meeting with officials," he added.Maharashtra's cumulative caseload reached 32,88,540 on Friday, while the death toll stood at 57,329, as per the state health department.The state has been recording more than 55,000 cases over the past few days.In a bid to tackle the spike in cases, the state government had imposed various restrictions, including night curfew which will remain in force till April 30, besides weekend lockdowns from Friday night to Monday morning every week. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-got-1-10-crore-doses-javadekar-state-to-get-1121-ventilators-237319

10-04-2021||New Delhi||SC asks Centre, Punjab, 3 other states to respond on plea seeking repeal of provisions criminalising begging||The Supreme Court has asked the Centre and four states, including Maharashtra and Punjab, to file their response within three weeks on a plea seeking a direction to repeal the provisions criminalising begging.A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy noted in its order that though a notice was issued on the plea on February 10 this year, only Bihar has so far filed its response in the matter.“Although notice has been issued on February 10, 2021, a reply has been filed by the respondent - state of Bihar - only and other respondents have not yet filed their reply. Let reply be filed within three weeks,” the bench said in its order passed on Friday.The apex court has posted the matter for hearing after three weeks.The top court had in February sought a response from the Centre, and the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana and Bihar on the plea which has claimed that the sections of the statute criminalising begging are violative of constitutional rights.The plea filed by Meerut resident Vishal Pathak has referred to the August 2018 verdict of the Delhi High Court which had decriminalised begging in the national capital and said that provisions of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959 which treats begging as an offence cannot sustain constitutional scrutiny.“The provisions of the statutes criminalising the act of begging put people in a situation to make an unreasonable choice between committing a crime or not committing one and starving, which goes against the very spirit of the Constitution and violates Article 21 i.e. Right to Life,” said the plea, filed through advocate H K Chaturvedi.Referring to the Census 2011, the plea has said that the total number of beggars in India is 4,13,670 and the number has increased from the last census.It said that the government has the mandate to provide social security to everyone and ensure that all have basic facilities, as embedded in the Directives Principles of State Policy in the Constitution.“However, the presence of beggars is evidence that the State has failed to provide these basic facilities to all its citizens, thus instead of working on its failure and examining what made people beg, criminalising the act of beggary is irrational and against the approach of a socialist nation as embedded in the preamble of our Constitution,” the plea has claimed.It said that a person, who is compelled to beg due to certain circumstances, cannot be faulted for his actions.The plea has claimed that ‘The Abolition of Begging and Rehabilitation of Beggars Bill 2018’ was introduced in Lok Sabha but “till date, this bill is not passed and is wedged in length parliamentary procedures, that has resulted in thousands of poor facing more hardships because of present arbitrary statutes”.The petition has sought directions to declare as “illegal and void” all provisions, except some sections, of the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1959, Punjab Prevention of Beggary Act, 1971, Haryana Prevention of Begging Act, 1971 and Bihar Prevention of Begging Act 1951.It has also sought to declare all other similar Acts prevailing in any part of the country as illegal.

10-04-2021||New Delhi||Mutants, sluggish vaccine drive, carelessness: Add them and you get Covid surge, say top scientists||Why are India’s COVID-19 cases flaring up so sharply? There are no clear answers but top scientists say the complex interplay of mutant strains, a hugely susceptible population made more vulnerable by elections and other public events and the lowering of guard are primarily to blame.India’s COVID tally climbed to 1,32,05,926 (1.32 crore, 13.2 million) with a record spike of  1,45,384, the Union Health Ministry said on Saturday, in what many say is a second wave that is surging more powerfully than the first. And just like there were no answers to why there was a slide earlier this year, there is no clarity on why the numbers are rising so sharply.While there are many imponderables and many things unknown, virologists Shahid Jameel and T Jacob John are agreed that not following COVID-19 protocol, including informing people they must continue with precautions even after being vaccinated, and a sluggish vaccination drive are responsible.Jameel said the interplay of mutants and vaccines over the next couple of months will decide the future of Covid in India and the world.“The intensity of the surge also suggests that there were a huge number of susceptible people after the first wave,” the director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University in Haryana told PTI.The Centre warned earlier this week that the next four weeks are critical and people’s participation in helping control the second wave of the contagion is pivotal. NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul said the pandemic situation has worsened with a sharp rise in cases and a large part of the population still susceptible to the virus, without giving any clear explanation on why this is happening.The fact that people lowered the guard and didn’t follow Covid protocols after the first wave was over is “certainly one valid explanation” for the surge, Jameel said.“Everything opening up to pre-Covid levels and behaviour that was no longer risk-averse exposed the susceptible population in a big way. A new factor is emerging mutants—both imported and homegrown,” the eminent virologist added.John, professor of virology at Tamil Nadu’s Christian Medical College (CMC), concurred with Jameel, saying not following COVID-19 protocols is partly to blame for the new wave.“Lowering of the guard was led by the central government and followed by all political parties, all religious groups, and the public at large. Schools and colleges were opened without vaccinating all staff. This explains partly the second wave,” John told PTI.“Wherever infection was rising, stricter imposition of discipline should have been taken but with the elections ahead, no leader wanted that. Elections during pandemic had to be carefully planned,” the renowned virologist told PTI.The scientist also agreed that variants are the other reason for the second wave, adding that it was too late for India to look for mutants.“The two factors came together and we were leaderless in response at the critical time. The speed of spread in the second wave is twice as fast as in the first wave.  Partly due to variants and partly lowering of the guard,” John explained.Referring to a Health Ministry briefing on March 24, Jameel noted that the UK variants now show up in about 80 per cent of cases from Punjab.“A new double mutant has emerged in India and is reported in 15-20 per cent of cases analysed from Maharashtra. If this percentage goes up further, it would be a clear indication of its role in the Maharashtra surge,” said the virologist.In India, variants first identified in the UK, South Africa and Brazil have been found.In late March, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced that a new variant had been identified in samples of saliva taken from people in Maharashtra, Delhi and Punjab. The genome sequencing carried out by Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), a consortium of 10 labs in India, identified two important mutations in the variant dubbed as “double mutant”. Explaining that the UK variant is known to be about 50 per cent more infectious, Jameel said one of the two mutations in the double mutant was also found in California, US, where it was associated with increased transmission.The two experts also discussed the country’s vaccination drive.According to John, the government started the drive too late and no outcome goal of vaccination was defined.“India started slow vaccine rollout in January third week, but it was first a token reward to healthcare workers who were vaccinated even when there was no need—and we wasted a lot of vaccines,” he said.“Was advance purchase order given to vaccine companies to get production accelerated during last year itself before approvals were obtained? “ John asked.Jameel said there was “poor communication” by officials to people who were vaccinated on how they must continue with precautions like masks and social distancing.Describing India’s COVID-19 situation as “curious”, Jameel said the country was on a falling curve of daily infections when vaccinations started in mid-January.“For various reasons, those eligible, including healthcare and frontline workers, were hesitant to get vaccines. Those above 60 also did not show enough eagerness even though cases had started going up by early March.“Now we are on a very fast rising curve with only 0.7 per cent Indians having received both doses and only about 5 per cent having received one dose. That is too low to make an impact,” he added.He noted that there was no way to predict that younger people would be affected in this surge.“Make everyone above 18 eligible for vaccination in states experiencing the surge, while staying with the 45 plus eligibility in states not experiencing the surge. Vaccinations have to be balanced against the supply of vaccines,” Jameel said.Noting that supply may be an issue, Jameel said India has the capacity to inoculate with 10 million doses of Covishield vaccine per month and three million Covaxin doses per month.“Supply can also be boosted by giving emergency use approval to Johnson & Johnson vaccine and Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine. Both of these have received approvals in other countries and have manufacturing partners in India,” he added.According to the Health Ministry on Saturday, the number of active cases has breached the 10 lakh mark again after around six-and-a-half months, while the death toll due to the viral disease has gone up to 1,68,436 with 794 more fatalities, the highest since October 18 last year.The active caseload was at its lowest at 1,35,926 on February 12, accounting for only 1.25 per cent of the total number of cases in the country.In a recent study, scientists, including those from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, predicted that the ongoing second-wave could peak by mid-April, following which the infections may see a steep decline by the end of May.

10-04-2021||Bhopal||Streets, markets empty as Madhya Pradesh weekend lockdown kicks in||Streets and markets in most cities of Madhya Pradesh wore a deserted look on Saturday, uncharacteristic for the weekend, as a 60-hour lockdown started showing effect.The lockdown came into force at 6 pm on Friday.Among these places, Ratlam, Betul, Katni, Khargone and Chhindwara districts, all bordering Maharashtra, have been seeing record spikes in infections over the past few days.Ratlam and Betul will be under lockdown for nine days, while it will be from Friday till the morning of April 16 in Chhindwara, close to Nagpur, the biggest city in Maharashtra's Vidarbha region.The lockdown will be in force for a period of seven days, which started on Friday night, in Khargone and Katni, officials said.However, thanks to an Assembly bypoll scheduled for April 17, Damoh remained "open" for campaigning, officials pointed out.An order on the lockdown issued by Additional Chief Secretary Rajesh Rajora has said essential services like ferrying of goods from other states will continue, chemist and ration stores, hospitals, petrol pumps, banks, ATMs, milk and vegetable shops will remain open, and there won't be any let up in vaccination and other emergency works either.The urban areas of the state are also under night curfew, which will be in force till April 30.In the last three days, Madhya Pradesh reported over 4,000 cases daily, with Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday saying the number of active COVID-19 cases in the state might reach one lakh by the end of this month given the spike in infections.In a worrying sign, the state's positivity rate jumped from 1.1 per cent in January-end to 13 per cent now. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/streets-markets-empty-as-madhya-pradesh-weekend-lockdown-kicks-in-237307
10-04-2021||New Delhi||Attack on CISF QRT, injury to child triggered Bengal poll booth violence, say sources||A Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) quick reaction team allegedly coming under attack during a security patrol and injury to a child in the commotion are stated to have triggered the violence at a polling booth in West Bengal’s Cooch Behar district which left four people dead on Saturday, official sources said.They said it all started around 9:35 am when a CISF team led by an Inspector-rank officer was inspecting the Jor Patki area of Sitalkuchi constituency jointly with the local police with an aim to “clear the elements” that were stopping voters from reaching the polling booth no 126 at Amtali Madhyamik Shiksha Kendra and other locations nearby.The security personnel intervened to stop this crowd of about 50-60 people, and in this commotion a child fell down. After this, some “miscreants” attacked the four-wheeler carrying the CISF quick reaction team (QRT) and the personnel on-board, the sources said.“The QRT reacted in self-defence and fired six rounds in air to disperse the mob. Later, a Deputy Commandant rank officer and in-charge of the CISF unit (567/Charlie Company) reached the spot and pacified the mob. He later left,” a senior officer said.About an hour later, the officials said, a group of about 150 people reached the polling booth no 186 in the vicinity, and “manhandled the polling staff”.The crowd allegedly beat up a homeguard and an ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) worker and also tried to snatch the weapon of the on-duty CISF personnel when they intervened, they said.As the mob got “aggressive”, two rounds were fired in the air. But sensing the “imminent danger to their life”, the security personnel fired another seven bullet rounds towards the crowd, the officials said.Four people were killed in the firing by the central forces, police said.In the meantime, a CISF QRT and some reinforcements from the local police reached the spot, they said, adding the polling was halted even as the crowd began to melt soon.In Delhi, the Election Commission later ordered the adjournment of polls at polling station number 126 in the Sitalkuchi Assembly constituency.The Central Industrial Security Force is an armed police force under the Union Home Ministry and is tasked to guard major civil airports and vital installations in the country. It has deployed multiple companies for providing security during the eight-phased assembly polls in West Bengal. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/attack-on-cisf-qrt-injury-to-child-triggered-bengal-poll-booth-violence-say-sources-237305
10-04-2021||New Delhi||COVID-19: Lockdown not an option, some restrictions will be imposed, says Delhi CM||Amid escalating cases of COVID-19 in Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said lockdown is "not an option" but some restrictions will be put in place in the national capital which is reeling under the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic.The chief minister said this during an interaction with reporters after visiting the LNJP Hospital—the mainstay of Delhi's fight against COVID-19—to review its preparedness."Lockdown is not an option, however, we will be putting some restrictions in place to contain the spread of the virus. We will release the restrictions in the coming few days. COVID centres are being rebuilt and some have already started functioning," he was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the chief minister's office.Kejriwal said the administration and hospitals are working to contain the fourth wave of the pandemic in the city."We are currently in a comfortable position with reference to beds and ventilators. We will ensure that the people of Delhi stay safe, to the best of our abilities," he added.  Coronavirus cases in Delhi have mounted at a very rapid rate in the last few days, and the number of deaths too have risen.Delhi recorded 8,521 fresh cases of COVID-19 on Friday, the highest single-day surge since November 11 last year, while 39 more people died due to the coronavirus infection, taking the death toll to 11,196.  The highest single-day spike in Delhi till date -- 8,593 cases -- was reported on November 11 in 2020, while on November 19, the city had recorded 131 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day fatality count till date."Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal visited the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan hospital on Saturday, to review its preparation in the face of the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic that has hit Delhi. He took stock of the situation and the facilities provided to the patients in the hospital," the statement said.At present, 1,500 beds out of 2,000 are reserved for COVID-19 patients, and the number might be increased according to requirements in the future, Kejriwal said."The last few days have seen a rise in the number of corona cases in the entire country, including Delhi. We need to simultaneously spearhead an aggressive vaccination campaign and also put in place measures that can effectively contain the spread of the virus along with making the hospital management equally effective," he said. This is the fourth wave of COVID-19 in Delhi. The last wave was in November after which the new cases had become so few in Delhi that "health system and agencies began to lax", he was quoted as saying in the statement.It is imperative that they gain their momentum again and begin to function in the same efficient manner that they did, which helped contain the spread of the virus, the chief minister said.    "The Delhi government and hospitals of Delhi are working in earnest to revert to their November level of preparation that helped contain the virus," he said.  The Delhi government-run LNJP Hospital has 2000 beds. During the last wave, all 2000 were declared as COVID beds.  Right now, we have declared 1,500 of those as COVID beds, 500 are still non-COVID. Slowly, the outpatient department will also be shut at the hospital and if the situation demands, all 2,000 will be made available for COVID patients, the chief minister said."Whatever is required by the hospitals from our end, will be provided. We sincerely hope and pray to God that no one falls prey to the disease but in the scenario that they do, we will ensure that the hospitals are ready for the challenge and the people of Delhi face no obstacles in recovery," he said.Asked about the vaccination campaign and preparation of the government in the face of rising cases, Kejriwal said, "I have written a letter to the prime minister (Narendra Modi), in which I have said that if adequate doses of the vaccination are made available to us; if we are given permission to increase the number of vaccination centres and if the age limit is removed then within 2-3 months we can vaccinate the entire state"."I cannot talk about the rest of the country, but according to Delhi government's level of preparation, if these three pre-conditions are met, we can assure you that all residents of Delhi will be vaccinated within 2-3 months," Kejriwal asserted.Once everyone is vaccinated, it will greatly aid in containing and ending the severity of the virus, he said."At the moment, we have vaccination for 7-10 days and the conditions for administering them, particularly the age limit, are very rigid. According to me, there is an impending need to remove these obstacles that are coming in the way of the vaccination campaign," the statement said.During his visit to the hospital, Kejriwal also spoke to a patient admitted in the COVID-19 ward through a video call facility and enquired about his condition. With the help of the video call facility at LNJP, patients can directly talk to their family members, the statement said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-lockdown-not-an-option-some-restrictions-will-be-imposed-says-delhi-cm-237303

10-04-2021||New Delhi||Kejriwal only leader with vision, PM should call him to discuss schemes for common people: Sisodia||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is the only leader with a vision for development, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi should discuss with him schemes to improve the lives of people and not create hurdles for them, senior AAP leader Mainsh Sisodia said on Saturday.Addressing a press conference here, the deputy chief minister also claimed that all political parties were promising to follow the "Kejriwal model" of governance in states where elections are being held.While the three-phase election in Assam and the single-phase polls in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry are over, the fourth leg of the eight-phase West Bengal assembly election was held on Saturday."Kejriwal is the only leader who has a vision for the country. He understands the problems being faced by the common people and their needs, and the way for development. He has the capability of taking the country in the right direction. Other parties are following his policies. What he promises, he does," Sisodia said. "We hope that the prime minister, who is the leader of the nation, would agree to our suggestions because he will not become any smaller if he does. He should invite Chief Minister Kejriwal every fortnight for tea to exchange notes on governance and share their vision for the development of our nation," he said.Sisodia said that "we sincerely hope there won't be any further hurdles in our road to development".  The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader claimed that Delhi has become a laboratory for developing various policies for development. "Whether it is giving 200 units free electricity or free bus rides for women, all political parties are promising these schemes in other states where elections are being held," he added.  Sisodia said recently when Union Home Minister Amit Shah was campaigning in West Bengal, he promised free electricity up to 200 units should the BJP be elected to power in the state.  "In Kerala, the BJP has promised free public transport for women, and in Tamil Nadu, the party has said that they will bring in a model of governance that is similar to what can be seen in Delhi," he said. Sisodia said, "In Assam, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has promised free electricity. Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has announced free rides for women in public buses despite the fact that there are not enough public buses in Punjab." He said that he has noted that the BJP and the Congress are fighting elections across the country on the foundation of the Kejriwal model of governance."They are forging ahead on the basis of the Arvind Kejriwal model of governance, and this gives us immense pleasure," Sisodia said.  Talking about the recent interaction that the prime minister held with chief ministers on COVID-19 management, he said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has insisted upon the relevance of home isolation and how it is a strong line of defence in containing COVID-19; he mentioned the importance of creating micro-containment zones across the country."  Last year, the Delhi government had made these recommendations and later implemented, the deputy chief minister said.Sisodia claimed that it is only Arvind Kejriwal who knows how to take the nation in the right direction through his impeccable leadership.  "Delhi has become a paragon of governance and development in every sphere, right from its economy to hospitals to schools,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kejriwal-only-leader-with-vision-pm-should-call-him-to-discuss-schemes-for-common-people-sisodia-237295

You have to go out of power. Didi is asking people to attack and gherao security forces who are here to protect the rights of the people of the state," he said.Attacking Banerjee over the culture of violence and "tolabaji" (extortion), Modi said people of Bengal had made up their mind to defeat the TMC."Didi, you don't preside over the destiny of the people of Bengal, they are not your 'jagir' (fiefdom)," he said.North Bengal, he said, was critical to national security which has been undermined due to appeasement politics of Banerjee.Reaching out to the numerically strong Dalit Rajbongshi and Matua communities, Modi said the TMC insults them, and claimed a party leader was shown in a video likening the scheduled caste people to beggars. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-condoles-death-in-cisf-firing-in-cooch-behar-blames-tmc-for-violence-237290

She said she had long apprehended that the forces' would act in such a manner. "As BJP knows it has lost the people's mandate, they are conspiring to kill people," Banerjee added.She alleged this was part of a conspiracy hatched by the Union home minister."However, I would ask everyone to remain calm and cast their vote peacefully. Avenge  the deaths by defeating them," she said.Banerjee said that the death toll in this election was far higher than that in the  Panchayat elections held three years ago. "If you count the total number of killings since the elections began some 17-18 persons were killed. At least 12 people belonged to our party alone."Banerjee said the EC too owed the people an explanation on today's incident."We are not in charge of the administration. The EC is in charge of administration," she pointed out."They have removed the senior IPS Surajit Kar Purakaystha. They have removed my OSD Ashok Chakraborty, who is a lower ranked retired officer from RPF. Yet the EC bringing in retired officers to oversee polls here," she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-demands-union-home-ministers-resignation-over-central-forces-firing-killing-4-during-polling-237288

10-04-2021||Washington||India needs to grow faster to make up for contraction during Covid pandemic: IMF||India, which is projected to grow at an impressive rate of 12.5 per cent this year, needs to grow at a much faster pace to make up for the unprecedented contraction of eight per cent that it clocked during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, according to a senior IMF official.International Monetary Fund Deputy Chief Economist Petya Koeva Brooks, in an interview to PTI on Friday, also made a strong case for an additional economic stimulus to address the impact of the pandemic on the country's economy."When it comes to India there was a major collapse of output last fiscal year and the number as you mentioned is eight."So, we are very glad to see the strong rebound this year with projected growth of 12.5 for fiscal year 21-22 and we are seeing also high frequency indicators including PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index), and trade and more mobility indicators which give us a sense that there is continued recovery in the first quarter of this year," she said.That said, there are some recent emergencies of the new variants in the localised lockdowns that are seen as one of the threats to this recovery, Brooks noted.“On the recovery itself, when it comes to level in terms of the level of output, we are expecting that level to return to the pre-crisis one from 2019 to this fiscal year. That is what we have in our projections.Noting that the Indian government took several steps to address the COVID-19 crisis, Brooks said, “We have seen policy responses, which have been coordinated and in several areas. We have seen that the fiscal support, the monetary easing as well as the liquidity and regulatory measures that were taken."What makes sense is to maintain the focus on having that coordinated policy response because this is what's going to prevent the long-term damage to the economy. Providing that support to small and medium-sized firms as well as vulnerable houses would be particularly important, she said.Brooks said the IMF very much welcomes the measures that were announced by India during its budget. It is particularly supportive of maintaining the accommodative fiscal stance and also emphasising expenditures on health and infrastructure.

The 7th fleet of the US Navy, in a public announcement, said, “USS John Paul Jones asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands. This freedom of navigation operation (FONOP) upheld the rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging India’s excessive maritime claims.”The MEA said the US warship was continuously monitored transiting from Persian Gulf towards Malacca Straits. It stated India’s position on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). “The convention does not authorise other states to carry out in the EEZ, military exercises, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state,” it said.The US said its act was consistent with international law while India’s claims were not. “India requires prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its EEZ or continental shelf, a claim inconsistent with the international law,” the statement of the 7th fleet said.The US statement has come even as five countries, including four Quad members, are in the middle of a three-day (April 7-9) military exercise in Bay of Bengal near the straits of Malacca, the busy shipping way that leads to China.Former Indian Navy Chief Admiral Arun Prakash tweeted, “There is irony here. While India ratified the UN law of the seas in 1995, the US has failed to do it. For it to carry out freedom of navigation missions in Indian EEZ in violation of our domestic law is bad enough. But publicising it? US please switch on IFF (identification of friend or foe).” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-prior-consent-us-navy-holds-drill-in-indian-waters-237117

He was to mark his 100th birthday on June 10.Prince Philip did not have to serve as the understudy. His consort for less than a decade was crowned Queen Elizabeth II after the death of her father. Since then he was always handed promotions by his wife. In the closing years, at the age of 90, the Queen made him the Lord High Admiral. And around the time he demitted his official duties in 2017, the Queen awarded him the Royal Victorian Order that made him a Knight Grand Cross.Prince Philip kept his head down all through the turbulence in the royal household and when he retired from official duties, he had completed a staggering 22,000 solo engagements. He remained useful whenever the Queen was rolled out by the British State to endorse political milestones, like attending a church ceremony to mark the end of combat operations in Afghanistan.Prince Philip and had four children but they never bore his last name. “I’m nothing but a bloody amoeba. I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children,” a biography of the Queen quoted him as saying. The Prince made three royal visits to India. During his 1961 visit, he was pictured with the Queen and the Maharaja and Maharani of Jaipur with a dead eight-foot tiger he had shot while on a hunt. It happened to be the same year he became president of the World Wildlife Fund, UK. He also shot a crocodile and mountain sheep on that trip but it was the photograph of the tiger that created the ripples. During Prince Philip’s last visit to India to mark the 50th anniversary of independence in 1997, he joined the Queen on a visit to Jallianwala Bagh where the royals laid a commemorative wreath at the site where General Dyer had opened fire at a Baisakhi gathering on April 13, 1919.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/queens-steadfast-consort-prince-philip-passes-away-237125

This is a single mother who has to face many issues because of blocked roads,” the Bench said posting the matter for further hearing on Monday.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appeared for the governments of Delhi, UP and Haryana.As the main roads connecting Delhi and Noida remain blocked since the beginning of protests against farm laws in November last, the Supreme Court had on March 29 issued notice to the Centre and the UP government on a petition by a woman who said commuting had become a nightmare for her.Acting on the PIL filed by Monicca Agarwaal – a resident of Noida and a single parent with some medical issues, a Bench had asked the Centre and Uttar Pradesh government to explain why the roads connecting Delhi and Noida were not kept free from blockades.“We consider it appropriate to issue notice to the Union government and others to ensure that the road area is kept clear so that the passage from one place to another is not affected,” it had said.Agarwaal said though her work place was in Noida she had to travel to Delhi frequently as she was in a marketing job.Noting that it was taking two hours instead of the normal 20 minutes, she contended that it had become a nightmare to commute between Noida and Delhi.Maintaining that “democracy and dissent go hand in hand”, the Supreme Court had on October 7, 2020 ruled that roads and public spaces can’t be blocked indefinitely and demonstrations expressing dissent have to be in designated places alone.On February 9, the top court dismissed a petition seeking review of the verdict, saying the right to protest can’t be anytime and everywhere.Agarwaal pointed out that despite directions issued by the top court to keep the roads blockade-free nothing had happened.Noting that a judicial view had already been taken and the matter reflected an administrative failure, the Bench agreed to take up the matter after the petitioner said the court should ensure that people’s right to passage wasn’t hindered.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/public-roads-cant-be-blocked-in-protest-supreme-court-236928

10-04-2021||New Delhi/Kolkata||EC notice to Mamata Banerjee over remarks on Central forces; TMC chief says ‘I don’t care’||The Election Commission has issued a notice to Mamata Banerjee for her “completely false, provocative and intemperate statements” against central forces performing election duty in West Bengal, provoking a defiant TMC boss to declare she will continue doing so until “the CRPF stops working for BJP”.The notice issued on Thursday night said the West Bengal chief minister prima facie violated various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Model Code of Conduct with her remarks against the central forces.The chief minister has been asked to respond to the notice by 11 am on Saturday.“... prima facie, completely false, provocative and intemperate statements made byMamata Banerjee... attempts to berate and vilify Central Paramilitary Forces during electoral process are causing extreme demoralisation amongst ranks and file of these forces...,” the notice said.It lauded the CAPFs for rendering a yeoman’s service since late 80s election after election, especially in ensuring area domination and causing deterrence for anti-social hooligans with their sheer presence.Banerjee, on the campaign trail, reacted angrily.She repeated her accusation that the poll watchdog was doing the BJP and home minister’s bidding.“I will continue speaking about the CPRF until they stop working for the BJP. Once they stop doing that, I will salute them. I do not care anything about your (EC’s) show-cause letters. You are working at the behest of the BJP. I wonder why there is no MCC violation when the PM campaigns on polling days,” Mamata told a rally at Jamalpur in Purba Bardhaman.Banerjee, at her election rallies, has often accused central forces of intimidating voters “under instructions from Union Home Minister Amit Shah” and also asked women to restrict their movement.This is the second notice to Banerjee in the last  few days.On Wednesday, the poll body had issued her a notice over her alleged appeal for votes along communal lines, saying it was in violation of the model code and the Representation of People Act.The notice said going by the statements made by her on March 28 and April 7, “and the historicity of the subsequent statements... it is more than obvious that MsBanerjee... has been consistent in berating and demoralising the Central Para Military Forces, who often played a significant role in assisting concerned state government and governments of union territories in restoration of law and order ... .”     The notice quoted Banerjee as accusing the central paramilitary forces of threatening women voters and not allowing them to exercise their franchise.“...And if CAPF create disturbances, I tell you ladies, a group of you go and restrain (gherao) them while another group will go to cast their votes. Don’t waste your vote. If you engage yourself only in restraining them they will be happy that you did not cast your vote. This is their plan. It is the plan of BJP.“And your plan will he that you will not be scared if they try to intimidate you coming to your village on the one hand, on the other you just talk to them. Talking to them will be tantamount to restraining them. You don’t have to gherao them literally,” the notice, quoting Banerjee, said.

10-04-2021||New Delhi||India-China military talks focus on further disengagement in eastern Ladakh||India and China held another round of military talks on Friday to take forward the disengagement process in the remaining friction points such as Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang in eastern Ladakh, people familiar with the development said.The 11th round of the Corps Commander-level talks began at around 10:30 am at the Chushul border point on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, they said.The 10th round of the military dialogue took place on February 20, two days after both militaries concluded the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of the Pangong lake. The talks lasted for around 16 hours.The Indian delegation at Friday's talks is led by Lieutenant General PGK Menon, the Commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps.One of the people cited above said India will insist on completing the disengagement process at the remaining friction points at the earliest.Late last month, Army chief General MM Naravane said the threat to India has only "abated" following the disengagement in the Pangong lake areas, but it has not gone away altogether.The border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of the Pangong lake in February, in line with a disengagement agreement.India has been insisting that the resolution of the outstanding issues, including at Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra, is essential for the overall ties between the two countries.

10-04-2021||Satya Prakash||An adult is free to choose his religion: Supreme Court||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 9Maintaining that an adult is free to choose a religion of his or her choice, the Supreme Court on Friday refused to entertain a BJP leader's PIL seeking directions to ban black magic, superstition and fraudulent religious conversions."We don't see a reason why a person above 18 years can't choose his or her religion," a Bench headed by Justice RF Nariman said, terming Upadhyay's PIL a "publicity interest litigation".The top court said there was a reason why the word “propagate” figured in Article 25 of the Constitution, which guaranteed right to religion.After the top court's refusal to entertain his PIL, Upadhyay chose to withdraw it. Later, the BJP leader said he would approach the Ministry of Law and Justice and the Law Commission with his demand.Upadhyay -- a Delhi BJP leader and an advocate-- had sought directions to the Centre and states to ban black magic, superstition and fraudulent and forcible religious conversions. He wanted the top court to ask the government to appoint a committee to ascertain the feasibility of enacting anti-conversion law to check the abuse of religion.Highlighting incidents of forceful religious conversion by "carrot and stick" and use of black magic “reported every week throughout the country, Upadhyay had pointed out that the Supreme Court had in the Sarla Mudgal Case (1995) directed the Centre to ascertain the feasibility of enacting an anti-conversion law.“The law may provide that every citizen who changes his religion cannot marry another wife unless he divorces his first wife. The provision should be made applicable to every person whether he is a Hindu or a Muslim or a Christian or a Sikh or a Jain or a Buddhist. Provision may be made for maintenance and succession etc. also to avoid clash of interest after death...This would go a long way to solve the problem and pave the way for a unified civil code," he had submitted, quoting from the Sarla Mudgal verdict.In fact, the victims of such forcible conversions were often socially and economically under privileged people, particularly belonging to the SC-ST, Upadhyay had contended.Terming forceful as a violation of right to equality, right to life and liberty and right to religion guaranteed under Articles 14, 21 and 25 of the Constitution, he had said it was also against the principles of secularism – an integral part of basic structure of Constitution.Accusing the Government of having failed to take any concrete action against these menace so of the society, he had said, the “Centre is empowered to make special provisions for the benefit of women and children under Article 15(3) and freedom of conscience, free profession, practice and propagation of religion under Article 25 is subject to public order, morality, health and other provisions of Part-III.”Alternately, he had demanded that the Law Commission should be asked to prepare a report on “Black Magic, Superstition and Religious Conversion within three months in spirit of the Judgment in Sarla Mudgal Case.”Being custodian of the Constitution and protector of fundamental rights, the court should use its plenary constitutional power to pass directions to stop conversion by carrot and the stick, he had submitted.The SC refused to entertain a PIL seeking an independent probe into the Nandigram episode in which Mamata Banerjee allegedly got injured. Top court asks petitioners to approach the Calcutta High Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/an-adult-is-free-to-choose-his-religion-supreme-court-236828
10-04-2021||Ajay Banerjee||US Navy sails in Indian Exclusive Economic Zone; asserts it is right, India’s claim wrong||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 9  In what could lead to serious questions on the India-US relations, the US Navy has announced that it  has ‘asserted’ navigational rights in the Arabian Sea and inside India’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), without requesting India’s prior consent.The 7th Fleet of the US Navy has made an announcement about one of its warships saying “USS John Paul Jones (it) asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands. This freedom of navigation operation (“FONOP”) upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging India’s excessive maritime claims.”Also read: US sail unlikely to raise diplomatic heatThe US said its act was consistent with international law while India’s claims were not in order of the international law. “India requires prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, a claim inconsistent with international law,” the statement of the 7th fleet said.The statement said, “We conduct routine and regular FONOPs, as we have done in the past and will continue to in the future. FONOPs are not about one country, nor are they about making political statements.”US forces operate in the Indo-Pacific region on a daily basis. All operations are designed in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, it said.Former Indian Navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash tweeted, “There is irony here. While India ratified UN Law of the Seas in 1995, the US has failed to do it so far. For the 7th Fleet to carry out FoN (Freedom of Navigation) missions in Indian EEZ in violation of our domestic law is bad enough. But publicising it? USN please switch on IFF (identification of friend or foe).”The Indian Navy is yet to respond.Two years ago, a Chinese survey vessel was driven out of the EEZ off the coast of Andaman and Nicobar Islands on the same grounds that it had no prior permission.The US statement has come even as five countries, including four members of the Quadrilateral or ‘Quad’ countries, are in the middle of a military exercise in the Bay of Bengal near the strait of Malacca, the busy shipping way that leads to China.The ‘Quad’ — India , US, Japan and Australia — along with the French Navy are doing a first-of-its kind multi-lateral maritime exercise, La Pérouse.India conveys concerns to USMeanwhile, India on Friday said it has conveyed concerns to the United States over a US Navy ship carrying out a freedom of navigation operation in the Indian exclusive economic zone (EEZ).In a statement, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said US Navy ship John Paul Jones was continuously monitored transiting from the Persian Gulf towards the Malacca Straits.India’s reaction came after the US Navy, in an unusual move, announced that one of its ships conducted patrols in the Indian EEZ this week, without seeking consent from India.“The USS John Paul Jones was continuously monitored transiting from the Persian Gulf towards the Malacca Straits. We have conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the government of USA through diplomatic channels,” the MEA said.It said India’s stated position has been that the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea does not authorise other countries to carry out military exercises or manoeuvres in an EEZ and on the continental shelf without the consent of the coastal nation.“India’s stated position on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea is that the convention does not authorise other States to carry out in the Exclusive Economic Zone and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal State,” the MEA said. —with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-navy-sails-in-indian-exclusive-economic-zone-asserts-it-is-right-indias-claim-wrong-236827
