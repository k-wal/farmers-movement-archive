26-04-2021||London||First ventilators, oxygen concentrators dispatched from UK to India||The first life-saving assistance package to help India meet the urgent need for ventilators and oxygen concentrators in its devastating second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has been dispatched by the UK and is due to arrive in New Delhi in the early hours of Tuesday.Further shipments, paid for by the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), are being organised over the course of this week and will include nine airline container loads of supplies, including 495 oxygen concentrators, 120 non-invasive ventilators and 20 manual ventilators.The focus at the moment is on expediting a constant flow of the equipment required immediately on the ground in the most efficient way, UK government sources said.In the longer term, discussions are ongoing to coordinate the response across government departments, the High Commissions of both countries and Indian diaspora groups in Britain to address the needs and requirements in India, where hospitals continue to struggle with supply shortages as the country recorded over three lakh coronavirus cases for the fifth day on Monday.Over the weekend, the FCDO had announced that following discussions with the Government of India, more than 600 pieces of vital medical equipment will be sent to India to support the country in its fight against COVID-19.“Vital medical equipment, including hundreds of oxygen concentrators and ventilators, is now on its way from the UK to India to support efforts to prevent the tragic loss of life from this terrible virus,” said Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who said the UK stands side by side with India as a “friend and partner” during a deeply concerning time.UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who also referred to India as a “very important partner”, held talks with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Monday.“Discussed our cooperation to address different aspects of the COVID challenge. Also reviewed progress in our bilateral agenda,” Jaishankar said in a Twitter statement following the call.The FCDO has said the equipment on its way to India will be crucial in helping to save the lives of many vulnerable people. The oxygen concentrators can extract oxygen from the air in the atmosphere so that it can be provided to patients, taking the strain off hospital oxygen systems and allowing oxygen to be provided in situations where hospital oxygen supplies have run out.The UK government said its Department of Health and Social Care worked closely with the National Health Service (NHS), as well as suppliers and manufacturers in the country, to identify reserve medical equipment from surplus stocks that can be transported to India.The UK has categorised the assistance package as the latest example of UK-India collaboration throughout this pandemic, to the benefit of both countries and the world.             Its delivery coincides with the week set aside for Boris Johnson’s visit to India during which his talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi were to pave the way to an Enhanced Trade Partnership.A planned virtual session between the two leaders has been scheduled for early May, but the timing may be affected by the pandemic crisis in India.

A day before, the financial capital had registered 5,542 new cases and 64 fatalities.The city had witnessed 4,758 new cases on March 30 and after that, it registered a sudden surge in infections. On April 4, Mumbai had added a record 11,163 cases and 10,000-plus infections on a couple of days in the current month.The number of daily cases has been gradually declining in the last few days.In the last 24 hours, Mumbai saw 28,328 COVID-19 tests, the lowest this month, taking the number of samples examined so far to 52,72,062, the data showed.Also, 9,150 patients were discharged from hospitals during the day, pushing the number of recovered cases to 5,46,861, the civic body said.With this, the tally of active cases has gone down to 70,373, it said.Since the last few days, the number of discharged patients has been higher than the new COVID-19 cases.According to BMC’s data, Mumbai’s COVID-19 recovery rate has improved to 87 per cent, while the infection growth rate has dropped to 1.09 per cent.The case doubling rate improved to 62 days, the civic body said.According to the BMC, the number of active containment zones in slums and ‘chawls’ (old row tenements) stood at 104, while the city currently has 1,084 sealed buildings.Earlier in the day, Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the Maharashtra government’s COVID-19 task force, said Mumbai may have turned the corner in its fight against the pandemic.The turnaround was due to the metropolis tackling the surge during the second COVID-19 wave with an “ATM strategy”, which is ‘Assess, Triage and Transfer, and Management’, he said.Dr Joshi, an endocrinologist, told PTI that Mumbai may have hit the second wave peak and the flattening phase could have begun.“During the first wave (last year), Mumbai used to hardly conduct 15,000 to 18,000 tests. However, during the second wave (which started around mid-February), the test numbers range between 40,000 and 50,000.“Mumbai has passed the peak as cases are plateauing, but the plateau could be longer,” Joshi said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-3-876-mumbai-logs-lowest-covid-19-cases-since-march-30-244541

26-04-2021||New Delhi||Social distancing, use of masks essential to prevent spread of COVID: Govt||Social distancing and use of masks are essential measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus infection, the government said on Monday.Addressing a news conference, Lav Agrawal, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, cited studies to buttress the point.He said many universities have researched that if a COVID-19 positive person does not follow the social distancing measures, then in 30 days the person can infect 406 people.“If the infected person reduces physical exposure by 50 per cent, then it has been found that 15 people are infected instead of 406. If the infected person reduces the physical exposure by 75 per cent, then the same (infected) person can infect 2.5 people in 30 days,” Agrawal said.            It is necessary that on one hand there should be a focus on clinical management, while on the other hand the focus must be on controlling COVID-19, he stressed.Agrawal also re-emphasised on the use of masks.“Study shows that if we are at a distance of six-feet, even then there is a chance of a COVID positive person transmitting the virus to an uninfected person. You can find this situation at home in case of home isolation cases. If masks are not used properly, then there is a 90 per cent chance of an infected person infecting an uninfected person,” the joint secretary said.If an uninfected person wears a mask and a COVID-19 positive person does not wear one then there is a 30 per cent chance of infecting the uninfected person, he said.If both, COVID positive and uninfected persons wear masks, then the chance of getting infected is 1.5 per cent.“Couple this with a six-feet distance between two people, then there is negligible risk of the spread of the infection across two people,” Agrawal said.

The most recent spike of COVID-19 cases there has been devastating. The United States stands in solidarity with the people of India,” Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said during a closed virtual dialogue hosted by the United States, Argentina, Japan, Norway, and South Africa on Pandemic Preparedness and Response.She said the US is doing everything it could to help, including deploying raw materials for vaccines, as well as therapeutics, rapid diagnostic kits, ventilators, oxygen generation supplies, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and USAID public health teams, and financial support for vaccine expansion.“We will work around the clock to help our ally and alleviate the suffering. And we implore others to do so as well,” she said.Thomas-Greenfield noted that as India so “unfortunately demonstrates”, it is hard to overstate the impact COVID-19 has had on the world. Over 142 million people have gotten infected from COVID-19 and over three million people have died.“And, as we all know, the impacts were not limited to the illness itself. We’ve learned the hard way that global health isn’t just about viruses and disease. It touches every aspect of life itself. Economies have suffered. Gender-based violence has spiked. Kids have been forced to stay home from school, and millions – including an estimated 11 million girls according to UNESCO – may not return,” she said.Thomas-Greenfield underlined that the takeaway from this past year is clear: “The world barely withstood this pandemic. We must be ready for the next. We cannot continue to under-invest—after outbreaks, epidemics, and now a pandemic—in our capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats".        India is witnessing a devastating wave of COVID-19 as it registers more than three lakh cases every day and over 2,000 deaths over the past few days.US President Joe Biden had tweeted Sunday that “Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need”. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke with Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval about the spike in COVID-19 cases in India and “we agreed to stay in close touch in the coming days. The United States stands in solidarity with the people of India and we are deploying more supplies and resources,” he said.US Defence Secretary Austin Lloyd has also directed the Pentagon to provide all necessary support to Indian healthcare workers battling the worsening coronavirus situation in the country. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-to-work-around-the-clock-to-help-india-in-its-battle-against-covid-19-surge-us-ambassador-to-un-244530
26-04-2021||Singapore||Ban on travellers from India not targeted at any nationality: Singapore minister||Singapore’s ban on travellers with recent travel history to India is not targeted at any nationality, but is aimed at addressing the risk posed by a place with a high incidence of COVID-19 infections, a senior minister said here on Monday.The move to bar all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors who have travelled to India within the last 14 days from entering or transiting through Singapore took effect from April 23. It came as Singapore went into “heightened alert” against COVID-19.A traveller who has left India but stayed in another country before flying to Singapore would not have the same level of risk as someone who came directly from India, said Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung.Ong, who becomes Health Minister from May 15 under a Cabinet reshuffle announced last week, was responding to a question about Indian nationals flying in from other countries to bypass a travel ban on long-term pass holders and short-term visitors who have travelled to India within the last 14 days.Reports of such incidents have sparked concern among some members of the public.Ong explained that anyone staying in one place long enough would assume the risk profile of that place, regardless of nationality.“If your policy is to target risk, then for someone from a high-risk country to move to a lower-risk country, stay there for some time, and after that remain non-Covid positive... and then come to Singapore, actually, you have lowered the risk tremendously in that process,” The Straits Times quoted the minister as saying.In response to another query about whether it would be possible for a traveller to bypass restrictions by leaving India for another country, before almost immediately flying to Singapore, Ong said this would not be possible as Singapore requires the traveller to spend 14 days outside of India.Ong’s remarks came after Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who is co-chair of the task force tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, said last week the situation in India had worsened.He said the stay-home notice (SHN) period was not “100 per cent foolproof”, stressing that any leaks among newly arrived Indian workers could possibly introduce new strains into dormitories and result in new clusters.Wong said the temporary ban on arrivals from India would give Singapore time to monitor the situation and understand the risks.The Ministry of Manpower, in response to queries about the issue of workers from India attempting to bypass border restrictions to enter Singapore, said it adjusts entry approvals dynamically, depending on the global COVID-19 situation and risk levels of countries and regions that work pass holders come from.“Approvals are staggered to manage the importation risk of COVID-19 cases. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and adjust our measures as necessary to balance public health interest and economic objectives,” said the ministry.The restrictions on travellers from India has reportedly hit the city state’s labour-intensive industries, especially the construction sector.Construction firms will get more flexibility to hire workers from China and more time to complete public sector projects as part of support measures announced on Monday, reported the Channel News Asia.This is to mitigate the effects of a ban on long-term pass holders and short-term visitors from India after the country recorded a spike in COVID-19 cases.“This move impacts the flow of Indian workers into Singapore as well as companies in the construction sector that are dependent on them,” said the Building & Construction Authority on Monday.On Monday, India set a global record for the rise in daily COVID-19 cases for a fifth straight day with 3,52,991 infections. The number of COVID-19 deaths jumped to a record high of 2,812 over the last 24 hours.

Do not wait for the test result. Also, you should see a doctor only if your oxygen saturation falls below 94 saturation. You do not need to use oxygen to increase the saturation from 94 to 99. Saturation of 94 is just fine,” Guleria said, appealing to mild patients not to get admitted to hospitals thereby blocking critical resources like beds and oxygen.Others might need resources more than those who have mild infection which 85 pc will have and only 15 pc will have moderate to severe disease, said Guleria.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isolate-if-you-have-covid-like-symptoms-dont-wait-for-test-result-aiims-chief-244522

Both Prime Minister Modi and EC are responsible for the (current) situation (of COVID spreading in the state),” Banerjee alleged at a workers meeting in North Kolkata where party candidates and workers were present.“While mass pyres were lit at crematoriums, Modi was busy delivering ‘Mann ki baat’ speeches,” the chief minister claimed.Earlier on Monday, Madras High Court had lashed out at the Election Commission over the conduct of assembly polls amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.A bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice S Ramamoorthy termed the EC as most irresponsible while hearing a public interest writ seeking directions to ensure fair counting of votes on May 2 in Karur by taking steps to ensure adherence to COVID-19 protocols.“I am requesting please withdraw the around 2 lakh- strong central forces drawn from covid-hit states, who are camping in schools and colleges and safe homes hampering covid management operations 75 per cent of them may be infected by the virus. Please withdraw them in the last phase,” she said.Banerjee said the Trinamool Congress will move the Supreme Court after the elections against the EC on the manner in which the body was conducting polls in West Bengal. “We will tell Supreme Court. The EC did not club the poll phases despite the spike in Covid-19 cases,” she said.The number of confirmed COVID cases in West Bengal has risen from 81,466 on April 1, to over 3.52 lakh on April 25.The chief minister claimed BJP influenced the eight-phase vote schedule drawn up by EC and that the schedule was based on the ‘mondals’ (organisational zones earmarked by the saffron party) and not on any rationale. “Different areas in Kolkata (alone) went for polls on different dates,” she pointed out.“I had to visit North Bengal nine times as adjacent areas went to polls on different days  (this was done) to ensure maximum coverage for BJP leaders and to prevent me from campaigning. Kolkata was split into three parts for holding polls in three phases,” she alleged, adding: “However, I still managed to campaign for 50 days with my injured leg”.Flagging an alleged WhatsApp conversation among EC Special Observers and District Magistrates and Superintendents of Police, she said “they are describing TMC as trouble makers and our men as TMC goons. They do not use such epithets about the BJP in the chats”.“By nominating some Superintendents of Police close to BJP, the EC might help the BJP to win six-seven more seats than the projected 70, but the Trinamool is set to cross 200 seat mark,” she asserted.Banerjee alleged EC has prepared a list as directed by BJP which instructed police to arrest key party members from Entally and Belgachhia areas ahead of the April 29 polls in north Kolkata constituencies and instructed her party functionaries “just refuse to go.”“At Raninagar (in Murshidabad district) the (central) force went on a rampage at the residence of our (local) leader. We are lodging an FIR,” she claimed.Repeating her charge that the Centre mismanaged the COVID situation, she said: “PM and Home Minister literally camped in Bengal for three months and put the looming Covid-19 crisis on the backburner”.“They did not firm up a plan to bolster oxygen supply network in those months but spent money from PM Cares fund to bribe people. I was told that some were offered even Rs 25 crore to campaign for BJP,” she alleged.“I wonder if the institution (EC) is capable of protecting democracy with retired government servants looking for plum postings as Governors. There has to be people, still in service, at the helm (of EC),” she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-demands-withdrawal-of-central-forces-who-may-be-infected-with-covid-accuses-pm-of-insensitivity-244502
26-04-2021||New Delhi||Three sectors exempted from government ban on non-medical use of liquid oxygen||A day after putting a ban on the use of liquid oxygen for non-medical purposes, the government on Monday allowed three sectors—ampules and vials, pharmaceutical and defence forces—to use the commodity.Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla had on Sunday imposed a ban on the use of liquid oxygen for non-medical purposes, amid a scarcity of medical oxygen in many parts of the country, particularly in Delhi, that have been hit by a fresh wave of the coronavirus pandemic.In a letter to states and Union Territories on Monday, Bhalla said that three sectors—ampules and vials; pharmaceutical and defence forces—have now been exempted from the ban order.The central government has taken a number of steps to deal with the medical oxygen crisis in some parts of the country due to the increasing demand as the second wave of coronavirus engulfed several states.The central government is trying to source oxygen from different parts of the country and making available in worst hit states by running special trains.It is also getting cryogenic tanks from countries like the Singapore and the UAE to transport oxygen, and sourcing oxygen concentrators from the United States. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/three-sectors-exempted-from-government-ban-on-non-medical-use-of-liquid-oxygen-244499
26-04-2021||Vijay Mohan||Army sets up special cell to assist in last rites of soldiers, dependants who succumb to COVID||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, April 26Amidst the continuing surge of COVID-19 infections across the country, the Army has set up a special cell to assist in the last rites of serving and retired personnel and their dependents who succumb to the pandemic.The cell has been set up by Headquarters Delhi Area under the aegis of the Western Command to facilitate the families affected. The central government had issued a special set of procedures to be followed while handling bodies of COVID-19 victims.Like civilian hospitals, the armed forces medical facilities too are under immense strain due to the pandemic. In addition to catering to their own requirements, the forces are also assisting the civilian administration at various places to run treatment facilities and quarantine centers as well as providing doctors and medical staff as and when required.Facilities at military hospitals are being continuously augmented and additional capacity is being created. As part of this process, 23 mobile oxygen generation plants were airlifted from Germany this week for use in military establishments. A large number of oxygen concentrators are also being procured. The Army also recently converted its Base Hospital in Delhi as an exclusive COVID-19 treatment center, moving out medical OPDs and routine services to the Army Research and Referral Hospital. The COVID beds capacity at Base Hospital has been enhanced by 200 per cent and the number of beds with oxygen support has been doubled.The Army has also reached out to the veterans, saying that there would be no distinction between the serving and veterans in extending medical treatment to those affected by COVID-19. Ex-servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) polyclinics have also been instructed to pro-actively deal with COVID-19 cases and ECHS regional centers have been directed to liaise with empanelled private hospitals for admission and treatment. Ex-servicemen cells and nodal officers have also been nominated at various stations and 24x7 telephone helplines have been established to assist those in need. Ex-servicemen have also been advised to seek online medical consultancy instead of visiting ECHS polyclinics for routine treatment.A few days ago, the Army had enforced fresh guidelines to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in its establishments by reducing office attendance to 50 per cent, holding meetings through video conferencing, staggering office times and ensuring adherence to COVID protocols during training activities. All non-essential surgeries in military hospitals have also been put on hold and a contingency plan for medical staff has been evolved.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-sets-up-special-cell-to-assist-in-last-rites-of-soldiers-dependants-who-succumb-to-covid-244491
26-04-2021||New Delhi||SC advances summer vacation by a week due to second wave of COVID-19 pandemic||The Supreme Court on Monday decided to advance its summer vacation by a week in view of second wave of COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed several lives, including those of lawyers.Now summer vacation will commence from May 8 and the top court will reopen on June 28, Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President Vikas Singh said.It was tentatively decided in a meeting the Bar leaders had with CJI NV Ramana, he said.The CJI has also “in principle” approved the opening of the COVID-19 care centre in the new chamber building of the Supreme Court.The place will be used for establishing medical facilities for at least 60 beds and other facilities such as RT-PCR tests and COVID-19 vaccination.The SCBA Executive Committee has approached the Delhi government to inspect the place and submit a feasibility report, Singh said.“Tehsildar Chanakyapuri has already been briefed to make arrangements for inspection of the building,” he said.The SCBA had on Sunday requested Chief Justice of India NV Ramana to advance the summer vacation of the Supreme Court in view of the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic.In a letter to CJI Ramana, five senior-most judges, the secretary general of the Supreme Court and the SCBA president had said the summer break could begin on April 26 and end by June 6 with regular courts commencing from June 7.The summer vacation should be curtailed by a week from seven weeks to six weeks, it added.Noting that the second wave of COVID-19 was set to reach its peak by mid-May and the Delhi government has also extended its lockdown till the beginning of May, the SCBA had suggested that summer vacation should be advanced.Singh had also urged them to convert the newly constructed advocates chamber building to a COVID-19 care centre for lawyers, court staff and their families affected by the pandemic.If the vacant lawyers’ chamber block in the new premises was allocated to be used as a COVID care centre, the Delhi government can be asked to take over it and make it operational.It pointed out that its members were suffering due to the pandemic and many of its members have died in the last few days.The SCBA letter had expressed the hope that considering the “grim situation”, the suggestions made by it would be accepted immediately so that the necessary follow up action could be taken by the Delhi government at the earliest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-advances-summer-vacation-by-a-week-due-to-second-wave-of-covid-19-pandemic-244487
26-04-2021||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee casts vote in Bhabanipur||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday cast her vote at a polling booth in south Kolkata’s Bhabanipur.Banerjee, a resident of Harish Chatterjee Street, exercised her franchise at a polling booth in Mitra Institution school around 3.50 pm.On a wheelchair, she briefly paused before photojournalists while coming out amid shouts of “Didi, Didi”, before boarding her car.She also showed a victory sign towards the cameras.Banerjee is a two-term MLA from Bhabanipur, but is contesting the elections this time from Nandigram in the Purba Medinipur district, taking on BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari.Earlier in the day, senior TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee, who is the chief minister’s nephew, also voted at the same booth.TMC has fielded veteran politician Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay from Bhabanipur against BJP’s celebrity candidate Rudranil Ghosh.

26-04-2021||Chennai||TN to allow Sterlite to produce oxygen, bar on operating other units||An all-party meeting convened by the Tamil Nadu government on Monday resolved to allow Vedanta’s Sterlite Industries in Tuticorin to produce oxygen for a four-month period amid surging COVID cases, paving the way for the partial reopening of the copper smelter closed in 2018 over pollution concerns.The unit was sealed by the state government in May 2018, days after 13 agitators were killed in police firing during a violent anti-Sterlite protest in the southern district.On Monday, the Chief Minister K Palaniswami-chaired meeting, attended by main opposition party DMK among others, resolved to allow Sterlite produce oxygen from its plant in Tuticorin, days after Vedanta moved the Supreme Court in this connection.“As per the Supreme Court directive, power supply may be allowed for Vedanta’s Sterlite Industries in Tuticorin for four months to repair and operate oxygen producing and related equipment only,” the meeting resolved.The period may be extended later but “at no cost” shall other activities like copper manufacturing and running the co-generation plant shall be allowed and the “power supply shall be cut after this period (four months) by TANGEDCO,” it added.Tamil Nadu should get priority in the oxygen being produced here and it shall be taken to other states only after meeting its requirements.A committee comprising the District Collector, Superintendent of Police, TNPCB environmental engineer from Tuticorin, government officials experts in oxygen production, local residents, NGO members and activists opposed to the plant will monitor the production of oxygen and also decide on running the unit, it said.Only technicians “directly involved” in oxygen-making will be allowed entry into the plant with due permission slips while the government will ensure appropriate safety measures.On Friday, the apex court had said people were dying due to lack of oxygen and questioned the Tamil Nadu government as to why it cannot take over the Sterlite copper unit for producing oxygen to treat COVID-19 patients.“We are not interested that Vedanta or A, B or C runs it. We are interested that oxygen should be produced,” a Bench headed by then Chief Justice SA Bobde had said.Meanwhile, the state government on Monday recalled Vedanta had submitted in the court that it can produce up to 1,050 tonnes a day of oxygen in liquid and gas forms from two of its units in Sterlite in two to four weeks to be used in nearby hospitals and those in the other parts of the state.Monday’s meeting of recognised political parties was held under ‘compelling’ circumstances, it said, adding the government had factored in the growing demand for oxygen for many COVID patients.In his remarks at the meeting, Palaniswami recalled his government’s various COVID-prevention efforts, including ramping up the medical infrastructure soon after the outbreak of the virus in late 2019, besides stepping up testing and tracing activities.“Due to the precautionary steps taken by the government during the COVID-19 first wave, the spread declined gradually. Death rate was also curtailed. The second wave is under control due to measures like increasing stocks of liquid oxygen and beds in government hospitals,” he said.There was a need to further ramp up medical infrastructure, especially oxygen production, he said and recalled his communication to Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier that the gas produced here should not be diverted to other states.“We are in a testing, challenging time due to shortage of oxygen. It is the duty of all to protect the lives of the people and we have convened this meeting as part of that,” Palaniswami said.DMK MP Kanimozhi, representing her party along with its Rajya Sabha member RS Bharathi, said the opposition bloc batted for temporary approval for Vedanta to produce oxygen.“DMK and allies insisted that there should be a monitoring committee,” she later told reporters. Congress and the Left parties also participated.BJP state unit chief L Murugan, who attended the meeting, said the focus should be on saving ‘valuable’ human lives, adding that other states could get oxygen from the plant only after Tamil Nadu’s requirements were met.Meanwhile, DMK President MK Stalin tweeted that the permission granted to Vedanta was “temporary” and assured the plant will not be opened at any cost if the DMK comes to power after the May 2 counting of votes.Assembly elections were held in Tamil Nadu on April 6. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tn-to-allow-sterlite-to-produce-oxygen-bar-on-operating-other-units-244483

26-04-2021||New Delhi||Former Maruti Suzuki MD Jagdish Khattar passes away||Former managing director of Maruti Suzuki India, Jagdish Khattar, passed away on Monday morning following a cardiac arrest, according to people close to him.Khattar (79), a former bureaucrat, was considered as one of the most high profile leaders of the Indian automotive industry, laying the foundation for Maruti's future growth after the government began its disinvestment in 2002 and gradually exited from its joint venture with Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC).He had joined the then Maruti Udyog Ltd in July 1993 as director (marketing) and went on to become an executive director (marketing) in the next six years. He was promoted as joint managing director in 1999, a year that saw various disagreements between SMC and the government.Khattar was appointed to the post of MD of Maruti Udyog Ltd, as per an agreement between the partners, who agreed to appoint their nominee for a three-year term.Even as the government and the Japanese partner continued to squabble over various issues, including ownership and technology transfer, Khattar had also to deal with industrial relations issues when workers at the company's Gurgaon plant went on an indefinite strike in 2000 demanding wage hikes, incentives and pensions, among others.In 2002, when it was SMC's turn to appoint MD, they renamed Khattar as their nominee. His second term as MD began in May 2002, which was supposed to last till the age of 65 years or end-2007, whichever was earlier.In 2007, he retired from the top post in the country's largest carmaker, having ensured that the company commanded 50 per cent of the passenger vehicles market in India despite growing competition from global players.A year after retirement, he founded a multi-brand car service chain, Carnation Auto with many reputed private equity investors including Premji Invest and Gaja Capital backing the venture.However, his entrepreneurial venture did not reach the heights of success that he achieved when he was helming Maruti Suzuki. In 2019, he was booked by the CBI along with his company Carnation Auto India Limited for allegedly causing losses of Rs 110 crore to Punjab National Bank (PNB).Khattar had, however, defended himself stating that an exhaustive independent forensic audit at the behest of the bankers did not find any wrongdoings in the functioning of Carnation Auto.

26-04-2021||Beijing||China's state-run airline suspends cargo flights rushing COVID-19 medical supplies to India||China's state-run Sichuan Airlines has suspended all its cargo flights to India for 15 days, causing major disruption to private traders' efforts to procure the much-needed oxygen concentrators and other medical supplies from China despite Beijing offering "support and assistance" to the country to deal with the latest surge of COVID-19 cases.In a letter to the sales agents on Monday, the Sichuan Chuanhang Logistics Co. Ltd, the company which is part of the Sichuan Airlines said the airline has suspended its cargo flights on six routes, including Xian to Delhi, amid hectic efforts by private traders from both sides to procure oxygen concentrators from China.In the letter seen by PTI, the company said “in the face of sudden changes in the epidemic situation (in India), in order to reduce the number of imported cases, it is decided” to suspend the flights for the next 15 days.“Indian route has always been the core strategic route for Sichuan Airlines. This suspension has also caused great losses to our company. We are very sorry for the unchanged situation”, the letter said and sought the "understanding of its sales agents”, it said. The letter also said the company will review the situation after 15 days.The suspension of cargo flights came as a surprise to agents and freight forwarders who are frantically trying to procure the oxygen concentrators from China.There are also complaints of Chinese manufacturers jacking up the prices by 35 to 40 per cent. The freight charges have been increased to over 20 per cent, Siddharth Sinha of Sino Global Logistics, a Shanghai-based freight forwarding company.He told PTI here that the Sichuan Airlines decision to cancel flights has caused severe disruption to attempts by private traders in both the countries to secure quick supplies of the Oxygen concentrators to rush to India in view of the dire situation.Now it becomes very challenging to rush the supplies as they have to be rerouted through Singapore and other countries through different airlines, which delays the much-needed supplies, he said.The suspension of the flights owing to the coronavirus situation in India is surprising as there is no crew change in India and the same crew flies the aircraft back, he said.India is struggling with a second wave of the pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days, and hospitals in several states are reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds.The Chinese cargo flights besides the shipping services have been operational throughout the pandemic rushing supplies of lucrative mobile phone equipment as well as a lot of other Chinese exports to India.  Sinha also said the Chinese suppliers also resorted to “inhuman” practice of heavy jacking up of prices to cash in on the pandemic emergency.The suspension of flights also came as a surprise to the Indian officials here as it came in the backdrop of official statements offering support and assistance to India.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian told a media briefing on April 23 that China is in communication with India to provide necessary support and assistance.“China expresses sincere sympathies to India over the deteriorating situation in the country recently," he said.“The Chinese government and people firmly support the Indian government and people in fighting the coronavirus. China is ready to provide support and help according to India's need, and is in communication with the Indian side on this”, he said.“We believe that the Indian people will defeat the virus at an early date”, he said.India's total tally of COVID-19 cases has climbed to 1,73,13,163 while active cases have crossed the 28-lakh mark. The death toll increased to 1,95,123 with a record 2,812 new fatalities, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Monday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinas-state-run-airline-suspends-cargo-flights-rushing-covid-19-medical-supplies-to-india-244463

Admission at this centre will be made after approval by district surveillance officers in Delhi.ITBP has said that treatment at this centre will be free of cost."The SPCCC has started functioning on Monday. About 25 patients have arrived till about 11 am and more are expected," ITBP spokesperson Vivek Kumar Pandey said.Videos and photos provided by the force showed ambulances bringing in patients and they being admitted after preliminary check-up conducted by ITBP doctors and paramedical staff under a tented canopy in the porch.Earlier, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal visited the facility and thanked the Union government for providing doctors and medical staff at the centre. He said 200 ICU beds would also be arranged at the facility.The helpline numbers of SPCCC are: 011-2665 5547/48/49 and 011-2665 5949/69.According to an official, patient details like age, address, contact number, oxygen level, pulse and comorbid conditions will be obtained and after assessment by a team of doctors, those eligible to get admitted will be communicated through their contact number.He said the DSOs would also be empowered to recommend patients to the SPCCC.A team of 50 ITBP and other organisations' doctors, about 80 paramedics and nursing staff, security personnel of the border guarding force and other administrative staff have been tasked to run the centre that is expected to add more beds in the coming days.The Ministry of Home Affairs had declared on April 22 that the SPCCC, which was made operational in July last year and shut in February this year as coronavirus infections declined in the national capital, was being restarted on the Delhi government's request as the cases are rising rapidly once again.A total of 11,657 COVID-19 patients were treated at this centre between July-February.Delhi is currently facing an acute shortage of oxygen beds for serious COVID-19 patients and has almost run out of ICU facilities amid soaring infections. It recorded 350 COVID deaths and 22,933 cases with a positivity rate of 30.21 per cent on Sunday.

26-04-2021||New York||US to rush vaccine raw materials, anti-Covid supplies to India||In a break from the America First policy, President Joe Biden's administration is "working round the clock" to immediately send India raw material needed for making Covishield and other products needed in the fight against the COVID-19 surge overtaking the nation, according to National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.Recalling the assistance sent by India to the US in the early phase of the pandemic last year, he told India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval in a phone call on Sunday that "the United States is working around the clock to deploy available resources and supplie", Sullivan's Spokesperson Emily Horne said.Sullivan told Doval that Washington "also is pursuing options to provide oxygen generation and related supplies on an urgent basis," she said in a readout of their conversation.The US will also send India anti-COVID supplies like test kits, ventilators, medications and personal protective equipment used by frontline workers.The National Defence Production Act invoked by former President Donald Trump banned the export of vaccine raw materials and some other COVID-related products and have continued under Biden. The decision to lift the embargo for India on the export of vaccine raw materials comes after nearly two weeks of requests from Adar Poonawalla, the CEO of vaccine-maker Serum Institute of India, and others in India. But as recently as Friday various US government spokespersons would not say if the Biden administration would lift the embargo.State Department Spokesperson Ned Price said on Thursday that the "first obligation" was to the American people and added, "It's in the interests of the rest of the world to see Americans vaccinated". But as calls grew for helping India, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken gave a hint on Saturday that India may get the material to fight the pandemic surge. He tweeted, "We are working closely with our partners in the Indian government, and we will rapidly deploy additional support to the people of India and India's health care heroes." Horne said in the readout, "Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, the United States is determined to help India in its time of need."  After some physicians had said that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) could be a treatment for COVID-19, last April Trump had personally asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to lift his ban on its exports and supply the drug to the US. India sent about 50 million doses of HCQ to the US and thanking Modi, Trump said, "We will remember it."  Now the next president's administration is remembering it, even though the emergency use authorisation for HCQ's in hospital settings in the US was withdrawn and a huge cache of it sits unused while Modi's decision was crticised in India. India has been sharing its vaccine production with countries around the world, sending nearly 65 million doses to 86 countries. Horne said, "Sullivan affirmed America's solidarity with India, the two countries with the greatest number of COVID-19 cases in the world" and they both "resolved that India and the United States will continue to fight the global COVID-19 pandemic together." The readout, listing what India will receive, said, "The United States has identified sources of specific raw material urgently required for Indian manufacture of the Covishield vaccine that will immediately be made available for India. To help treat COVID-19 patients and protect front-line health workers in India, the United States has identified supplies of therapeutics, rapid diagnostic test kits, ventilators, and personal protective equipment (PPE)  that will immediately be made available for India."  The US is also deploying an expert team of public health advisors from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and USAID to work with the embassy in Delhi, India's Health Ministry, and India's Epidemic Intelligence Service, the readout said. USAID, which is the international assistance arm of the US, "will also quickly work with CDC to support and fast-track the mobilisation of emergency resources available to India through the Global Fund," it said. The Global Fund is an international collaboration to fight epidemics and serious diseases. Looking ahead, the readout said, "The U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is funding a substantial expansion of manufacturing capability for BioE (Biological E), the vaccine manufacturer in India, enabling BioE to ramp up to produce at least one billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2022."  Biological E, a Hyderabad-based company, is set to conduct Phase 3 trials for a vaccine developed by Baylor University and Dynavax Technologies Corporation in the US. At the March summit of Quad, Biden and Modi, along with Prime Ministers Yoshihide Suga of Japan and Scott Morrison of Australia agreed on a joint plan to help other countries with vaccines that would be made in India with US and Japanese finance and distributed using Australian logistics. Democratic members of the House of Representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi and Ro Khanna asked Biden to open the spigot on the excess vaccines for India, but from the readout of the Sullivan-Doval meeting it did not appear that as yet there was an agreement on the vaccines. Krishnamoorthi pointed out that the US had about 40 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is distributed in India under the Covishield brand name, and had begun supplying some of it to Canada and the US. He said that he would "strongly call on the Biden Administration to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses to countries hardest-hit by the spread of COVID-19, including India, Argentina, and potentially others." "I applaud the Biden Administration's decision to put people over profits," Khanna said welcoming the decision to give India the raw materials and other supplies, and added, "The Biden Administration can still do more, like give India our stockpile of AstraZeneca vaccines that won't be used in the US."  Biden's chief adviser on the COVID-19 pandemic, Anthony Fauci, said on a TV programme on Sunday that sending vaccines to India was under consideration.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-to-rush-vaccine-raw-materials-anti-covid-supplies-to-india-244433

Sullivan and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken had earlier in the day sought to deflect intense criticism of the US ban on export of raw materials for vaccines that has hit production in India, forcing it to renege on export commitments. A White House statement said the US had identified supplies of therapeutics, rapid diagnostic test kits, ventilators, and PPE that will be immediately dispatched to India. The US is also pursuing options to provide oxygen generation and related supplies on an urgent basis.In the long term, the US is part-funding expansion of manufacturing capability for BioE, the vaccine manufacturer in India. This will enable it to ramp up production to at least 10 crore doses of vaccines by the end of 2022.Public anger in India had mounted after the US banned the export of raw materials used for vaccine manufacturing, affecting exports. German Chancellor Angela Merkel refused to acknowledge New Delhi’s compulsions and hinted that the EU might have to reorient its supply chains away from India if it defaulted on its export commitments. Bangladesh, having waited for a second batch of Indian vaccines, is now tying up for the manufacturing of Sputnik vaccines to meet future requirements. The international vaccine alliance GAVI has publicly accused India of missing out on vaccine export commitments to less developed countries.The US is also asking a team of the Centers for Disease Control to work with the US embassy and India’s health ministries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-yields-to-provide-vaccine-raw-material-medical-equipment-244160

Steroids were good enough in other cases, he added.85% will recover in home isolation: GuleriaAIIMS chief Dr Randeep Guleria said on Sunday that 85 to 90% people would recover from Covid by isolating at home. Oxygen was needed only when saturation fell below 94%, he added.“We have to break the chain of transmission and we need severe restrictions to reduce the positivity rate. In Delhi, the positivity rate has gone up from 1 per cent on April 1 to over 30 per cent today. Mumbai had 26 per cent positivity rate at one point in time, but with severe restrictions it has come down to 14 per cent,” Wig said.Wig said India could reduce the positivity rate to less than 5 per cent in three weeks, if people practised Covid-appropriate behaviour and accepted vaccines quickly.“Everyone must take the vaccine dose as soon as possible.

Our vehicles went to Bawana, Faridabad, Noida, Greater Noida, but did not get oxygen anywhere," the management said.Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital and Pentamed facility in Model Town made SOS calls for oxygen.As the crisis unfolded, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal wrote to corporates — Tatas, Birlas, Ambanis, Hindujas and Mahendras, and other business families — urging assistance. “If you have oxygen and a tanker, please help the Delhi Government,” Kejriwal wrote a day after he sought help for oxygen from state counterparts.The CM again said the state was not receiving the committed oxygen supply of 480 tonne a day and was getting just 330 MT daily. Delhi's Covid positivity rate remains above 30 per cent. Tamil Nadu also reported oxygen shortages with CM E Palaniswamy writing to the PM alleging diversion of state's oxygen quota to Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.As of Sunday, oxygen demand from 22 high-surge states was 8,331 MT a day and supply was 8,280 MT a day. Only Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Gujarat had received lesser central allocations as compared to demand, indicating that supply and transport of oxygen was a challenge for Delhi and not the allocation.Centre issues fresh advisory to states||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/second-wave-has-shaken-nation-says-pm-narendra-modi-delhi-lockdown-till-may-3-244164

In Punjab, the highest positivity rate is among the 30 to 48-year-olds. That’s alarming. We don’t mind paying the Centre, but it should give us guaranteed doses,” Sidhu added.The Centre, meanwhile, accused the Opposition of playing “needless politics” as the Congress alleged that the Centre was permitting vaccine makers to indulge in brazen profiteering to the extent of Rs 1.11 lakh crore.Health Minister Harsh Vardhan took to Twitter to say that the new liberalised vaccine policy would grant flexibility to states to procure vaccines even as the Centre will continue to offer vaccines from its stock free of cost to the states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/4-congress-ruled-states-flag-vaccine-crunch-say-no-supply-till-may-15-244165

An important decision that will boost oxygen availability to hospitals and help people across the nation,” he said after the government announced the establishment of 551 pressure swing absorption plants from PM CARES Fund.“In line with the Prime Minister’s direction of boosting availability of oxygen to hospitals, the PM CARES Fund has given in-principle approval for allocation of funds for installation of 551 dedicated Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) Medical Oxygen Generation Plants inside public health facilities in the country.The PM has directed that these plants should be made functional as soon as possible. He said these plants would serve as a major boost to oxygen availability at the district level, a government statement said.The dedicated plants will be established in identified government hospitals in district headquarters in various states and UTs. The procurement will be done through the Ministry of Health.The PM CARES Fund had earlier this year allocated Rs 201.58 crore for installation of additional 162 dedicated Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen generation plants inside public health facilities in the country. Of these just 33 have yet been installed.“Such an in-house captive oxygen generation facility would address the day-to-day medical oxygen needs of these hospitals and the district. In addition, the liquid medical oxygen (LMO) would serve as a ‘top up’ to the captive oxygen generation. Such a system will go a long way in ensuring that government hospitals in the districts do not face sudden disruption of oxygen supplies and have access to adequate uninterrupted oxygen supply to manage the Covid-19 patients and other patients needing such support,” the government said.Several oxygen plants were tendered last year, but not installed.

Pt Rajan Mishra breathed his last at St Stephen’s Hospital in Delhi on Sunday fighting Covid. He was 70.Among the top Hindustani classical vocalists, the brothers began learning music at a tender age and first performed at haazri, (a musical ritual) at Sankat Mochan temple in Benaras. Rajan was 10 and Sajan five. Their music had a spiritual essence. For them, their art was an “offering to God”.Among their proclaimed works are Bhairav Se Bhairavi Tak, Bhaktimala and Durgati Nashini Durga. Even though the Benaras gharana is known for dhrupad, dhamar, khayal, chand, prabandh, thumri, chaiti and kajri, the brothers focused on khayal and became the foremost exponents of the raga.Having performed across the world, their first concert was in Sri Lanka in 1978. The brothers achieved much acclaim and were honoured with Padma Bhushan, Tansen Samman, Omkarnath Thakur Award, Kashi Gaurav, Yash Bharti Award, Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and the Gandharva National award.

I have not only lost a valued colleague but a good friend,” the newly appointed CJI said in a statement. Remembering his association with the late judge, the CJI said they shared a Bench for close to a year.“I will dearly miss our conversations, his warmth, wit and humour. My heart goes out to his family and friends. May his soul rest in peace,” the CJI said.Justice Shantanagoudar was admitted to the Medanta Hospital with a lung infection and was in the ICU. His condition was stable till late Saturday evening but deteriorated later, sources said.Justice Shantanagoudar was part of several notable verdicts, including a popular dissent in a land acquisition matter, during his over four-year stint at the Supreme Court. Hailing from Karnataka, he was also part of a nine-judge Constitution Bench which had on February 10 last year held that the five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court could refer questions of law to a larger Bench while exercising its limited power under review jurisdiction in the Sabarimala temple case.On February 8, 2018, Justice Shantanagoudar, number nine in seniority, dissented from the majority view of justices (now retd) Arun Mishra and AK Goel, who held that the 2014 verdict of another three-judge Bench on the land acquisition matter was ‘per incuriam’ (passed without due regard to law).Within months of his elevation to the top court in February 2017, Justice Shantanagoudar was part of a Bench headed by then CJI Dipak Misra which held that in a child custody matter, the remedy of writ of habeas corpus could not be used for mere enforcement of the directions given by a foreign court against a person.In February, a Bench headed by Justice Shantanagoudar took note of consumer interest and directed the RBI to lay down comprehensive directions mandating the steps to be taken by banks for locker facility/safe deposit facility management. Justice Shantanagoudar was also part of a significant judgment passed last year which held that an accused had the right to ‘default bail’, even if the investigation was not completed on time and the prosecutor could not defeat his indefeasible right by subsequently filing a charge-sheet or an additional complaint. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/with-justice-shantanagoudars-demise-i-have-lost-a-valued-colleague-good-friend-says-cji-244147

The inoculation process and documents to be provided to get the jab remain the same."An increased demand is expected once the vaccination is opened for all. For the purpose of crowd control, registering on CoWIN portal and making an appointment to get a vaccine will be mandatory for those aged between 18 and 45 years. Walks-in will not be allowed in the beginning so that there is no chaos," an official said.From May 1, the present system of private COVID-19 vaccination centres receiving doses from the government and charging up to Rs 250 per dose from people will cease to exist and private hospitals will procure directly from vaccine manufacturers.According to the Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy, COVID-19 vaccination will continue to be free at government vaccination centres that receive doses from the Centre for eligible population groups comprising healthcare workers, frontline workers and people above the 45 years of age.Vaccine manufacturers would make an advance declaration of the price for 50 per cent supply that would be available to state governments in the open market before May 1. Based on this price, states, private hospitals, industrial establishments may procure vaccine doses from manufacturers.Private hospitals would have to procure their supplies of COVID-19 vaccine exclusively from the 50 per cent supply earmarked for "other than the Government of India channel"."While the Centre has liberalised the vaccination policy, it does not mean that vaccines will be sold in pharmacists or chemist shops in the open market,” Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan had clarified on Wednesday.The price charged for vaccination by private hospitals would be monitored, he had said, adding, "The present dispensation where private COVID vaccination centres receive doses from the government and can charge up to Rs 250 per dose will cease to exist". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/registration-on-cowin-must-for-those-between-18-and-45-years-to-get-vaccine-shot-244021

26-04-2021||New Delhi||Govt asks Twitter to take down some tweets critical of its COVID-19 handling||Twitter and other social media platforms have removed about 100 posts and URLs after the government asked them to remove content that was critical of the handling of the current medical crisis or spreading fake news around the pandemic.Twitter said it has notified the impacted account holders of its action taken in response to a legal request from the Indian government, while Facebook did not comment on the issue. Sources said the companies have complied with the order. However, it wasn't immediately known what the removed posts were. Meanwhile, government sources said the IT Ministry, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Home Affairs, asked the social media platforms to remove the posts and URLs (uniform resource locators) to "prevent obstructions in the fight against the pandemic” and disruption of public order due to the said posts. They added that the order was issued in view of the misuse of social media platforms by certain users to spread fake or misleading information and create panic about the pandemic in the society “by using unrelated, old and out of the context images or visuals, communally sensitive posts and misinformation about COVID-19 protocols”. Although reports suggested that the posts critical of government handling of the medical crisis were asked to be removed, sources said the government is open to criticism and suggestions in the collective fight against COVID-19. However, they said it is necessary to take action against those users who are “misusing” social media during this grave humanitarian crisis for unethical purposes. Twitter removed or restricted access to more than 50 posts in the past one month at the behest of the government, including tweets that criticised its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Other posts removed showed pictures and videos of a recent Maoist attack in Chhattisgarh. Earlier this year, more than 500 accounts were suspended and access to hundreds of others in India blocked after the government ordered the microblogging platform to restrain the spread of misinformation and inflammatory content related to farmers' protests. India is registering a record number of COVID cases daily. The number of new COVID infections touched 3,49,691 cases and 2,767 fatalities, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Sunday at 8 am. A Twitter spokesperson said when it receives a valid legal request, it reviews it under both Twitter Rules and local law. “If the content violates Twitter's Rules, the content will be removed from the service. If it is determined to be illegal in a particular jurisdiction, but not in violation of the Twitter Rules, we may withhold access to the content in India only. The legal requests that we receive are detailed in the bianual Twitter Transparency Report, and requests to withhold content are published on Lumen,” the spokesperson said. Reports citing Lumen database (an independent research project studying cease and desist letters concerning online content) suggested that more than 50 posts - including those by a Member of Parliament, MLA and filmmakers -  were removed by Twitter on government request. The microblogging platform emphasised that it is committed to the principles of openness and transparency, and that it tackles misinformation based on the highest potential for harm. It noted that it is tackling COVID-19 misinformation using a combination of product, technology, and human review. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-asks-twitter-to-take-down-some-tweets-critical-of-its-covid-19-handling-243975

26-04-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||US to ease vaccine raw material exports to India||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 25The US has said it has identified sources of specific raw material urgently required for Indian manufacture of the Covishield vaccine that will immediately be made available for India.The assurance came after a conversation between National Security Advisers Jake Sullivan and Ajit Doval later in the day.Sullivan and US Secretary of State Tony Blinken had earlier in the day sought to deflect intense criticism of the US ban on export of raw materials for vaccines that has hit production in India, forcing it to renege on export commitments.A White House statement said the US has identified supplies of therapeutics, rapid diagnostic test kits, ventilators, and PPE that will be immediately dispatched to India. The US is also pursuing options to provide oxygen generation and related supplies on an urgent basis.  In the long term, the US is part-funding expansion of manufacturing capability for BioE, the vaccine manufacturer in India. This will enable it to ramp up to produce at least 10 crore doses of vaccines by the end of 2022.Public anger in India had mounted after the US banned the export of raw materials used for vaccine manufacturing, affecting exports. German Chancellor Angela Merkel refused to acknowledge New Delhi’s compulsions and hinted that the EU might have to reorient its supply chains away from India if it defaulted on its export commitments.Bangladesh, having waited for a second batch of Indian vaccines, is now tying up for the manufacturing of Sputnik vaccines to meet future requirements. The international vaccine alliance GAVI has publicly accused India of missing out on vaccine export commitments to less developed countries.The US is also asking a Center for Disease Control (CDC) team to work with the US embassy, India’s health ministries and “Epidemic Intelligence Service’’ staff. USAID will try to fast-track the mobilisation of emergency resources available to India through the Global Fund.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-to-ease-vaccine-raw-material-exports-to-india-243972
26-04-2021||New Delhi||Govt must be held morally, politically accountable: Anand Sharma on Covid deaths||Noting that accountability of government is integral to democracy, Congress leader Anand Sharma on Saturday said the Narendra Modi dispensation must be held morally and politically accountable for the death of Covid patients due to shortage of oxygen and critical medicines.He said the government must answer why it did not put an exigency plan in place before the onset of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic."Accountability of government is integral to democracy. This government must be held morally and politically accountable," Sharma said on Twitter."Reminding again the prime minister and his colleagues that India cannot be micromanaged in a pandemic. The responsibility for the deaths of Indian citizens for shortage of oxygen and medicines lies squarely at the doorstep of the government," he said.Sharma, a former union minister, tested Covid positive last week and is currently recuperating. He is currently admitted to Medanta Hospital in Gurugram and is stable.He said the unfolding tragedy of India's citizens dying for want of medicines and man-made oxygen shortage has shocked the collective conscience of the nation."But, the apathy of the government which remains in brazen denial is unforgivable," he said."A mindset of control, obsession for publicity and propaganda and desperation for dominance and power as a priority has destroyed India's preparedness to fight the second surge," he noted.In a federal country of 135 crore people, the centralisation of all authority and decisions to fight the Covid pandemic, negating the role of the states, has resulted in an unprecedented national disaster, he said."Why no exigency plan was put in place for the second wave? Why oxygen emergency reserve was not created? Who is responsible for rampant black-marketing of life saving medicines?" he asked.
