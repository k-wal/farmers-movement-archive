Random tests are being done at a fast pace and capacity is being ramped up. More than 80,000 tests are being conducted a day which is five times more than the national average,” the health minister told reporters.The Kejriwal government is taking a number of other decisions to contain the contagion, the minister said, adding that micro-containment zones are being created wherever two to three COVID-19 cases are getting detected.“Asserting that the rapid spread of infection amid immunisation campaigns suggest that we must move the vaccination campaign forward in a more swift manner,” Kejriwal wrote to the prime minister, urging for relaxation in norms for opening vaccination centres and age criterion for getting inoculated.“If the rules for opening new centres are simplified and everyone is allowed to vaccinate, then the Delhi government will be able to vaccinate all Delhi residents in three months, the Delhi government is fully prepared for it,” he said.Jain had earlier said that according to the World Health Organisation, the situation is considered under control if the positivity rate remains below 5 per cent for several days.The number of cumulative cases as of January 1 had stood at over 6.25 lakh and the total fatalities were 10,557.The number of daily cases had started to come down in February.On February 26, the month’s highest daily count of 256 cases was recorded.However, the daily cases began to rise again in March and have been steadily increasing since then.Health experts and doctors have attributed this “sudden rise” in cases to people turning complacent, not following COVID-appropriate behaviour and “assuming all is well now”.The next two-three months could be challenging, they said, adding that the situation can be kept under control if vaccination is opened up for more people and COVID-19 protocols are strictly adhered to. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-delhi-government-orders-its-hospitals-to-run-1-3rd-of-inoculation-sites-24x7-increase-bed-count-235023

05-04-2021||New Delhi||CBI to reach Mumbai on Tuesday to start process of initiating PE against Deshmukh||A CBI team will reach Mumbai on Tuesday to start the process of initiating a preliminary enquiry against former Maharshtra home minister Anil Deshmukh who resigned after the Bombay High Court directed the agency to probe allegations of corruption levelled against him by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.Normally, the agency waits for a formal order and a legal opinion before initiating any action in such cases but given the short period of 15 days granted by the high court to conduct a preliminary enquiry into the allegations, the CBI has taken the swift action, officials said.The CBI team will meet lawyers to collect the order, complaint along with annexure and other related documents to start the probe, they said. A bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G S Kulkarni on Monday said this was an “extraordinary” and “unprecedented” case that warranted an independent inquiry.In its 52-page judgement, the bench said Singh’s allegations against Deshmukh had put at stake the citizen’s faith in the state police.Such allegations, made by a serving police officer, against the state home minister could not be left unattended, and were required to be probed into, if prima facie, they made a case of a cognisable offence, the HC said.The court said a probe by an independent agency was necessary in the present case, to “instill public confidence and safeguard the Fundamental Rights of the citizens”.The HC pronounced its verdict on three public interest litigations (PILs) and a criminal writ petition filed last month, seeking several reliefs and a CBI probe into the matter.One of the PILs was filed by Singh himself, and the other two were filed by lawyer Ghanshyam Upadhyay and a local teacher Mohan Bhide.The criminal writ petition was filed by city-based lawyer Jayshree Patil.The high court ordered for the CBI inquiry on Patil’s plea.Singh, in his plea filed on March 25, sought a CBI probe against Deshmukh who, he claimed, had asked police officers, including suspended cop Sachin Vaze, to extort Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants.              Vaze himself is under NIA probe in the case pertaining to explosives found in a SUV near the mansion of industrialist Mukesh Ambani.Deshmukh has denied any wrongdoing.

05-04-2021||New Delhi||PIL demands raising HC judges' retirement age from 62 to 65 years||As almost one third of the 1079 posts of judges in 25 high courts across India remain vacant, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court Monday seeking to raise their age of retirement from 62 years to 65 years.Filed by Delhi BJP leader and advocate by advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, the PIL demanded uniform retirement age for judges of high courts and the Supreme Court. Uniformity in the retirement age is not only necessary to reduce pendency of cases but also essential to attract and retain the best legal talent in the bench, he submitted. The retirement age of judges of the top court is already 65 years.If there was uniformity in retirement age, the Judges of the High Court will discharge judicial work more independently and without any expectation to move to the Supreme Court, it submitted.The PIL contended that to minimise the apprehension of subordination between the Supreme Court and High Courts also, it was appropriate to equate the retirement age of High Court Judge's with Supreme Court judges.Terming it as “irrational” to have different retirement age for judges of constitutional courts, Upadhyay said increasing the retirement age and making it uniform i.e 65 years will not only strengthen the rule of law, but also secure the fundamental right of speedy justice, guaranteed under Article 21.Uniformity in the retirement age of Judges will create a pool of experienced judges in High Courts, which will be extremely useful for deciding the cases of extreme importance or which require deep and thorough knowledge for interpretation of the Constitution, the PIL submitted. — With PTI inputs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-demands-raising-hc-judges-retirement-age-from-62-to-65-years-235011

A couple of days later, Taiwan’s Foreign Office expressed its condolences on the loss of life and injuries in the Chhattisgarh ambush.In a statement, the Chinese embassy took umbrage to an editorial, which “seriously violated One-China principle and provoked China’s bottom line disregarding long-standing position of the Indian government”.Chinese Embassy spokesperson said all countries that have diplomatic relations with China should firmly honour their commitments to One-China policy, which is also Indian government’s official standing.“The Taiwan question concerns China’s core interests. We firmly oppose any separatist activities to create the so-called “Taiwan independence,” “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan”.“China firmly opposes any country having diplomatic ties with China making any form of official contact and exchanges with Taiwan. China’s red line on the Taiwan question cannot be challenged. On issues of right and wrong, there is no room for compromise,” said the spokesperson.The embassy urged the relevant Indian media to take a correct stance on issues of core interests concerning China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, adhere to the One-China principle, and “avoid sending wrong messages to the public”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-upset-as-india-taiwan-exchange-condolences-235003

Sanjeev Kumar (48), a CA working with a prominent firm in Banjara Hills. The CA has been charged for faking an official document and spreading it using WhatsApp creating panic among the people. “The faking of government order on imposition of a lockdown amounts to cheating people by posting it on social media”, police said. Hyderabad Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar said the accused has downloaded an old GO regarding the Covid-19 lockdown issued by the state government in his laptop and forged it. “He forged the GO by changing the dates of the lockdown and wrote this year’s dates and further through WhatsApp circulated it,” Kumar said. The PDF format of fake GO was first circulated in a group of CA comprising of about 40 members. The group members then shared with their friends and it spread all over the state causing panic. The laptop and mobile device of the accused have been confiscated and a case under various provisions of the Information technology Act has been registered.

05-04-2021||Kolkata||Two Bengal districts hold key to TMC’s return to power||With the BJP seeking to breach TMC fortresses in Bengal, two of the biggest districts—North and South 24 Parganas—seem to hold the key in the state’s action-packed electoral battle.Together, the two districts send 64 representatives to the 294-member assembly—North-24 Parganas having 33 seats and South-24 Parganas 31.The TMC had swept both the districts in 2011 and 2016, and had successfully cemented the foundation of the Mamata Banerjee camp in the state. In 2016, the party had bagged 27 of the 33 seats in North 24 Parganas, and all but two seats in the minority-dominated South-24 Parganas.The saffron party, during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, managed to make a dent in the TMC’s citadel in North-24 Parganas, but failed to chart its course in South-24 Parganas.“This time, too, winning seats in both the districts would be the key to retaining power. The BJP, through threat and intimidation, had made inroads in certain areas during the general election. But we have taken adequate measures to stop the saffron party’s juggernaut,” state minister and TMC’s North-24 Parganas district president Jyotipriyo Mullick said.Echoing him, party colleague and his counterpart in South-24 Parganas, Subhasish Chakraborty, said voters will reject the “divisive forces”, and the TMC will emerge stronger in the area.With state capital Kolkata locked in between, both the districts share border with Bangladesh, and house a significant refugee population.It was the Left Front dispensation that had split 24- Parganas into two separate districts in 1980 for ease of governance. Prior to that, during the Congress rule, 24-Parganas stretched from Kamarhati in the North to Sagar Island in the South.The Left, however, lost its influence in these areas—home to a large number of minorities—after the Sachar Committee report in 2008 painted a dismal picture of the living conditions of Muslims.Add to that, the anti-land acquisition movement in Nandigram and Singur projected the TMC, led by Mamata Banerjee, as the new alternative.South 24 Parganas, along with East Midnapore district, was the first two zilla parishads that the TMC had wrested from the mighty Left in 2008.Over the years, however, rampant infighting in the TMC camp and communal riots in these two districts started taking a toll on the TMC’s prospects, and the BJP managed to bag two of the five Lok Sabha seats in North-24 Parganas in 2019.The saffron party, which had made the citizenship law one of its poll planks during the general election, was able to woo a section of the refugees, especially those from the Matua community, and the Bongaon Lok Sabha seat subsequently fell on its lap.Matuas are a deciding factor in 14 out of the 33 assembly seats in North-24 Parganas.The TMC, notwithstanding a strong BJP wave, managed to win all the Lok Sabha seats in South-24 Parganas.However, the recent exodus of elected representatives and local leaders has become a matter of concern for the Mamata Banerjee camp, as the defectors include five MLAs from the two districts.The BJP, at present, has one elected representative from Bhatpara in North 24 Parganas, as Pawan Kumar Singh bagged the assembly seat during a bypoll.Adding to TMC’s woes, the newly floated Indian Secular Front, which has stitched an alliance with the Left and the Congress, is seeking to checkmate the ruling party in some of its strangleholds in South-24 Parganas, which have a significant minority population.“The TMC has done nothing for the minorities, and they will get a befitting reply in South-24 Parganas district,” ISF president Naushad Siddiqui, who is contesting the elections from Bhangore assembly seat, claimed.Despite the odds stacked up against the ruling party, which also include rampant infiltration, row over cattle smuggling and graft allegations during Amphan relief distribution, a well-oiled election machinery, strong foundation, and decisive district leadership may work in its favour in south Bengal.In North-24 Parganas, the TMC hopes to politically exploit the confusion over CAA implementation to curry favour with the Matua community, which had voted hands down in favour of the saffron camp in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.The ruling party has also fielded greenhorns and swapped candidates in several seats to beat the anti- incumbency wave.The BJP, which is undertaking power-packed poll campaigns led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah—is hopeful of winning more than 50 per cent of the seats in the two districts.“We will be able to bag 60 per cent of the seats in North 24 Parganas, if not more. In South-24 Parganas, too, we will fare well, with at least 50 per cent seats in our kitty,” BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said.Elections in South and North-24 Parganas are being held in three and two phases respectively. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-bengal-districts-hold-key-to-tmcs-return-to-power-234986

You (MEA) have to find out some other remedy available to them. There has to be some higher pressure on them. It is not helping. It cannot go on like this,” the high court said.It was hearing a case in which the mortal remains of the Hindu man were wrongly buried in Saudi Arabia as per Muslim rites due to incorrect translation of his religion on the death certificate purportedly by Indian Consulate officials in Jeddah.The deceased’s wife, who had been running from pillar to post to get the mortal remains, approached the high court in March seeking direction to the MEA to take steps to urgently exhume the remains and repatriate them to India in a time-bound manner.The high court had earlier asked the MEA to coordinate with the Deputy Chief of Missions of Saudi Embassy here to facilitate the exhumation and repatriation of the remains.It had also requested the Deputy Chief of Mission to obtain some timeline within which the process of exhumation and repatriation of the body would be completed.On Monday, the Director of Consulate Passport Visa, MEA, Vishnu Kumar Sharma, told the court that the ministry was continuously making vigorous efforts for exhumation and repatriation of the mortal remains of Sanjeev Kumar but they have still not received any formal response from the Saudi Arabia authorities.He said he was not in a position to give any date by which the process could be completed and added that the MEA has reminded the Saudi embassy in Delhi to expedite the process of exhumation and repatriation of the mortal remains.When the court asked the MEA official if there was any way by which they can approach any other authority in Saudi Arabia or court, Sharma said they cannot go to foreign court because of diplomatic treaty and they can forward it through diplomatic channels only.He, however, said the family was free to approach the foreign court.The court asked the official to find out if there is any other legal remedy to be invoked by the family and listed the matter for further hearing on April 8.Advocate Subhash Chandran K R, representing petitioner Anju Sharma, said the MEA can contact the Indian Consulate at Saudi Arabia and ask them to expedite the process and they can make it a diplomatic issue.The MEA official had earlier said that as per the existing protocol in Saudi Arabia, an Indian citizen’s body cannot be disposed of without obtaining an NOC from the Indian Consulate. However, in this case, the procedure was not followed, he had said.Sanjeev Kumar, 51, died on January 24 in Saudi Arabia, where he was working, due to cardiac arrest and his mortal remains were kept at a hospital there.Petitioner Anju Sharma has said in her plea that on getting the news of her husband’s death, the family requested the authorities to repatriate the mortal remains.“Shockingly, on February 18, the petitioner was informed that the body of her husband has been buried in Saudi Arabia while the family members of the deceased were waiting for the mortal remains in India.“The officials in Indian Consulate explained that it was due to a mistake committed by the official translator of the Indian Consulate, Jeddah, who wrongly mentioned his religion as ‘Muslim’ in the death certificate. They also shared a letter of an apology tendered by the official translating agency of Indian Consulate in Jeddah with the petitioner herein,” said the petition, filed through advocate Yogamaya M G.It also said that neither the woman, nor any of the family members gave consent to bury Kumar’s body in Saudi Arabia.Thereafter, the woman requested the officials of Indian Consulate in Jeddah to ask the local authorities there to exhume the mortal remains of her husband so that they can be transported to India for performing last rites as per the faith of the family.“Unfortunately, even after seven weeks of the death of the husband of petitioner, the authorities have failed to do necessary formalities to repatriate the mortal remains of Sanjeev Kumar to India for performing last rites,” the plea has said.It also sought direction to the Centre to take appropriate departmental actions against officials concerned of the Indian Consulate at Jeddah for their wilful negligence and also direct the authorities to obtain a corrected death certificate of the deceased and supply the document to his wife.

05-04-2021||New Delhi||BJP questions the ‘silence’ of Uddhav Thackeray, demands his resignation||Following the resignation of Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said the “conspicuous silence” of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on the entire issue is raising a lot of questions.Addressing a press conference here in the national capital, he wondered while demanding Thackeray’s resignation what the “targets” of the other ministers in the MVA government were. “We know the target of Home Minister was Rs 100 crore. The BJP expects that all layers to be exposed, surely there are a lot of linkages. We expect all linkages in this shameful corruption will be exposed with the CBI probe,” he said.“It is not a ‘Maha Vikas Aghadi but ‘maha vasooli’. Anil Deshmukh has resigned citing moral responsibility. Do you (Uddhav Thackeray) have any moral responsibility or not/ Udhav Thackeray has forfeited all moral authority to govern.”“Democracy is run by standards of propriety. We think it is a serious matter. Uddhav Thackeray has been cornered through two sides, one via Sachin Vaze (suspended Mumbai police cop) and the other through allegations of extortion. If we link all these chains, it points to the conspiracy of loot in which Sachin Vaze is the common link,” Prasad said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-questions-the-silence-of-uddhav-thackeray-demands-his-resignation-234977

They are demanding a repeal of the three laws along with a legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their produce.The protesting farmers took out a tractor rally in Delhi on January 26.“Farmers will conduct an agitation in Gujarat using their tractors. Time has come to gherao Gandhinagar and block roads. If needed, we will have to break barricades too,” Tikait said.The BKU leader is on a two-day tour of Gujarat since Sunday to campaign against the Centre’s three farm laws.On the second day of his visit, Tikait, accompanied by former Gujarat Chief Minister Shankersinh Vaghela, paid tributes to Mahatma Gandhi at the Sabarmati Ashram.“Farmers are suffering because there is no agitation here. There is no backing from courts also. Farmers are compelled to say they are happy and making profit. Please give us that technology which is helping Gujarat’s farmers to reap benefits,” said Tikait.He claimed farmers of Banaskantha are compelled to sell potatoes for Rs 3 per kilogram.“Is that enough to make farmers happy? We have come here to remove fear from the minds of farmers. We will agitate in a peaceful manner,” Tikait said, when asked about his future plans for Gujarat.Later, Tikait and Vaghela reached Karamsad town in Anand district and paid tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at his native place.Tikait then headed to Bardoli in Surat, where he would address farmers in the evening.

They may end up having adverse entry in their character certificates which could deprive them of many career opportunities."Citizens must dissuade youngsters in their families from indulging in such acts which could jeopardize their future", he added.Notably, the state government had recently come out with a circular stating that those found taking part in violent demonstrations might end up getting adverse remarks in their character certificates provided by the local police.This would debar them from getting jobs or contracts with the government, the missive had stated, evoking criticism from the opposition. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/protest-against-non-reopening-of-coaching-institutes-turns-violent-in-bihar-town-234972
05-04-2021||New Delhi||Centre moves SC seeking urgent hearing in ISRO espionage case||The Centre on Monday moved the Supreme Court seeking urgent hearing on the report filed by a high-level committee regarding the role of erring police officials in the 1994 espionage case relating to ISRO scientist Nambi Narayanan who had been acquitted and was eventually awarded Rs 50 lakh compensation by the top court.The matter was mentioned for urgent hearing by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta before a bench, headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, which said that the case would be heard next week.Mehta told the bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, that the report has been filed by the committee and it be considered as this is a “national issue”.The bench said it understands that it is an important matter but “not a very urgent matter”.“We will take it up next week,” the bench said.The apex court had on September 14, 2018 appointed a three-member panel, headed by its former judge Justice (retd) D K Jain, while directing the Kerala government to cough up Rs 50 lakh compensation for compelling Narayanan to undergo “immense humiliation”.It had ordered setting up of the committee to take appropriate steps against the erring officials for causing “tremendous harassment” and “immeasurable anguish” to Narayanan and had directed the Centre and state government to nominate one officer each in the panel.Terming the police action against the ex-scientist of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) as a “psycho-pathological treatment”, the apex court had in September 2018 said that his “liberty and dignity”, basic to his human rights, were jeopardised as he was taken into custody and, eventually, despite all the glory of the past, was compelled to face “cynical abhorrence”.The espionage case, which had hit the headlines in 1994, pertained to allegations of transfer of certain confidential documents on India’s space programme to foreign countries by two scientists and four others, including two Maldivian women The scientist was arrested when the Congress was heading the government in Kerala.The three-member investigation panel submitted its report in a sealed cover to the apex court recently.The CBI, in its probe, had held that the then top police officials in Kerala were responsible for Narayanan’s illegal arrest.The case also had its political fallout, with a section in the Congress targeting the then Chief Minister late K Karunakaran over the issue, that eventually led to his resignation.Over a period of almost two-and-a-half years, the panel headed by Justice Jain examined the circumstances leading to the arrest.The 79-year-old former scientist, who was given a clean chit by the CBI, had earlier said that the Kerala police had “fabricated” the case and the technology he was accused to have stolen and sold in the 1994 case did not even exist at that time.Narayanan had approached the apex court against a Kerala High Court judgement that said no action needed to be taken against former DGP Siby Mathews, who was then heading the SIT probe team, and two retired superintendents of police K K Joshua and S Vijayan, who were later held responsible by the CBI for the scientist’s illegal arrest.“There can be no scintilla of doubt that the appellant, a successful scientist having national reputation, has been compelled to undergo immense humiliation. The lackadaisical attitude of the state police to arrest anyone and put him in police custody has made the appellant to suffer the ignominy,” the apex court had said in its September 2018 order.“The dignity of a person gets shocked when psycho-pathological treatment is meted out to him. A human being cries for justice when he feels that the insensible act has crucified his self-respect,” the top court had said.It had accepted Narayanan’s plea that the authorities, who were responsible for causing such a “harrowing effect” on his mind, should face “legal consequences”.The CBI, while giving clean chit to the scientist, had said that Siby Mathews had left “the entire investigation to IB surrendering his duties” and ordered indiscriminate arrest of the scientist and others without adequate evidence being on record.The case had caught attention in October 1994, when Maldivian national Rasheeda was arrested in Thiruvananthapuram for allegedly obtaining secret drawings of ISRO rocket engines to sell to Pakistan.Narayanan, the then director of the cryogenic project at ISRO, was arrested along with the then ISRO Deputy Director D Sasikumaran, and Fousiya Hasan, a Maldivian friend of Rasheeda.

05-04-2021||New Delhi||SC asks Centre to consider holding CBI director selection panel meet before May 2||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to consider holding a meeting of the selection committee for the appointment of a regular CBI Director before May 2, saying the interim arrangement can’t go on.“The in-charge arrangements for CBI director cannot go on. There is a point in what Mr (Prashant) Bhushan says”, Justice Nageswara Rao told Attorney General KK Venugopal after the top law officer said the selection committee meeting was likely to take place on May 2.However, the Bench told the government to hold it earlier and posted the matter for further hearing next Friday.On behalf of petitioner NGO Common Cause, advocate Prashant Bhushan accused the government of delaying the meeting of the high power committee as it wanted to bypass present Chief Justice of India SA Bobde who is retiring on April 23. There’s no provision for the appointment of an interim CBI Director, he argued.After CJI Bobde’s retirement, Justice NV Ramana will be a part of the high-powered committee headed by the Prime Minister that recommends the name for appointment of the CBI Director.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta refuted the petitioner’s allegation that the present CJI was being bypassed. Terming Bhushan’s allegation as absurd, Mehta said the meeting has been convened in May given the ongoing state assembly elections.The last incumbent CBI Director Rishi Kumar Shukla demitted office on February 2 this year and instead of appointing his successor, the government on February 3 appointed Praveen Sinha as an interim CBI Director “till the appointment of new CBI Director, or until further orders.”According to Section 4A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 -- as amended by the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, the CBI Director’s appointment has to be made on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, leader of the single largest Opposition party and the Chief Justice of India (or a Supreme Court judge nominated by CJI).The Supreme Court had on March 12 issued notice to the Centre on a PIL filed by NGO Common cause seeking appointment of a regular CBI Director by the selection committee of the Prime Minister, Chief Justice of India and Leader of Opposition.It had asked the Centre to respond to the petition which questioned the government’s move to appoint an acting/interim CBI Director after the term of the previous CBI Director got over.The NGO alleged that the probe agency’s work was suffering.“The government has failed to appoint the Director of CBI as per Section 4A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 on the expiry of the term of the last incumbent Director Rishi Kumar Shukla on February 2 this year and has instead, vide order dated February 3, appointed Praveen Sinha as an interim/acting CBI Director till the appointment of new CBI Director, or until further orders,” the petition submitted.The NGO urged the top court to direct the Centre to initiate and complete the process of selection of the CBI Director well in advance—at least one to two months before the date on which the vacancy in the post of CBI Director occurred in future.The petitioner has sought a direction to the Centre “to appoint a regular Director of CBI forthwith by following the procedure laid down in Section 4A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, as amended by the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013.” Under the amended law, the CBI Director’s appointment has to be made on the recommendation of the Prime Minister, leader of the single largest Opposition party and the Chief Justice of India (or a Supreme Court judge nominated by CJI).The petitioner referred to the top court’s 1998 verdict directing that Director CBI would have full freedom for allocation of work in the CBI including constitution of investigation teams. It had also directed that there should be a selection committee to identify a panel of names for the appointment of Director CBI, and thereafter the final selection to be made by the Appointments Committee of Cabinet.This Court had said the CBI Director would have a fixed tenure of two years to ensure that ad-hocism in the appointment and functioning of the CBI Director was eliminated and his independence was maintained, the NGO pointed out.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-centre-to-consider-holding-cbi-director-selection-panel-meet-before-may-2-234958

The woman in Bundeli dialect said, "I have myself received the corona vaccine, so everybody should get it. There is no problem in getting inoculated. The people should wait for their turn and get themselves vaccinated." Doctor Bhupendra Kurmi has said that the date of birth of the elderly woman is January 1, 1903, as per her Aadhaar card and she is a resident of Sadarpur village.Raising the alarming level of new coronavirus cases, former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath attacked the government on the shortage of the vaccines in the state and said, "On one hand the present Shivraj Singh Chouhan government has appealed to each and every person to receive the vaccine, on the other hand, there are not enough vaccines available in many districts of the state. People are forced to return to homes without the jab. There are deaths due to a shortage of oxygen supply in hospitals. There is a lack of medicines for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, there are not enough Covid testing kits, no beds for treatment in many districts, private hospitals brazenly charging high treatment rates. What is the government doing? Don't know if the Chief Minister is reviewing the Covid-19 situation or not?" --IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/118-year-old-woman-gets-corona-vaccine-in-mp-234940

"We accordingly request the Chief Justice, Delhi High Court to give us a panel of names of about five judges of a high caliber and absolute integrity to enable us to suggest an appropriate replacement for Bharat Parashar, Special Judge," the bench had said.The bench took note of the submission of special public prosecutor Cheema that the law contemplates the disposal of such cases has to be ensured in two years which may be extended up to four times by a period of six months each.It had taken note of the fact that Parashar has been acting as the special judge since 2014 and his replacement is now needed and fixed the case after two weeks to consider the names to be provided by the Chief Justice of the High Court.The top court in 2014 had quashed 214 coal blocks allocated by the Centre between 1993 and 2010 after taking note of PILs, including one filed by lawyer M L Sharma, and had ordered trial by a special CBI Judge.

Nearly 76 per cent of all UK variants detected in India are in Punjab.“The UK strain is known to be extremely virulent. But protection measures are the same. Wearing of masks will determine whether people will defeat the virus or end up in hospitals. It is time to start treating people who do not wear masks as anti-social. Masks are that crucial to Covid management,” Mishra said, calling for a cultural movement to promote use of masks.For high Covid burden states like Punjab, the genomics expert advised: “Since most cases are asymptomatic, testing is the key. States witnessing steep surge must escalate tests on war footing and isolate the infected. Else we will hardly have health infrastructure to handle patient rush after few days or so.”Ruling out link between variants and the current surge, Mishra said: “We let our guard down. People gave up masks, social distancing and hand and respiratory hygiene. The virus just needs an unprotected meeting between two people to spread.”He said the second wave was highly infectious and had the capacity to wreck the health system. “India must vaccinate 50-60 crore people by July. That would give us a fair level of immunity against the virus,” said Mishra. The CSIR scientist noted that India had nearly 40,000 vaccination centres and each had been directed to inoculate 100 persons a day. “We can achieve half a crore vaccinations per day and 60 crore by July. Speedy inoculations will address the pandemic in time. Delay could allow the virus to acquire new and hard to address mutations,” he said.Drive in full steam||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/target-60-cr-inoculations-by-july-to-arrest-surge-genomics-expert-234760

He directed Central public health specialists to be positioned in Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh, currently witnessing worrying levels of surge.With active cases touching 6,91,597 — 5.54 per cent of the total infections, the PM directed top bureaucrats and health officials to avoid mortality “under all circumstances by ramping up healthcare infrastructure, availability of oxygen, ventilators and ensuring clinical management protocols across hospitals and for people in home care.”Story HighlightsThe PM laid stress on community participation and stringent imposition of Covid-appropriate behaviour. The meeting ended with a decision to conduct a national campaign from April 6 to 14 for 100 per cent mask usage, personal hygiene and sanitation at public places and workplaces.“Jan bhagidari and jan andolan are key to Covid management and all states must undertake stringent measures with comprehensive restrictions in places witnessing high surge to curb the spread,” the PM said.The meeting noted that 10 states were accounting for more than 91 pc of the cases and deaths.Attended by Cabinet Secretary Rajeev Gauba, Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan and NITI Aayog member (Health) VK Paul, the meeting described the situation in Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh as one “of serious concern.”In the last 14 days, Maharashtra has recorded 57 per cent of total cases and 47 per cent of deaths in the country. The state today saw 47,913 cases — more than double its earlier peak. Punjab has so far accounted for 4.5 per cent of the total cases and 16.3 per cent of the total deaths in the past fortnight.Chhattisgarh has contributed 4.3 per cent cases in 14 days and has recorded 7 per cent of the total deaths during the same period.The 10 high-burden states (Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Punjab, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, UP, MP, Gujarat, Haryana) and UTs are contributing 91.4 per cent of the total cases and 90.9 per cent of the deaths in the country.The experts at the meeting attributed the surge to a severe decline in compliance with Covid protocols, primarily related to use of masks and maintaining social distance, pandemic fatigue and lack of effective implementation of containment measures. “The exact contribution of mutant strains to the escalation of cases in some states remains speculative. The fact is measures to control the pandemic remain the same as before,” a PMO statement said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quell-surge-ramp-up-infra-prime-minister-narendra-modi-234763

The choppers could land only around 5 pm to pick up those who sustained injuries, the officials said.“The Maoists drew the forces into an ambush with heavy gunfire and encircled the security personnel from three sides. A heavy gunbattle ensued in the jungles which are devoid of any foliage at present,” a senior official said.

05-04-2021||New Delhi||‘Factually incorrect’: EC on Mamata’s claims about presence of outsiders at Nandigram polling booth||In a strongly worded rejoinder to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, the Election Commission has rejected her claim about the presence of outsiders at a polling booth in Nandigram as “factually incorrect” and “devoid of substance”.The EC sent the letter to Banerjee on Saturday in response to a complaint filed by her on April 1, when polling was held in Nandigram, alleging irregularities in the polling process.In its point-by-point rejoinder, the EC said Banerjee’s letter regarding booth capturing and the presence of outsiders at a polling booth in Boyal was “preceded by a massive coverage all over the country... which showed dozens of audio-visual shots of your being in this polling station and literally hurling an avalanche of allegations on some officials working with the government of West Bengal itself, paramilitary forces and eventually the Election Commission”.Citing reports received from the ground, including its observers, the poll body said, “It is self-evident from the perusal of all the reports that the allegations mentioned in your hand-written note are factually incorrect, without any empirical evidence whatsoever and devoid of substance.”The commission said it is a matter of deep regret that a “media narrative was sought to be weaved hour after hour to misguide the biggest stakeholders, which is the voters, by a candidate who also happens to be CM of the state”.At least this should have been appreciated that the “side show” was fraught with immense potential to have an adverse impact on law and order across West Bengal and may be in some other states, it said.“And all this was being done when the election process was/is on. There could not have been a greater misdemeanour,” the letter stated.Banerjee, who is contesting the polls from Nandigram, had visited a polling booth in Boyal when polling was underway on April 1.According to Chief Electoral Officer Ariz Aftab, wheelchair-bound Banerjee was stuck in the booth for almost two hours as two groups raised slogans against each other. A large number of CAPF personnel and senior officers reached there and brought out the chief minister after bringing the situation under control.Later, Banerjee blamed outsiders for creating trouble. She also accused the EC of not acting on complaints of alleged irregularities in the polling process in Nandigram lodged by her party, Trinamool Congress.

Some weapons of the security forces were missing, he added.In a major joint offensive, separate joint teams of security forces, comprising over 2,000 personnel, launched an anti-Naxal operation from Bijapur and Sukma districts in the South Bastar forests, considered as a Maoist stronghold, on Friday night.The operation was launched from five places - Tarrem, Usoor and Pamed (in Bijapur), and Minpa and Narsapuram (in Sukma), the official said.When the patrolling team dispatched from Tarrem was advancing through the forest near Jonaguda, around 500 km from the state capital Raipur, it was ambushed by cadres of PLGA (Peoples’ Liberation Guerilla Army) battalion of Maoists and a gun-battle ensued, he said.Chhattisgarh’s Deputy Inspector General (anti-Naxal operation) O P Pal on Saturday said some jawans, both from the police and paramilitary, were reported missing after the encounter, adding efforts were on to trace them.Pal had claimed that the Maoists suffered a huge loss in the gunfight. Only the body of a woman Naxal could be recovered from the spot amid heavy exchange of fire.The attack comes close on the heels of the March 23 incident when five DRG personnel were killed as the Maoists blew up a bus carrying the security personnel with an IED in Narayanpur district of the state.On March 21 last year, 17 security personnel were killed in a Naxal ambush in Minpa area of Sukma district.On April 9, 2019, BJP MLA Bhima Mandavi and four security personnel were killed after Naxals blew up their vehicle with an IED in Dantewada district.On April 24, 2017, 25 CRPF personnel were killed in a Naxal ambush in Burkapal area of Sukma district.In March 2017, 12 CRPF jawans were killed in a Maoist attack in Sukma district.In November 2016, two CRPF jawans were injured in a pressure bomb blast triggered by Naxals in the dense forest of Sukma district.In March 2016, a powerful landmine blast struck a truck filled with para-military soldiers in Raipur district, killing seven policemen.As many as 14 of the 27 districts in Chhattisgarh are affected by Left Wing Extremism violence.Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday spoke to Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel and took stock of the situation following the incident, officials said.Shah also directed CRPF’s Director General Kuldiep Singh to visit Chhattisgarh to assess the situation.The Union home minister condoled the death of the security personnel in the encounter and said their valour will never be forgotten. The government will continue its fight against the enemies of peace and progress, he added.President Ram Nath Kovind expressed deep anguish over the death of the security personnel.“The killing of the security personnel while battling Maoist insurgency in Chhattisgarh is a matter of deep anguish.My condolences to the bereaved families. The nation shares their pain and will never forget this sacrifice,” he tweeted.Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also expressed grief over the death of the security personnel.“Sadly, Prime Minister and Home Minister Amit Shah are too busy electioneering to take on the menace of Naxalism. TV proclamations ain’t enough. We need to put a decisive strategy and blueprint,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted.

05-04-2021||New Delhi||Private details of more than 500 million Facebook users, including 6 million Indians, on offer: Hacker||A hacker has posted the phone numbers and sensitive account details of nearly 533 million Facebook users -- about a fifth of the social networking platform's entire user base -- including over 61 lakh Indian users which has been dumped on a public cybercrime forum.The leaked data includes Facebook ID numbers, profile names, email addresses, location information, gender details, job data, and other details."All 533,000,000 Facebook records were just leaked for free. This means that if you have a Facebook account, it is extremely likely the phone number used for the account was leaked," tweeted Alon Gal, CTO of security firm Hudson Rock."I have yet to see Facebook acknowledging this absolute negligence of your data," he added.Facebook has confirmed the leak to The Record."This is old data that was previously reported on in 2019. We found and fixed this issue in August 2019," a Facebook spokesperson was quoted as saying in the report late on Saturday.With the data now entering the public domain, there is a real danger that this information can be widely used by cybercriminals for email or SMS spam, robocalls, extortion attempts, threats and harassment, etc.The data is reportedly broken up into download packages by country.As Cambridge Analytics still haunts nearly 87 million users, including over 5 lakh users from India, this has come as the biggest ever leak of a social media platform that has billions of users.In January this year, reports first surfaced that the phone numbers of 533 million users were currently being sold via a bot on encrypted messaging platform Telegram, which came from a Facebook vulnerability that was patched by the social network in 2019.According to a report in Motherboard, the person selling the database full of Facebook users' phone numbers ($20 per number) lets customers lookup those numbers by using an automated Telegram bot.Gal had then said: "It is very worrying to see a database of that size being sold in cybercrime communities, it harms our privacy severely and will certainly be used for smishing (the fraudulent practice of sending text messages) and other fraudulent activities by bad actors." However, this time, the Facebook data leak has been published with more details.In December last year, reports surfaced that a bug exposed the personal information like email addresses and birthdays of Facebook-owned Instagram users.Saugat Pokharel, an experienced bug hunter from Nepal, discovered the bug. The attack used Facebook's Business Suite tool, available to any Facebook business account, reported The Verge.According to a Facebook spokesperson, the bug was only accessible for a short period of time during a small test. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/private-details-of-more-than-500-million-facebook-users-including-6-million-indians-on-offer-hacker-234502
