02-04-2021||New Delhi||CBSE not to reduce syllabus for students of classes 9-12 for academic year 2021-22||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has decided not to reduce the syllabus for the students of classes 9 to 12 for academic year 2021-22, according to the new curriculum.The CBSE had last year rationalised the syllabus by up to 30 per cent for classes 9 to 12 for academic year 2020-21 to reduce the course load of students amid the COVID-19 crisis.The students who studied the reduced syllabus will appear in exams in May-June.According to the new syllabus released by the CBSE, the chapters and topics that were slashed in the last academic year have been restored in the official curriculum for the upcoming academic session, 2021-22.“The board already announced last year that the rationalisation exercise was a one-time initiative as teaching and learning through online mediums or alternative methods was fairly new then,” a CBSE official said.Schools across the country were closed in March last year, ahead of a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The teaching and learning activities majorly moved online during the lockdown.While a few states allowed a partial reopening of the schools in October, several states are again resorting to online classes in the new academic session amid a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases.In its syllabus-rationalisation exercise, the board had dropped the chapters on democracy and diversity, demonetisation, nationalism, secularism, India’s relations with its neighbours and growth of local governments in the country, among others.The choice of the chapters dropped from the syllabus drew a backlash from opposition political parties and a section of academicians, who claimed that the move was “ideologically driven”, while several school principals welcomed it as a relief to students.Last year, the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) had also announced a reduction of up to 25 per cent in the syllabus for the classes 10 and 12 board exams in 2021, taking into account the learning disruption due to the closure of schools during the lockdown.The CICSE is yet to announce its syllabus for the new academic session.

However, the personnel of the police and central forces brought the situation under control.Sporadic incidents of violence had also taken place on Thursday in Nandigram in Purba Medinipur district, which went to polls in the second of the eight-phase assembly elections in the state.Banerjee had accused central forces deployed in Nandigram of helping the saffron party under instructions from Union Home Minister Amit Shah.Allegations of booth capturing and partisan behaviour prompted the Election Commission to seek a report on an incident in Boyal village where the feisty TMC boss stayed put for over two hours outside a polling booth following a siege of sorts by BJP workers.

02-04-2021||New Delhi||Congress seeks cancellation of poll in Assam’s Tamulpur after BPF candidate switches to BJP||The Congress on Friday urged the Election Commission (EC) to cancel the poll held in Tamulpur assembly constituency of Assam after Bodoland People’s Front candidate switched sides to the BJP ahead of voting.A delegation of Congress leaders led by senior party leader and former law minister Ashwani Kumar met the EC and handed over a memorandum to it seeking cancellation of the poll.The Congress also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of violating the model code of conduct by “blatantly misusing” the official machinery by getting his picture printed on COVID-19 vaccination certificates in order to publicise himself and his party during the ongoing state assembly elections.While the poll panel has passed directions ordering the removal of the prime minister’s photos from the certificates, the Congress urged the EC to ensure that its directions are also complied with in states where by-elections are being held.The party delegation argued that it was incumbent on the EC to ensure the purity of the electoral process and free and fair polls, after BPF candidate Basumataray defected to the BJP.Kumar argued that defections induced by illegal means even before the counting of votes is a new phenomenon which is a “fraud on the people and robs the electorate of the freedom of choice in the election of their representative”.He said the nation looks to the EC to exercise its constitutional power to subserve the larger purpose of ensuring the sanctity, transparency and integrity of the electoral process.The delegation also sought an enquiry into the incident wherein EVMs were loaded in a vehicle belonging to a BJP candidate. “We have today made three representations to the Hon’ble Election Commission. The first one pertains to the induced defection through illegal means of the candidate of the Bodoland People’s Front in assembly constituency number 58 in Assam,” Kumar told reporters.He said the EC has enough powers in the Constitution to ensure that such inducements that vitiate the electoral process and put a question mark on the purity of the electoral system and which go to weaken democracy are nipped in the bud. He said the second representation was in respect of the EVMs found in the car of a BJP candidate in Assam which was a complete violation of the guidelines specified by the EC itself. In a memorandum signed by party leaders Randeep Surjewala, Ajay Maken and Kumar, the Congress said the model code casts restraints on the party in power to issue advertisements at the cost of the exchequer. “The picture of the prime minister on COVID-19 vaccine certificates undermines the sacrifices and hard work of all the health care workers in the country,” it said.“The same is also in violation of the earlier direction of the EC issued in March wherein the poll panel after receiving complaints on use of portrait of the prime minister on COVID vaccine certificates has via letter directed the Centre to remove the pictures in poll-bound states,” it added.“We request this Hon’ble Commission to issue urgent directions to preserve the sanctity of the election process by restraining the publishing of portraits of Prime Minister Narendra Modi upon COVID vaccine certificates,” the memorandum said, adding that it should be removed in all states where by-elections are being held.

02-04-2021||Vellore (TN)||DMK slams Centre over ‘income tax searches’ at residence of party chief Stalin’s daughter||The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam on Friday lashed out at the central government over ‘searches’ by income tax officials at the residence of party chief MK Stalin’s daughter Senthamarai in Chennai and alleged it has a ‘political objective.’Stalin said while he would face ‘pressures,’ cadres should continue to focus on field work to secure victory for the party in the April 6 Assembly polls.In a statement, he cautioned partymen to not get diverted due to ‘diversionary’ action like raids or ‘false propaganda’ of the ruling AIADMK and its allies.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, saying “raiding the opposition is BJP’s coping mechanism when facing electoral defeat”.Addressing a poll campaign at Jayamkondam, Stalin said his party would not be frightened or worried by such searches.“We will not be worried about it. Conduct more searches,” he said, adding his party would only be energised more by such raids. He said he would not be cowed down and he had faced even the Emergency period (1975-77).He said the central government was trying to confine them to their homes using searches just as elections were drawing close.“Such tactics would not succeed with the DMK men,” he said.Party general secretary Duraimurugan said when parties were on the verge of completing the campaign and looked forward to the day of polling, the income tax searches at the residence of Senthamarai, daughter of his party chief Stalin was done with a “political objective”.    Income tax officials neither confirmed nor denied the searches. Reportedly, similar searches were on in respect of other candidates as well. Security personnel outside DMK leader MK Stalin's daughter Senthamarai Stalin's residence during a raid by Income Tax in Chennai on Friday. PTI photoThe Centre has made a “wrong calculation” that raids just ahead of the election would rattle Stalin, his family and the party and also weaken poll preparations, Duraimurugan claimed while speaking to reporters here.“The DMK is not a party that can be scared by such searches,” he said, adding the party had already faced similar instances and it would not be deterred.Only recently, tax searches were held in the premises linked to party leader AV Velu and now searches have been conducted in the residence of Senthamarai and the union government pursuing such a tactic was neither “democratic” nor “honest”.“I condemn this,” he said.Had the party been afraid of such raids, the party would have been “dead” long ago and these only added to their determination and resoluteness, he added.The Centre may have thought that Stalin would not be able to see his beloved daughter becoming sad, but the DMK president is the leader of “lakhs and lakhs of party cadres” and he is a “courageous lion”, he said.When asked about searches in premises of party leaders belonging to AIADMK, an ally of the BJP and other parties as well, Duraimurugan said the tax raids vis-a-vis the DMK people were aimed at intimidating them while those in respect of others was only “eye-wash”.CPI (M) state secretary K Balakrishnan slammed the Centre, claiming that the search action was a diversionary tactic and would not yield any results. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dmk-slams-centre-over-income-tax-searches-at-residence-of-party-chief-stalins-daughter-233697

It shall also disclose under what circumstances, materials, such as, tobacco pouches or any other contraband/such things find their way inside the jail premises and what kind of preventive and other measures are being taken by the jail authorities,” A Bench headed by Justice UU Lalit said.Asking the Jail Superintendent to file the affidavit by April 5, the Bench posted the matter for further hearing on April 8.The order was passed on March 25 after receipt of a report by a subordinate court judge that accused Rahul – one of the three death row convicts in this case—was unable to walk properly.The Bench was surprised to note that the Jail Superintendent was asked to get accused Rahul medically examined and to furnish certificate but no such documents pertaining to his medical examination were placed on record.Though CCTV was installed near the medical dispensary, the life of the CCTV footage was only four days, it was told.A Bench headed by Justice Rohinton F Nariman had recently ordered installation of CCTV cameras at various places in the jail but in this case no CCTV footage was available, it noted.The Bench said the affidavit to be filed by the Jail Superintendent “shall also disclose the make of CCTV camera which have been installed which according to Raj Kumar does not have life greater than four days for CCTV footage; so also about the time lines adhered to and required for installing CCTV cameras and the budgetary allocation made for such installations.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-fumes-after-death-row-convicts-found-intoxicated-in-tihar-jail-233695

Over 6.43 lakh patients have recovered from the virus.The city had recorded 992 cases on Tuesday, 1,904 cases on Monday and 1,881 cases on Sunday.Delhi on March 19 had recorded 716 fresh COVID-19 cases, the highest in over two-and-a-half months, while the positivity rose had jumped to 0.93 per cent. Four fatalities were reported on that day pushing the death toll to 10,953, as per official data.The next day, Delhi had reported over 800 COVID-19 cases, for the first time this year, and the positivity rate had breached the one per cent-mark after over two months.The figures have been steadily rising since then, crossing two per cent-mark in between and then breaching the three per cent-mark.The positivity rate was 2.70 per cent on Tuesday, 2.77 per cent on Monday, 2.35 per cent on Sunday, 1.70 per cent on Saturday, 1.80 per cent last Friday, and 1.69 per cent last Thursday.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain had last week dismissed any possibility of imposing another lockdown in Delhi, saying it was not a solution to check the spread of the coronavirus that is again surging rapidly.Health experts and doctors have attributed this “sudden rise” in cases to people turning complacent and not following COVID-appropriate behaviour.The next two-three months could be challenging, they said, adding the situation can be kept under control if vaccination is opened up for more people and COVID-19 protocols are strictly adhered to.

India’s cotton exports jumped over 40 per cent to 10 million bales (of 170 kg each) in the 2018-19 marketing year on strong overseas demand.The ECC’s decision had raised hopes of a partial revival of Pakistan-India bilateral trade relations, which were suspended after the August 5, 2019 decision of New Delhi to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.In May 2020, Pakistan lifted the ban on import of medicines and raw material of essential drugs from India amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.Bilateral ties nose-dived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in Pakistan. Subsequent attacks, including one on an Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relations.The ties strained further after India’s war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Pakistan in February 2019 in response to the Pulwama attack in 2019 in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.India’s move to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 angered Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad. Pakistan also snapped all air and land links with India and suspended trade and railway services.

One of the options suggested was that instead of physically travelling abroad, online programmes could be explored as these are now become technically viable.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-ban-on-foreign-training-of-government-officials-extended-indefinitely-233680

02-04-2021||Konni (Kerala)||In poll-bound Kerala, PM Modi mentions ‘seven deadly sins’ of LDF, UDF||With Good Friday being observed in poll-bound Kerala, Prime Minister Narendra Modi used a Biblical reference for targeting the ruling CPI(M)-led LDF and Congress-headed UDF, saying the two fronts have committed the ‘seven deadly sins’ including greed and lust for power.“You all have heard of the seven deadly sins. UDF and LDF have committed their own seven deadly sins in Kerala,” Modi said at an election rally here on Friday, attacking the two fronts which have been ruling Kerala alternatively over the years.“The first sin is pride and arrogance. UDF and LDF feel that they can never be defeated. This has made their leaders very arrogant and disconnected from their roots, while the second sin is their greed for money,” he said, referring to the gold, dollar and solar cases, which has tainted the two fronts.The gold smuggling case is about the seizure of 30 kg of gold worth Rs 14.82 crore from a diplomatic baggage at the Thiruvananthapuram airport in July last year and the dollar case pertains to alleged smuggling of USD 1,90,000 (equivalent to Rs 1.3 crore by a former finance head of UAE consulate).The Solar panel scandal, which hit the previous UDF government of Oommen Chandy, relates to a couple cheating people of crores of rupees by promising to instal solar panels and offering franchise and jobs.Modi claimed the two fronts were envious, jealous and want to outdo each other in committing wrongs.“They suffer from competitive corruption. They are jealous if the other alliance makes a paisa more than the other,” the prime minister said at the rally at the stadium which was overflowing with people.The lust for power has made the two fronts to enter into alliances with communal, criminal and repressive elements of society, he alleged.“What was the stand of the Indian Union Muslim League on Triple Talaq? What are the social policies of Popular Front of India (PFI) and its political arm Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI). Can their regressive politics be supported? No,” he said.The two fronts were promoting dynasty politics and everything else is a side issue, Modi said.During an election rally in Palakkad district on March 30, Modi had targeted the LDF over the gold smuggling scam, saying the CPI(M)-led government “betrayed” the people of the state just as Judas did to Jesus for a few pieces of silver.

I want to emphasise that we have not imposed any export ban on vaccines,” he said.“No country has shared with the world the number of vaccines that India has while vaccinating its own population. Till now, we have supplied vaccines to more than 80 countries across the world and we have already stated that our external supplies would be done keeping in mind our domestic requirements,” he pointed out.The ‘Vaccine Maitree’ has supplied 6.4 crore doses to the global community.

India feels they will hurt the masses more than the military junta.Despite a bloody crackdown that has killed hundreds of civilians in Myanmar, India has avoided mentioning the word sanctions in its statements. Its position has been strengthened by the stand taken by Vietnam, which has taken over the Presidency of UNSC for the month of April.Vietnam’s UN Permanent Representative Dang Dinh Quy said if the UNSC were to impose sanctions, Vietnam will comply “as long as it does not exert a negative impact on the lives of people and the humanitarian situation of the country concerned.’’Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla made similar observations a fortnight back. “Don’t adopt tactics that seem reasonable if you are far away. Global sanctions will impact food security which will lead to inflation in Myanmar,’’ he had said.With two veto yielding UNSC members—Russia and China—also ranged against sanctioning Myanmar, India will be able to preserve its interests that include a port being built by the Adani Group, a first-ever link to the North-East from the Bay of Bengal via Myanmar territory and transfers of military equipment.At the media briefing on Friday, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi reiterated the observations made by the Vietnam diplomat including the centrality of ASEAN. India, he said, supported any attempts at resolving the current situation, including through the efforts of ASEAN, and remained engaged with other countries and the UNSC in order to “play a balanced and constructive role’’.A day earlier, other regional countries also disagreed with the western pressure to impose sanctions. A minister-level meeting of BIMSTEC (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand) turned down US-led efforts to isolate Myanmar and stressed on engagement.As compared to India, Vietnam has been more critical of Myanmar. While calling Myanmar a member of the ASEAN family, Vietnam, nevertheless, condemned the killing of over 100 civilian protesters on March 27. At the same time, it has joined hands with Eurasian states--Russia, China and India—at the UNSC to ensure their interests in Myanmar are not affected by sanctions imposed by ‘far off’ countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-aligns-with-eurasian-states-on-dealing-with-myanmar-violence-233669
02-04-2021||Dinhata/Natabari/Falakata (WB)||‘Not your party member’: Mamata hits back at Modi over 'another seat' jibe||Asserting that she was winning the election from Nandigram, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday hit back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that she does not need his “suggestion” on contesting from an alternate seat.The prime minister had on Thursday asked Banerjee to clarify whether there is truth in “rumours” that she would file her nomination for another seat going to the polls in the last phase, maintaining that the TMC chief has admitted defeat in Nandigram.“I want to tell the prime minister to control his home minister first and then try to control us. We are not your party members that you can control,” Banerjee said at an election rally in Dinhata in the north Bengal district of Coochbehar.Banerjee had on Friday alleged that Shah was influencing central forces to behave in a partisan manner during the Bengal polls.“I am not your party member that you will suggest I contest from another seat. I have contested from Nandigram and will win from there,” she added.At a rally in Uluberia on Thursday, Modi said that the people of Bengal are prepared if she goes anywhere else to contest, anticipating defeat in Nandigram, where she was up against BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari, her former close aide.Banerjee, who began her north Bengal tour with the rally here, alleged that the election is not being conducted by the Election Commission but by Amit Shah, the Home Minister.She also alleged that the central forces were being used to intimidate the voters.“I want more than 200 seats, since anything less than that will mean they (BJP) will buy the ‘gaddars’ (traitors),” Banerjee said, apparently admitting that TMC MLAs may be up for grabs if her party wins by a slender margin in the elections to the 294-member assembly.Banerjee said she required “strong people”, including women, to be polling agents for her party in the elections who would not give in to any intimidation or allurement.The TMC chief had for some time been voicing concerns that her rivals may buy up poll booth agents, critical to the election process as these party officials help check electoral malpractices and fake voting.Speaking at Natabari, also in Coochbehar, the chief minister said leaders from Tamil Nadu, where assembly elections will be held next week, had contacted her over income tax raids on relatives of DMK leader M K Stalin, claiming that these were done at the behest of Amit Shah.She alleged raids by central investigative agencies in Bengal were for similar political considerations.The TMC supremo while speaking at Falakata in Alipurduar, claimed the names of 14 lakh Bengali speaking citizens residing in Assam were deleted in NPR, and maintained the BJP had similar plans for Bengal also. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-your-party-member-mamata-hits-back-at-modi-over-another-seat-jibe-233661

But there is no need to panic. The government is monitoring the situation and taking all necessary steps."

02-04-2021||New Delhi||Udhayanidhi Stalin continues with his relentless attack; BJP seeks his disqualification||DMK youth wing president and Chepauk constituency candidate Udhayanidhi Stalin is continuing with his relentless attack against the BJP which is contesting the upcoming Tamil Nadu Assembly elections with the ruling AIADMK.After he referred to late Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj to allege that Prime Minister Narendra Modi sidelined them, Udhayanidhi, who PM Modi referred to as “crown prince”, has now claimed the threat to join BJP led to BCCI president Sourav Ganguly’s heart attack. Sources say the BJP has written to the Election Commission seeking his disqualification and delist him from the star campaigner list of the DMK in Tamil Nadu.According to Udhayanidhi, Ganguly was “threatened to join the BJP and the stress led to him getting a heart attack”. “Amit Shah’s job is to threaten others and topple elected governments, I will not be scared of him. I am Kalaignar’s grandson,” Udhayanidhi was quoted as saying.He also raised questions over the appointment of Home Minister Amit Shah’s son Jay Shah as BCCI secretary.Daughters of two late Union ministers had hit out at Udhayanidhi after he claimed at an election rally that Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley were sidelined by Prime Minister Modi, suggesting that it eventually led to their deaths.Hitting back, Bansuri Swaraj and Sonali Jaitley Bakshi urged Udhayanidhi to refrain from using the names of their parents for his poll propaganda.“Udhayanidhi Stalin ji, please do not use my mother’s memory for your poll propaganda! Your statements are false! PM Narendra Modi ji bestowed utmost respect and honour on my mother. In our darkest hour, the PM and party stood by us rock solid! Your statement has hurt us,” said Bansuri Swaraj, daughter of Sushma SwarajArun Jaitley’s daughter Sonali Jaitley Bakhshi tweeted saying: “Udhayanidhi Stalin ji, I know there is election pressure, but I won’t stay silent when you lie and disrespect my father’s memory. Dad Arun Jaitley and Narendra Modi ji shared a special bond that was beyond politics. I pray you are lucky enough to know such friendship.”Addressing an election rally, Udhayanidhi said: “Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to Dharapuram on Tuesday and criticised me. He said that I sidelined the party’s senior leaders and came through a shortcut. Did I come through a shortcut? Prime Minister Modi, who was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, came through a shortcut after sidelining other leaders.”“People were saying that LK Advani who took ‘Rath Yatra’ in India will become the next PM, but Modi sidelined him. Next Murli Manohar Joshi, (then) there was Jaswant Sinha and he was unable to bear the torture and left the party. Sushma Swaraj could not handle the pressure and she died. Arun Jaitley also could not handle the torture and he died. PM also sidelined Venkaiah Naidu,” he alleged.“You sidelined so many people and came to power and I am not someone scared of you and to salute you because I am not Edappadi Palaniswami but Udhayanidhi Stalin, grandson of Kalaignar. I am a man with self-respect,” he said.PM Modi had said “the crown of prince of DMK (MK Stalin’s son Udhayanidhi Stalin) sidelined many senior leaders and made horrible remarks but DMK did nothing to stop him”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/udhayanidhi-stalin-continues-with-his-relentless-attack-bjp-seeks-his-disqualification-233657
02-04-2021||Mumbai||Shut down trains and local markets, not malls, to curb COVID-19 infections: Malls body||A day after a suggestion was made for shutting down malls in the financial capital by the Mayor, a lobby grouping of such establishments on Friday appealed for the shopping plazas to be allowed to operate normally.The Shopping Centres Association of India said the malls get only 1 per cent of the floating population and a bulk of people are found in trains and local markets.The lobby grouping for malls wondered why trains and local markets which attract more crowds are allowed to operate, while retail and restaurants have a limited footfall walking-in have more restrictions."Surge in cases started after local trains were allowed in mid-February. There need to be more focus on local markets and trains to control the spread,” it said.It can be noted that Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar had on Thursday hinted at restrictions like halting movement on trains, malls and religious places in order to limit the infections. The plea comes on a day when Pune, one of the biggest cities in the state, has decided to go for a night lockdown from dusk to dawn, and days after the state government banned groups of over five from assembling together in the evenings. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is scheduled to address citizens late on Friday.The COVID-19 infections are rising by the day in Maharashtra, contributing nearly half of the country's total in the last few days. Mumbai alone had over 8,000 positive patients on Thursday.Localised restrictions like antigen testing before entering malls are derailing the recovery of the shopping places in Maharashtra, the association said.It has urged the state government to allow shopping centres and malls to operate normally, committing to follow all the safety measures to prevent spread of infections.The SCAI said malls are perhaps the only public infrastructure establishments which follow all the stringent protocols recommended by authorities for Covid-appropriate behaviour, and have also been conducting the antigen tests in Mumbai.The statement from the body said it is “unfortunate” that malls have been made a target for restrictions, adding that only 1 per cent of floating populations walks into malls. The body also invoked the livelihoods argument, stating that the shops and restaurants in malls employ people from economically weaker sections of the society and shutting down this sector will create huge impact on them. "We urge the state government to consider normalized operations of the shopping centres/malls,” a spokesperson for the association said, adding a representation has been made to the state government. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shut-down-trains-and-local-markets-not-malls-to-curb-covid-19-infections-malls-body-233654

02-04-2021||New Delhi||EVM controversy: If EC doesn’t wake up now, it’ll be fatal for democracy: Cong||The Congress on Friday questioned the Election Commission after a BJP candidate’s vehicle was found transporting a polled EVM in Assam’s Karimganj district and said if the poll body does not wake up now and remains “complicit” it will be fatal for democracy.Violence broke out in Karimganj district on Thursday night after a mob spotted a BJP candidate’s vehicle being used to transport a polled EVM to the strong room, forcing the police to fire in the air to bring the situation under control.The EC suspended four poll officials and ordered a repoll at the booth as a video went viral on social media.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi took a swipe at the Election Commission, tweeting in Hindi that the “EC’s car has broken down, the BJP’s intentions are bad and the condition of democracy has worsened”.Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that the “EVM fraud” was for everyone to see and asked whether the EC needed the BJP’s help to carry EVMs.“EVM fraud is for everyone to see. EVMs found in the car of BJP MLA candidate Krishnedru Paul after the second phase of polling in Assam. Does the ECI need the BJP to carry the EVM’s.“If the ECI doesn’t wake up even now and remains mute or complicit, it is fatal for democracy,” he said on Twitter.Surjewala alleged that the BJP was staring at a decisive defeat in the Assam Assembly elections and it had “panicked immeasurably”.“The last desperate measure is always EVM theft. Will the ECI reply - Why were EVM recovered from BJP candidate Krishnendu Paul’s car? Why were EVM found in the boot of a luxury car near Hatipura polling station in Diphu in Assam,” he asked.He posed several questions to the ECI, asking why were the officials carrying the EVM in Jamunukh without any security official accompanying them, in violation of the ECI mandate, and whether the voters in Kalaigaon complained of EVM disappearing from the booth.“What enquiry was held? What action was taken,” he asked in a series of tweets.“Will the ECI reply - Whether some suspicious officials were found inside the strongroom in Dibrugarh, where EVM are kept? What action was taken,” he asked.Surjewala also asked whether 139 polling stations faced serious EVM malfunctioning in the second phase, including in Jagiroad, Nagaon, Hojai, Nilbagan, Lumding, and sought to know what action has been taken.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the Election Commission needs to start acting decisively on reports of private vehicles transporting electronic voting machines, and a serious re-evaluation of the use of EVMs needs to be carried out by all national parties.Tagging a tweet which carried a video showing EVMs in the car of a BJP candidate in Assam, she said every time there was an election, videos of private vehicles caught transporting EVMs show up.“Unsurprisingly they have the following things in common: The vehicles usually belong to BJP candidates or their associates. The videos are taken as one off incidents and dismissed as aberrations. The BJP uses its media machinery to accuse those who exposed the videos as sore losers,” she said.She alleged that too many such incidents are being reported and nothing is being done about them.“The EC needs to start acting decisively on these complaints and a serious re-evaluation of the use of EVMs needs to be carried out by all national parties,” she said in a series of tweets.Congress leader Rajeev Shukla said that with such incidents happening again and again, the EC needs to restore the confidence of people in elections and the safety of EVMs. He said the incident is of serious nature and must be probed thoroughly.The incident snowballed into a huge controversy with the opposition Congress and AIUDF alleging that the EVM was being “stolen”, while the Election Commission suspended four poll officials and ordered a repoll at the booth.The vehicle of the polling party of the 149-Indira MV School in the Ratabari constituency broke down on their way to the strong room in Karimganj town, officials said.“They took a lift on a private vehicle. Incidentally, the vehicle was registered under the name of the wife of the sitting BJP MLA from Patharkandi Krishnendu Paul. When it reached the Nimal Bazaar area, some public spotted it,” a official of the district administration said.

02-04-2021||Karachi||Pakistan's textile industry upset as govt rejects cotton import proposal from India||Pakistan's struggling textile industry has voiced its disappointment after the Imran Khan government rejected a proposal to import cotton from India, the world's biggest producer, saying it is the need of the hour to avoid a massive export decline, a media report said on Friday.The federal Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Khan on Thursday rejected the proposal of a high-powered committee to import cotton from India, with Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi asserting that there can be no normalisation of ties until New Delhi reverses its decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.The Cabinet's decision has disappointed the textile export industry, the Dawn newspaper quoted Pakistan Apparel Forum chairman Jawed Bilwani as saying.The textile export sector, which was already under pressure due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been continuously demanding duty-free import of cotton yarn from all over the world, including India, to avert any big loss to textile exports.Describing Commerce Adviser Abdul Razak Dawood's recommendation to allow import of cotton and cotton yarn from India as realistic and the need of the hour, Bilwani said that the Cabinet must accord serious consideration to the proposal.The step would send a negative message to foreign buyers as cotton yarn was not available in the country, he said, adding that prices of cotton yarn have increased after the Cabinet's decision.“The government must ensure availability of cotton yarn if it did not want to allow its import from India,” Bilwani said as he feared massive textile export decline if import of cotton yarn from the neighbouring country was not allowed.In the current year, Pakistan faced a 40 per cent plunge in cotton production and if it was compared with 15 million bales in 2014-2015, then the drop was 50 per cent this year, he said.Bilwani said sea freights have already increased by 700 per cent due to the pandemic and the goods now reach their foreign destination in 105 days instead of 25 days.“If the government did not want to permit import of cotton yarn from India then it must impose a ban on export of cotton and cotton yarn for at least next six months,” he added.Pakistan's U-turn on Thursday came a day after the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC), under newly-appointed Finance Minister Hammad Azhar, recommended importing cotton and sugar from India, lifting a nearly two-year long ban on its import from the neighbouring country amidst tensions over the Kashmir issue.It had raised hopes of a partial revival of bilateral trade relations, which were suspended after the August 5, 2019 decision of New Delhi to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.India is the world's largest cotton producer and second-largest exporter. Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are main cotton growing states.India's cotton exports jumped over 40 per cent to 10 million bales (of 170 kg each) in the 2018-19 marketing year on strong overseas demand, especially from China, according to industry body CIA.In May 2020, Pakistan lifted the ban on import of medicines and raw material of essential drugs from India amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Ties between India and Pakistan nose-dived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in Pakistan. Subsequent attacks, including one on an Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship.The ties strained further after India's warplanes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack in 2019 in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.India's move to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 angered Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties with India and expelled the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad. Pakistan also snapped all air and land links with India and suspended trade and railway services. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistans-textile-industry-upset-as-govt-rejects-cotton-import-proposal-from-india-233638

She then narrated the entire incident to the Class 8 girl who rebuked the accused and warned him about not indulging in such acts, the officer said.To take revenge from the Class 8 girl, he created three fake accounts in her name on Instagram and posted her morphed nude photographs on those accounts. The accused also asked for sexual favours in order to delete the photographs, he said. "During interrogation, the accused disclosed that earlier he had a heated argument with the victim's friend on Instagram. To take revenge from the Class 8 girl, he created her fake profiles on Instagram. Thereafter, he sent her abusive contents, nude pictures, threatened and abused her," he said.The Faridabad Cyber Police Station has also lodged a case earlier against the accused for creating a fake profile of another girl, he said. Two mobile phones used to create fake profiles have also been recovered from the accused, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/25-year-old-delhi-man-held-for-creating-fake-profile-of-class-8-girl-posting-her-morphed-nude-pics-on-social-media-233637

Only 50 people will be allowed to attend a wedding and only 20 people can remain present for the last rites, he added.He said that essential services have been exempted from the curfew.Buses of the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML), city’s public transport system, will remain off roads for seven days, Rao said, adding that schools and colleges will remain closed till April 30.“Only the students of Classes 10 and 12, and the candidates preparing for MPSC exam will be allowed to carry out their regular academic activities,” he added.“All these decisions were taken in view of the surge in COVID-19 cases in the last few days. The situation is becoming critical. In the last one week, the positivity rate of the district has crossed 32 per cent,” Rao said.Till last Friday, the positivity rate was around 26-27 per cent. But in last one week, it went beyond 32 per cent and the per day tally of the cases is also around 8,000, he said.Rao said that as per the assessment by experts, if this growth rate does not change, the district will surpass the 9,000-mark (o COVID-19 cases) in the next two days.The situation will be reviewed after seven days when further decision will be taken, he said.According to him, efforts were on to increase the number of beds in hospitals in the district.“Since vaccination is the key to bring down the impact of infection, the speed of giving vaccines will be increased in the coming days,” he said.As far as testing ratio of the district is concerned, it is the highest in the state. On Thursday alone, 29,000 tests were carried out, he said, adding, “But we want to increase the testing ratio further.”The administration will focus on adding more oxygenated and ICU beds in the private as well as government- run hospitals, he said.The administration is in constant touch with private hospitals to increase the number of beds, Rao added.“We want to achieve the highest bed availability by April 5 and if the case scenario remains the same, we will have to declare some hospitals as 100 per cent COVID-19 hospitals,” he said.“The speed of vaccination in the district was the highest in the state in the last 10 days. It is even highest in the country, but we are planning to increase the pace. We are planning to scale up the vaccination to 1 lakh per day in the next three to four days,” the senior official said.In order to break the virus chain, monitoring of patients in home isolation will be done effectively and focus would be given on testing of super-spreaders, he said.BJP Lok Sabha member from Pune, Girish Bapat, who also attended the meeting, opposed the decision to stop the PMPML bus services and imposition of curfew from 6 pm.“We oppose the decision to suspend the PMPML service as majority of the working class is dependent on the public transport system. We as a party will take further course of action on the decision of PMPML,” he said.He also suggested that the earlier curfew timing of 8 pm to 6 am should be kept unchanged and the administration should ensure that more than five people do not gather.Bapat said that while implementing the restrictions, police should avoid using force, such as lathicharge, on common people.“People should fear the police, but they should not feel terrorised,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-restaurants-bars-malls-to-be-shut-for-week-in-pune-233633

DMK complains to EC||At a time when electioneering for the April 6 Tamil Nadu Assembly polls is at its peak, Income Tax officials on Friday carried out searches in the premises of DMK President M.K. Stalin's daughter Senthamarai here, sources said.Senthamarai is married to Sabareesan, who is said to have a major say in the DMK.Tax officials are also carrying out search operations in a couple of other places belonging to persons connected with the DMK.Tax officials are searching the house of Karthik, son of Mohan, DMK's Anna Nagar constituency candidate.Reacting to the searches, Stalin tweeted that with their electoral loss certain and in the absence of people's support, the BJP is misusing its powers."We are not slaves like the AIADMK to fall at the feet for such threats. Fearless. Daringly we will oppose," Stalin said.Electoral allies of the DMK such as the VCK have condemned the raids.Last month Income Tax officials searched former minister and DMK leader E.V. Velu's residence and other premises connected with him.Meanwhile the DMK has complained to the Election Commission of India alleging that tax officials had entered Senthamarai's residence forcibly."The income tax department has been used as a sword and as a pawn in the hands of the ruling BJP party and there are no reasons as to why these searches are being conducted few days before the  election date viz 6.4.2021," DMK said in its compliant.Pointing out the opinion polls have favoured DMK to capture power in the state, DMK said: "The overall sentiments of the people are in favour of the DMK combine as for last 10 years there has  been high rise of corruption and high rise of offences against women including sexual harassments at the workplace including one incident by a top police official in the DGP rank." Urging the poll body to intervene and direct the Income Tax department  to refrain itself from abusing its power during elections, the DMK said the act of tax deparment amounts to corrupt practice falling within the definition of Section 123(7) of Representation of People Act.Alleging the tax officials under the garb of discharge of official duties are abusing their powers for the purpose of poll prospects of the AIADMK- BJP combine, DMK added that all the officials  involved in these operations will be named and tried accordingly in accordance with law."Further their actions amounted to intimidating and defaming and therefore they will not have any protection under the Act for their official discharge of functions," the party added.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/m-k-stalin-condemns-it-raid-at-daughters-house-dmk-complains-to-ec-233629
02-04-2021||New Delhi||Covid second wave in India may peak by mid-April, say scientists||Scientists have predicted using a mathematical model that the ongoing second-wave of COVID-19 pandemic across the country could peak by mid-April, following which the infections may see a steep decline by the end of May.During the first wave of COVID-19 infections across India, the mathematical approach, named SUTRA, predicted that the initial surge of infections in August would peak by September and lower in February 2021.Scientists, including Manindra Agrawal from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, applied the model to predict the trajectory of the current surge in infections and found that the number of daily new infections is likely to peak in mid-April for this ongoing pandemic wave."For the last several days, we have found that there is a reasonable chance that the cases in India could peak sometime between 15-20 April. It is a sharp slope, but on the way down, it would likely be equally sharp, coming down very fast and by end of May may see a dramatic reduction," Agrawal told PTI."There is some uncertainty in predicting the peak value of daily new infections because of the sharp rise. Currently, it is coming to 1 lakh infections per day, but this can go up or down. But the timing remains the same between April 15-20," he added.The scientists predict that in the current wave, the first state to peak could be Punjab in a few days, followed by Maharashtra.However, the IIT Kanpur professor added that the model's prediction of the new peak is sensitive to the daily new infections data."Even a little bit of change each day causes the peak numbers to change by several thousand numbers. But the location of the peak has remained on mid-April," he added.Independent calculations made by scientists, including Gautam Menon from Ashoka University in Haryana, have also predicted that the peak of the ongoing wave of infections could be between mid-April and mid-May.However, Menon cautioned that such projections of COVID-19 cases should really be trusted only in the short term."Any excessively precise prediction, of a peak within just a 5-day window, would ignore the many uncertainties associated with the inputs to any such calculation," Menon, who was not involved in the SUTRA modelling, told PTI.Agrawal noted that the model uses three main parameters to predict the course of the pandemic."The first is called Beta, or contact rate, which measures how many people an infected person infects per day. It is related to the R-naught value, which is the number of people an infected person spreads the virus to over the course of their infection," Agrawal explained.The other two parameters, he explained are 'Reach', which is a measure of exposure level of the population to the pandemic, and 'Epsilon' which is the ratio of detected and undetected cases."The reason we had to introduce 'Reach' is that unlike earlier pandemics which start at a location and suddenly spread fast across a place, in COVID, the spread of the pandemic has been slower due to the many protective measures in place," Agrawal explained.The mathematician said 'Epsilon' helps factor in the number of asymptomatic infections across the country."Since the detected cases are quarantined, we assume they no longer contribute to new infections. So a growing number of daily new cases, reflect larger undetected infections. By measuring the number of new cases each day, we try to estimate the undetected and asymptomatic infections," Agrawal explained.He added that the model relies on inputs from daily reported new infections, based on which the value of the three main parameters are inferred."We learn everything from the daily-infections data. The beta value across India has gone up by 50 per cent in March, which indicates that a combination of factors—people becoming more relaxed, and more infectious variants going around. But precisely what reason this could be is something biologists have to say," the scientist noted.While the model did not previously predict a second-wave in India, he said it could have been due to a change in the parameters sometime between February and March 2021."So clearly during this time some parameters had changed. So we had to wait for some time to collect new data and see how the parameters had changed, which we now know," Agrawal said.On Friday, India recorded 81,466 new infections in a span of 24 hours—the highest single-day rise in cases since October 2, 2020—taking the COVID-19 tally of cases to 1,23,03,131, according to the Union Health Ministry data. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-second-wave-in-india-may-peak-by-mid-april-say-scientists-233627
02-04-2021||Mumbai||We will have to co-exist with virus for now: Multiplex, retail associations wary of lockdown in Maha||Cinema, retail and shopping industries have just begun their recovery process and won't be able to bear another shutdown, according to industry associations who have urged Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to not impose a lockdown in Maharashtra where COVID-19 cases continue to rise.The Multiplex Association of India (MAI), Retail Association of India (RAI), and Shopping Centres Association of India has said they are following all the safety protocols mandated by the government and should not be the first casualty of such restrictions.Maharashtra, whose capital Mumbai is home to Hindi cinema, on Thursday reported 43,183 new COVID-19 cases, its highest one-day rise since the pandemic began, taking its cumulative caseload to 28,56,163 a health official said. Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope recently said people should be ready for stringent measures in the coming days to curb the spread of COVID-19 and that imposing a lockdown is the last option for the state government. Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar on Thursday also hinted that some restrictions could be introduced in the city from Friday.Kamal Gianchandani, CEO PVR Pictures and president of MAI, said the cinema industry is mentally reconciled with the fact that they will have to "co-exist with the virus for now"."There's a sense of deja vu for sure because we all have painful memories of the lockdown," he told PTI in an interview, emphasising the need for stricter enforcement of safety protocols and faster vaccination of people.Gianchandani said businesses should be permitted to function because that's the only way for them to sustain."If we can't function, the whole cycle comes to a stop and then we cannot sustain ourselves. So, if at all, they're thinking of a second lockdown, we would urge them to reconsider their decision and take a much more long-term and pragmatic approach."Businesses, the economy and the virus have to co-exist. You can't manage and contain one at the cost of the other. It's not an either-or situation anymore. It has to be an 'and' situation," he added.Several films like "Haathi Mere Saathi" (Hindi version), "Bunty Aur Babli 2", and "Chehre" that were up for release in March and April have been pulled by the makers from the calendar due to uncertainty amid the pandemic.Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, RAI, told PTI that a lockdown would be a non-analytical and knee-jerk reaction."Because it means we have given up hope that we can control the situation, that in the last one year, we have not learnt anything new. So, this is a really non-tenable situation." A lockdown will create a domino effect on businesses, supply chain as well as jobs, he warned."When the businesses were at 30 or 40 per cent levels, a whole lot of MSME suppliers were impacted. More than 20 per cent of the retail workforce got impacted. Thankfully, we were able to bring back some amount of economic activity and retailers went out of their way to ensure people got their jobs back."But we cannot afford this kind of lockdown. Forty-six million people work in the retail sector across the country in various forms. A lockdown is going to cripple all of them," Rajagopalan warned.Mukesh Kumar, chairman and director on board, Shopping Centres Association of India, said the industry is already suffering because of the previous decisions such as mandatory testing for the malls and reducing the timings."We are just recovering. We have reached almost 60 per cent of the footfall and 90 per cent of sales in March but then it started going downhill once the notification came about checking people coming to the mall and that they must have a negative RT PCR report... Then the second news came about reducing the timings, so these were all bad news."Let's hope that this doesn't happen because we will not be able to take another lockdown. Another shut down will be discriminatory only for the malls, theatres and F&B," Kumar told PTI.According to SCAI, they cater to just one per cent of the population and follow stringent safety protocols with malls ensuring that they don't have more than one person per square foot."If you look at the number of people in the mall, it is very limited. They are being monitored and you can't get a safer place than the mall where everything is controlled, monitored, reviewed and audited. You can't have this in markets, railway stations, airports or any other crowded place. In the event, any action is taken, the first casualty is the mall, theatres and the F&B," Kumar claimed.Despite the rising COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra, Gianchandani is cautiously optimistic about the future provided theatres are allowed to operate in Maharastra, a crucial state for business."I remain confident as at this point, there is no change of dates as we speak. 'Sooryavanshi' is coming on April 30 and 'Radhe' is scheduled for May 12 or 13, depending on the Eid. So as we speak, these films are releasing on the dates that they have announced, but at the same time, the cases continue to worsen, there would be concerns."I do think that government machinery and administration in districts are doing everything possible to contain the spike in cases. And my sense is they would be able to show results fairly quickly. So we remain quite optimistic that these films will release on time," Gianchandani noted.Rajagopalan said instead of imposing restrictions, the government should be utilising resources like malls in the vaccination drive.

02-04-2021||New Delhi||Kamal Haasan a 'super-NOTA'; his party will not win single seat: Karti Chidambaram||Congress leader Karti Chidambaram on Friday dubbed Kamal Haasan a "super-NOTA" and said the actor-turned-politician's Makkal Neethi Maiam (MNM) will not win a single seat in the Tamil Nadu Assembly polls as it is "not a sustainable political party".The Congress MP from Sivaganga also slammed the AIADMK-BJP alliance and said the people of Tamil Nadu do not want a government which has any "stain, scent or shadow" of the BJP as its 'Hindi-Hindutva' agenda "irritates" them.In an interview with PTI, Karti Chidambaram also claimed that the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-Congress alliance will win over 200 out of the 234 Assembly seats in the single-phase April 6 polls."People do not want a government which will not respect Tamil sentiments, Tamil language and Tamil heritage. They do not want a government which has any stain, scent or shadow of the BJP," Karti Chidambaram said.The 'Hindi-Hindutva' agenda of the BJP "irritates" the Tamil people, and they do not want the BJP in any shape or form, he asserted.The Congress leader also claimed that despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visits to poll-bound Tamil Nadu and several top BJP leaders' aggressive campaigning, the BJP's "zero MLAs, zero MPs" status will remain."They will remain at zero MLAs and zero MPs. The prime minister can make as many trips as he wants to Tamil Nadu, but the BJP's Hindi-Hindutva policies will be roundly rejected by the people," he told PTI over phone while on the campaign trail seeking votes for the DMK-Congress alliance's candidates.Asked if Haasan and his outfit MNM will impact the polls, Karti Chidambaram said, "He (Haasan) is only a 'super-NOTA', he will not win a single seat and his is not a sustainable political party. They will only congregate for the elections and they will disperse after the elections."The 'None Of The Above' (NOTA) option on electronic voting machines, was introduced in 2013. After the Supreme Court order in 2013, the EC added the NOTA button on the EVMs as the last option on the voting panel.On the key issues in the Tamil Nadu polls, Karti Chidambaram said the main issue was that of ten years of "non-performance" of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK)."The livelihood of the average person has not improved in Tamil Nadu. Then there is the rampant mis-governance and corruption by the AIADMK. It has favoured a few in giving out public contracts, there has been a huge siphoning of resources as well as poor quality of work by the public works department," the 49-year-old leader said.During the COVID times, the AIADMK did not provide direct cash transfer to the people and only gave Rs 1,000 for ration cards which was "woefully inadequate" for the lockdown period, he said.Asked if the reported differences within AIADMK were giving the advantage to the Congress and the DMK, Karti Chidambaram said even if the party is united, people will not support the AIADMK which became "abundantly" clear during the parliamentary elections."Even if you add the votes of (TTV) Dhinakaran (the leader of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam), the AIADMK would have lost," he asserted.Karti Chidambaram also expressed confidence that the DMK led alliance will "win handsomely" and repeat the performance of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections when the UPA won 38 out of the 39 parliamentary seats. He said the alliance will win over 200 seats in the 234-member Assembly.Asked about the announcement of the Dadasaheb Phalke award to Rajinikath by the Centre on Thursday amid poll campaigning and its impact, the Lok Sabha MP said, "I congratulate Mr Rajinikanth for getting the award. He has had a long innings in the film industry, he should remain in the film industry and this will have absolutely no bearing on elections.""The BJP has been trying to ride on his (Rajinikanth's) coat-tail for many years and this will have absolutely no impact," he said.On how the Congress intends to strengthen itself in the state going forward, Karti Chidambaram said he has definite ideas which can be discussed after the elections.Single phase polling to 234 Assembly seats in Tamil Nadu is scheduled on April 6. The counting of votes will take place on May 2 along with that of Kerala, Assam, West Bengal and Puducherry polls. The Congress is contesting 25 seats in the Tamil Nadu polls.The alliance comprising DMK, Congress and some small parties is taking on the ruling AIADMK that is facing the polls in alliance with the Pattali Makkal Katchi, the BJP, the former union minister GK Vaasan-led Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) along with other smaller parties.The MNM has been trying to position itself as the only alternative to the Dravidian majors. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kamal-haasan-a-super-nota-his-party-will-not-win-single-seat-karti-chidambaram-233616

02-04-2021||Sitalkuchi (WB)||Amit Shah: Mamata govt runs on 3T model of 'Tolabaji, Tanashahi, Tushtikaran'||Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday lashed out at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, accusing her of running the TMC government in the state on the 3T model of 'Tolabaji' (extortion), 'Tanashahi' (dictatorship) and 'Tushtikaran' (appeasement).Shah exuded confidence that Banerjee, who is contesting her former lieutenant and BJP candidate Suvendu Adhikari in the Nandigram seat, will lose from the constituency in Purba Medinipur district.Identifying cross-border infiltration as the biggest problem of the north Bengal region, which he claimed faced injustice at the hands of the TMC government, the Union home minister promised to completely stop illegal immigration from neighbouring Bangladesh if the BJP is voted to power in the state.He also promised that the BJP will spend Rs 2,000 crore annually on north Bengal's development and establish an AIIMS to cater to the medical necessities of the people of the region.Addressing an election rally in Coochbehar district's Sitalkuchi, situated near the India-Bangladesh border, he said, "Cross-border Infiltration is north Bengal's biggest problem. The TMC government can never stop it, only we can." "Mamata Banerjee runs the state government on the 3T model of 'Tolabaji' (extortion), 'Tanashahi' (dictatorship) and 'Tushtikaran' (appeasement)," he said.Exuding confidence of coming to power in the state with a massive mandate, Shah said, "We are winning in the first two phases of elections (held on March 27 and April 1).Mamata didi is losing in Nandigram."Shah accused the TMC government of meting out injustice to the north Bengal region."Mamata didi has done nothing for the development of the region. After coming to power, the BJP will constitute a North Bengal Development Board and spend Rs 2,000 crore annually on the region's development."We will also establish an AIIMS, which will cater to the medical necessities of not only Coochbehar district but also of the entire region," he said.The constituencies in the Coochbehar district will go to polls in the fourth phase on April 10.

No wonder their leaders keep insulting women again and again," he said without naming anyone.DMK leader A Raja had earlier courted controversy for making alleged disparaging remarks against Tamil Nadu chief minister K Palaniswami's mother during an election rally, drawing criticism.Taking note of a complaint from the ruling AIADMK, the Election Commission had on Thursday barred Raja from campaigning for 48 hours and also removed him from his party's list of star campaigners for the April 6 Assembly polls. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dmk-and-congress-leaders-keep-insulting-women-says-modi-in-tamil-nadu-rally-233609

It, however, warned that assumptions of “parity” amid extended ranges of nuclear systems and deployments may lead to “misunderstandings and mis-signalling”.Both countries ‘on same page’Chinese and Indian experts share the same stance on no-first use and that nuclear escalation between the two countries is not only unlikely, but also unthinkable. — SIPRI, International think tankSwedish think tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Thursday released its report “South Asia Nuclear challenges Interlocking views from India, Pakistan, China, Russia and the United States”. It cited experts from the five countries to build an argument.“Among Chinese and Indian experts, there was a prevailing view that they shared the same stance on no-first use and that nuclear escalation between the two countries was not only unlikely, but also unthinkable,” the report said.The report warned that assumptions of “postural parity” may bring stability in the short term, especially when altercations were largely limited to skirmishes at the border, but in the longer term, such assumptions might lead to “misunderstandings and mis-signalling”.The continued dominance in Indian analyses of the concept of a “two-front” threat from China and Pakistan meant that greater consideration of how deterrence would operate among these three countries, said the SIPRI report.Emerging technologies may have a cascading effect. “Experts from India and Pakistan expressed concerns over how hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence and autonomy may change the concept of deterrence,” the report said.The report cited the February 2021 India–Pakistan joint statement on ceasefire and withdrawal of Chinese and Indian forces from Pangong Tso area in the aftermath of the Galwan clashes.

The proposal was cleared a day earlier by the Pakistan’s Economic Coordination Committee (ECC).Edit: Pakistan u-turn in 24 hrsRaises KashmirThe PM has said there can be no normalisation of ties with India until they reverse their Aug 5, 2019, actions on Kashmir. — Shireen Mazari, Pakistan MinisterOn Wednesday, Pakistan appeared to be on course to reversing two official notifications of August 10, 2019, that banned all trade with India in protest against the change in status of J&K. But there might have been an internal pushback in Islamabad because at least one import proposal — for raw cotton and yarn — must have been cleared by Pakistan PM Imran Khan as he is also the Minister of Commerce and Textile.Newly appointed Pakistan Finance Minister Hammad Azhar had framed the ECC’s approval for the import of cotton and sugar in terms of economic necessity. Prices of sugar in India were the lowest in the world while cotton will help the textile sector tide over raw material shortage.The tables were turned on Thursday with Pakistan’s Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari tweeting that the Cabinet has not approved the EEC’s decision.“Today cabinet stated clearly NO trade with India,” she tweeted, while stating that Imran Khan had made it clear that “there can be no normalisation of relations with India until they reverse their illegal actions” regarding occupied Kashmir taken on August 5, 2019.In case Pakistan had cancelled the two notifications, the path would have cleared for India reversing the 200 per cent duty imposed on Pakistani trade. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-takes-u-turn-on-imports-from-india-233371

The EC also referred to some other remarks made by Raja against the state CM.Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K Palaniswami on Thursday alleged that women in the state would not have protection if the DMK was voted to power in the April 6 Assembly election.Referring to the alleged offensive remarks made by DMK MP A Raja recently over his birth, the CM said DMK chief MK Stalin “failed” to condemn the comments of his party leaders on women.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/election-commission-bars-dmks-raja-from-campaigning-for-48-hours-233398
02-04-2021||Wayanad(Kerala)||Prime Minister Narendra Modi helping corporates: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of “helping” the big corporates instead of empowering the millions of poor in the country.While campaigning for Congress candidates contesting in the April 6 elections from assembly seats falling in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency, he said, “The PM believes if you inject money in the hands of the biggest businesses, you can start the economy. But all that happens is that those big corporates take that money away.”Gandhi held roadshows in Mananthavady and Sultan Batheri in Wayanad seeking votes for the party candidates.Addressing an election meeting in Kalpetta, the former Congress president claimed that his party has a solution to solve the problem of economic crisis.“To start Kerala’s economy, we are proposing an idea called NYAY. It’ll not only help poor people, it’ll start Kerala’s economy and start production of jobs. NYAY is Rs 6,000 a month into all of Kerala’s poorest people’s bank accounts,” he said.He said his party believes that “if you want to start an economy you have to put money into poor people's hands”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prime-minister-narendra-modi-helping-corporates-rahul-gandhi-233400

These five will be in addition to the batch of three jets that arrived from France yesterday.India to take part in Bangladesh military drillNew Delhi: A multinational military exercise ‘Shantir Ogroshena 2021’ (Front Runner of Peace) will be held at Bangladesh to commemorate the birth centenary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and mark 50 years of liberation. The Indian Army contingent comprising 30 personnel, including officers, JCOs and jawans of a battalion from the Dogra regiment, will participate in the exercise along with contingent of Royal Bhutan Army, Sri Lankan Army and Bangladesh Army from April 4 to 12. TNSThe IAF announced the arrival of three jets late Wednesday night saying the jets were provided mid-air re-fuelling by tankers of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) air force.The IAF also thanked the UAE air force for re-fuelling the Rafale jets, describing it as yet another milestone in the strong relationship between the two air forces.The arrival of three jets yesterday means the IAF now has 14 of these planes, each capable of carrying lethal missiles which widen the arc of operations.The new additions are expected to be based at Hasimara in northern part of Bengal. The key base is close to the narrow Siliguri Corridor, which is strategically vital in defending the areas abutting the Chumbi valley – held by China. Doklam, where a standoff had ensued between India and China in 2017, is at the southern-edge of the Chumbi valley.The first squadron, (16-18 planes each), was raised at Ambala. India had ordered 36 jets at a cost of 7.89 billion euros (Rs 59,000 crore) in 2016. The first lot arrived in July 2020 and since then the jets have been coming in batches.French Ambassador Emmanuel Lenain, who was at an event in Kochi on March 30, spoke about the timeline of the delivery, saying, “By 2022 all 36 jets will be delivered to India.”The Rafales are the first step to building up the IAF strength to 42 fighter jet squadrons. The IAF currently has 31 squadrons against the need for 42 squadrons, assessed to tackle a simultaneous two-front war with Pakistan and China. The Ministry of Defence has okayed 83 Tejas Mark 1A jets and is looking at additional MiG 29 and Sukhoi 30 MKI jets from Russia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/5-more-rafale-jets-by-month-end-233418

The rising active cases are a cause of worry as these can overwhelm the health systems. These now make up 4.78 per cent of the total infections as recovery rate has slipped further to 93.89 per cent.India’s active caseload had fallen to a low of 1, 35,926 on February 12 which was 1.25 per cent of the all cases.Toll also rose further today reaching 1,62,927 with 459 daily new deaths, the highest in 116 days.With the situation looking glum, the Centre, in a step to exponentially expand the countrywide vaccination drive, decided to operationalize both public and private sector COVID Vaccination Centres (CVCs) on all days of month of April (from today till April 30, 2021).  The Centre wrote to states asking them to make the necessary arrangements to provide COVID vaccinations in all centres on all days of the month, including gazetted holidays during April 2021.“This step has been taken after deliberations with the states on March 31 to optimally use all vaccine centres across public and private sectors to ensure a rapid increase in the pace and coverage of COVID vaccination. The vaccination exercise as a tool to protect the most vulnerable population groups in the country from COVID-19 continues to be regularly reviewed and monitored at the highest level,” said the Health Ministry.The earlier two phases of inoculations have covered over 6 crore people so far as against the targeted 30 crore (health, frontline workers, 60 plus people and 45 to 59 year olds with co morbidities).In the current phase all 45 years plus people irrespective of co morbid conditions will be covered.TOTAL VACCINE DOSES ADMINISTERED SO FAR6.75 Crore today (88,48,558 health workers with the 1st dose, 52,63,108 health workers 2nd dose, 93,99,776 frontline workers 1st dose, 39,18,646 frontline workers 2nd dose and 4,01,06,304 who are over 45 years old.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/expanded-covid-19-vaccine-drive-15-28-lakh-shots-to-people-aged-45-above-233264

So today in Cabinet there will be discussion on ECC decisions incl trade with India & then govt decision will be taken! Media shd be aware of this atleast!” Mazari tweeted.Azhar’s announcement on Wednesday to import cotton and sugar from India had raised hopes of a partial revival of bilateral trade relations, which were suspended after the August 5, 2019 decision of New Delhi to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.India is the world’s biggest producer of cotton and the second biggest sugar manufacturer.In May 2020, Pakistan had lifted the ban on import of medicines and raw material of essential drugs from India amid the Covid-19 pandemic.Ties between India and Pakistan nose-dived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in Pakistan. Subsequent attacks, including one on an Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship.The ties strained further after India’s war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack in 2019 in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.India’s move to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August, 2019 angered Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties with India and expelled the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad. Pakistan also snapped all air and land links with India and suspended trade and railway services.

02-04-2021||New Delhi||Two +ve tests at interval of 102 days with one -ve defined as SARS-CoV-2 re-infection: ICMR study||Two positive tests at an interval of at least 102 days with one interim negative test have been defined as SARS-CoV-2 re-infection by Indian scientists for establishing surveillance systems, according to an ICMR study.    But a confirmation of the re-infection will require a whole-genome sequencing, it stated.While SARS-CoV-2 re-infection is still a rare phenomenon, Indian scientists have developed an easy-to-use epidemiological definition of re-infection for establishing surveillance systems.According to the study 'SARS-CoV-2 re-infection: development of an epidemiological definition from India' which has been published by Cambridge in the Epidemiology and Infection journal, an investigation was conducted with the objective to develop an epidemiological case definition of possible SARS CoV-2 re-infection and assess its magnitude in India.  SARS-CoV-2 re-infection is an emerging concern and there is a need to define it, the scientists highlighted. Therefore, a working epidemiological case definition for re-infection was developed and its magnitude was explored via an archive-based, telephonic survey.  The epidemiological case definition for SARS-CoV-2 reinfection was developed from a literature review of data on viral kinetics.    Re-infection with SARS CoV-2 was defined as two positive tests at an interval of at least 102 days with one interim negative test.  During the archive-based, telephonic survey, thirty-eight of the 58 eligible patients could be contacted, with twelve (31.6 pc) being healthcare workers. The majority of the participants were asymptomatic and had a higher Ct value during their first episode.  "To conclude, a working epidemiological case definition of SARS CoV-2 re-infection is important to strengthen surveillance. The present investigation contributes to this goal and records reinfection in 4.5 per cent of SARS CoV-2 infected individuals in India," the study stated.  "Taking available evidence into consideration, re-infection with SARS CoV-2 in our study was defined as any individual who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on two separate occasions by either molecular tests or rapid antigen test at an interval of at least 102 days with one negative molecular test in between," the study stated.  "While SARSCoV-2 re-infection is still a rare phenomenon, there is a need for epidemiological definition of re-infection for establishing surveillance systems and this study contributes to such goal," it said.Some respondents in the study had a symptomatic second episode as opposed to the first one. The rate and duration of hospitalisation was not compared as during the initial phase of the pandemic in India all cases were being hospitalized for at least 14 days, irrespective of symptom severity.  Currently, there is no consensus regarding the working definition of re-infection, based only on epidemiological features; a resource-intensive method like whole genome sequencing being the only confirmation."It is not logistically feasible to store the samples of millions of positive cases for future sequencing to identify an important phenomenon like SARS CoV-2 re-infection," the study said.Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has considered the duration of 90 days between two positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA along with genomic evidence of re-infection as an investigative criterion to understand the phenomenon of reinfection.Both CDC and European CDC suggested the use of genomic evidence for confirmation of reinfection, However, an epidemiological working definition will be more pragmatic and helpful to assess the magnitude of re-infection in most population and resource-constrained settings.While COVID-19 re-infection is still rarely reported, nonetheless, immunity should not be assumed and public health measures such as physical distancing, hand-hygiene, and use of masks should be followed after recovery from the first event of infection, the study stated.Further well-designed cohort studies must be undertaken to understand the natural history of COVID-19, including its immunogenicity, susceptibility to re-infection, antibody-dependent enhancement and the severity of re-infections. It may also be suggested that the samples of healthcare workers may be stored for genomic analysis to study suspected COVID-19 reinfections, particularly in resource-limited settings as chances of them encountering such events are higher due to potential high-risk occupational exposure.

02-04-2021||Nandigram/Kolkata||West Bengal polls: Over 80 per cent voter turnout, violence in second phase||A large voter turnout of more than 80 per cent despite sporadic incidents of violence and allegations of vote fraud on Thursday marked the second phase of West Bengal assembly polls.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also accused central forces deployed in Nandigram constituency, where she is locked in battle with her former lieutenant, Suvendu Adhikari now with the BJP, of helping the saffron party under instructions from Union Home Minister Amit Shah.Allegations of booth capturing and partisan behaviour prompted the EC to seek a report on an incident in Boyal village where the feisty TMC boss stayed put for more than two hours outside a polling booth following a siege of sorts by BJP supporters.Banerjee slammed the Election Commission for not taking any action despite lodging 63 complaints and threatened to move court over it. Amongst the complaints were allegations of “booth capturing” and “massive fake voting” in Boyal.The area saw a face-off between TMC and BJP supporters who gave vent at each other with slogans of “Khela Hobe” and “Jai Shri Ram”.Stones were hurled and abuses traded, prompting the administration to rush a police contingent to the spot.Banerjee also rang up the West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to complain about the situation.Despite the violence and accusations of vote fraud in Nandigram, the TMC supremo said she was confident of victory from the constituency where she had a decade-and-half ago led a farmers’ movement against a chemical hub planned by the then Left front government.“I am not worried about Nandigram, I am confident of victory. (But) I am worried about democracy,” Banerjee said as she showed the ‘V’ for victory sign to a gaggle of press photographers.The TMC boss claimed she would win a majority of the 60 seats that had gone to polls in the first and second phase.The TMC leadership also complained of “terror unleashed by the Central forces in favour of the BJP” in the Nandigram constituency, which recorded 80.79 per cent polling till 5 pm.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was campaigning elsewhere in the state however said “what happened in Nandigram proves that Banerjee has lost the polls.”While her rival Adhikari said, “It has become her habit to insult people of Nandigram.  The people of Nandigram will not forget this insult. Mamata Begum (Mamata Banerjee) will be defeated.”Suvendu Adhikari’s car too was attacked twice at - Takapura and Satengabari -  and stones were pelted while he was visiting booths in the assembly constituency.His vehicle was gheraoed at various locations as TMC supporters shouted slogans against the BJP leader. Similarly, BJP candidate from Keshpur assembly constituency Tanmay Ghosh’s vehicle was also vandalised allegedly by the Trinamool Congress supporters, officials said.Despite tight security in 30 assembly segments spread across Purba and Paschim Medinipur districts, Bankura and South 24 Parganas,  rival TMC and BJP supporters fought pitched battles in several places in the four districts.“Till 5 pm, 80.43 per cent polling has been recorded in the state,” EC officials said.Bankura recorded the highest turnout at 82.92 per cent, followed by Purba Medinipur at 81.23, South 24 Parganas at 79:65 per cent, Paschim Medinipur at 78 per cent.

02-04-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||U-turn: Ongoing polls force govt to reinstate January-March interest rates||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 1Less than 12 hours after slashing interest rates on small savings, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday withdrew the order claiming that it was an “oversight.’’“The schemes of Government of India shall continue to be at the rates which existed in the last quarter of 2020-2021, ie, rates that prevailed as of March 2021. Orders issued by oversight shall be withdrawn,” Sitharaman tweeted early in the morning.“Interest rates on small savings to be retained at level of fourth quarter of last financial year,” she said.Also read: Congress hits back over interest rate orders, 'oversight or election-related hindsight?'The Minister reversed an order announced at 10 pm on Wednesday in view of the ongoing elections, said sources. This would have been the second blow for a large section of the population, especially the elderly and professionals, who either bank heavily on the interest from fixed small savings or put aside for the future in public provident fund. Interest rates on fixed bank deposits have already been falling in tandem with lower interest on credit by the corporate sector.In bad news for fixed income depositors, the Government cut the interest rates on a slew of such schemes including the post office small savings schemes for the three months and Senior Citizen Savings Scheme to 6.5 % from 7.4 % per annum.The interest rate on PPF has been cut to a 44-year low of 6.4 % from 7.1 % per annum while the five-year Monthly Income Account Scheme will offer 5.7 per cent instead of 6.6 per cent payable monthly.Interest rates of small savings schemes of GoI shall continue to be at the rates which existed in the last quarter of 2020-2021, ie, rates that prevailed as of March 2021. Orders issued by oversight shall be withdrawn. @FinMinIndia @PIB_India  Earlier story: Interest rates on small savings schemes cutOn the 1-year time deposit, the rate of interest stands will be 4.4 % while on the five-year deposit, the rate will remain 5.8 % per annum.The biggest cut is on the 1-year deposit where the new rate stands lower by 1.1 %. The interest rate on post office savings account has also been cut from 4 % to 3.5 %. The 5-year RD scheme will get 5.3 % while Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana will offer 6.9 % per annum. The money in KVP will now double in 138 months (6.2 %) instead of earlier tenure of 124 months (6.9 %).Based on government yields, at the start of every quarter of the financial year, the government sets the interest rates on post office schemes for the next three months.But there is no change till maturity for investments in NSC, KVP, Time Deposits, Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS).There is a provision in PPF and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY) for a revision in the rate each quarter of any financial year.Many post office schemes come with tax benefits under Section 80C of the I-T Act and all of them have sovereign backing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/u-turn-ongoing-polls-force-govt-to-reinstate-january-march-interest-rates-233114
