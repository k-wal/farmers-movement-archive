13-04-2021||Dehradun||Kumbh and Markaz shouldn’t be compared: Uttarakhand CM Tirath||Uttarakhand Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Tuesday said the ongoing Kumbh Mela in Haridwar should not be compared with the Nizamuddin Markaz which was held in a closed space and attended even by foreigners.“There should be no comparison between Kumbh and Markaz. The Markaz was held in a closed space, in a Kothi like structure whereas the Kumbh is being held in the open on the sprawling ghats of the Ganga,” Rawat said on a weekly talk show organised by the Hindustan Times.The chief minister was replying to a question as to why the two religious events should not be equated (Nizamuddin Markaz and Kumbh) as Kumbh also draws crowds and could strengthen the second wave of the coronavirus infection.Citing other differences between the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar and Nizamuddin Markaz, Rawat said, “The devotees attending Kumbh are not from outside but our own people.”“Moreover, when the Markaz was held there was not much awareness about Corona nor were there any guidelines. No one knew for how long the attendees of the Markaz had remained in the confines of the structure,” he said.“Now there is more awareness both about Covid and the guidelines related to it,” the chief minister added. He also said Kumbh comes once in 12 years and is linked with the faith and sentiments of millions of people.“Holding it successfully amid the challenge posed by Covid-19 by ensuring that the SOP is strictly followed by all is our goal,” he said.Rawat said people’s health is a priority but matters of faith cannot be totally ignored.“Cases have of course risen of late but we are following the health ministry guidelines and the recovery rate is good. Arrangements are also adequate to deal with any situation,” he said. Largescale arrangements of masks and sanitisers have been made in the Mela area and the entire machinery is working day and night to ensure that the Covid guidelines are followed by everyone, the chief minister said.People are being checked at the border points before being allowed to enter Haridwar and attend the Mela. There are also arrangements for the random testing of people, he said.Haridwar is all set to organise another Shahi Snan on the occasion of “Mesh Sankranti” on Wednesday during the ongoing Kumbh.  Meanwhile, Uttarakhand on Tuesday reported the highest single-day spike this year in Covid cases with 1,925 testing positive in the state.Dehradun district with 775 cases, Haridwar with 594, Nainital with 217 and Udham Singh Nagar with 172 led the table while 13 infected patients died.

13-04-2021||Satya Prakash||Don’t stay arrest in criminal cases in routine manner, SC tells high courts||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 13Taking exception to high courts passing orders staying arrest and coercive action against accused in cognizable offences in a routine manner, the Supreme Court Tuesday asked them not to issue such orders during pendency of investigation.Emphasizing that police have the statutory right and duty to investigate cognizable offences, a  Bench of Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice MR Shah and Justice MR Shah said criminal proceedings can’t be scuttled at the initial stage.While issuing a set of guidelines, the Bench disapproved of the practice of passing orders such as “Not to arrest” or “No Coercive steps” in cognizable cases under investigation even as the high courts decided not to entertain petitions for quashing of FIRs filed by the accused.“We caution the high courts again against passing such orders of not to arrest or ‘no coercive steps to be taken’ till the investigation is completed and the final report is filed, while not entertaining quashing petitions under section 482 CrPC and/or Article 226 of the Constitution…,” the top court said.“Ordinarily, the courts are barred from usurping the jurisdiction of the police, since the two organs of the State operate in two specific spheres of activities and one ought not to tread over the other sphere,” it said, adding, “Save in exceptional cases where non-interference would result in miscarriage of justice, the court and the judicial process should not interfere at the stage of investigation of offences”.Writing the verdict for the Bench, Justice Shah said that passing such “blanket” interim orders without assigning reasons would hamper investigation and courts should not thwart any probe into cognizable offences.Quashing of a complaint or FIR should be an “exception rather than an ordinary rule”, the Bench held.The top court quashed a September 2020 interim order of the Bombay High Court which had directed restraining the police from taking any coercive measures against the accused in cheating/forgery case.Noting that despite the law laid down by the top court on this issue, some high courts continued to pass such orders, it directed its Registry to forward a copy of the judgment to all the 25 high courts.It said functions of judiciary and police were “complementary, not overlapping” and power of quashing should be exercised sparingly with circumspection in the rarest of rare cases.The high courts must appreciate that speedy investigation is the requirement in criminal administration of justice, it said.“The order of the high court must disclose reasons why it has passed an ad-interim direction during the pendency of the proceedings under Section 482 CrPC. Such reasons, however brief, must disclose an application of mind,” it noted.“The aforesaid is required to be considered from another angle also. Granting of such blanket order would not only adversely affect the investigation but would have far reaching implications for maintaining the Rule of Law,” it noted.The bench said that while examining an FIR/complaint, the quashing of which is sought, the court cannot embark upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations.It said that extraordinary and inherent powers of the court do not confer an “arbitrary jurisdiction” to act according to “its whims or caprice” and the first information report is not an encyclopaedia which must disclose all facts and details relating to the offence reported.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-stay-arrest-in-criminal-cases-in-routine-manner-sc-tells-high-courts-238644

That is why, this year, despite many constraints, we have supplied vaccines to over 80 countries,” he said at the conference, held virtually.The Prime Minister further said, “We will continue to share our experiences, our expertise and also our resources with humanity in the fight against the pandemic.”While we may be used to having ‘Plan A’ and ‘Plan B’ but there is no Planet B and only Planet Earth, he said and added so, we must remember that we hold this planet merely as trustees for our future generations.The Prime Minister also said that during this pandemic, in our own humble way, within our own limited resources, we in India have tried to walk the talk.Organised by the Observer Research Foundation (ORF), a think-tank,  in partnership with the Ministry of External Affairs, Raisina Dialogue is India’s premier conference on geopolitics and geo-economics, and its sixth edition is being held from April 13 to 16.

13-04-2021||New Delhi||Raisina Dialogue: NATO Secy Gen flags China coercion of neighbours, hampering freedom of navigation||NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday flagged China’s assertive moves such as coercing neighbours in the region and hampering freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, while asserting that the transatlantic military alliance is a key platform to forge convergence on responding to the security implications of a rising China.In his virtual address at the Raisina Dialogue, Stoltenberg also said India is a “pivotal player” in the Indo-Pacific region and asserted there is a huge potential for NATO to work with the country in different ways without being part of an integrated military cooperation.“India is a pivotal player in the Indo-Pacific region. It is also an important and active international actor. You are one of the largest troop contributors to United Nations peacekeeping missions. Currently, a member of the UN Security Council. And you will hold the G20 presidency in 2023,” he said, adding that India truly matters on the global scene.The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is an intergovernmental military alliance between 30 European and North American countries.Noting that the rise of China is a defining global issue which has implications for all, Stoltenberg said there are opportunities that come with China’s rise.China has lifted millions out of poverty, brought economic growth and prosperity, and it is an important trade and investment partner to many NATO countries, he noted.China will soon have the biggest economy in the world, it is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and therefore it is “instrumental in dealing with issues of our time”—from global governance to international trade and climate change, he said.“That is why at NATO, we engage with China. In the past, we have cooperated in fighting piracy off the coast of Somalia. And there are areas where China can play a constructive role to our mutual benefit. From peace and stability in Afghanistan, to negotiating arms control arrangements,” Stoltenberg said.“But we must be clear-headed about the challenges that come with China’s rise,” he added.China is matching its military power to its economic power, it has tripled its military expenditure over the last decade, now has the world’s second largest defence budget, and it continues to invest massively in military modernisation, he said.“At the same time, China does not share our values. It persecutes ethnic and religious minorities, such as the Uighurs, suppresses human rights in Hong Kong and it is using new and advanced technology to monitor and control its own people, creating state surveillance without precedent,” the NATO Secretary General said.“We have also seen more assertive moves by Beijing, to challenge the rules-based international order. It is openly threatening Taiwan, coercing neighbours in the region and hampering freedom of navigation in the South China Sea,” he said.Asserting that China’s rise has “real implications on our security”, Stoltenberg said NATO is, and will remain, a regional alliance for Europe and North America.“But China is coming closer to us. And this requires our collective attention and action,” he said.NATO is a key platform to forge convergence on responding to the security implications of a rising China, Stoltenberg said.“This is one of the reasons why we are addressing how to further strengthen the resilience of our societies and our infrastructure. So that we can reduce vulnerabilities stemming from foreign ownership, coercion or manipulation,” he said.“And we want to engage even more closely with our friends and partners around the world. Because that is the best way to protect the rules-based international order, secure our societies and ring-fence our democracies,” he asserted.Stoltenberg’s remarks come in the wake of China’s increasing military muscle flexing in the South China Sea and the Sino-India border row in eastern Ladakh.Stoltenberg said the Indo-Pacific is becoming more and more important and NATO sees the value of strengthening its partnership and cooperation with countries in the region.“We already have formalized strong partnerships with like-minded democracies in the region, including South Korea, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.“But we also strongly believe that we can work more closely with countries like India, a like-minded democracy, sharing the same values and standing up for the rules based order,” Stoltenberg said.Refusing to compare the rise of China with the Soviet Union in the Cold War period, Stoltenberg said, “We don’t regard China as an adversary and we also see real opportunities in the rise of China”.But then there is a need to combine that understanding with the fact that “we see a more assertive China, violating international or undermining the rules-based order, threatening neighbours, and, of course, China is a country that doesn’t share our values”, he said.Organised by the Observer Research Foundation (ORF), a think-tank,  in partnership with the MEA, Raisina Dialogue is India’s premier conference on geopolitics and geo-economics.

13-04-2021||Panaji||Goa Forward Party withdraws from BJP-led NDA||The Goa Forward Party walked out of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) on Tuesday, citing “anti-Goan policies” of the BJP-led state government.However, the move of the GFP, which has three MLAs in the 40-member Goa House, will not have any impact on the stability of the Pramod Sawant government in the state since the Vijai Sardesai-led party is not a ruling constituent.The GFP extended support to the NDA in 2017 to facilitate the formation of the then BJP-led state government under the leadership of Manohar Parrikar.After Parrikar’s death in 2019, the alliance soured when three GFP ministers were dropped from the Pramod Sawant-led government.The GFP’s state executive committee and political affairs committee met in Panaji on Tuesday.Later, GFP president Vijai Sardesai, in a formal letter to senior BJP leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, conveyed the party’s decision to withdraw from the NDA.“I write to you today formally declaring the Goa Forward Party’s withdrawal from the National Democratic Alliance. There is no doubt that our relationship with the NDA ended in July 2019, with no room for reconsideration,” Sardesai said in the letter.He claimed that in the last two years, the BJP has repeatedly introduced “anti-Goan policies” in every session of the state Legislative Assembly.Since July 2019, the BJP’s Goa leadership has turned its back on the people of the state who looked ahead with hope to the prospect of all-round development, the GFP alleged.Parrikar’s death brought Goa to despair, ushering in a period of rampant corruption and dishonesty, it said.The GFP has pointed out the state government’s alleged failure in handling various issues, such as three linear projects, the Mahadayi river water dispute, and other matters.The Sardesai-led party said it is fully committed to consistently and selflessly work to safeguard, protect and preserve Goa’s culture, people and heritage.

13-04-2021||Chandigarh||Web talk on strategic importance of Indo-Pacific region conducted by Central University of Jammu||A web talk on “Indo Pacific: A Construct in Offing” was organised by the Department of National Security Studies, Central University of Jammu, today.Highlighting the strategic significance of the Indo-Pacific region Prof Rakesh Datta from the Department of Defence and National Security Studies, Panjab University, Chandigarh, said that the geopolitical construct of the ‘Indo-Pacific’ region is not only related to the foreign policy strategies of major powers but also has serious implications for a rising power like India.Stating that there was a need of maintaining balance of power by containing China in the Indo-Pacific through India’s rise in the region, he added that this region is becoming the most attractive destination for foreign direct investment, trade and businessProf Datta stressed that there was a desperate need for cooperation in areas such as defence, information sharing, counter-terrorism and peacekeeping and in the given scenario, where the common threads of geopolitics, geoeconomics and geostrategy are closely intermeshed across the Indian and Pacific oceans, this new conceptualization needs to be accorded deeper consideration.In his presidential remarks, Vice Chancellor of Jammu Central University, Prof Ashok Aima,  shared Chinese discernibility in trapping countries through debt diplomacy and was equivocal about bursting of Chinese bubble in the near future with the rise of market forces.Prof Rasal Singh, head of the department at Jammu University gave his initial remarks on the relevant theme and highlighted the changing role of India internationally and how India is seen as a global partner by major powers at present.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/web-talk-on-strategic-importance-of-indo-pacific-region-conducted-by-central-university-of-jammu-238609

You are not giving votes to Begum. If you vote for Begum, there will be mini-Pakistan. (Barely audible)... A Dawood Ibrahim has come up in your locality... We will note down everything. What is the government doing? What is the use of it?” the EC notice issued to Adhikari on April 8 said quoting his speech.In his reply to the notice, Adhikari said he firmly believes in a free, fair and impartial election where there is no ill-will between the candidates and no personal attack is made while criticising political opponents.The BJP leader said he had no malafide intention to criticise anyone personally or make any offensive or derogatory statement against anyone. He also promised to abide by any directive of the EC. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ec-lets-off-bjps-suvendu-adhikari-with-a-light-rap-for-mini-pakistan-remark-238604

It is often the biggest contributor to Rajasthan's COVID-19 tally.Dr Ajeet Singh Shekhawat, superintendent of Rajasthan University of Health Sciences Hospital here, told PTI, "For the last three days, more than 100 patients are being admitted to the hospital every day. The situation is alarming this time and the beds are filling up fast." The hospital has 1,200 beds, including 450 oxygen beds and 200 ICU beds, he said."As of now, nearly half of the beds are occupied. Around 330 patients have been admitted in the last three days," he said.Dr Virendra Singh, president of Rajasthan Hospital, said the beds at the facility are already full."The second wave is very alarming and the number of patients is increasing rapidly. In our hospital, beds are full," he said.The health department officer said directions have been issued to all private hospitals having 60 or more beds to reserve 25 per cent of them in wards and another 25 per cent in ICU for COVID-19 patients."Initially, on April 2, private hospitals with 60 or more beds were instructed to reserve 10 per cent of beds for COVID-19 patients. But looking at the spread of the infection, another order was issued on April 5 to increase the percentage of reserved beds from 10 to 25 with effect from April 9," the officer said.As of Monday, the number of active COVID-19 cases in Rajasthan stood at 36,441, according to the official report. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/beds-in-jaipur-hospitals-filling-up-fast-as-covid-19-cases-surge-238593
13-04-2021||Mumbai||Kin claim oxygen shortage led to 10 deaths in 2 Maharashtra hospitals||Relatives of 10 COVID-19 patients who succumbed at two hospitals in adjoining Palghar district alleged that a shortage of oxygen led to the deaths, a charge denied by civic authorities and the management of the medical facilities on Tuesday.On Monday, seven coronavirus patients died in Vinayaka Hospital, located in Nalasopara east, while three others succumbed in Riddhi Vinayak Hospital, which is in the western part of the township, some 60 kilometres from Mumbai.Angry relatives of the patients claimed that a lack of oxygen supply at the hospitals led to the deaths.The issue got escalated after former mayor of Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation Rajeev Patil, in an audio clip, claimed that a shortage of oxygen, required for treatment of critical patients, led to the deaths at the hospitals, which fall under the jurisdiction of the civic body.Refuting the allegations, Kishore Gavas, deputy commission, Vasai Virar Municipal Corporation, on Tuesday said the deaths occurred as the patients were critical.Both hospitals have ample oxygen stock, the civic official said.Seconding Gavas, a release from Vinayaka Hospital said it has "a huge supply of oxygen" and, hence, the cause of death of these patients being attributed to its shortage was "factually incorrect"."We have received oxygen supply from the (civic) corporation and like us there is no shortage of the oxygen in any other hospital as well."Hence, the shortage of the life-saving gas is not the reality here," the hospital's release added.On Monday, a large number of people had gathered at the hospitals after word spread that the deaths were caused due to a shortage of medical oxygen.Police personnel were deployed in strength to prevent any untoward incident, a police official said had said.Former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya had tweeted that seven COVID-19 patients died at a hospital in Nallasopara due to "defect in oxygen supply". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kin-claim-oxygen-shortage-led-to-10-deaths-in-2-maharashtra-hospitals-238588
13-04-2021||New Delhi||Govt begins process for inviting financial bids for Air India sale, deal to conclude by September||The government has initiated the process for inviting financial bids for the sale of national carrier Air India and the deal is likely to conclude by September, sources said.Salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group was among the "multiple" entities that had put in preliminary bids for buying loss-making Air India in December last year.The sources said that after analysing the preliminary bids, eligible bidders were given access to the Virtual Data Room (VDR) of Air India, following which investors' queries were answered.The transaction has now moved to the financial bids stage, the sources said, adding that the deal is expected to conclude by September.The government is selling its entire 100 per cent stake in Air India that has been in losses ever since its merger with domestic operator Indian Airlines in 2007.The stake sale process got delayed due to the COVID pandemic and the government had extended five times the deadline to submit preliminary bids for the national carrier.The airline, which started as a mail carrier in 1932, will give a successful bidder control of 4,400 domestic and 1,800 international landing and parking slots at domestic airports, as well as 900 slots at airports overseas.Besides, the bidder would get 100 per cent of the low-cost arm Air India Express and 50 per cent of AISATS, which provides cargo and ground handling services at major Indian airports.With previous attempts since 2017 failing to get any significant interest, the government had this time sweetened the deal by giving freedom to potential suitors to decide how much of the airline's debt they want to take on as part of the transaction.Previously, the bidders were required to take over the entire Rs 60,074 crore debt.Last month, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said the government will keep Air India running till it gets divested and there is no choice but to either "privatise or close" the debt-laden airline."We are looking at another timeline now, what is called data room for prospective bidders to look at... that is opened up, 64 days for the financial bids to come in. After that it is the question of taking a decision and handing over the airline," Puri had said."...There is no choice, we either privatise or we close the airline. We run a loss of Rs 20 crore every day despite Air India making money now. Because the mismanagement has resulted in a cumulative debt of Rs 60,000 crore," he had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-begins-process-for-inviting-financial-bids-for-air-india-sale-deal-to-conclude-by-september-238576

13-04-2021||New Delhi||Ordered probe of WhatsApp policy on competition aspect: CCI to HC||The new privacy policy of WhatsApp would lead to excessive data collection and "stalking" of consumers for targeted advertising to bring in more users and is therefore, an alleged abuse of dominant position, competition regulator CCI told the Delhi High Court on Tuesday.The submission was made before Justice Navin Chawla by senior advocate Aman Lekhi on behalf of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in defence of its order directing an investigation into the new privacy policy of messaging platform WhatsApp.The CCI was looking into the competition aspect and not the alleged violation of individuals' privacy which was being looked into by the Supreme Court, Lekhi said."There is no question of jurisdictional error," he said and added that WhatsApp and Facebook's pleas challenging the CCI's decision were "incompetent and misconceived".WhatsApp and Facebook, represented by senior advocates Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi, have challenged the CCI's March 24 order directing a probe into the new privacy policy. The high court which reserved its order in the matter was told by Lekhi that whether the data collection by WhatsApp and sharing it with Facebook would amount to an anti-competitive practice or abuse of dominant position can be determined only after the investigation.He argued that the data collected, which would include an individual's location, the kind of device used, their internet service provider and whom they are conversing with, would lead to creation of a customer profile and preference which would be monetised by way of targeted advertising and all this amounts to "stalking".He also said that the investigation ordered was only an administrative proceeding which did not have any civil consequence at this stage.The two social media platforms have contended that when the top court and the Delhi High Court were looking into the privacy policy, then CCI ought not to have "jumped the gun" and intervened in the issue.They contended that CCI's decision was an abuse of the commission's suo motu jurisdiction.They said the issue of the policy being unfair to consumers was being considered by the apex court and therefore, CCI ought not to have taken up the issue.In January, the CCI on its own decided to look into WhatsApp's new privacy policy on the basis of news reports regarding the same. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ordered-probe-of-whatsapp-policy-on-competition-aspect-cci-to-hc-238562
13-04-2021||New Delhi||'The War That Made R&AW': Book on making of modern Indian espionage||A new book traces the origins of Research & Analysis Wing (R&AW) and gives insights into the integral role played by its founder legendary spymaster RN Kao in helping India liberate Bangladesh in 1971."The War That Made R&AW", published by Westland in collaboration with Golden Pen, is written by filmmakers and writers Anushka Nandakumar and Sandeep Saket. It was released on Monday."As filmmakers, in any narrative or a cinematic universe, one constantly seeks out a hero. We found one in RN Kao. For us, this chapter from history is visually rich, suspenseful, gripping and has been a deeply satisfying tale to bring to life," said the authors about the book.Kao, a deputy director at the Intelligence Bureau (IB), took over as director of RAW in 1968 after former prime minister Indira Gandhi split the former to carve out an intelligence agency focused on international threats.He had one goal, to build an Intelligence-gathering agency that would ensure the security and integrity of India. And, eventually, the legend of the 'Kaoboys' -- the nickname given to the team he built—would spread far and wide.His legendary exploits include conducting the 'Kashmir Princess' probe in the mid-1950s, his contributions in the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971 and role in ensuring Sikkim's merger with India."The story of how R&AW was set up, and the organisation's role in Bangladesh's fight for freedom, is a riveting one. Anusha and Saket have done a wonderful job chronicling how the great Indian spymaster R N Kao, his right-hand man Sankaran Nair, and the rest of the R&AW team, ran their operations at this time," said Deepthi Talwar said, Editor, Westland Publications.The compelling tale of covert operations, courage and quick thinking, and of how wars are won as much off the battlefield as on it, the book, according to Golden Pen's Jaspinder Singh Kang, is an ode to the "most iconic event in the history of India's independence"."This book is an ode to, probably, the most iconic event in the history of our nation post-independence. A war that was fought not only on land, air and sea, but, most strategically, behind the scenes, by our first intelligence agency."The creation of Bangladesh -- we can appreciate more so now -- thwarted what could have been a threat from East and West. We are absolutely thrilled about Golden Pen and Westland's joint release of RA&W by Sandeep and Anusha," said Kang.Golden Pen, started in 2018, is a partnership between former investigative journalist Zaidi and international marketing consultant Jaspinder Kang. It aims at enhancing the quality of crime noir and intriguing tales and subsequently taking Indian crime stories and writers to the global audience.

13-04-2021||Raipur||Bodies pile up in hospitals, Chhattisgarh govt struggles to deal with sudden surge in cases||Bodies of COVID-19 victims have been piling up in mortuaries and crematoriums in Raipur, as the Chhattisgarh administration struggles to deal with the sudden surge in cases of the viral infection and fatalities.In some videos on social media, bodies were seen lying on stretchers outside the mortuary of Raipur's Dr B R Ambedkar Memorial Hospital (DBRAMH), the state's biggest government-run hospital, and last rites of victims being performed from morning till late night in crematoriums here.Talking to PTI on Tuesday, state Health Minister T S Singh Deo said the overall situation is "very concerning" and the sudden rise in COVID-19 cases and deaths has posed a challenge for authorities."The district administration and the municipal corporation have been asked to ensure the bodies are cremated at the earliest," he said.The situation was also grim in neighbouring Durg district.Since April 1, 861 people have died due to COVID-19 in Chhattisgarh, with Raipur reporting 305 fatalities and Durg 213, as per official data.The minister said there is generally no delay in the cremation of bodies of COVID-19 victims belonging to Raipur.But, for victims hailing from other districts who succumbed in hospitals here, it takes some time for completing the process of shifting the bodies to their respective places, he said.An official from the Raipur Municipal Corporation official said since the last couple of days, the last rites of about 100 victims were being performed every day in crematoriums and burial grounds here.Patients with various ailments, including COVID-19, were being treated in the DBRMAH. The bodies of non-Covid patients and those related to medico-legal cases were also kept in the hospital's mortuary, Raipur's Additional Municipal Commissioner Pulak Bhattacharya said.The bodies of victims hailing from other districts were are kept in the Raipur hospital's mortuary before being shifted to their native places, he said."Due to a sudden spike in deaths due to COVID-19, the bodies piled up in the mortuary," Bhattacharya said.On Monday, the hospital's morgue had 40 bodies, mostly of COVID-19 victims, which was more than its capacity, he said."Since the last two days, the last rites of nearly 100 victims were being performed per day in Raipur. We have pressed more hearses into service so that the bodies can be shifted to crematoriums without any delay," he said.Till about a fortnight back, the bodies of COVID-19 victims were disposed of only in two crematoriums in Raipur, but now the district administration has ordered to use all 18 crematoriums and burial grounds falling under the city civic limits for the purpose, he said.Crematoriums on the outskirts of Raipur have also been identified, the official said.During the first wave of COVID-19 last year, 10 crematoriums and burial grounds were being used in Raipur for the last rites of the victims, he added.A process was underway to set up more electric crematoriums in Raipur and other cities, another official said.

As per the data of last 10-15 days, 65 per cent of patients are below 45 years of age. Your health and life is very important to us. So, I would like to appeal to the youth to step out of the house only when it is necessary and follow all COVID protocols," Kejriwal said at a press conference."During the previous waves, people actively donated plasma. When the situation improved, there was less demand for plasma and subsequently the donations went down. Now the cases have again risen and there is very less plasma available in stock. I appeal to those who have recovered from the virus to actively donate plasma and aid the fight against the virus," he added.The chief minister said over 13,500 case have been reported in the national capital in the last 24 hours."We are attaching banquet halls with big hospitals. Hospitals will only have serious patients. We have declared few hospitals as 100 per cent COVID facility. We are also checking each patient admitted in hospital to see if their condition permits them to be treated at home so beds can be utilised for patients with severe conditions."There are not just these hospitals in Delhi (COVID-only hospitals), there is sufficient capacity in other hospitals for non- COVID related emergencies. Planned surgeries like knee replacement can be delayed for two three months for now," he said.

13-04-2021||New Delhi||Covid second wave delays recovery of aviation sector in India||The Indian aviation will have to wait longer to reach pre-Covid levels of operations as the second wave of Coronavirus threatens to derail the gains made by the sector over the past few months with flyer confidence tanking again resulting in sharp drop in demand in the past couple of weeks.As per industry estimates, demand for flying dropped by 13 per cent to 246,600 passengers in the last week of March 2021 (v/s the last week of February, 2021—when the peak was recorded), resulting in no month-on-month (MOM) improvement in traffic (still down 37 per cent to pre-Covid levels).In April, 2021, demand further fell by 5 per cent from the last week's average of March, 3021 to 233,000 passengers per day, clearly indicating that flying is again getting out of fashion over concerns on the pandemic.Moreover, the situation is also impacting yields for airlines. As per airfare tracker of Motilal Oswal Financial Services, yields in March increased by 2-5 per cent MoM, but down 13- 14 per cent QoQ in 4QFY21. This is despite the upward revisions in the floor of airfare bands in February, 2021 by 10 per cent and again in March by 5 per cent.A spike in crude oil prices during 4QFY21 has further added to the negative sentiment, the brokerage said.The sliding graph of air travel has again pushed airlines to seek government approval to lower capacity from present mandated 80 per cent to about 50-60 per cent, the same that operated during the early part of opening of sector post lockdown last year."Currently, around one-third of total states in India have imposed further lockdowns/restrictions - but operations in the sector have not been curbed. We keep our assumptions unchanged for now, with estimates of traffic recovering to pre-Covid levels by end of 3QFY22E. We reiterate our neutral stance on INDIGO - with the possibility of further delays in the recovery to pre-Covid levels," the Motilal Oswal report on aviation sector with focus around Indigo airlines said.On a positive note, the report said that the pace of Covid vaccination drive would have positive impact on air travel and airlines as it will increase in confidence of flyers and increase travel demand.To put this into perspective, around three months after the start of vaccinations in the US (32 per cent of the US population has received at least one vaccine dose): demand for domestic travel improved to 66 per cent of pre-Covid levels (from 39 per cent in Jan'21).Demand for international travel is gradually improving (at 32 per cent of pre-Covid levels v/s 16 per cent in Jan'21). For now, tickets are mostly being sold to leisure destinations in Latin America and the Caribbean.Recovery of international traffic is still contingent on the situation in other countries.For India, only 16 per cent of international inbound and outbound passengers are from the US and Europe, while the majority are from developing nations, where achieving  70 per cent vaccination may take some more time than developed nations, further delaying demand recovery in India, the brokerage said. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-second-wave-delays-recovery-of-aviation-sector-in-india-238553
13-04-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Indicted by Lokayukta, Kerala minister K T Jaleel resigns||In a setback to the Pinarayi Vijayan-led LDF government in Kerala, Higher Education minister K T Jaleel resigned on Tuesday, days after the Lokayukta indicted him for nepotism, abuse of power and breach of oath of office.Jaleel has sent his resignation to the Chief Minister, and it has been forwarded to the Governor, CMO sources told PTI.The resignation has been accepted by Governor Arif Mohammad Khan, Raj Bhavan said.In a Facebook Post, Jaleel himself confirmed that he had put in his papers."I am happy to say that those who had been baying for my blood can be relieved for now.I have submitted my resignation to the Chief Minister. Since the past two years, I have been facing a media onslaught," Jaleel, second minister in the LDF ministry to resign on nepotism charges, said in the post.The resignation came four days after the Lokayukta'sadverseremarks dealt an unexpected blow to Jaleel,and on a day his plea seeking a stay on the verdict was being heard by the Kerala High court, which has reserved orders on his petition.The development comes at a time when the LDF government has hardly a couple of days left for its term to get over. The state assembly elections were held on April 6 and the results are awaited on May 2.Industries E P Jayarajan had resigned in October 2016, five months after the Left ministry assumed office following a row over the appointment of his nephew and son of former Kannur MP P K Sreemathy as Managing Director of Kerala Industries Enterprises Ltd.Two years later, Jayarajan was taken back in the ministry.While CPI(M) secretary in-charge, A Vijayaraghavan welcomed the decision, saying it was apt and taken on moral grounds,the Congress said he should have stepped down earlier. .The CPI(M) leadership is understood to have asked the minister to resign.Law minister A K Balan had earlier stated that the Lokayukta had given the Chief Minister three months time to act on the report and that there was no such precedent in the state."Has anyone ever resigned just because a lower court has said something? Balan had asked as demands for Jaleel's resignation grew from various quarters following the adverse remarks by the Lokayukta.  Describing the resignation as "delayed wisdom" of Jaleel, Union minister V Muraleedharan wanted to know why the Chief Minister had also not quit."The CM who is active on social media is keeping mum on the matter,"he told reporters in Delhi.Lashing out at Jaleel, leader of opposition in the state assembly Ramesh Chennithala said the minister had no other go, but to resign.The high moral ground that the party was claiming which prompted him to resign, was not right, the senior congress leaders said. "Why did he not resign immediately after the Lokayuktaverdict three days ago? Why did he move the high court?" Chennithala asked reporters.A division bench of the Lokayukta, comprising Justice Cyriac Joseph and Justice Harun-Ul-Rashid, had on Friday submitted the report against Jaleel to the Chief Minister and had held that the allegation of abuse of power, favouritism and nepotism against the minister was proved.The Muslim Youth League had on November 2, 2018 alleged that Adeeb K T, a cousin of Jaleel, was appointed general manager in Kerala State Minorities Development Finance Corporation, flouting rules.Adeeb was serving as manager of a private bank when the appointment was made.The Lokayukta had found that the minister had changed the qualifications for the post of General Manager in the Corporation to add "B.Tech with PGDBA" also as a qualification for the post to enable his second cousin, eligible for the post.It had observed that the direction to add the particular qualification was without any proposal or suggestion from the Corporation and that Adeeb would not have been eligible to apply for the post."It amounted to favouritism and nepotism and also lack of integrity in his capacity as a minister. The conduct of the 2nd respondent (minister) also violated the oath of office he had taken as a minister to discharge his duties as a minister without fear or favour, affection or ill-will," the Lokayukta had said in its verdict.    Jaleel has been in the media glare since last year after he was questioned by the Enforcement Directorate and the National Investigation Agency over the import ofQuran by the UAE consulate here and his telephone conversation with Swapna Suresh, a key accusedin the gold smuggling case relating to seizure of 30 kg of gold worth around Rs 15 crore through diplomaticbaggage in July last yearBesides Jaleel and Jayarajan, A K Saseendran, late Thomas K Chandy (both NCP) and Mathew T Thomas (JD-S)were the other ministers in the present cabinet who had resigned.Transport minister Saseendran had to quit after a 'sleaze audio clip', purportedly of him conversing with a woman aired by a television channel, went viral.He was replaced by Chandy, who also had to resign following allegations of land grab for his luxury resort at Alappuzha.After a court acquitted Saseendranof the sexual harassment charges, he was taken back in the cabinet.Mathew T Thomas (JD-S) resigned as Water resources minister to make way for party colleague K KrishnanKutty. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indicted-by-lokayukta-kerala-minister-k-t-jaleel-resigns-238550
13-04-2021||Nagpur||'Court' actor Vira Sathidar dies of coronavirus complications||Actor-activist Vira Sathidar, best known for featuring in the National Award-winning film "Court", died on Tuesday due to COVID-19 related complications.Sathidar, 62, was undergoing treatment at AIIMS Nagpur after he contracted the coronavirus.A hospital official said that the actor was admitted to the medical facility last week and passed away at 3.42 AM on Tuesday due to sudden cardiorespiratory arrest in COVID-19 pneumonia with respiratory failure.Filmmaker Chaitanya Tamhane, who directed Sathidar in the acclaimed 2014 movie "Court", said the actor was on put on life support post his hospitalisation.  "He had COVID-19 and was put on ventilator. It's an extremely unfortunate news. It is yet to sink in," Tamhane told PTI. Sathidar rose to prominence after playing the role of protest singer Narayan Kamble in "Court", who is accused of encouraging a manhole worker to commit suicide through one of his folk songs. Tamhane said the news of Sathidar's demise has come as a "huge shock" to him."He was not only an actor, activist and a poet but also one of the nicest human beings I've met. I still can't process it. He was a fantastic person and I can now only think of the time we spent making 'Court,'" the director added. Apart from "Court", which was India's official entry to Oscars in 2016, Sathidar went on to feature in two more short films.

13-04-2021||New Delhi||Southwest Monsoon 2021: Forecaster Skymet predicts 103 per cent rain for India||Private forecaster Skymet Weather has predicted Monsoon rains at 103 per cent (907 mm) of the Long Period Average rains for India, ranging between “normal and above normal”, with a model error of five per cent. This is the third year in succession that India may see “above normal” rains during the season. The last time it happened was in 1996, 1997, and 1998, Skymet said.  While most pasts of the country are expected to see “good rains”, some parts in the Northwest, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana, and Eastern parts of the country are expected to see some deficiency during initial parts of the season, the Skymet said. The Northwest is expected to see above-normal rains in September, the Skymet said.The monsoon usually reaches Northwest India at the end of June.Historically, there has been a vast difference in rain distribution over Punjab and Haryana.Last year Punjab reported a rain surplus, whereas Haryana recorded deficient rainfall.This year, in July and August, the states may report "some deficiency between 10 to 15 per cent"."However, the month of September seems to be rain surplus therefore, we do not expect any major risk in terms of rainfall over Punjab and Haryana," said Mahesh Palawat of Skymet Weather.Skymet said that there is “no cause of concern” so far as the food bowl of the country is concerned    Overall, there is a 70 per cent probability of “normal” rains with very little, only 10 per cent probability of “below normal” rains in June. In July, there is a 75 per cent probability of “normal” rains and only 15 per cent of “below normal” rains. In August, there is an 80 per cent probability of “normal” monsoon, 10 per cent “above normal” and 10 per cent of “below normal” rains. In September, there is a 30 per cent probability of “normal” rains and as much as 60 per cent of “above normal” rains, Skymet said. September is expected to see good rains, above 16 per cent in most parts of the country, including the Northwest.Ahead of the onset of the much-awaited rains over the Indian mainland two key factors, La Nina, and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), are “softening”, returning to neutral levels. The Skymet also ruled out the possibility of El Nino, which means SSTs may remain “neutral” during the 2021 Monsoon season, meaning that it may not give a “boost” and, also not “harm” the monsoon in any way. Similarly, the IOD index is also expected to be neutral, “not affect rains in any significant manner”, during the June-September season, according to the first forecast of the seasonOfficial forecaster India Meteorological Department (IMD) is expected to come out with its forecast for the seasonal rains on which almost two-thirds of India’s agricultural tracts depend upon for irrigation. Warmer than normal SSTs normally lead to more cloud formation and rains. In those terms, La Nina, or say a warmer West Pacific, and positive IOD, that is warmer West Indian Ocean, are indicative of good rains. El Nino or colder SSTs and negative IOD indicate otherwise.Last year saw El Nino weakening and La Nina developing during the second half of the season, factors that gave the country rains 109 per cent of the Long Period Average, third-highest after 112 per cent (in 1994) and 110 per cent (in 2019) according to the IMD. Monsoon rains are also important for replenishing groundwater and from this season onwards the official forecaster is also planning to provide estimates of possible increase and availability of water levels in river basins and reservoirs for better water management.

13-04-2021||New Delhi||Why Indian Army plans a reduction of 1,00,000 men?||There's a strong possibility of you getting a forward on social media these days, criticising Indian Army's proposed move of reduction in manpower.What it probably won't mention is that it concerns the 'non-essential' manpower. So what is it, really and, more importantly, how and when is the reduction going to happen?Essentially, the idea is to modernise the armed forces with the heavy infusion of cutting edge technology including Artificial Intelligence (AI), cyber warfare capability, space technology to serve small tech-intensive Integrated Battle Groups (IBF), of a tri-service nature.To achieve that objective within limited budgets, the following steps are essential: Maintaining a healthy Teeth-to-Tail - or combat vs non-combat ratio The 'teeth-to-tail ratio',in military parlance, is the amount of military personnel it takes to supply and support each combat soldier. While both 'teeth' and 'tail' soldiers may find themselves in combat or other life-threatening situations, 'teeth' soldiers are those whose primary function is to engage in combat.The Army said, as detailed in the 20th standing committee report released last month, that some reduction in manpower remains the ultimate goal."It is an ongoing process; if you recollect, when Gen. V.P. Malik was the Chief, he thought of a reduction of 50,000 men. Our aim in the next three to four years is a reduction of about 1,00,000 men and this money that we are going to save because of the manpower costs, the government has assured us that this money will be cycled back to us for imbibing technology," the committee was told.Outsourcing, the new age mantraSo, while several blueprints of plans to reduce the Army manpower have been prepared over the past couple of decades, the reduction of the 'non-essential' manpower may finally begin after the massive upgradation of internal infrastructure done in the recent years, especially in the border areas.The repair workshops are opening in forward locations and the Indian Army is consistently working on shortening its logistics tail and work on the Integrated Battle Group, or the IBG, concept. The small units will have a small logistics tail which too shall be outsourced.The committee was told that, if in need of repair or service, an Army Tata vehicle no longer needs to be sent to Army Base Workshops (ABWs). With Tata workshops now operating even in places like Silchar and Guwahati, it can be sent straight to the facility run by the manufacturing company.A couple of years ago, while reviewing the functioning of different organisations including defence workshops, the government had decided to corporatize eight Army Base Workshops on Government Owned Contractor Operated (GOCO) model while disbanding two ABWs, one Static Workshop and four ordnance depots.With workshops being put on the GOCO model, the manpower can be shifted to other divisions, including space, cyber and Artificial Intelligence.Saving manpower, infusing technologyLast year, during the first anniversary of Balakot air strikes, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had termed hybrid warfare a reality and had emphasised the need to reorient the training of soldiers to meet the challenges posed by it. With AI, high-speed weapons and space-based sensors and tools having a significant impact, he stressed that there was an urgent need to imbibe new technologies and use existing capabilities in innovative ways.With India being a witness to a number of skirmishes in the region, CDS General Rawat too realises the fast-changing geopolitics around the globe. Time and again, he has called for maintaining credible deterrence in land, air and at sea at all times, saying that the three Services must work together concurrently to deal with any potential threats, based on the principle of theater commands."Credible deterrence comes from the will of the military leadership and intent of the political class while taking tough decisions. This was amply shown after the Kargil, Uri and Pulwama attacks," General Rawat had said earlier.With the whole concept of war undergoing transition, the Ministry of Defence is now working on introducing modern technologies, which though costly will save on manpower and even money in the long run."For example, let us say there is a hill feature which we are occupying. Today we occupy that hill feature with 120 men which is a company. But if that same company is given technology which ensures that it has got a complete transparency within 2000 meters of what is available there and has got weapon systems to engage, it can do the same task with about 80 men. That is what we are looking at in the future," the committee was told.At the same time, while looking at imbibing technology, the Army is also focusing on the infantry soldier manning the border."We want to give him a modern rifle; we want to give him a modern surveillance system; we want to give him technology that he can imbibe." — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-indian-army-plans-a-reduction-of-1-00-000-men-238540
13-04-2021||New Delhi||13,500 Covid cases in 24 hours in Delhi, cancel board exams: Kejriwal||Delhi has reported over 13,500 cases in 24 hours, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday and appealed to the Centre to cancel the Class 10 and 12 board exams and explore alternative methods, including online exams. Warning that conducting the exams may contribute to the large-scale spread of the virus, he said the centres could emerge as major hotspots."Six lakh children in Delhi are going to write CBSE exams. Nearly one lakh teachers will be a part of it. These (the centres) can become major hotspots leading to large-scale spreading of corona. Children's lives and health are very important to us. I request the Centre to cancel the CBSE exams," he said at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon.The Central Board of Secondary Education can explore other methods, including online exams and promoting students on the basis of internal assessments, he said."Several countries have done it, some states in India are doing it too. Some alternative methods could be thought of. Children can be promoted this time on the basis of either an online method or internal assessment. But the exams should be cancelled," he added.The CBSE Class 10 and 12 exams are scheduled to begin on May 4. With the exponential increase in coronavirus cases, the chorus for cancellation or postponing the board exams is growing.

13-04-2021||New Delhi||Gujarat riots: SC adjourns hearing on Zakia Jafri's plea against SIT clean chit to Modi||The Supreme Court on Tuesday adjourned by two weeks the hearing on a plea of Zakia Jafri, the wife of slain MP Ehsan Jafri, challenging the Special Investigation Team (SIT) clean chit to then Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi in the 2002 riots.A bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar said the matter would be listed after two weeks as the petitioner has circulated a letter seeking adjournment in the case.The apex court had on March 16 posted the matter for hearing on Tuesday and said that it would not entertain any more request for adjournment. The bench had last month taken note of the request of senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Jafri, that the matter is heard sometime in April as several advocates were busy in the Maratha reservation case which was then being heard by a five-judge Constitution bench. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Gujarat government, had then opposed the plea for adjournment. The top court had in February last year fixed the case for hearing on April 14, 2020, saying the matter had been adjourned many times and will have to be heard someday. Prior to this, Jafri's counsel had told the apex court that notice needs to be issued in the plea as it relates to an alleged "larger conspiracy" from February 27, 2002, to May 2002.Ehsan Jafri was among the 68 people killed at Gulberg Society in Ahmedabad on February 28, 2002, a day after the S-6 Coach of the Sabarmati Express was burnt at Godhra killing 59 people and triggering riots in Gujarat.On February 8, 2012, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) had filed a closure report giving a clean chit to Modi, now the prime minister, and 63 others, including senior government officials, saying there was "no prosecutable evidence" against them.Zakia Jafri had filed a petition in the apex court in 2018 challenging the Gujarat High Court's October 5, 2017 order rejecting her plea against the decision of the SIT.The plea also maintained that after the SIT gave a clean chit in its closure report before a trial judge, the petitioner filed a protest which was dismissed by the magistrate without considering "substantiated merits".It also said the high court "failed to appreciate" the petitioner's complaint which was independent of the Gulberg case registered at Meghaninagar Police Station.The high court in its October 2017 order said the SIT probe was monitored by the Supreme Court. However, it partly allowed Zakia Jafri's petition as far as its demand of a further investigation was concerned.It said the petitioner can approach an appropriate forum, including the magistrate's court, a division bench of the high court or the Supreme Court seeking further investigation.

13-04-2021||Washington||US stands by its support to India's request for extradition of Tahawwur Rana, says Biden admin in court||The Biden administration, in a fresh submission before a US court, has reiterated its support to India's request for the extradition of Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana, who is sought for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack.US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chooljian on Monday received the latest set of submissions from the US government attorney in the case.The judge has scheduled an in-person extradition hearing of Rana to India for June 24.In the submission, along with an attached memorandum, Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian, made a declaration in support of the “United States' Surrebuttal in Support of its Request for Certification of Extradition.” Lulejian reiterated that 59-year-old Rana's extradition to India is as per the India-US extradition treaty.As per the India-US Extradition Treaty, the Indian government has requested the formal extradition of Rana, and the United States has initiated this extradition proceeding. The US Government has argued that Rana meets all the criteria warranting certification of his extradition to India.These are: the court has both personal and subject matter jurisdiction, there is an extradition treaty between the United States and India that is in full force and effect, and the crimes for which Rana's extradition is sought are covered by the terms of the treaty.“The United States respectfully requests the certification of Rana's extradition to India for the Secretary of State's decision on his surrender,” he said.“The extradition request contains sufficient evidence to establish probable cause, and Rana has not pointed to any evidence in the record that obliterates India's presentation of probable cause,” he said.Lulejian said that to the extent Rana relies on a statement made during (David Coleman) Headley's plea hearing, his reliance is improper because the plea agreement itself says that only the written agreement controls.Moreover, the statement upon which Rana relies is ambiguous at best, he said.In his submission, the US attorney noted that the premise of Rana's argument is incorrect because the Indian substantive charges are not considered lesser included offences of their conspiracy charges.Rana, a childhood friend of Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He has been declared a fugitive by India.Pakistani-American Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.

13-04-2021||Washington||Indian-American frontline health-care professionals in Green Card backlog hold protest at US Capitol||Urging American lawmakers to pass a legislation that ends the archaic per country quota for legal permanent residency in the US, a group of frontline Indian-American healthcare professionals, stuck in the 150-plus-year Green Card backlog, held a peaceful demonstration in front of the Capitol.A Green Card, known officially as a Permanent Resident Card, is a document issued to immigrants to the US as evidence that the bearer has been granted the privilege of residing permanently in the country.In a joint statement on Monday, the Indian-American doctors said that they are in a 150-plus-year Green Card backlog due to archaic country caps that allows no nation to get more than seven per cent of employment-based green cards.“India is a land of a billion plus people but the number of green cards it gets is the same as a country as small as Iceland. There is no cap on H-1B visa though and Indians make 50 per cent of the H-1B work force. This discrepancy between H-1B and green cards has created an inhuman backlog that is adversely affecting our professional and personal lives,” they said.Indian IT professionals, most of whom are highly skilled and come to the US mainly on the H-1B work visas, are the worst sufferers of the current immigration system. which imposes a seven per cent per country quota on allotment of the coveted Green Card or permanent legal residency.The protesters said that the fairness bill removes country caps and allots green cards as a first come first serve basis. It passed in the House of Representatives by 365 votes in 2019 and its Senate equivalent S386 passed the Senate in 2020. Now the bill is back to the House as a modified version.They urged Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren to bring it to vote as a bipartisan solution to end the suffering of skilled professionals. “The Green Card backlog is taking a toll on the frontline health care workers and their families. They are living in fear and anxiety,” Dr Namita Dhiman, a child and adolescent psychiatrist said. “US President Joe Biden should end the Green Card backlog by allowing USCIS (United States Citizenship and Immigration Services) to utilise unused green cards from the past years for the frontline healthcare workers in the backlog,” she said. “COVID-19 has been brutal to frontline healthcare workers and the green card backlog makes it miserable. This is leading to serious mental health issues in this group,” Dhiman added.Baltimore-based Dr Santanu Samanta, a radiation oncologist, said he feels threatened about the consequences to his family and his job, if there is no change brought in the Green Card system. “I would desperately want to see changes that would help us become permanent green holders to serve people in this country,” he said. “Due to being stuck in the Green Card backlog, I couldn't get fellowship training for four years despite being the most worthy candidate. After training is finished, I couldn't find an appropriate job. My wife and daughter got so scared during COVID Pandemic that they wanted to go back to India,” said Dr Saurabh Ranjan, an interventional cardiologist. “If I die while on H-1B visa, I don't get any benefits and my family will be deported. After serving the last 10 years as a physician, I still am alien and feel so desperate and hopeless how we have been treated in regard to green cards and citizenship,” Dr Ranjan said.Infectious disease and critical care physician from Wisconsin Dr Raj Karnatak said that they are fighting to save lives on the frontline knowing that if they get sick or die serving on the frontline, their families will get deported. “We need immediate relief from the miserable Green Card backlog,” he said.

13-04-2021||Washington||No nation is more important than India as US seeks to counter China, states think tank report||A leading think tank for science and technology policy has said as Washington seeks to counter a rising China, no nation is more important than India with its abundance of highly skilled technical professionals and strong political and cultural ties with the United States.It however cautioned that "overreliance" on India as an IT services provider could become a strategic problem if major disagreements emerge between the two nations on issues such as intellectual property, data governance, tariffs, taxation, local content requirements or individual privacy.The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) think-tank in a report released on Monday describes the worst and best-case scenarios.In one, tensions between India and China are reduced and the many business synergies between these two neighbouring nations come to the fore. In this case, the heart of the global economy would shift to the east, and there would be little the United States could do about it, the report stated.In the second scenario, the interests of India and the United States become increasingly aligned, as the economic, military, and international relations challenges from China grow. In such a case, democratic norms could prevail across most of the developed world, as developing nations start looking to a 'Delhi model' instead of a 'Beijing model', it stated."As America seeks to counter a rising China, no nation is more important than India, with its vast size, an abundance of highly skilled technical professionals, and strong political and cultural ties with the United States. "But the parallels between America's dependency on China for manufacturing and its dependency on India for IT services are striking," said the think-tank.According to David Moschella, a non-resident senior fellow at ITIF and co-author of the report, the same forces that increasingly divide the United States and China are now pushing the US and India closer together."The interplay between the United States, India, and China will shape global competition and digital innovation for years to come. While there is a wide range of possible scenarios, two things are clear: India should be an essential part of US efforts to compete with and reduce its dependence on China, and this will inevitably expand America's global dependencies from manufacturing to services,” he said."America's technology dependencies on India in the 2020s seem certain to rise. Yet it is important to know whether the United States will be dependent on a strategic partner with strong mutual interests, or an increasingly neutral rival," said ITIF President Robert D. Atkinson, who co-authored the report with Moschella.Much will depend on the strategic choices that the Joe Biden administration and Indian government make in the next several years. One thing is clear that economic and geopolitical stakes could not be higher, he said.The report describes how India is making important progress in research and development, innovation centres, machine learning, analytics, product design and testing, and other areas, especially in IT and life sciences.While leading US tech companies are well-positioned in India's booming Internet and e-commerce marketplaces, strong local competitors are now emerging. Outside the technology sector, US companies operating in India face stiff competition from Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian, and other firms.Although doing business in India is still often difficult, most large US companies have expanded significantly to having IT service providers, large operations, or their own India-based capability centres, the report stated.

13-04-2021||Washington||Republican Senator against imposing sanctions on India for buying Russian missile system||A top Republican Senator has said that imposing CAATSA sanctions on India for buying the multi-billion-dollar S-400 missile system from Russia would be a geostrategic victory for Moscow.Senator Todd Young, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote in the Foreign Policy magazine that if the Joe Biden administration imposes sanctions on India, it would weaken two strategic fronts at a critical time - undermine Washington's relationship with India and also affect the QUAD's ability to counter China.Quad - comprising Japan, India, Australia and the United States - aims at developing a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence.Yong said on Monday that in recent weeks, the Democratic chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Senator Bob Menendez called for India to be threatened with sanctions under Section 231 of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) if it moves forward with the purchase of the Russian missile system.Section 231 imposes sanctions on entities that "operate for or on behalf of" Russian defence or intelligence sectors.“Russia could take advantage of the sanctions to reclaim its role as India's military partner of choice. Paradoxically then, sanctioning New Delhi over its Russian-made defence system would actually prove to be a geostrategic victory for Moscow," Young wrote in the magazine.Alternatively, he urged the Biden Administration to give CAATSA waiver to India. The waiver is intended at preventing US sanctions on countries like India."By invoking the waiver authority and allowing India's purchase of Russian weaponry, the Biden administration can make clear that China is the primary geostrategic threat to the United States."As the United States acknowledges that fact, the White House must then prioritise - in word and deed - relationships with those countries critical to meeting that threat head-on. By doing so, all Quad countries will benefit," Young said.

Champhai district housed the highest number of Myanmar nationals at 558, followed by Siaha district which housed 414 of them, he said.According to the official, the Myanmar nationals are currently taking refuge in nine districts, including the state capital Aizawl.“There are 310 Myanmar natives in the state capital Aizawl,” he said.Six Mizoram districts—Champhai, Siaha, Lawngtlai, Serchhip, Hnahthial and Saitual—share a 510 km long international border with Myanmar.Meanwhile, North East Students Organisation (NESO), an umbrella body of various student organisations in the Northeast has urged the NDA government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to stop bloodshed and loss of lives in the trouble-torn Myanmar, a statement by the student body said.The meeting of the organisation held via video conference on Monday urged the Centre to prevail in its capacity to the Myanmar military junta in order to stop bloodshed and loss of lives in the neighbouring country, the statement said.It also urged the Centre to seek immediate restoration of democracy in the coup hit country.The NESO urged Modi government to properly address the plight of the Myanmar nationals who have taken refuge in Mizoram, Nagaland, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh to escape possible persecutions, with the consent of respective state governments.It said that the ethnic groups from Sagaing region and Chin state of Myanmar shared the same culture, ethnicity and history with the indigenous communities of the four northeastern states, which share international boundaries with the neighbouring country.The student organisation further urged the centre to provide necessary temporary support to the Myanmar nationals till they are sent back to their country as the situation improved.In a statement issued in Meghalaya, expressing shock at the heavy loss of life after the bloodshed that is continuing, NESO chairman Samuel B Jyrwa said: “The NESO decided to urge the Central Government of India with the consent of state governments of Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland & Arunachal Pradesh to properly address the plight of the Myanmarese nationals who are seeking shelter in these four states”.Mizoram has been kind towards the Myanmar nationals running off this side to escape persecution in the hands of the military junta in that country after their February takeover of the country.Chief Minister Zoramthanga had shot a letter to the Prime Minister in March, stressing that India should not be turning a blind eye to the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar.Recently, Union Home minister Amit Shah had stated that the Centre would give food and medicines to the Myanmar nationals who have taken refuge in India, but the state government is yet to receive any “clear-cut direction” in the matter.Shah, during an interview with India Today TV, had said that the union government is ready to help the people of Myanmar with ration and medical supplies but won’t encourage illegal infiltration. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/14-lawmakers-among-more-than-2-200-myanmar-nationals-taking-refuge-in-mizoram-238195

13-04-2021||New Delhi||Bengal elections: EC bars CM Mamata Banerjee from campaigning for 24 hours||The Election Commission on Monday barred West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee from campaigning for 24 hours for her remarks against central forces and a statement which had alleged religious overtones.“Commission hereby condemns such statements potent with serious law and order problems across the state(s) and sternly warns Mamata Banerjee and advises her to desist from using such statements while making public utterances during the period when Model Code of Conduct is in force,” the order said.It said that the “commission also imposes a ban of 24 hours on Ms Mamata Banerjee from campaigning in any manner from 8 pm of April 12 till 8 pm of April 13”.Assembly elections in West Bengal began on March 27 and four of the eight phases of the polls have been completed.The poll panel’s order cited two separate notices to Banerjee on April 7 and April 8, and her subsequent replies.On her speech which had alleged religious overtones, the Election Commission (EC) said that Banerjee has “selectively chosen” parts of her speech in her reply dated April 9 and “did not mention anything on the context of key parts of her speech”.In her reply to the notice, the Trinamool Congress leader had said, “I did not seek to influence the voters to cast their vote for her on religious segmentary lines; rather I categorically spoke in favour of religious harmony in line with the spirit of Model Code of Conduct and the Constitution of India.”“By using words ‘I also will tell my Hindu brothers and sisters not to make division amongst yourselves as Hindu and Muslim’ it is evident that my speech was not to incite religious sentiments but to maintain peace and harmony,” the chief minister had said.The EC order reproduced the “key part” of her reported speech.The text of Banerjee’s speech quoted in the commission’s order read: “I am requesting my minority brothers and sisters with folded hands don’t divide the minority votes after listening to the devil (shaitaan) person who had taken money from the BJP. He passes many communal statements and initiates clashes between the Hindu and the Muslims...” “The comrades of CPM and BJP is roaming around with the money given by BJP to divide the minority votes. Please don’t allow them to do so. Keep in mind that if the BJP comes to the government then you will be in severe danger,” read text of her speech quoted in the EC order.On her reported remarks against central armed police forces, Banerjee told the poll panel that she had only called upon the voters, specifically voters who are women, to protest democratically by “gherao” if and when somebody, including the forces, created any obstruction in their right to vote.“Gherao is one of the democratic ways of registering public protest and accepted, and there is no reason why gherao should be considered as illegal. Be it noted that the multi-dimensional word ‘gherao’ has been a legitimate entry in the in the political lexicon of West Bengal since the late 1960s, and in recent years, more frequently than not, the word has been used to connote peaceful satyagraha against authorities by silent victims of a situation,” she said.The order said in her reply, on remarks against central forces, Banerjee has “yet again conveniently left out key parts of her speech, perhaps due to selective amnesia”.The order reproduced portion of her speech to drive home the point that she had violated the model code, provisions of the Representation of the People Act and the Indian Penal Code.“l know under whose instruction they beat up and how they beat up. It is your duty to save the family of the people. If any of our mothers and sisters suffers a single stroke with the stick attack them with ladle, spuds and knife. I am telling you. It is the right of women. And if anyone of our mothers and sisters is denied entry in the voting compartment all of you come out and revolt,” the order said reproducing portions of her speech.

Sadly, most states are left with a stock of just three to five days. While it will be necessary on one hand to substantially ramp up our domestic production capacity, it will also be prudent to allow emergency use authorization of all the vaccine candidates that have the required clearances, without any further delay.”Unstated approval reference in Sonia’s letter including the Pfizer vaccine which has not been granted emergency use authorisation by the Indian drug regulator as the firm has not submitted India specific safety data.BJP’s national general secretary BL Santosh countered the calls for approval to all vaccines and said, “Sputnik V had been approved for emergency use in India after bridge study by Dr Reddy’s. All who are advocating approval to Pfizer without bridge studies in India as part of a lobby should understand that Indian lives also matter and you cannot bully the Narendra Modi government.”Sonia in her letter to PM also sought expansion of vaccination based on need and exposure rather than age and GST exemption for life saving drugs and equipment. “The numbers allocated to a state has to be based on the prevalence and projection of infection in that particular state.  All instruments, medicines and infrastructure required to deal with COVID 19 should be made completely exempt from GST. Even ventilators, oximeters and oxygen cylinders presently attract GST as do key life-saving drugs like Remdesivir and Dexamethazone,” she said.Gandhi also batted for minimum income guarantee scheme saying as states imposed curfews, economic activity would be hit hard impacting the poor and daily wagers the most. “I appeal to you to put into place the much needed scheme of minimum monthly guaranteed income in place and transfer an amount of Rs 6.000 in every eligible citizen’s account,” she said.Earlier today, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi led the party’s “Speak up for vaccines” social media campaign asking the PM to “stop events, stop exports of vaccines and give vaccines to everyone in need.”Gandhi also said the PM had said COVID would be controlled in 18 days.“It has been 385 days,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonia-writes-to-pm-modi-for-nod-to-more-vaccines-bjp-hits-back-238172

13-04-2021||New Delhi||Plea in SC challenging Centre’s decision on vaccination for all above 45 years||A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court challenging the Centre’s decision on COVID-19 vaccination only to “prioritised age groups” above 45 years and sought doses for all citizens.The plea filed by political activist and columnist Tehseen Poonawalla said there has been a steep increase in daily COVID-19 cases in the country, with 1.31 lakh new cases as of April 9.This has necessitated an ever-increasing need to allow vaccination for COVID-19 to all age groups and especially to all persons with co-morbidities such as respiratory illnesses and terminal illness, who, despite being vulnerable to the virus, have not been given the option to be protected by the vaccine.“This arbitrary bar on the age-groups coupled with the sudden rise in the number of infections due to COVID-19 disease...necessitates immediate steps to be taken to ensure that vaccination is not only available to persons aged above 45 years but to all such persons, even below the age of 45-years, who are employed in work that requires them to go outside every day as well as all persons with any of the co-morbid conditions as vulnerable groups,” the plea said.“The bar on availability of approved vaccines to persons below the age of 45 years, despite having co-morbid conditions, is arbitrary, unreasonable and ultra vires Article 21, which guarantees a right to life, not being a mere animal existence but including within it the right to dignity and appropriate healthcare as well as Article 14, which envisages a right to equality to all the citizens,” it said.The petition has sought directions to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to make effective changes in its policy to ensure vaccination for COVID-19 to all citizens of the country.The Drugs Controller General of India had approved the use of two vaccines for immunization—Serum Institute of India’s (SII) Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.In a boost to India’s vaccine drive, the Centre had eased the age limit on vaccination, allowing all those above 45 years in age to get the shots from April 1.The vaccination phases in India have so far covered all people above the age of 60, those above 45 with comorbidities, medical professionals and frontline workers.
