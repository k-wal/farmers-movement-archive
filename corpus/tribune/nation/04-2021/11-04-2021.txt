If anyone dares to take the law into his hands, this will happen to him also,” Ghosh said without elaborating on the phrase ‘naughty boys’.“The naughty boys, who had presumed that the rifles of the central forces were just for a show during election duty, will not dare repeat the same mistake after seeing what happened in Sitalkuchi,” he said, while addressing an election rally at Baranagar in North 24 Parganas district.Four persons died as CISF personnel opened fire after some people “attempted to snatch their rifles” while voting was underway in Sitalkuchi assembly constituency area in the fourth phase on Saturday.“On April 17 (date of fifth phase of polling) as well, the central forces will be at the booths. Sitalkuchi-like incidents may happen if people try to take the law into their hands,” he said.His comment triggered protest with TMC demanding his immediate arrest.“We demand his immediate arrest for making such an inflammatory statement which will encourage trigger happy forces and threaten the safety of voters,” TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy told reporters.Left Front leader Sujan Chakraborty, also the CPI(M) candidate in the Jadavpur seat, said, “Dilip Ghosh is making irresponsible statements. His comment unmasks the fascist face of the BJP.”Ghosh had earlier made several controversial statements, triggering political storms and public outrage.

11-04-2021||---||Vaccine universalisation, vaccine nationalism need of the hour: AAP leader writes to PM||New Delhi, April 11Terming vaccine universalisation and vaccine nationalism need of the hour, AAP leader Raghav Chadha wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying there must be a strict India-first rule as citizens’ needs must be given priority over exports to other countries.In a letter, the AAP MLA said the Centre has chosen to export over 64 million doses to 84 countries while Indian citizens are desperately looking for a vaccination centre that is still open.“I wish to ask Government of India as to what its priority is—the people of Delhi or of Dominican Republic? The people of Maharashtra or of Mauritius? The people of Bengal or Bangladesh? Gujarat or Guyana? Odisha or Oman? Uttar Pradesh or United Kingdom? Kerala or Kenya,” Chadha asked.He urged the government to prioritise vaccinating the 135 crore people in India before “earning trivial international laurels”.“I urge Government of India to adopt ‘vaccine nationalism’, and prioritise vaccinating the entire 135 crore in India before earning trivial international laurels. Do not let vaccination centres shut while doses are being flown out of the country.“It is further alarming to read reports that Government of India will be exporting nearly 45 million doses to Pakistan in the coming days. On one hand, Government of India claims that Pakistan has only exported terrorism to India, on the other hand, we are exporting life-saving vaccines to Pakistan,” he said. Chadha said vaccine nationalism and vaccine universalisation are the need of the hour. “Vaccines should have a strict India-first rule, with Indian citizens’ needs being given priority over exports to other countries. Government of India should not be exporting doses while Indian citizens are dying by the thousands, with a cure within grasp, but out of reach.“By promoting vaccine nationalism, Government of India must ensure that every Indian citizen is vaccinated and does not have to suffer because of Government of India’s diplomatic adventurism,” Chadha said.       The letter comes amid complaints of vaccine shortage by several states in the country. Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh have formally informed the Centre about their fast depleting stock of COVID-19 vaccines, while Chhattisgarh and Odisha said they too are facing a similar shortage.       Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor claimed Chadha’s letter was neither motivated by nationalism, nor did it have any serious concern for the youth.“It’s just a part of Aam Aadmi Party’s dirty political game to create confusion and make the vaccination process controversial. Government of India is seriously committed to speedy vaccination for all and taking steps like prohibiting COVID medicine export as it has today banned export of remdesivir injections,” he said.

11-04-2021||Mumbai||Nobel laureate trashes theory of limited government intervention to uplift poor||Renowned economist and Nobel laureate Abjijit Vinayak Banerjee has trashed the ideology that calls for lesser or limited government interventions towards uplifting the poor arguing that such freebies make the poor lazy, saying there is no evidence whatsoever proving so.He said his own research on the subject across diverse economies in Asia, Africa and Latin America in the past decade and more does not support this ideology, rather it proves that those who have benefited from public and non-governmental interventions wherein they were given free assets did in fact became more productive and creative.Addressing the 20th foundation day of Bandhan Bank, the non-profit-turned-MFI-turned-small finance bank, on Sunday, Banerjee said there is no data and no empirical evidence anywhere to establish the ideology that getting freebies or getting free assets make the poor people lazy.This ideology has been pushing successive governments to give less to the poor so that they don't become lazy. But we have seen no evidence to this effect anywhere, not even in India, instead we have seen improvements everywhere, he said.The economist also partly blamed those people hawking this ideology for the large number of the poor here and elsewhere as this had successive governments leaving poverty reduction and other socioeconomic impactful measures to non-profits and private sector till about the middle of the first decade of the new millennium when Manmohan Singh-led government unveiled the rural jobs guarantee scheme.This and many other affirmative actions has lifted nearly tens of millions out of poverty in five years after the implementation.He said an analysis of a decadal data from Bandhan when it was an NGO, clearly established the impact of its work on the poor who have seen on average 25 per cent income growth helping them consume 18 per cent more.This is a great data-driven lesson, gained from his randomised control trials, in fighting poverty over a long period, Banerjee said, adding the first lesson in this is that when the poor become better off, they become more creative in generating more wealth and leading better lives including by sending their kids to better schools far away from their villages.Data from my randomised control trials clearly showed that they're those people who benefited from public/non-government help have seen income increasing by 25 per cent leading to an 18 per cent jump in consumption he said.While calling for more globalisation and free trade, he however admitted that fight against poverty has become more complicated in a globalised world as globalisation has created new forms of risks—the now raging pandemic is one of the best examples of such new risksèespecially for the poor as they suffered the most from the lockdowns across the world.The globalised world has more risks of varied formats and we need more impactful and nuanaced risk mitigation measures and mechanism to tide over them and not puncturing the wheels of globalisation.This could be done by upskilling, re-skilling and learning new skills, he said, adding globalisation arond the world and more so in our country has had limited success because we have not paid enough attention to creating risk mitigation mechanism. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nobel-laureate-trashes-theory-of-limited-government-intervention-to-uplift-poor-237732

Due to low vaccine stocks, officials have had to postpone the campaign in some districts and organise it on a lower scale in other districts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-cases-up-in-telugu-states-as-vaccine-stocks-dwindle-237727

11-04-2021||Mumbai April 11||Covid-19: Maharashtra crosses 1-crore vaccination mark||Maharashtra has administered COVID-19 vaccine doses to over one crore people so far, a senior health official said on Sunday.The vaccination drive began on January 16 this year across the country and is currently under way for front-line and health care workers, and people aged 45 years and above.“We have crossed one crore doses today. Till today noon, we have administered 1,00,38,421 doses,” Maharashtra’s principal secretary (health) Pradeep Vyas said in a statement.Amid reports of Maharashtra facing an acute shortage of the doses, hampering its immunisation drive, Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Saturday said the state has received 1.10 crore doses of the anti-COVID-19 vaccines so far.Apart from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan are the two other states that have received more than one crore doses, Javadekar had said.On the blame game between the Centre and the state government over the availability of vaccine doses, the BJP leader had said this was not the right time to do politics.Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope had alleged that many states, which are smaller than Maharashtra in terms of population and the number of patients, have received more doses of vaccine.

11-04-2021||New Delhi||Mutants, sluggish vaccine drive, carelessness: Add them and you get Covid surge, say top scientists||Why are India’s COVID-19 cases flaring up so sharply? There are no clear answers but top scientists say the complex interplay of mutant strains, a hugely susceptible population made more vulnerable by elections and other public events and the lowering of guard are primarily to blame.India’s COVID tally has climbed to 1,33,58,805 (1.33 crore, 13.3 million) with a record spike of 1,52,879 daily cases, the Union Health Ministry said on Sunday, in what many say is a second wave that is surging more powerfully than the first.As Delhi alone reported 10,732 fresh cases, far exceeding its earlier peak of 8,593 on November 11, 2020, the number of active cases in the country breached the 11-lakh mark for the first time since the outbreak of the pandemic. And just like there were no answers to why there was a slide earlier this year, there is no clarity on why the numbers are rising so sharply.While there are many imponderables and many things unknown, virologists Shahid Jameel and T Jacob John are agreed that not following COVID-19 protocol, including informing people they must continue with precautions even after being vaccinated, and a sluggish vaccination drive are responsible.Jameel said the interplay of mutants and vaccines over the next couple of months will decide the future of Covid in India and the world.“The intensity of the surge also suggests that there were a huge number of susceptible people after the first wave,” the director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences at Ashoka University in Haryana told PTI.The Centre warned earlier this week that the next four weeks are critical and people’s participation in helping control the second wave of the contagion is pivotal.NITI Aayog Member (Health) VK Paul said the pandemic situation has worsened with a sharp rise in cases and a large part of the population still susceptible to the virus, without giving any clear explanation on why this is happening.The fact that people lowered the guard and didn’t follow Covid protocols after the first wave was over is “certainly one valid explanation” for the surge, Jameel said.“Everything opening up to pre-Covid levels and behaviour that was no longer risk-averse exposed the susceptible population in a big way. A new factor is emerging mutants—both imported and homegrown,” the eminent virologist added.John, professor of virology at Tamil Nadu’s Christian Medical College (CMC), concurred with Jameel, saying not following COVID-19 protocols is partly to blame for the new wave.“Lowering of the guard was led by the Central government and followed by all political parties, all religious groups, and the public at large. Schools and colleges were opened without vaccinating all staff. This explains partly the second wave,” John told PTI.“Wherever infection was rising, stricter imposition of discipline should have been taken but with the elections ahead, no leader wanted that. Elections during pandemic had to be carefully planned,” the renowned virologist told PTI.The scientist also agreed that variants are the other reason for the second wave, adding that it was too late for India to look for mutants.“The two factors came together and we were leaderless in response at the critical time. The speed of spread in the second wave is twice as fast as in the first wave. Partly due to variants and partly lowering of the guard,” John explained.Referring to a Health Ministry briefing on March 24, Jameel noted that the UK variants now show up in about 80 per cent of cases from Punjab.“A new double mutant has emerged in India and is reported in 15-20 per cent of cases analysed from Maharashtra. If this percentage goes up further, it would be a clear indication of its role in the Maharashtra surge,” said the virologist.In India, variants first identified in the UK, South Africa and Brazil have been found.In late March, the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced that a new variant had been identified in samples of saliva taken from people in Maharashtra, Delhi and Punjab.           The genome sequencing carried out by Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), a consortium of 10 labs in India, identified two important mutations in the variant dubbed as “double mutant”. Explaining that the UK variant is known to be about 50 per cent more infectious, Jameel said one of the two mutations in the double mutant was also found in California, US, where it was associated with increased transmission.The two experts also discussed the country’s vaccination drive.According to John, the government started the drive too late and no outcome goal of vaccination was defined.“India started slow vaccine rollout in January third week, but it was first a token reward to healthcare workers who were vaccinated even when there was no need—and we wasted a lot of vaccines,” he said.“Was advance purchase order given to vaccine companies to get production accelerated during last year itself before approvals were obtained?” John asked.Jameel said there was “poor communication” by officials to people who were vaccinated on how they must continue with precautions like masks and social distancing.Describing India’s COVID-19 situation as “curious”, Jameel said the country was on a falling curve of daily infections when vaccinations started in mid-January.“For various reasons, those eligible, including healthcare and frontline workers, were hesitant to get vaccines. Those above 60 also did not show enough eagerness even though cases had started going up by early March.“Now we are on a very fast rising curve with only 0.7 per cent Indians having received both doses and only about 5 per cent having received one dose. That is too low to make an impact,” he added.He noted that there was no way to predict that younger people would be affected in this surge.“Make everyone above 18 eligible for vaccination in states experiencing the surge, while staying with the 45 plus eligibility in states not experiencing the surge. Vaccinations have to be balanced against the supply of vaccines,” Jameel said.Noting that supply may be an issue, Jameel said India has the capacity to inoculate with 10 million doses of Covishield vaccine per month and three million Covaxin doses per month.“Supply can also be boosted by giving emergency use approval to Johnson & Johnson vaccine and Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine. Both of these have received approvals in other countries and have manufacturing partners in India,” he added.According to the Health Ministry on Sunday, the death toll increased to 1,69,275 with 839 daily new fatalities, the highest since October 18, 2020.The active caseload was at its lowest at 1,35,926 on February 12.In a recent study, scientists, including those from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, predicted that the ongoing second-wave could peak by mid-April, following which the infections may see a steep decline by the end of May.

11-04-2021||New Delhi||Delhi records 10,732 COVID cases, highest single-day spike so far||Delhi has recorded 10,732 fresh cases of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours which is the highest single-day surge in the national capital till date, according to data shared by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday.Addressing an online press conference, he also said that the current fourth wave of the pandemic in the city is “very dangerous” and is spreading at such a rapid rate that it has left many people baffled.“Cases have escalated in a big way in the last 10-15 days. And, in the past 24 hours, the city has recorded 10,732 cases,” he said.The previous highest-ever single-day spike in Delhi of 8,593 cases was reported on November 11, 2020, while on November 19, the city had recorded 131 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day fatality count till date.“Prior to 10,732 cases, Delhi had recorded about 7,900 cases, and over 8,500 cases a day prior to that,” he said.This is also the first time daily COVID cases have breached the 10,000-mark in the national capital since the start of the pandemic in early 2020.On Saturday, 7,897 cases and 39 fatalities were registered. The positivity rate also mounted to 10.21 per cent, breaching the 10 per cent-mark for the first time this year.The positivity rate mid-November last year stood above 15 per cent.On Friday, 8,521 cases and 39 deaths were recorded. This was also the first time that over 8,000 cases were recorded in a day this year amid a massive spike in cases in the last few weeks.On Thursday, the city had recorded 7,437 cases. This was also the first time that over 7,000 cases were reported in a day this year.On preceding two days, the cases count had stood above 5,000.On November 27, the city had recorded 5,482 cases and 6,224 cases on November 24 and 7,486 on November 18, according to official data.

11-04-2021||New Delhi||COVID situation in Delhi very serious, 4th wave much more dangerous: Kejriwal||The COVID-19 situation in Delhi is “very serious” with 10,732 cases of infection reported in the last 24 hours, the highest ever since the pandemic began, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said Sunday as he issued a stark warning—do not step out of homes unless it is urgent.“The fourth wave is more dangerous than the previous wave. The government is closely monitoring the situation,” Kejriwal told a press conference.Also read: Delhi records 10,732 COVID cases, highest single-day spike so farIn just a few weeks, Delhi has gone from near normalcy—with less than 100 cases reported on a single day on February 16, to an exploding pandemic, a grim reminder that the virus is contributing to extract its toll.Kejriwal said the current fourth wave of the pandemic in the city is “very dangerous” and is spreading at such a rapid rate that it has left many people baffled.“Cases have escalated in a big way in the last 10-15 days. And, in the past 24 hours, the city has recorded 10,732 cases. The situation is very serious.This is the highest single-day spike in Delhi since the outbreak of coronavirus. The previous highest ever single-day spike in Delhi -- 8,593 cases—was reported on November 11, 2020. That day, the city had recorded 131 COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day fatality count till date.The chief minister said that his government does not want to impose lockdown in Delhi but such a situation may arise if there is a rush to the hospitals and beds are unavailable for serious patients.“We need your cooperation. If your cooperation is received and situation of hospitals is under control, there will be no need to impose lockdown in Delhi. But, if beds in the hospitals fell short and are unavailable, then lockdown may have to be imposed,” he said.He said lockdown should be imposed by any government only when its hospital system has collapsed.“I am not in favour of lockdown. I believe lockdown is not a solution to deal with COVID-19. It should be imposed if hospital system collapses,” he said.He, however, asked people to remain in home isolation if infected with the virus instead of rushing to hospitals, saying the most important thing is that hospital beds are kept vacant for serious patients.He said that there was a peculiar contradiction that despite vaccine availability in the country, coronavirus was spreading fast.“As per data available with me, 65 per cent COVID-19 patients are below 45 years. How will coronavirus stop when 65 per cent of affected are below 45 years for whom there is no vaccination,” he said.Kejriwal said that in a recent meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi 2-3 chief ministers requested restrictions on vaccination to be lifted.“Our government is ready to vaccinate people door to door. The time is to launch vaccination at a war footing lifting restrictions of age and setting up vaccination centres.”  He said that experts say that despite receiving vaccine, people may get infected with COVID-19 but they will not be seriously ill.So, people need to wear masks and observe all the precautions even after getting vaccinated, he said.Kejriwal asked all political parties to work together to fight coronavirus spread, saying it was not time to do politics and point fingers.He also appealed the religious and social organisations and NGOs to contribute in the fight against the virus and check its spread.

11-04-2021||Mumbai||Corruption case: CBI questions personal staffers of Anil Deshmukh||The CBI on Sunday questioned two personal staffers of former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh in connection with the allegations of corruption levelled against him by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, officials said.Deshmukh’s personal assistant Kundan Shinde and personal secretary Sanjeev Palande were asked to appear before the CBI team in connection with its ongoing preliminary enquiry (PE) into the case following directives of the Bombay High Court, they said.Both of them were being questioned by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) at the DRDO guest house in suburban Santacruz, the officials said.Singh had in a letter alleged that Palande was present when Deshmukh allegedly asked suspended cop Sachin Vaze to allegedly extort over Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants of Mumbai, they said.Vaze, who was arrested last month by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the case of an explosives-laden SUV found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house, in his statement had reportedly claimed Shinde was present during one such conversation.The agency started its preliminary enquiry into the allegations of bribery against Deshmukh on Tuesday on the orders of the high court.It sent a team of officers from Delhi to Mumbai to carry out the probe.The CBI has so far recorded statements of Param Bir Singh, currently posted as the Director General of state Home Guards, Sachin Waze, DCP Raju Bhujbal, ACP Sanjay Patil, advocate Jayshree Patil, a petitioner, and hotel owner Mahesh Shetty.Singh was shifted from the post of Mumbai police commissioner to the Home Guards department on March 17.Later, he filed a petition in the HC seeking a CBI probe against Deshmukh, alleging the NCP leader had asked Waze and other police officers to extort Rs 100 crore from restaurants and bars in Mumbai.Deshmukh, who has denied the allegations, resigned from the Cabinet on April 5 after the HC order.

After all she is still the CM of Bengal and it is her duty to visit the place of this unfortunate occurrence. We know for certain now that EC is not fair”, Sinha said in a tweet on Saturday evening.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cooch-behar-firing-mamata-asks-ec-to-rename-model-code-of-conduct-as-modi-code-of-conduct-237672

India has made it clear that pulling back troops from friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh could be done only after the Chinese army ‘disengages’ from areas like Gogra, Hot Springs and the Depsang plains.So far, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China has been inflexible to this suggestion. As of now, the ‘disengagement’ has happened only at one sector — Pangong Tso.A statement of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) today gave details of the outcome of the meeting of military commanders on Friday. “It was highlighted that completion of disengagement in other areas would pave the way for two sides to consider de-escalation of forces and ensure full restoration of peace and tranquility and enable progress in bilateral relations,” it said.Sources in New Delhi explained that until there was a timeline for the three-step process for pulling back troops, weapons and war equipment from the entire stretch of the LAC in eastern Ladakh, India could not focus on a complete pull back only for the Pangong Tso sector.The MoD statement came after a marathon 13-hour meeting between the Corps Commander-level officers of both sides at the Chushul-Moldo border point on April 9 that ended around 11. 30 pm. “The two sides had a detailed exchange of views for the resolution of the remaining issues related to disengagement along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh,” it said.The two sides agreed to jointly maintain stability on the ground, avoid new incidents and jointly maintain peace in the border areas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pla-inflexible-lac-talks-hit-a-deadlock-237376

Her right to claim compensation crystallised upon her husband’s life being tragically snatched away in the motor accident and simply because she has now remarried, her claim does not abate or lessen, the top court said in its April 6 order.“Her entitlement fructified when the dependency was calculated. Therefore, as an aggrieved widow, she would be entitled to a share of compensation apropos ‘loss of dependency’ of equal amount to her parents-in-law, who had lost their son,” it said. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal had awarded Rs 1,68,39,642 along with interest to the widow, and parents of the deceased. But the widow, who had re-married, was ordered to be given only Rs 3,91,054 by the tribunal.Noting that the tribunal had not compensated her for “loss of love and affection” and “loss of consortium”, the Delhi High Court had said the widow was entitled to equal, i.e. one-third share (Rs 56,13,214) of the total Rs 1,68,39,642 awarded to the dependents of the deceased.“There is no persuasive reason stated in the impugned order for the starkly disproportionate apportionment against the widow,” the high court had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/widow-remarriage-wont-affect-right-to-claim-relief-says-supreme-court-237382

However, as a consolation, the BJP, for the first time, won nine seats in the TTAADC though its junior ally IPFT, despite being a major tribal-based party, drew a blank. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-outfit-captures-tribal-body-in-tripura-237383

India and the US differently interpret a key clause in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).India is among the group of countries insisting that its consent is essential for an external military power to hold exercises, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives. The US, however, maintains that this interpretation restricts the concept of a free and open ocean, and needs to be challenged, which it does practically every year. The only additional element this year is that the US Navy also issued a statement immediately after the passage.The Pentagon insisted that Indian misgivings were misplaced, stating it was an “innocent passage” to assert navigational rights and freedoms. Interestingly, the Pentagon claimed that the passage tool place through Maldives’ EEZ without requesting prior permission. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-protests-us-warship-intrusion-in-eez-237496

11-04-2021||---||Controversy erupts over Prashant Kishor’s leaked audio chat on West Bengal polls||New Delhi, April 10As the fourth phase of polling in West Bengal concluded today, the BJP was quick to lap up the purported claims of ruling TMC’s election strategist Prashant Kishor to buttress its argument that the saffron outfit has gained popular support in the state.Prashant KishorBJP won’t cross 100-seat markI am glad BJP is taking my chat more seriously than words of their own leaders. They should show courage & share the full chat instead of getting excited with selective use of parts of it. I have said this before & repeating again – BJP will not to cross 100 in WB.The BJP IT cell head and co in charge for West Bengal Amit Malviya argued that Kishor’s comments made to a few Delhi-based journalists during a social media audio discussion amounted to the TMC conceding defeat in the state Assembly elections.Further, the saffron party’s IT cell went all out to amplify the clips of the purported audio conversation in which Kishor is heard saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi continues to enjoy as much popularity in West Bengal as Chief Minister and TMC leader Mamata Banerjee. Kishor is also heard saying that 27 per cent Dalit voters in the state are voting for the BJP. In the audio, which Malviya shared on Twitter, Kishor can be heard making claims that there’s anti-incumbency factor against the TMC and it is also at the receiving end because of appeasement politics.“On a day Bengal is voting for 4th phase on as many as 44 seats, TMC cadre and leaders woke up to find out that Mamata Banerjee’s election strategist (Prashant Kishore) has conceded the election. Every voter in Bengal has these videos on their mobile and is watching them as s(he) queues up to vote,” tweeted Malviya, who also claimed that the TMC election had just been thrown away.Kishor purportedly stated during the conversation that PM Modi enjoyed cult status to an extent that a substantial chunk of population in the state gives him a demigod status. “There is anti-incumbency against the TMC and polarisation is a reality, says Mamata Banerjee’s strategist in an open chat,” Malviya said.Taking purported claims of Kishor to strengthen BJP’s narrative against Mamata for minority appeasement, Malviya quoted TMC’s election strategist having said that “all that the Left, Congress and TMC ecosystem have done in the last 20 years is Muslim appeasement. It has resulted in resentment.”Meanwhile, Kishor, on his part, also took to Twitter to counter the saffron party.‘PM enjoys cult status’Prashant Kishor purportedly stated during the conversation that PM Modi enjoyed cult status to an extent that a substantial chunk of population in the state considers him a demigod. “There is anti-incumbency against the TMC and polarisation is a reality, says Mamata Banerjee’s strategist in an open chat,” BJP IT cell head and co in charge for West Bengal Amit Malviya said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/controversy-erupts-over-prashant-kishors-leaked-audio-chat-on-west-bengal-polls-237487

She is inciting people against forces.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sought Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s resignation over the killings while Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused the ruling Trinamool Congress of perpetuating a culture of violence in the state.Modi, who addressed two rallies at Siliguri and Krishnanagar in Nadia district, accused Banerjee of instigating people against central forces and said the problem lay with her politics of “rigging elections and violence”. “Didi is giving instructions on how to gherao and beat up our security forces. She has stooped to this level as she can see her chair slipping away,” he said. Making a strong defence of the central forces deployed for election duty in Bengal amid allegations of high-handedness by the TMC, Modi said they recently facilitated polls in four other states and there were no complaints. Banerjee, speaking at a public meeting in North 24 Parganas, said, “Shah should resign owing responsibility for the incident which is dastardly, cold-blooded and unprecedented.” The Trinamool supremo said her party would bring out protest rallies throughout the state on Sunday. She asked TMC activists to wear black badges and demonstrate peacefully from 2 pm to 4 pm.Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal CMUnprecedentedShah should resign owning responsibility for the incident which is dastardly, cold-blooded and unprecedented.Banerjee claimed she had long apprehended that central forces would act in such a manner. “As BJP knows it has lost the people’s mandate, they are conspiring to kill them,” she said. Cooch Behar SP Debasish Djar said the jawans, belonging to the CISF, opened fire allegedly after a mob of around 350 villagers, including women, attacked them with crude weapons and tried to snatch their firearms near booth number 126 in Sitalkuchi.The CISF issued a detailed statement claiming around 9.35 am, its quick reaction team was attacked by a mob of about 50 to 60 people who were “resisting voters from reaching the polling booths”.“Chaos ensued when a child fell down and the mob started vandalising CISF vehicles and attacked jawans. After an hour, another group of around 150 people joined in and started manhandling the polling staff. A few miscreants tried to snatch the weapons of CISF personnel.“Our personnel fired two rounds into the air, but the mob continued advancing aggressively... Sensing imminent danger to their life, the personnel fired seven more rounds towards the advancing mob,” the statement said. The polling in the booth was stopped following the incident. In another incident, Anand Burman, a first-time voter, was shot by alleged TMC supporters when he was standing in queue outside a polling booth at Paglapir under Sitalkuchi.Four more phases of polling (for remaining 159 seats) are slated to take place in the state to complete the poll process. The polling in 91 segments had taken place in the first three phases. The EC today directed the MHA to rush 71 additional companies of Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) to West Bengal for the conduct of the remaining four phases. The EC also suspended the polls at polling station number 126 in Sitalkuchi. It also gave a clean-chit to CISF saying its personnel opened fire “in self-defence and to protect polling staff”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/five-dead-political-storm-over-cooch-behar-violence-237486

It said “was highlighted that completion of disengagement in other areas would pave the way for two sides to consider de-escalation of forces and ensure full restoration of peace and tranquillity and enable progress in bilateral relations”.The MoD statement has emerged after a marathon 13-hour meeting between the Corps Commander level military officers of both sides. The meeting at Chushul-Moldo border meeting point on April 9 had ended around 11.30 pm. It was the 11th round of talks since June last year.Starting February 10, troops of either side started the ‘dis-engagement’ process from along the banks of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial lake. Following the disengagement at this spot, the process is stalled for almost two months. The next two steps — de-escalation and de-induction, which means pulling back troops and war equipment to the pre-April 2020 home bases — have not yet begun.Also, so far, the ‘dis-engagement’ has been done only at Pangong Tso, the situation at other areas is same as before. The present position of troops is not face-to-face, but they are within the striking range from where rapid redeployment is possibleThe MoD statement said “the two sides had a detailed exchange of views for the resolution of the remaining issues related to disengagement along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh”.It was agreed on the need to resolve the outstanding issues in an expeditious manner in accordance with the existing agreements and protocols.The two sides agreed that it was important to take guidance from the consensus of their leaders, continue their communication and dialogue and work towards a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest.They also agreed to jointly maintain stability on the ground, avoid any new incidents and jointly maintain peace in the border areas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-military-talks-focus-on-pulling-back-troops-237331

We must focus on India’s vaccination drive first and foremost, then only export vaccines and gift them to other countries,” Gandhi said, calling for responsible behaviour - adhering to all Covid regulations without exception.Stressing the need for unity in the fight against Covid, Gandhi said the government had mismanaged the situation by “exporting vaccines and allowed a shortage to be created in India”.Gandhi said mass gatherings for elections and religious events have accelerated Covid for which everyone is responsible to some extent. “We need to accept this responsibility and keep the interest of the nation above our own. In our states, we need to take strict measures to ensure that the pandemic doesn’t go out of control and ensure testing at large scale, preparation of adequate facilities, setting up temporary ones.”Gandhi also asked CMs about the status of farmer agitation.She sought answers to whether there is enough vaccine available, whether the central government has been cooperative, whether the states are doing enough to ensure availability of the oxygen.“What is your view of lockdown? Should not public gatherings, including election rallies, be cancelled?” she asked.Punjab CM Amarinder Singh and Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel said they had asked the Centre for vaccine supplies.Case positivity rate in Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh where the Congress is in power is much higher than the national average.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-mismanaged-covid-by-exporting-vaccine-creating-local-shortage-sonia-tells-congress-cms-237283

Priority is test, track and vaccinate,” she said to CMs.Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, where Congress is in power in alliance and on its own have the highest burden of daily COVID cases nationally.Over 64 per cent of all COVID deaths in the last 14 days have happened in Maharashtra and Punjab.Case positivity rate is as high as 25 per cent in Maharashtra and 14 per cent in Chhattisgarh as against the national average of around 5 per cent.Key to COVID containment is extensive tests till case positivity falls below 5 per cent. WHO advises 140 tests per million per day until rate falls below 5 per cent.It’s feared that high burden states are missing infections as majority new cases are asymptomatic. At the meeting Punjab CM Amarinder Singh told Sonia that Punjab has only five days of vaccines left.“Punjab is left with only five days of supply (5.7 lakh Covid vaccine doses) at the current levels of vaccinating 85,000-90,000 persons a day. We have urged the Centre to share the schedule for supply of vaccines with the States over the next quarter based on their confirmed supply orders.”Hoping that the Centre would send fresh batches of vaccine supply soon, the Chief Minister said if the state is able to meet its target of 2 lakh vaccines a day, then its current supplies will last only three days. He said he had written to the Prime Minister and the Health Minister to give confirmed supply schedules.Despite being a slow-starter in vaccination, Punjab has vaccinated more than 16 lakh persons, at an average of around 85,000-90,000 per day, he said during the video conference.The meeting was attended by chief ministers of the Congress-ruled states, as well as senior party leaders, including Rahul Gandhi.Amarinder said people in Punjab were still not coming out in large numbers for the vaccination due to the massive anger prevailing against the Government of India on the issue of Farm Laws. He said since Punjab has majority population among the agriculture community, even the common man is affected by the farmers’ agitation, he said, adding “this anger is impacting the vaccination drive.” He said his government is undertaking an extensive media campaign to address the misinformation regarding Covid and vaccination hesitancy.  Ranking 18th in the country at present in terms of cases reported, Punjab is showing around 8 pc  positivity, with an average of around 3000 cases per days for the past 15 days, the Chief Minister apprised Sonia. The number of cases is slightly stable, he pointed out, adding that “this shows that the steps taken in the last three weeks are in the right direction.” Even in the graphs put up by Health Ministry in Prime Minister’s review meeting yesterday, the “curve appears to be flattened over the past fortnight,” he said, disclosing that the state currently has around 27,200 active cases with recovery rate of 87.1 per cent. CM said deaths are a concern for Punjab, with around 50-60 daily deaths with a little under 2 per cent Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in the second surge. Overall, CFR is 2.77 per cent for all reported cases since March 2020, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/have-only-5-days-of-vaccine-left-punjab-cm-tells-sonia-at-covid-review-meet-237278

TMC has claimed that all those killed are party supporters.Polling ended at 6.30 pm.  A 76.16 per cent voter turnout was recorded till 5 pm in 44 seats where polling was held for fourth phase. Meanwhile, the Election Commission (EC) has ordered adjournment of polls at polling station number 126 in the Sitalkuchi Assembly constituency.A spokesperson of the poll panel said the decision was based on an interim report filed by special observers.The highest turnout of 79.73 per cent was registered in Cooch Behar district, followed by 76.2 per cent polling in Hoogly. In South 24 Parganas it was 75.49 per cent, while in Howrah it was 75.03 per cent and in Alipurduar 73.65 per cent, he said.Polling was held from 7 am to 6.30 pm in 15,940 polling nine assembly constituencies in Howrah, 11 in South 24 Parganas, five in Alipurduar, nine in Coochbehar and ten in Hooghly district.West Bengal had registered 84.13 per cent voting in the first, 86.11 per cent in the second and 84.61 per cent in the third phase of polling, data by the CEO’s office said.The result of the 44 seats will be declared along with 250 others of the state on May 2.Earlier in the day, a young BJP supporter Ananda Burman was killed in the area when alleged TMC supporters fired at voters who were standing a queue outside a polling booth.TMC alleged that jawans of the central forces resorted to firing at TMC supporters without any provocation. BJP leader and Cooch Behar MP Nisgith Pramanik, however, held Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee responsible for the incident. He said that repeated instigation by Banerjee to her supporters against the central forces led a section of TMC supporters to attack central forces resulting in the tragedy.The EC has asked for an action-taken report on the incident.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee questioned CISF's claim of having fired at voters in self-defence. Banerjee said no policeman had been wounded in the incident, nor was there any video evidence to substantiate the claim, and added that her government would institute a Special Investigation Team to inquire into the circumstances of the firing.   Voting was held with strict adherence to COVID-19 protocols in 44 constituencies, including nine seats in Howrah, 11 in South 24 Parganas, five in Alipurduar, nine in Cooch Behar and 10 in Hooghly, they said.The 18-year-old voter, Ananda Barman, was allegedly gunned down by miscreants outside booth number 85 in Pathantuli area after clashes broke out between activists of the ruling TMC and the BJP.The culprits, who are yet to be identified, managed to flee, the officials said.Also read: The incident led to violence in the area as bombs were hurled, prompting central forces to baton-charge to bring the situation under control, police said.Both the TMC and BJP claimed that Barman belonged to their party, but his family members said he was an activist of the saffron party."We have received information about a person being shot outside a polling booth in Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar. We have sought a report from the micro observer," an Election Commission official said.The Trinamool Congress has moved the EC, complaining against the BJP of not allowing its agents to enter several booths at Coochbehar's Natabari, Sitalkuchi, Tufanganj, Mathabhanga and Dinhata.The BJP has denied the allegations.In Ganguly Bagan area in Jadavpur constituency, the booth agent of CPI(M) candidate Sujan Chakraborty was reportedly attacked by a "fake voter", who threw chilli powder at her while trying to escape, the officials said.A central police contingent was rushed to the spot following the incident.On Saturday evening, officials said the central government was sending 71 additional companies of the CAPF for the remainder of the elections. Meanwhile, BJP candidate Indranil Khan accused the central forces of not taking action against bogus voters in Kasba constituency in Kolkata.Over 1.15 crore voters are eligible to exercise their franchise to decide the fate of 373 candidates, including Union minister Babul Supriyo and state ministers Partha Chatterjee and Arup Biswas.Tight security arrangements have been made to ensure peaceful voting with 789 companies of central armed police forces (CAPF) being deployed to guard 15,940 polling stations.with PTI inputs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bengal-elections-5-tmc-workers-shot-dead-76-pc-turnout-in-4th-phase-of-poll-237254
