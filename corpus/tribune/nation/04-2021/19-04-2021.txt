19-04-2021||New Delhi||COVID-19 surge has brought restaurant industry back to square one: NRAI||The National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) on Monday said the sudden surge of COVID-19 has brought the restaurant industry back to the same dire situation it was at the earlier peak of the pandemic.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a six-day lockdown from 10 pm on Monday till 5 am on April 26 which he said was necessary to deal with the rising number of COVID-19 cases as the city’s health system was stretched to its limits.The lockdown is needed to prevent the health system of Delhi from collapsing under the increasing number of patients as there is an acute shortage of medicines, beds, ICUs and oxygen, Kejriwal said.“This is the most unfortunate situation; we could have ever witnessed. The sudden second surge of COVID has brought us to square one; the same place we were standing aimlessly a year ago at the peak of the pandemic,” NRAI president Anurag Katriar said in a statement.As far as the restaurant industry is concerned, the new curfew regulations don’t change the status quo for the industry, he added.“Our dine-in business was shut until the 30th of April under the night curfew regulations and only home deliveries were permitted and these conditions remain unchanged now under the curfew,” Katriar said.As partners with the Delhi government in this fight against the pandemic, “we once again request the govt to kindly smoothen and expedite the process to issue e-passes for our teams”, he added.Katriar said clear directions to the law enforcing agencies will ensure that restaurant workers, who are also frontline warriors, are not subjected to any undue harassment by the law-enforcing authorities.“Home deliveries, which is just a minuscule part of our overall business, is currently the only business avenue available to us and therefore very critical. We are sure that the govt of Delhi is aware of this and will do the needful to protect the interests of our beleaguered fraternity”, he added.

19-04-2021||Chakulia (WB)||Mamata urges EC with 'folded hands' to curtail Bengal poll schedule amid COVID-19 surge||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday urged the Election Commission to re-consider its decision to stick to the original poll schedule, as she stressed that wrapping up the last three phases of polls on a single day or at the most in two days would check the spread of COVID-19 to some extent.Indicating that the EC may have decided against clubbing the remaining phases at the behest of the BJP, Banerjee, while addressing her rally here in Uttar Dinajpur, requested the poll panel to prioritise public health.“With folded hands, I request the EC to hold the next three phases on a single day. If not one day, conduct it in two days and save one day.“Please don’t take your decision based on what the BJP says... Please ensure that you protect public health by curtailing the poll schedule, even if it is by one day,” the TMC supremo said.The CM further said that she and other leaders of her party would not hold any rally in congested areas.She lambasted the Narendra Modi government for “not taking adequate measures in the past six months to avert vaccine crisis”.Calling the BJP a party of “rioters and war mongers”, she told people gathered at the rally, “Don’t allow them (saffron party leaders) to turn Bengal into Gujarat.”    Referring to the incident of firing in Cooch Behar, Banerjee said, “They conspire to kill people by opening fire on voters. Your vote will be the reply to their bullet.”          Four persons died on April 10 in Sitalkuchi area of Cooch Behar when central forces opened fire in “self defence” allegedly after coming under attack from locals.The TMC supremo has, on several occasions in the past, claimed that central forces were working on the instructions of “home ministry run by Amit Shah”.She had also said that the CAPF personnel were “assaulting voters” in some places, asking them to vote for the BJP.

19-04-2021||New Delhi||Thousands of migrant workers head home despite CM Kejriwal’s assurance ‘Main hoon na’||Thousands of migrant workers gathered at Anand Vihar ISBT here to catch a bus home, hours after Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a week-long lockdown and appealed to them with folded hands not to leave Delhi while sounding a word of assurance—“Main hoon na” (I am here for you).Police officials said over 5,000 people gathered at Anand Vihar including at ISBT as well as the railway station and the numbers were rising.Earlier in the day, Kejriwal appealed to the migrant workers to not leave Delhi, saying the short period of lockdown would need not be extended.  “I assure you, the government will take full care of you. Main hun na, mujh par bharosa rakho (I am here for you, have faith in me),” Kejriwal said, announcing the lockdown from 10 PM tonight to 5 AM next Monday.A senior police officer said after the sudden announcement of the lockdown, thousands of migrant workers thronged the ISBT Anand Vihar area.  “We have deployed maximum force here. There must be over 5,000 people here at present. Buses are limited as of now, we are guiding people as per their destination,” he said.The police were also in talks with civil administration officials to either arrange transport for them or shelter homes for their temporary stay, the officer said.Policemen deployed in the area were also trying to counsel the migrant workers to stay back as the lockdown was for a few days only, he added. However, migrants feared that the lockdown could be extended as the situation of COVID-19 was deteriorating by the day.Mukesh Pratap, who works at a cloth factory in Dilsad Garden and a native of UP’s Bareilly, said he wanted to go to his home as there was a possibility of lockdown extension.“Lockdown will definitely affect our livelihood so it is better for us to remain at our home. It may be extended also and I would not like to take a chance,” he said.In an online briefing, the chief minister said: “I would like to appeal to them (migrants), with folded hands, this is a short lockdown of six days. Please do not leave Delhi. You would lose a lot of time, money, and energy in travelling. Stay in Delhi”.Kejriwal said it was not an easy decision to impose lockdown because it hurt the poor people most.       “I understand how people lose their jobs and wages during the lockdown. This is especially difficult for the poor people and daily wage workers,” he said. Migrants arrive at Anand Vihar Terminal after Delhi Government announced a complete lockdown for 6 days due to a surge in coronavirus cases in New Delhi on Monday.

The judiciary will, however, function on its own discretion,” the bench said.The state has witnessed a spurt in coronavirus cases over the past few weeks.Responding to the order, Uttar Pradesh Additional Chief Secretary, Information, Navneet Sehgal said strict curbs are necessary to control the spread of the virus and that the government has taken several steps in that direction.However, he said, alongside saving lives, protecting livelihoods is also important.“Therefore, there will be no complete lockdown in the cities for now.

19-04-2021||New Delhi||IOC, BPCL to supply oxygen to hospitals in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab||After Reliance Industries Ltd, state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) have begun diverting oxygen produced at their refineries to supplement the availability of medical oxygen in states worst hit by COVID-19.In a statement, IOC said it has “begun the supply of 150 tonnes of oxygen at no cost to various hospitals in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.”       “The first batch of the lifesaver medical grade oxygen was dispatched today to Maha Durga Charitable Trust Hospital, New Delhi,” it said. “Delhi is already facing an oxygen emergency situation.”  In the face of a massive surge in demand for medical oxygen during the second wave of the pandemic, IOC has diverted the high-purity oxygen used in its Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) unit to produce medical-grade liquid oxygen at its Panipat refinery and petrochemical complex in Haryana.The throughput of the unit has also been scaled down for a more critical cause.In a separate statement, BPCL said it has started supply of 100 tonnes of oxygen at no cost.“The company will be supplying around 100 tonnes per month,” it said.With average daily cases of COVID-19 rising again since last one month, the demand for oxygen has significantly risen. In fact, in most parts of the country, the cases are hitting new peak, thereby disrupting the demand-supply scenario for medical oxygen.Last week, Reliance’s twin oil refineries in Jamnagar in Gujarat through minor process modification converted industrial oxygen into medical-use oxygen that can be administered to COVID-19 patients low on oxygen. In all, 100 tonnes of oxygen is being supplied from the Jamnagar refineries free of cost.BPCL is also supplying 1.5 tonnes per day of medical oxygen to Kerala from its Kochi Refinery.Last year, BPCL had supplied around 25 tonnes of medical oxygen when the average daily cases had risen in October-November.The Kochi Refinery has a provision to produce and store liquid oxygen of 99.7 per cent purity.Oil refineries can produce limited volumes of industrial oxygen in air-separation plants meant for nitrogen production. Scrubbing out other gases such as carbon dioxide can convert it into medical-use oxygen with 99.9 per cent purity.Reliance operates the world’s largest oil refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat.IOC Chairman S M Vaidya reiterated the firm’s unstinted support to the country at this critical hour in every possible way.“All through the pandemic, our prime focus has been to ensure the supply of essential fuels 24X7. We have also stepped up the production of raw material for PPEs, and we are now providing lifesaving medical oxygen to hospitals.“Our expertise and assets, including refineries, pipelines, petrochemical units, bottling plants, terminals and aviation fuel stations, will continue to serve the people despite the stiff challenges”, he added.As the COVID-19 cases in the country continue to rise, the demand for medical-grade oxygen too is growing rapidly. “The current initiative by IOC aims at supporting the states in fighting the battle against COVID-19,” the statement added.

During searches documents related to the forged or fake FDRs were recovered from the premises of the bank manager.They said the scam surfaced during a recent joint surprise check conducted by the CBI which has registered a case against unidentified officials of DUSIB and BOB.The check conducted at the accounts section of DUSIB head office showed that 112 fixed deposits worth Rs 214 crore were opened at the Patparganj branch of Bank of Baroda between September 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021, the officials informed.The amount was taken out from five accounts of DUSIB at Central Bank of India to two accounts at BoB to create these fixed deposits, they said, adding that the FD receipts are printed on just an A4 sheet of paper and not on security papers.The documents also showed that only three fixed deposits worth over Rs 6.01 crore have been issued in the name of DUSIB, while 109 fixed deposits worth over Rs 207 crore are “fake securities” and the money has been misappropriated, the CBI has alleged in its FIR.The agency also found out that DUSIB maintains all its accounts in the Central Bank of India and the account in BoB was not opened by it or with its authority, they said.The account was opened in October 2020 showing DUSIB as a company, even though it is a board, on the basis of documents which prima facie do not look genuine, the agency alleged in its FIR.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-unearths-rs-207-crore-scam-in-delhi-urban-shelter-improvement-board-241296

19-04-2021||New Delhi||Vardhan slams Manmohan Singh, says Congress-ruled states busy raising doubts about vaccines||Hitting back at senior Congress leader Manmohan Singh for his critique of the government’s COVID-19 management, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday alleged the second wave of the pandemic was instead fuelled by Congress ruled states as they were busy raising doubts about vaccines rather than vaccinating people.Responding to Singh’s letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Vardhan also said that the letter drafters of the senior Congress leader have done a great disservice to his standing.History shall be kinder to you Dr Manmohan Singh ji if your offer of ‘constructive cooperation’ and valuable advice was followed by your @INCIndia leaders as well in such extraordinary times !Here’s my reply to your letter to Hon’ble PM Sh @narendramodi ji 👍 @PMOIndia pic.twitter.com/IJcz3aL2mo  Acknowledging that while Singh understands the importance of vaccination as an important method of fighting the COVID-19 battle, Vardhan said in his letter that “irresponsible” public pronouncements made by some Congress leaders have resulted in a below national average vaccination coverage of senior citizens and even front-line workers in some of the Congress-ruled states.Tweeting the letter to Singh, the health minister said, “History shall be kinder to you Dr Manmohan Singh ji if your offer of ‘constructive cooperation’ and valuable advice was followed by your @INCIndia leaders as well in such extraordinary times !”     Singh on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Modi suggesting five measures to battle the COVID-19 crisis, including ramping up vaccination and boosting supply of medicines.                    Vardhan said, “People in responsible positions in your party as well as in the state governments formed by your party do not seem to share your view.”                 He expressed shock that senior members of the Congress party are yet to utter a single word of gratitude towards scientists and vaccine manufacturers for innovating under trying circumstances and empowering the world with vaccines.“Let alone thanking our scientists, many Congress members and Congress ruled state governments have taken extraordinary interest in spreading falsehoods regarding the efficacy of these vaccines, thereby fuelling vaccine hesitancy, and playing with the lives of our countrymen.“A sitting chief minister of your party created a dubious world record of sorts by being the only head of government directly inciting people against an indigenously developed vaccine! Some Congress leaders even shamed the vaccines in public but took their doses in private, quietly,” he charged.               “A word of advice from you to them even if it had been done in private by you may have ensured better cooperation from these people. Knowing your penchant for constructive cooperation, which you have said you always believed in, I would assume that you did advise them and yet, quite clearly, your advice has been in vain,” the minister said.Vardhan said the former prime minister’s advice to not get tempted to go by absolute numbers, but to go by percentage of population covered, is not incorrect.However, he said this is a practice that must be followed uniformly and junior members of “your party” too must follow your advice.      Quite obviously, it cannot be that the discussion on total cases, active cases or mortality is based on absolute numbers, which the Congress party often tries to do, but the vaccination numbers continue to be touted as a percentage of the population covered, he said.With due respect, and “irrespective of the negativity that your party spreads” Vardhan said he takes Singh’s suggestions at face value and with the belief that they are made keeping national interest in mind.“However, it does seem that those who drafted your letter or advised you, have done a great disservice to your standing by misleading you regarding material that is already in public domain,” he said.Highlighting the point in the letter on allowing import of vaccines that have already been approved by credible foreign authorities, Vardhan said a decision on this had already been taken a week ahead of “your suggestion”, on April 11, 2021.The same is the case with your suggestion regarding providing funds and other concessions to augment vaccine manufacturing. This decision had also been taken many days before receipt of your letter and multiple vaccine manufacturing entities have been funded by the government to immediately enhance production.“Anyway, despite such factual inaccuracies, we understand your deep concern for the country and also assure you that we share the same,” the minister said.“We request your continued cooperation in the battle against the pandemic and welcome more such illuminating suggestions. However, as a senior leader, we expect that you shall offer the same advice and wisdom to your own party leaders as well,” Vardhan stated.

Panvel is in Navi Mumbai.The Army’s rolling stock comprises wagons of different types and categories that are normally used to transport heavy vehicles, equipment and personnel.These are owned by the Army and not the Railways.Amidst the unprecedented demand for oxygen at hospitals and healthcare centers, the Railways has decided to run ‘Oxygen Express’ trains over the next few days for ferrying liquid medical oxygen as well as oxygen cylinders across the country.A special “green corridor” is being created for the fast movement of such trains.The Army is also providing a medical team for the 500-bed Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel COVID Hospital set up by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) near the New Delhi airport.

The fact is everybody was complacent.’’Opposing the demand to ban vaccine exports by several Opposition leaders, Jaishankar said he was pushing other countries, particularly some big ones, to keep raw material flowing for vaccines being manufactured in India.“Now ask yourself this question. Can you go around telling others to keep supply chains going but when it comes to the end product, you won’t give the vaccine,’’ he said.The largest vaccine under production in India, he pointed out, is an international product.India had tried its best to live up to the vaccine contractual commitments but as things got tough, “we spoke to world very honestly.’’“They understand that. A complete ban is so short sighted. It is really non-serious people who make that argument. And some are around if you’ve noticed,’’ he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-slows-down-covid-19-vaccine-exports-241278

The state has found a majority of the new infections among people below 45 years of age. Eatala Rajender told the media that he had personally spoken to Union Health Minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan on Sunday seeking vaccination for all above 25. He said the state was hoping the Centre takes a positive decision on the issue. “Youngsters above 25 years form the largest group of Covid infections, and it is our duty to vaccinate them. We are hoping the Centre takes a positive decision on the issue”, he said adding “a sharp spike in cases, amid the second wave of the novel coronavirus youths should be vaccinated at the earliest”. On shortage of Covid vaccines in Telangana, Rajender said that about 2.7 lakh vaccine doses will reach the state anytime as per the promise by the Union Health Minister. “From the beginning, vaccine procurement and distribution is under the control of the Centre and it is up to them to ensure all States receive their share of vaccines in a timely manner. We have the ability to vaccinate 10 lakh persons per day and have urged MOHFW to increase our allotment,” he said while interacting with the press here. Following a video conference between Chief Minister, K Chandrasekhar Rao and Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, the health authorities have ramped-up the Covid vaccination process. “On an average, every day we are vaccinating 1.5 lakh eligible individuals across the State. We are also focusing on achieving 100 percent vaccine coverage for health care and front-line workers,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-bats-for-vaccination-for-all-above-25-241277
19-04-2021||New Delhi||SC stays proceedings before Delhi HC in Amazon Future case||The Supreme Court Monday stayed the ongoing proceedings before the Delhi High Court in the case related to the amalgamation of Future Retail Ltd (FRL) with Reliance Retail.A Bench of Justices R F Nariman, B R Gavai and Hrishikesh Roy posted the matter for hearing on May 4 and directed that all pleadings be completed in the matter.Amazon had moved the apex court on April 8 challenging the Delhi High Court’s Division Bench order that had vacated a stay on Kishore Biyani-led Future Group proceeding with its Rs 24,713 crore asset sale to Reliance Industries.Prior to this, FRL had moved the division bench of the high court against its a single judge’s order upholding the Singapore’s Emergency Arbitrator’s (EA) order restraining FRL from going ahead with its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail to sell its business.The Division Bench had granted Future a reprieve from a March 18 single-judge order that restrained it from taking any steps to sell assets to Reliance.The petition by the US based e-commerce giant has sought a stay on the March 22 order of the division bench, terming it “illegal”, “random”, “inequitable and unfair”.Amazon and Future have been locked in a bitter legal tussle after the US firm dragged Future Group to arbitration at SIAC in October last year, arguing that the latter had violated their contract by entering into the deal with rival Reliance.Amazon had invested in Future Coupons in August 2019 with an option of buying into the flagship Future Retail after a period of three to 10 years.The Future group had however moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking regulatory approvals to the Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance.Amazon had filed a plea before the high court (single judge) for enforcement of the October 25, 2020 Emergency Arbitrator (EA) award by Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) restraining FRL from going ahead with its Rs 24,713 crore deal with Reliance Retail.The high court division bench however said that it was staying the single judge order as FRL was not a party to the share subscription agreement (SSA) between Amazon and Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL) and the US e-commerce giant was not a party to the deal between FRL and Reliance Retail.The bench had further said that it was of the prima facie view that the shareholding agreement (SHA) between FRL and FCPL, the SSA between FCPL and Amazon and the deal between FRL and Reliance Retail “are different” and “therefore, the group of companies doctrine cannot be invoked”.In its suit before the single judge for enforcing the EA award, Amazon had sought to restrain FRL from taking any steps to complete the transaction with entities that are a part of the Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani (MDA) Group.Amazon had also sought detention of the Biyanis, directors of FCPL and FRL and other related parties in civil prison and attaching of their properties for alleged “wilful disobedience” of the EA order.After the SIAC’s EA order, Amazon wrote to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), stock exchanges and CCI, urging them to take into consideration the arbitrator’s interim decision as it is a binding order.FRL thereafter moved the high court to restrain Amazon from writing to Sebi, CCI and other regulators about SIAC’s order, saying it amounts to interfering with the agreement with Reliance.A single judge on December 21 last year had on FRL’s plea passed an interim order allowing Amazon to write to the statutory authorities, but also observed that prima facie it appeared the US e-commerce giant’s attempt to control Future Retail was violative of FEMA and FDI rules.

19-04-2021||New Delhi||SC rejects plea seeking 100 pc matching of VVPAT slips with EVMs vote count||The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a plea seeking 100 per cent matching of the voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) slips with the electronic voting machines (EVMs) vote count in the elections, saying it will not interfere in the middle of poll process.“We are not going to interfere in the middle of election process,” a bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian said.The Assembly election process is on in five states including West Bengal and the counting of votes for all the seats will be held on May 2.The bench asked the counsel appearing for petitioner Gopal Seth whether they had made any representation to the Election Commission (EC) on this.“Yes. They (EC) had appreciated our representation,” the counsel said, adding that free and fair election is a right of the people.He said the petitioner had earlier approached the Calcutta High Court on this issue.The counsel argued the high court had said that the apex court had earlier passed order on this.“The special leave petition is dismissed. As a sequel to the above, pending interlocutory applications, if any, stand disposed of,” the bench said in its order.In April 2019, the apex court had directed the EC to increase random matching of VVPAT slips with EVMs to five polling booths per assembly segment in the Lok Sabha polls and said it would provide greater satisfaction not just to political parties but the entire electorate.Prior to that, the EC followed a system of random counting of VVPAT slips in one polling booth per assembly segment of a Parliamentary or Assembly constituency.The top court had observed in 2019 that it was not doubting the fairness and integrity of the existing electoral process saying, “we are certain that the system ensures accurate electoral results”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-rejects-plea-seeking-100-pc-matching-of-vvpat-slips-with-evms-vote-count-241274
19-04-2021||New Delhi||Make probe agencies go after medicine hoarders instead of political opponents: Cong to Centre||The Congress on Monday said the BJP-led Centre should make probe agencies NIA, CBI and the ED go after black-marketeers and hoarders of medicines used for coronavirus treatment in place of “using them to target political opponents”.This will instil fear in their minds, said Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan.“Strict action should be taken against people hoarding and black marketing vaccines, injections and medicines. The government should bring in the NIA, CBI and the Enforcement Directorate against black-marketeers and hoarders of injections and vaccines.“When you can use them to target your political opponents, why not utilise them sensibly against black-marketeers and hoarders who are today creating all these problems in the country?” he posed.Chavan was also critical of former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis “picketing” a police station along with other BJP leaders when the local police had summoned a pharma company’s top executive over alleged stocking of remdesivir, an anti-viral drug used for coronavirus treatment.The Mumbai police on Saturday night questioned Rajesh Dokania, director of Bruck Pharma, a Daman-based pharmaceutical manufacturing company that manufactures Remdesivir vials, following information that thousands of vials of the Remdesivir drug critical in coronavirus treatment were to be flown out of the country.On learning about it, Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar had rushed to the police station. Their appearance at the police station has triggered a political slugfest between the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government and the opposition party over the paucity of healthcare supplies.“When a person caught by Gujarat police for black marketing of remdesivir is questioned by Mumbai police, Fadnavis gheraos the police station along with some BJP leaders. Do you want to help the public or the black-marketeers,” Chavan asked.“Let us not play politics and let us help the country and people.”              Chavan also demanded that the Centre spells out a plan on vaccine supplies and be transparent about it.“A clear plan about the vaccine supply should be rolled out. Export of vaccines should have been banned earlier. The government should ramp up production and roll out a programme for vaccines and remdesivir. It should make its policy transparent,” the Congress leader said.He said Maharashtra is the worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.“Our state government is fighting it on a war footing and are not playing any politics over it. We sincerely want to fight it on a war footing and expect cooperation from the Central government.”“But, the Centre is acting irresponsibly and have taken the issue politically,” Chavan alleged.About former prime minister Manmohan Singh writing to his successor Narendra Modi suggesting five measures to battle the COVID-19 crisis, Chavan said the suggestions from the opposition should be taken in a positive way.“It was expected that it would be taken in a positive way. But the way (Health Minister) Harsh Vardhan has responded, I think he should apologise. The prime minister should attend to the handling of the COVID situation instead of campaigning in elections,” he said.Hitting back at Manmohan Singh for his critique of the government’s COVID-19 management, Vardhan on Monday alleged the second wave of the pandemic was fuelled by Congress-ruled states as they were busy raising doubts about vaccines rather than vaccinating people.“History shall be kinder to you Dr Manmohan Singh ji if your offer of ‘constructive cooperation’ and valuable advice was followed by your Congress leaders as well in such extraordinary times!” the health minister tweeted.Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said Vardhan’s reply to the former prime minister was “probably the first case of pettiness where he took to name-calling and accusations”.

This time, when there is more need of oxygen, the Centre has taken over all the medical oxygen generator plants and the oxygen distribution network.""There are equal number of COVID-19 cases in Rajasthan and Gujarat. In Gujarat, 1,200 metric tonne oxygen is being supplied, whereas Rajasthan is getting only 124 metric tonne," he claimed."If oxygen is not made available adequately, how will we save lives of people," the minister questioned.Sharma further said that the Rajasthan government has ordered procurement of 1,500 oxygen condensers, which will provide oxygen to 3,000 patients. But more oxygen will be required to fight the disease, he added.The health minister also targeted the Centre over the shortage of vaccines, and said seven lakh vaccine doses are required in the state daily.The Rajasthan government wrote to the prime minister and the Union health minister, after which the state received 14 lakh doses, which will be administered in two days, Sharma said.The state has full storage capacity and a bumper stock of 15 days should be provided which will help it save many lives, he added.Sharma said the shortage of tocilizumab and remdesivir should also be addressed by the Centre.He added that the vaccination against COVID-19 should be opened up for all.The minister appealed to the people to follow lockdown-like restrictions during the "Jan Andolan Pakhwada (Self Discipline Fortnight)" till May 3.From April 1 to 18, over 131 COVID-19 deaths were reported in the state. In the entire month of March, Rajasthan had reported just 31 fatalities.The state recorded 10,242 coronavirus cases and 42 deaths on Sunday.The cumulative tally of positive cases and deaths have increased to 4,14,617 and 3,151, respectively.

Johnson’s forthcoming visit to India towards this month has been cancelled because of New Delhi’s preoccupation with the surge in Covid cases.Johnson had to cancel his January 26 visit because Covid cases at that time had spiked alarmingly in the UK.“In view of the prevailing Covid situation, it has been decided by mutual agreement that the PM of the UK will not visit India next week,” said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).The two sides will be holding a virtual meeting in the coming days to launch plans for a transformed India-UK relationship.“Both leaders attach the highest importance to taking India-UK partnership to its fullest potential and propose to remain in close touch in this regard and look forward to an in-person meeting later in the year,” said the MEA spokesperson.Reuters adds: India is enduring a second wave of the virus, with infections passing the 15 million mark, second only to the United States."(Indian Prime Minister) Narendra Modi and I have basically come to the conclusion that, very sadly, I won’t be able to go ahead with the trip," Johnson told reporters. "I do think it’s only sensible to postpone."Relations with India are seen as a key component of both Britain's post-Brexit ambitions to reinvigorate trade with countries outside the European Union, and a diplomatic push to gain more influence in the Indo-Pacific region."Of course it will be frustrating, but we’ll try and replicate as much as we can remotely, and then look forward to doing it in person as and when circumstances allow, and hopefully before the COP (climate) summit in November, and hopefully we’ll get Narendra Modi over for the G7 in June," Johnson said.Britain has invited India to attend the G7 summit it is hosting in June.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-pm-johnson-cancels-trip-to-india-due-to-coronavirus-worries-241251

All of them were villagers. They were economically weaker and poor. Most of them were women. However, people who understood Gandhi's speech gave donations generously and participated in India's freedom struggle," the professor had recalled.Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa and his cabinet colleagues joined many others in expressing grief over the demise of Venkatasubbaiah."The contribution of Prof GV for the development of Kannada language, its dictionary and literature is unparalleled. He has authored more than 60 books and 'Igo Kannada'. His continuous writing till the end fills one with amazement," the Chief Minister said.Others such as Deputy Chief Minister CN Ashwath Narayan, Rural Development and Panchayat Raj Minister KS Eshwarappa, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, and Mines and Geology Minister Murugesh Nirani also condoled the death.Former chief ministers HD Kumaraswamy and Siddaramaiah also expressed sorrow over the death.

The supply of Covid-19 vaccine doses from the Government of India has been ‘scarce and erratic”, the CM wrote.Banerjee said the population in West Bengal and more particularly in the capital city of Kolkata was extremely high and that an aggressive vaccination programme was the need of the hour. The vaccination programme was suffering due to uncertainties of supply from the Centre, she complained.Pointing out that almost 2.7 crore people had to be vaccinated and 5.4 crore vaccine doses were needed, the CM requested Modi to step in urgently and ensure the requirement of doses was fulfilled at the earliest.Besides vaccination, Banerjee mentioned the supply of essential medicines such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab and the supply of oxygen in West Bengal as two other key issues. She said the supply of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab was extremely scarce, causing grave concern to doctors.“The state needs 6,000 vials of Remdesivir and 1,000 vials of Tocilizumab on a daily basis. Currently, only 1,000 vials of Remdesivir are available in the state daily while there is no fresh supply of Tocilizumab,” Banerjee said, urging the Prime Minister to ensure steady supply of these medicines.“The Steel Authority of India Limiter is meeting our needs and we shall be grateful if you instruct them for ensuring steady supplies,” she wrote. Banerjee also reminded Modi that another letter was addressed to him on February 24, asking him to allow Bengal to purchase vaccine doses directly from state funds and launch a free vaccination campaign. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/didi-writes-to-pm-flags-vax-shortage-240978

The official said the Naxals might use high-tension wires located in various areas in Chhattisgarh for the power supply to various cities and villages.“The Naxals may hook branch lines and place them on likely target grounds in near future as one of their nefarious designs of battle,” he added. The intelligence officials also suspect that the Naxals might as well target low-flying and halted helicopters from their locally improvised rocket launchers. According to them, they might place “booby traps in manners which are never seen before and more and more remote control IEDs may be seen in future”.“Also, the IEDs may have various initiating systems that may use pull, pressure and pressure release mechanisms such as syringe, use of improvised systems made of local wood and vegetation,” the official said.

The officials said cyber fraud gangs had started adopting a new modus operandi to withdraw money from ATMs. Giving details, security agency officials said the fraudsters first tampered with the network (LAN) cable of the ATM and then declined messages from “ATM Switch” were altered to successful cash withdrawal transaction responses, and subsequently cash was withdrawn from the ATM.The banks have been directed to ensure end-to-end encryption in the communication between the “ATM Terminal” or PC and the “ATM Switch”, the officials said, suggesting that the banks should “conceal and physically secure or protect” the network cables, input/output port within the ATM premises. A similar advisory had also been issued by the Reserve Bank of India, they added. — TNSTampering with network||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fraudsters-new-modus-operandi-to-withdraw-money-from-atms-240981

Jaishankar, Qureshi rush to UAE||NEW DELHI, APRIL 18External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi landed in Dubai on Sunday, but both sides insisted they had left their countries at a short notice to separately meet their UAE counterpart and no bilateral between them was planned.Playing mediatorA senior UAE diplomat has owned up to his country’s role in brokering peace between India and Pakistan that began with a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in February. But the talks hit a hurdle after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan walked back on his decision to resume partial trade with India.The UAE is the hub of the “bouncing trade” between India and Pakistan, estimated at several billions of dollars every year. The goods that are prohibited from being traded between the two countries are sent to the UAE, where the label of origin is changed to satisfy both sides.India’s ties with the UAE had improved after the end of the Cold War and have now progressed to the point where both sides are considering a defence relationship.Also read: Qureshi’s visit was the first to be announced on Saturday, followed a few hours later by Jaishankar. Though officials called it a coincidence, sources insisted it was not. Earlier, UAE’s Ambassador to the US Yousef Al Otaiba had said Dubai had played a key role “in bringing Kashmir escalation down and created a ceasefire, hopefully ultimately leading to restoration of diplomatic ties and getting the relationship back to a healthy level”.“They (India and Pakistan) might not sort of become best friends, but at least we want to get it to a level where it is functional… operational… and they are speaking to each other,’’ he added. India always insists that all issues of discord with Pakistan are bilateral in nature and there is no scope for mediation. Jaishankar, while speaking extensively at the recent Raisina Dialogue, had skirted the issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bilateral-jaishankar-qureshi-rush-to-uae-240996

The Delhi Government has now ordered district magistrates to arrange vans for the purpose. The bodies could be seen lying outside mortuaries of many hospitals here with crematoriums’ managers reporting “unimaginable load of last rites”.Testing and tracking remains woefully low with private lab test bookings taking two to three days on an average and people queuing up in hundreds outside several private labs just to get themselves tested.Gayatri Kumar, a South East district resident who tested positive on Wednesday, is yet to be contacted by anyone in the Delhi administration for contact-tracing.“My mother tested positive on Wednesday, but no one from the Delhi administration has contacted our family yet. We are unable to test our mother’s oxygen saturation because medical shops have run out of oximeters and online sale is not before two weeks. Oxygen cylinders are not available anywhere,” said Kavita, Gayatri’s daughter who says her mother’s breathing troubles are compounding.The situation is expected to worsen in the coming days with the Delhi Government today notifying that in the 115 private hospitals where 2,262 ICU beds and 8,561 ward beds had been reserved for Covid-infected, ICU beds had reached 100 per cent capacity and ward beds 90 per cent capacity. New Delhi has been the third highest contributor to daily national Covid load for nearly a week now with cases above 25,000 and deaths above 160 and counting. The capital is just a mirror to the larger health system challenges most cities are today facing.Six patients die due to low-pressure oxygenAt least six Covid-19 patients died in the ICU of Government Medical College Hospital in Madhya Pradesh’s Shahdol late on Saturday night allegedly due to low pressure in the medical oxygen supply. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/positivity-rate-doubles-to-16-in-12-days-health-infrastructure-reels-under-severe-stress-240999

Four of these plants are in Himachal Pradesh, three in Chandigarh and one each in Punjab and Haryana.The announcement came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the availability of life-saving medical equipment and drugs for Covid-19.“As many as 162 PSA oxygen plants have been sanctioned for installation in public health facilities in all states. These will augment medical oxygen capacity by 154.19 metric tonne.

We must resist the temptation to look at the absolute numbers being vaccinated and focus instead on the percentage of the population vaccinated.”India has so far administered 12,25,02,790 vaccine doses, including 10.63 crore first doses (which is less than 10 per cent for a population of over 130 crore).The former PM demanded that the government should publicise the vaccine dose orders placed with companies over the next six months. “If we want to vaccinate a target number in this period, we should place enough orders in advance so that producers can adhere to an agreed schedule of supply.”He also asked for indications on how the expected supply would be distributed to states transparently and advised the Centre to retain 10 per cent doses for emergency needs and send the rest to states with clear signals of the likely availability so that the states could plan the rollout.Urging flexibility for states to define frontline workers below 45 years who could be vaccinated, the former PM wrote, “States may want to designate schoolteachers, drivers, municipal and panchayat staff, and possibly lawyers, who have to attend courts as frontline workers. They can then be vaccinated even if they are below 45 years.”He called for proactive support from the government to vaccine producers to expand manufacturing facilities. Citing Israel, which has invoked compulsory licensing to produce vaccines, he wrote: “It is time for India to do the same so that a number of companies are able to produce the vaccines under a licence.”The former PM also advocated import clearance to foreign-made jabs approved by credible regulators (the Centre has already done this) without insisting on domestic bridging trials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ramp-up-vaccine-drive-manmohan-to-pm-narendra-modi-241004

Vistara's flights on Delhi-Hong Kong route had earlier been banned from April 6 to April 19.Vistara did not respond to PTI's request for a statement on the matter.  A record single-day rise of 2,61,500 coronavirus infections has taken India's case tally to 1,47,88,109, while active cases have surpassed the 18-lakh mark, according to Union Health Ministry data updated on Sunday.The death toll increased to 1,77,150 with a record 1,501 new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am showed.

She had taken a three-year study leave for doing a super-specialty course in surgery and as per rules, was required to serve for at least 11 years after completion of the course, which was till 2028.The AFT did not accept her contention that since she was willing to refund the expenses incurred by the government on her super specialization during the study leave, the army cannot refuse to grant her pre-mature retirement. She had also averred that she had genuine reasons for seeking pre-mature retirement which were rejected arbitrarily.The army contended that seeking pre-mature retirement is not a right by only an option to seek permission for re-mature retirement is available to an officer. In this case, the competent authority did not deem it appropriate to grant permission keeping in view organizational requirements and administrative factors.The AFT said that as per the terms and conditions of study leave, once a candidate has submitted an application for grant of leave and thereafter gives an undertaking for service liability and pursues the study course, the competent authority, while considering the application for pre-mature retirement is required to take note of service exigencies and other administrative requirements,||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pre-mature%C2%A0retirement-not-a-right-but-subject-to-service-exigencies-rules-aft-240874
19-04-2021||London||UK Opposition joins calls for Boris Johnson to cancel India visit over new Covid variant||Britain’s Opposition Labour Party on Sunday joined calls for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to cancel his visit to India, starting next Sunday, amid growing concerns of a new variant of COVID-19 detected in the country.Public Health England (PHE) has said 77 cases of the so-called “double mutant” Indian variant have been detected in the UK since last month and that it has now been classed as a Variant Under Investigation (VUI).Downing Street had earlier confirmed a much shorter schedule for the UK prime minister’s visit, with the bulk of the programme, including talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, set for a day-long agenda on Monday, April 26.“I can’t see why the prime minister can’t conduct his business with the Indian government via Zoom,” said Labour’s Shadow Communities Secretary Steve Reed.“The prime minister, like all of us in public life, needs to try and set an example. I’d much rather the prime minister did it by Zoom rather than travelling to India,” he told ‘Sky News’, when asked if the visit should go ahead next week.A government minister, meanwhile, stressed that there is no evidence the Indian variant can evade vaccine protection or that it is more contagious.“I’m told there is no evidence at the moment this particular variant is able to get around the vaccine or...that it is necessarily more contagious than the others – but we are looking at it, it will be studied,” said Environment Secretary George Eustice.The variant – officially named B.1.617 – is believed to be almost certainly playing a part in the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in India and a major spike in infection rates. It has sparked concerns among academics and sections of the UK media, who have called for India to be added to the “red list”, which involves stricter travel restrictions with a compulsory 10-day hotel quarantine for anyone returning to the UK from such countries.Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, is among those who said that he finds it “mystifying” and “slightly confounding” that India is not yet on the red list and that those flying into the UK from there are not subjected to the compulsory hotel quarantine.“I think we should be terribly concerned about it,” Prof Altmann told the BBC.Meanwhile, speculation is rife that India has been kept off the red list to allow Johnson’s visit to go ahead, even though cut short, and to ensure that India-UK trade negotiations are on track ahead of India’s negotiations with the European Union (EU).Downing Street has said designations under the red list, which currently covers around 40 countries, are kept “under constant review” and so far the message is that the visit will go ahead in its shortened version.“As with all the prime minister’s visits, his trip to India will prioritise the safety of those involved. All elements of the visit will be Covid secure,” the prime minister’s spokesperson said.A lot is riding on the visit, previously postponed from a Republic Day tour in January, as the first major bilateral visit for Johnson outside Europe since the UK general election in December 2019 and the conclusion of the Brexit transition period at the end of December 2020. The priority is for both sides to agree to a ‘Roadmap 2030’, a plan for the next decade to pave the way to a free trade agreement (FTA) in future.

19-04-2021||New Delhi||Trains to transport oxygen, industrial plants divert supply as active Covid cases cross 18 lakh in India||Seeking to address the shortage of medical oxygen as active COVID-19 patients surpassed the 18-lakh mark, the Centre on Sunday said it has expedited installation of 162 PSA oxygen generation plants in health facilities across the country, while the Railways announced special trains to transport the life-saver and several industry majors pitched in by diverting supply to hospitals.As a record single-day rise of 2,61,500 coronavirus infections took India’s total tally of COVID-19 cases to 1,47,88,109, authorities in the worst-hit states admitted they were running short of beds, ventilators and medicines.Union Minister Harsh Vardhan said all possible support is being extended to states to double production of Remdesivir drug, ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen and COVID-19 vaccines, besides enhancing healthcare infrastructure.The setting up of 162 PSA oxygen plants in public health facilities is being expedited and a 24X7 cell is coordinating with the states, he said.Read also: 3,000 Remdesivir injections seized from HP’s Baddi, 6 held“These will augment medical oxygen capacity by 154.19 MT,” the health ministry tweeted.The PSA plants manufacture oxygen and help hospitals become self-sufficient in their requirement for medical oxygen, while also reducing the burden on the national grid for its supply of medical oxygen.Earlier, the ministry had decided to float a tender for the import of 50,000 MT of medical oxygen.The Railways said it will run ‘Oxygen Express’ trains over the next few days to transport liquid medical oxygen and oxygen cylinders across the country.“Since the first empty tankers will move on April 19, we hope to begin operations of Oxygen Express over the next few days. We would be able to send oxygen wherever there is such demand. A green corridor is being created for fast movement of Oxygen Express trains,” an official said.Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra governments had approached the Railways Ministry to explore whether liquid medical oxygen tankers could be moved by the rail network, officials said.The country’s largest steel-maker SAIL, Tata Steel and ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AMNS India) said they were supplying medical oxygen to health facilities.“Responding to the national urgency, we are supplying 200-300 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen daily to various state governments and hospitals. We are in this fight together and will surely win it! @PMOIndia @TataCompanies,” Tata Steel said in a tweet.“@SAILsteel supplied more than 33,300 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen (#LMO) of 99.7 percent purity of #Oxygen for #COVIDRelief from its integrated steel plants,” SAIL said on Twitter.According to the steel ministry, 28 oxygen plants located in the steel facility of both public and private sectors are supplying about 1,500 tonnes of medical oxygen every day.Also, an additional stock of 30,000 MT, including the safety stock, is being made available for medical use.The positivity rate has doubled in the last 12 days to 16.69 per cent and  10 states—Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan—reported 78.56 per cent of the new infections, the health ministry said.Maharashtra and Delhi, which are among the worst hit, have already sounded the Centre on the shortage of beds, oxygen, medicines and COVID vaccine.At least six COVID-19 patients died in the ICU of a government hospital in Madhya Pradesh’s Shahdol allegedly due to low pressure in the medical oxygen supply, according to a hospital official.The incident occurred at the Government Medical College Hospital (GMCH) on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday. However, the district administration denied that these deaths were caused due to the “shortage of oxygen”.Over 25,000 more people tested COVID-19 positive in the last 24 hours in the national capital and less than 100 ICU beds remain available in hospitals, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, highlighting the grim situation.Kejriwal said he spoke to Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday morning and stressed the need for more beds for the COVID patients. He said he had requested the Centre to reserve at least 7,000 of 10,000 beds in hospitals run by it in Delhi as COVID beds and ensure immediate supply of oxygen.Currently, only 1,800 of 10,000 central government hospital beds are reserved for COVID-19 patients, he said.The Northern Railways has deployed 50 isolation coaches, each having two oxygen cylinders, at Delhi’s Shakur Basti railway station and 25 such facilities will be placed at Anand Vihar by Monday, General Manager Ashutosh Gangal said.Similar facilities were being provided in Maharashtra and other states.Engineering entrance exam JEE-Mains scheduled to be held from April 27-30 has been postponed in view of the COVID-19 situation, Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ announced, days after the CBSE Class 10 Board exams were cancelled and Class 12 exams were deferred. Several state boards have subsequently postponed their exams.The COVID crisis has prompted states to further tighten restrictions, besides imposing weekend lockdown.Maharashtra Home Minister Dilip Walse Patil warned of action against those violating the restrictions imposed by the state government to contain the spread of COVID-19.The state reported a new daily high of 68,631 COVID-19 cases  on Sunday, while 503 deaths pushed the toll to 60,473.The tough new measures, which exclude essential services, came into force on Wednesday night and will remain in force till 7 AM on May 1.Section 144 of CrPC, prohibiting the assembly of five or more people at a spot, will remain in force during the period.Registering a steady increase for the 39th day in a row, the active cases stand at 18,01,316, while the national COVID-19 recovery rate has dropped to 86.62 per cent, the union Health ministry said.“The daily positivity rate in the last 12 days has doubled from 8 per cent to 16.69 per cent,” the health ministry said in a statement. “The national weekly positivity rate has increased from 3.05 per cent to 13.54 per cent in the last one month.”The cumulative recoveries have surged to 1,28,09,643 after 1,38,423 more people recuperated.Meanwhile, India took 92 days to reach the mark of 12-crore vaccinations, the fastest country to do so.It is followed by the US which took 97 days and China which took 108 days.

19-04-2021||New Delhi||Vaccine ramp-up key to Covid fight: Manmohan writes to PM Modi||Former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday wrote to his successor Narendra Modi to convey his suggestions on COVID management.Singh saught flexibility for states to define vaccine eligibility for frontline staff below 45 years, which could include teachers and lawyers, and urged the government to focus on the percentage of people vaccinated rather than the absolute numbers.In a two-page letter to Modi, Singh said a big part of India’s COVID management would have to be ramping up the vaccine programme, which was the key to pandemic response.“There are many things we must do to fight the epidemic but a big part of this effort must be ramping up the vaccination programme,” Singh said.Listing detailed suggestions, Singh demanded the government make public the vaccine dose orders placed with companies and deliveries promised over the next six months.“The government should publicise what are the firm orders for doses placed on different vaccine producers and accepted for delivery over the next six months. If we want to vaccinate a target number in this period, we should place enough orders in advance so that producers can adhere to an agreed schedule of supply,” said Singh.He said the government should also indicate how this expected to supply will be distributed across states based on a transparent formula.“The central government could retain 10 per cent for distribution based on emergency needs, but other than that, states should have a clear signal of likely availability so that they can plan their rollout,” the ex-PM said.In a major suggestion, Singh urged the PM that states be given some flexibility to define categories of frontline workers who can be vaccinated even if they are below 45 years of age.“States may want to designate school teachers, bus, three-wheeler and taxi drivers, municipal and panchayat staff, and possibly lawyers who have to attend Courts as frontline workers. They can then be vaccinated even if they are below 45 years,” suggested Singh.Articulating the broader sentiment of the Congress Working Committee which met on Saturday to talk about the COVID surge the former PM sought that the Government proactively support vaccine producers to expand their manufacturing facilities quickly by providing funds and other concessions.Citing Israel, which has invoked compulsory licensing provisions to produce COVID vaccines, Singh said it was time for India to do the same so that several companies can produce the vaccines under a licence.Advocating import clearance to foreign-made jabs approved by credible regulators (something the Centre has already done) without insisting on domestic bridging trials, Singh said this relaxation is justified in an emergency and could be for a limited period during which the bridging trials could be completed in India.“The key to our fight against Covid 19 must be ramping up the vaccination effort. We must resist the temptation to look at the absolute numbers being vaccinated, and focus instead on the percentage of the population vaccinated,” the ex-PM cautioned.India has so far administered 12,25,02,790 vaccine doses, of which 10.63 crores are first doses.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vaccine-ramp-up-key-to-covid-fight-manmohan-writes-to-pm-modi-240841

Both vaccines are being given in two doses in a gap of up to eight weeks.Bharat Biotech has proposed a booster dose after six months of the second dose.Talking about the applicability and effectiveness of a third dose, especially in view of the raging second COVID-19 wave, experts said the third booster dose needs more studies to determine if it will help in fighting infections more effectively.Samiran Panda, Director of the ICMR National AIDS Research Institute, said if the companies are deciding on giving a third booster dose after two doses then it should be based upon data on immunological memory.This means that after two doses what is the status of antibody concentration and after how long it comes below a level after which one needs the third booster dose, he said.“I wonder why the companies are suggesting this and what is the data because COVID-19 we came to know in December 2019 and the vaccines were made in April and August. So we don’t have enough data and I think the proposal for third dose is based on a conjecture rather than the time that needs to lapse after which we will have data on how many shots are needed. So time has not come as yet,” Panda told PTI.He said now when these companies are talking about boosters there comes the question what would these boosters do.“These boosters are suppose to boost up the immunity to tackle the dwindling concentration of antibodies. It has been found that after 6-9 months the concentration of the antibody comes down but that was mostly in natural infections,” Panda said.“For vaccination, how long does it take to come down is not known because the vaccination drive recently started it has not been even five months,” he said.India launched its vaccination drive against COVID-19 on January 16 and the health ministry on Saturday said that  so far 12,25,02,790 doses have been administered.Dr Giridhara R Babu, professor and the Head of lifecourse epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India, said one needs to study and see if the booster dose will help in fighting the disease more effectively.“How long the protection lasts, based on that it needs to be decided when a booster has to be given. One needs to study and see if the boosters will help in fighting the disease more effectively,” he said.Another healthcare expert said the third dose may play a crucial role in future but at present,  there is not enough data to support this claim.“Like flu shots, one might need the booster shots every year but it is too soon to make that assumption as the disease (COVID-19) itself is very new and it has not even been a year since the vaccines have come out. We need more data and study,” the expert said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-need-of-3rd-booster-dose-based-more-upon-conjecture-than-data-say-experts-240829
