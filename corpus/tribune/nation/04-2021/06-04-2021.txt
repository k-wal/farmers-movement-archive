06-04-2021||New Delhi||Gundecha Brothers accused of sexual harassment: BBC||Dhrupad maestros the Gundecha brothers have been accused of sexual harassment and assault by female students of their school, Dhrupad Sansthan in Madhya Pradesh, as per a BBC investigation.BBC said Monica's name has been changed to protect her identity because she fears reprisal. But she is keen to share her story. She alleges that she was raped by the late Ramakant Gundecha, a famous classical Indian musician, while she was a student at his school, Dhrupad Sansthan, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.Gundecha died in November 2019 but he and his brothers, Umakant and Akhilesh, have since been accused of sexual harassment and assault by female students of the music school.Over the course of a three-month investigation, the BBC has heard multiple allegations against all three Gundecha brothers. Umakant and Akhilesh deny the allegations, the report said.Ramakant was and Umakant still is a famous exponent of Dhrupad, one of the oldest genres of Hindustani music, while Akhilesh is a percussionist. In 2012, Ramakant and Umakant received the Padma Shri, India's fourth-highest civilian award for their contribution to music.The report said Dhrupad Sansthan, the prestigious school they founded and taught at, has attracted hundreds of students, foreign and Indian, from across the globe. It claims to have accreditation from Unesco's Intangible Cultural Heritage Committee. But the Unesco told the BBC that it had no links to the school and said it will be sending a 'cease and desist' notice demanding the withdrawal of such claims.BBC said the allegations against the brothers have sent shockwaves through the classical music world, where they enjoy fame and status. The allegations have also shone a spotlight on an ancient tradition, the guru-shishya parampara—an informal contract by which the student is usually expected to completely surrender to the will of the teacher.Allegations against the three brothers range from sharing flirtatious and sexually suggestive messages to exposing themselves during class to molestation, and, in the case of Ramakant, even rape, the report said.As per the report, Monica said she was in her first week at the school when she began receiving inappropriate WhatsApp messages from Ramakant. She alleged that one evening he drove her to a dark car park and molested her in the backseat of his car."He started kissing me. I pushed him away but he kept trying," she said. "He touched my body and tried to unclothe me. At that time, I realised I was not moving. I was like a stone. At one point he realised that I was not responding. So he asked me, should I drop you back at the school? But I couldn't even reply." The report mentioned that Monica said she wanted to erase the memory of the incident. She didn't leave the school immediately because she loved the music and was keen to pursue it further. She had left her job and invested all her money to study at the school.But then three months later, she alleged, Ramakant raped her. "[He] entered the room, pulled my pants off and forcefully had sex with me. And when he had finished he just left. I went to the door and bolted it. And for three days, I didn't eat," she said.The report said Sarah, another student at the school, whose name has also been changed, told the BBC that she was molested by Akhilesh Gundecha."I got sick when I was there and was hospitalised," she said. "Akhilesh came to take me back to the school. He sat next to me in the car and started touching my hands. I pulled them away. It felt very strange." In total, five women told the BBC they had witnessed abuse and harassment on the Dhrupad Sansthan campus. Some said that when they rebuffed sexual advances from Ramakant Gundecha, he lost interest in teaching them. They also alleged that if a student complained, she was often publicly humiliated in class.BBC said Rachel, who didn't want to remain anonymous, said she had found the strength to speak up now, several years later, only after similar allegations came to light in a Facebook post shared by a group called 'Dhrupad Family Europe' in September 2020.As per the report, through their lawyers, both Akhilesh and Umakant Gundecha denied all of these allegations, stating that "vested interests" from outside the student community were trying to "further their agenda of causing damage to the art and reputation of the Gundecha Brothers and Dhrupad Sansthan".But the charges are also being investigated by an internal complaints committee over the last four months.BBC said students say the committee at Dhrupad Sansthan was formed only after they put pressure on the school. Former students, who are part of a support group for the survivors, have also alleged that they have received threats on multiple occasions for speaking out in support. Survivors are bound by law not to disclose the results of the investigation.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gundecha-brothers-accused-of-sexual-harassment-bbc-235493

06-04-2021||Mumbai||AAP urges Maharashtra govt to withdraw curbs on restaurants, shops||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday appealed to the Maharashtra government to withdraw the order to shut shops and restaurants as part of the curbs to check the spread of coronavirus.The party’s state unit has written to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, urging him to withdraw the government order to shut shops and businesses under the new ‘break the chain’ protocol.The closure of retail outlets breaks the back of the economy, as their operation is a part of the chain that sustains, not only businesses and their employees, but also transport and manufacturing companies, the letter stated.The radical lockdown decision taken by the state government is expected to have an economic impact of Rs 40,000 crore, it stated.Hotels, trade and transport sectors in the state are being expected to bear the brunt of this damage, which will force many businesses to fire workers, incur unbearable losses, and ultimately, shut their shops permanently, the party said.Daily-wage workers and small-scale vendors will not be able to bear the damaging impact of this new policy, given that their livelihoods are yet to recover from the 2020 lockdown.The state cannot afford more economic losses, and hence, the government must deliberate with the Industry Association of Retailers and Restaurateurs, and come up with more viable solutions, like odd/even, ticketed entries to crowded markets, moving hawkers to playgrounds and maidans to decongest the markets, etc, the party said.“We look forward to the government’s action to save our local businesses and economy,” AAP Mumbai in-charge Preeti Sharma Menon said.

06-04-2021||New Delhi||Saving Great Indian Bustard; SC asks why high tension electric cables cannot be undergrounded||The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Centre, Rajasthan and Gujarat governments why high tension electricity cables could not be laid underground to save critically endangered Great Indian Bustard (GIB), the heaviest flying bird on the planet.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde also reserved its verdict on a plea of Ranjitsinh, a retired IAS officer and others, seeking court’s directions for an urgent emergency response plan to protect and ensure recovery of numbers of GIB and Lesser Florican (LF).The bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, was told by the Central Power Ministry that there was technical problem in undergrounding the high voltage electric cables.The ministry said it is not done in other parts of the world as well.“You tell us why the high voltage line cannot be undergrounded,” the bench observed.Senior advocate Shyam Divan, appearing for the former IAS officer, referred  to various apex court’s judgements and reports and said that the principle that polluters should pay can be applied in the instant case and money can be arranged for taking steps to save the endangered birds.“Our approach should be eco-centric and not human-centric and other species also have the right to live,” he said, adding that the GIB is the “heaviest flying bird on the planet” and India being their habitat has a great responsibility towards the world at large to ensure their survival.Divan also asserted that even high tension electricity cables can be laid underground as done in other parts of the world.Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, appearing for the Centre, said that she would be assisting the bench as Attorney General K K Venugopal has quarantined himself after one of the reatives of his staffers has tested positive for COVID-19.She referred to the affidavits of the Centre and said that the government was not adversarial to the litigation and was putting the fact that undergrounding of high tension electric cables was technically not feasible.Earlier, the top court had expressed concern over death by electrocution of the endangered birds and had said it may consider ordering low tension electricity cables to be laid underground in Rajasthan and Gujarat and installation of bird diverters at certain places to save them.The bird diverters are flaps installed on power lines and they work as reflectors for bird species like GIB which can spot them from a distance of about 50 meters and change their path of flight to avoid collision with power lines.“In principle, we see the importance of making the (electricity) lines underground, but we cannot order undergrounding of all the cables,” the bench had said while taking note of the views of the Centre.Earlier, the apex court had sought to know the views of  Venugopal on laying of underground cables and source of its funding for protecting the endangered birds—the GIB and Lesser Florican (LF).The top court had asked Venugopal to not think on commercial lines and explore the possibility of funds for laying underground cables from Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).It was hearing a plea for installation of bird diverters and laying underground cables to protect two endangered native birds—the Great Indian Bustard and the Lesser Florican.    On July 15, 2019, the court had taken serious note of alarming extinction of the GIB and the LF and constituted a high powered committee to urgently frame and implement an emergency response plan for the protection of these species.        It had constituted a three-member panel comprising Director of Bombay Natural History Society; Asad R Rahmani, former Director of Bombay Natural History Society and Dhananjai Mohan, Chief Conservator of Forests of Uttarakhand.  Later, three more members were added in the panel as suggested by the petitioner.It had sought responses from the Centre and state governments including Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, where these two species of birds are prominently found, on a plea of wildlife activists.Ranjitsinh, a retired IAS officer and others had sought the court’s directions for an urgent emergency response plan to protect and recovery of both bird species. He has served as the director of Wildlife Protection and contended in his plea that over the last 50 years the population of the GIB has recorded a decline of over 82 per cent, falling from an estimated 1,260 in 1969, to 100-150 in 2018.   “The population of the Lesser Florican (also known as the likh or kharmore) has seen a sharp decline of 80 per cent over the past few decades, from 3,530 individuals recorded in 1999, to less than 700 individuals in 2018,” the plea said.  It added that both the birds are protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 but despite being accorded the highest level of protection under national law; the birds face the threat of imminent extinction.The plea blamed various reasons for the threats faced by the two endangered birds including—mortality by collision with infrastructure, particularly power lines and wind turbines, depletion of grasslands, hunting, development of mines and human habitation in and around their habitats and ingestion of pesticides. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/saving-great-indian-bustard-sc-asks-why-high-tension-electric-cables-cannot-be-undergrounded-235485
06-04-2021||New Delhi||SCWLA moves SC for appointment of meritorious women as HC judges||Complaining about poor representation of women in higher judiciary, the Supreme Court Women Lawyers’ Association (SCWLA) on Tuesday moved the top court seeking consideration of “meritorious” woman advocates for appointment as high court judges.Giving a chart of women judges presently posted in various high courts, SCWLA complained about "abysmally low" 11.04 per cent share of women as judges in higher judiciary. “From the chart it is reflected that, from the 1079 of sanctioned strength of judges (including both Permanent and Additional Judges) we have 661 number of judges out of which, only 73 number are women judges which accounts for a 11.04 of women judges,” SCWLA submitted.In ‘M/s PLR Projects Pvt Ltd versus Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd’, the top court has been dealing with the issue of unfilled vacancies of judges in high courts. Seeking to intervene in the matter, SCWLA urged the court to make it a party in the case pending before a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde. “Since independence till date, there have been only eight (08) women judges appointed in the Supreme Court out of total 247 judges appointed from 1950 till as on date (2020),” it said, adding, currently Justice Indira Banerjee was the lone woman judge in the Supreme Court.It has sought a direction to “consider meritorious women lawyers practicing in Supreme Court and High Courts for appointment of judges in High Courts”. The plea has also sought a direction to the Centre to incorporate in Memorandum of procedures (MOP) the provisions and consideration of appointment of women judges in high courts. “To issue an appropriate order/direction to the Secretary, Department of Justice, Ministry of Law & Justice, government of India to expedite the process of inclusion and appointment of women judges on meritorious ground to the respective Supreme Court and High Court Benches,” it said.Referring to constitutional provisions on equality, SCWLA said the higher judiciary should have adequate representation for women after giving due weightage to the merit. “The women's participation in the justice delivery system is an important factor for societal progress and gender equality,” it said, referring to the concern expressed by Attorney General KK Venugopal on gender gap in higher judiciary.“Improving the representation of women could also go a long way towards a more balanced and empathetic approach in cases involving sexual violence,” it said. On March 25, the top court had said the Centre should respond to the Collegium’s recommendations within a reasonable time frame.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scwla-moves-sc-for-appointment-of-meritorious-women-as-hc-judges-235480

The need for enhanced #climatefinance, technology transfer, and capacity building was also acknowledged by both sides.“The Finance Minister stressed on the need for assessment of the $100 billion commitment per year from developed countries to developing countries.

06-04-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||Despite US disapproval, India and Russia for hi-tech weapons manufacturing||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 6Far from being dissuaded from the US threat to impose sanctions, New Delhi and Moscow discussed the additional production of Russian military equipment under PM Modi’s make-in-India initiative, said visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov after meeting his counterpart S Jaishankar here on Tuesday.Noting that Russia is the only partner that transfers cutting-edge military technology to India, Lavrov said talks touched on manufacturing of state-of-the-art weapon systems.“In this strategically important area, Russia is a major foreign contractor for New Delhi. I am sure deepening of Russian Indian military cooperation serves the national interest of both countries,” said Lavrov.Denying that he had said US exercises pressure on India, Lavrov said there were no discussions on statements from the US against arms trade with Russia.In a departure from top US officials advising India to cut down on arms purchases from Russia, Lavrov said Moscow respected the right of India to diversify ties in these areas. Both sides also touched on cooperation in energy, including nuclear, peaceful exploration of space and manned programs, rocket engine building, satellite navigation, the Russian Far East and the Arctic.Fresh from a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi last month, Lavrov said though Russia-China relations at the summit-level are at their highest levels in history; there are no discussions on a military alliance. Whether it was a Russia-China military alliance or talks of a Middle East NATO or an Asian NATO, “we believe it is counterproductive. Our Indian friends have the same position,” he observed.Lavrov hinted that in addition to an in-person summit of BRICS leaders in India next month, Moscow was also encouraging the idea of a Russia-India-China summit.  In a pre-visit interview, he said Russia was closely watching the process of normalisation at the LAC and welcomed the agreements reached after the Jaishankar-Wang Yi telephone conversation on February 25 aimed at resolution of the situation.Afghanistan was a major area of discussions between the two Foreign Ministers as were other “thorny issues” in the neighbourhood such as Yemen, Syria and Iran. Lavrov described India as a “key player” for a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan and “definitely should be engaged in international efforts supporting Afghan national reconciliation process”.Jaishankar, back from Heart of Asia – Istanbul Process conference in Dushanbe last week, said he stated that a durable peace would require harmonising interests of all, both within and around that country.Jaishankar said the agenda of discussions also included UNSC issues, Myanmar, ASEAN and the Indo-Pacific. Larger backdrop of global political changes provided the context, he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/despite-us-disapproval-india-and-russia-for-hi-tech-weapons-manufacturing-235476

But lockdown-like restrictions for the remaining five days of the week has led to unrest among people,” Fadnavis stated in the letter.Some groups are on the streets to protest against these curbs, he said, adding that issues of several stake holders hadn’t been considered while imposing these restrictions.“Due to the undeclared lockdown, retailers, small businesses and salons will be affected,” he said.It is important to check the pandemic, but at the same time, there shouldn’t be a time where a question gets raised about the livelihood of people, the leader of opposition said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fadnavis-writes-to-maharashtra-cm-about-unrest-over-covid-19-curbs-235475

Otherwise, the COVID-19 situation will go out of hand.May be three-four days of curfew or lockdown can be imposed to check the situation at the moment,” Chief Justice Nath said during an online hearingAdvocate General Kamal Trivedi informed the bench that the state government was in a “Catch-22” situation about the lockdown.Chief Justice Nath noted that the night curfew, imposed from between 9 pm to 6 am in four major cities of Gujarat, was not proving to be effective.“You can always open it after three-four days of curfew. But, this curfew will help, I think. Like, initially in March 2020, there was a curfew for two days, three days,” Chief Justice Nath said.To break the chain of the viral infection, Justice Karia also suggested that the government should limit the number of employees coming to offices or commercial establishments “so that less number of people come in contact” with each other.Trivedi said he will take instructions from the state government and revert.“Day before yesterday, the government was seriously thinking about imposing a lockdown. But, there were views that a lockdown is likely to cause misery to the poor people,” the advocate general said.“So, the government is in a ‘Catch-22’ situation. We are trying our level best,” he informed the bench. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-spike-gujarat-hc-suggests-lockdown-for-short-period-235471
06-04-2021||Mumbai||India’s economic recovery still shallow, month’s lockdown can dent GDP by 2 pc: Report||India’s economic recovery is still “shallow” and a month’s national lockdown to curb the rising pace of COVID-19 infections can dent the GDP by up to 2 per cent, an American brokerage warned on Tuesday.Analysts at BofA Securities said there has been a six times increase in the number of infections to over 1.03 lakh, and state governments have responded with localised lockdowns till now.A national lockdown, which it reckoned as a “last resort”, if declared, can have deep impact on the growth process, which is still “shallow”, it said.“We grow even more concerned that rising Covid-19 cases pose a risk to our still shallow recovery...We estimate that a month of national lockdown costs 100-200 bps of annual GDP. Needless to say, this also aggravates fiscal risks,” it said.The country was kept under a lockdown to arrest the spread of COVID-19 infections last fiscal, which is going to be the primary reason for an over 7 per cent contraction in GDP. Analysts are expecting a double-digit GDP growth in FY22 on the base effect.The brokerage said the infections have crossed the peak and warned that the pace of rise in cases is picking up.In 2020, it took three months for cases to rise from 10,000 levels in mid-June to 90,000 levels in mid-September, whereas in this round, it has taken only six weeks.Overall testing continues to be far from adequate, it said, making it clear that the infections have not risen due to a jump in testing per se.The death rates are mercifully lower, it said, explaining that the 478 fatalities recorded on Monday were 42 per cent lower than what was observed when the daily cases were at the peak of 97,000.“Given the high economic cost, we expect the Centre and State governments to try to contain the spread with the tightening of Covid-19 regulations, night curfews and localized lockdowns,” it said.“It remains to be seen if this second wave of Covid 19 cases subsides without a national level lockdown,” it added.In its base case, the brokerage continues to see a 9 per cent jump in the real gross value added growth for FY22, but there can be a 3 percentage point impact to the estimate in case of a national lockdown, it warned.

06-04-2021||Raipur||Elusive Maoist leader Hidma in spotlight after latest attack||Dreaded Maoist leader Madvi Hidma has emerged as the mastermind of the last weekend’s massacre of 22 security personnel by Naxals in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region and the audacious attack has brought him into the limelight once again.Last Saturday’s operation by security forces was aimed at cornering Hidma, but unfortunately it proved to be a meticulously planned trap that culminated in heavy casualties for the CRPF and the state police along the border of Sukma and Bijapur districts.An elusive figure, Hidma is a top leader of the outlawed Naxal outfit CPI (Maoist) and has been on the radar of security agencies for many years.According to police, Hidma heads the Peoples Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) battalion no. 1, the strongest military formation of the rebels in Dandakaranya which covers parts of Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Telangana and Maharashtra besides the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh.At a time when the activities of rebels in the Bastar region were appearing to be on the wane, Hidma hit back in a brutal fashion to make his presence felt and prove that the armed movement was very much alive in Chhattisgarh.Believed to be the chief architect of various deadly attacks on security forces in Chhattisgarh in the past decade and beyond, Hidma is being blamed for the April 3 ambush in the Bastar region which left 22 CRPF and police personnel dead and 31 others injured.Tekalguda village, where Maoists ambushed security forces, is just 6 km away from Puvarti, believed to be the native village of Hidma.His age and looks are still a matter of speculation with security agencies suggesting he is around 45 years old.They just have a bundle of old photos of a young man who they believe is Hidma.He is also a member of the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) of Maoists which has been instrumental in carrying out several deadly attacks on security forces in south Bastar.Hidma joined the Naxal movement in the late 1990s as a ground-level organiser.He came under the scanner of security agencies for the first time after the 2010 Tadmetla attack in Chhattisgarh wherein 76 troopers were killed.He had then assisted another dreaded Maoist leader Papa Rao in executing the attack. Since then, his name crops up every time there is a major attack on security forces in Bastar.Well trained in guerrilla warfare, Hidma carries an AK-47 rifle and his cadres are equipped with sophisticated weapons. A four-layered ring of armed cadres around him has kept him away from the reach of security forces.For the last few years, security forces have been consistently carrying out intelligence-based operations in interiors of Bijapur and Sukma to target him, a police officer said.However, his deep knowledge of the forested area and tough terrain have helped him to avoid getting caught, the officer said.However, recent operations by security forces in the core areas of Maoists have created immense pressure on senior leaders, including Hidma, he said.Hidma has developed an image of a hero among his cadres and eliminating him would be a major step towards weakening the Maoist movement in Bastar, the officer said.Hidma has been named in a slew of major Naxal strikes, including the Jhiram valley attack in Darbha, Bastar in 2013 that killed frontline senior Congress leaders like Mahendra Karma, Nand Kumar Patel and V C Shukla.Another strike bearing his imprint was the Burkapal ambush of April 2017 that claimed the lives of 24 CRPF personnel.Accused of murder of several security personnel, Hidma, who carries a cash reward of Rs 40 lakh in Chhattisgarh, mostly confines himself to the south Sukma region which is his base area, the officials said.His wife Raje is also an active member of the CPI (Maoist) and has been linked to several major Maoist strikes, they said.

06-04-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Sabarimala triggers heated debate on election day in Kerala||The Sabarimala women's entry issue, one of the major poll planks of the opposition UDF and the NDA against the ruling LDF during the campaign, took centre stage of debate even on Tuesday, the day of the assembly election, in Kerala as major leaders locked horns over the matter.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said Lord Ayyappa, the presiding deity at the Sabarimala, and all other gods are with the LDF government which has worked for the welfare of people.Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala in his reaction said the Left government would surely face the wrath of the Lord Ayyyppa and his devotees in this election.Lashing out at Vijayan, BJP state president K Surendran said what the CM had done in Sabarimala three years ago was the 'act of demon' and people of the state would never forget his "wicked deeds".Kerala had witnessed violent protests by right-wing activists after the LDF government decided to implement the 2018 Supreme court verdict allowing women of all age groups to offer prayers at the hill shrine of Lord Ayyappa at Sabarimala, where traditionally women in the menstrual age group of 10-50 are barred from offering worship.The war of words became intense as the polling continued with the several prominent leaders on both fronts coming up with sharp reactions supporting and opposing the statements of the CM.All began when Sukumaran Nair, the general secretary of the Nair Service Society, an outfit of influential Hindu Nair community, on Tuesday said the people of Kerala wanted a change of rule in the state.In a veiled attack against the LDF government, which had faced severe criticism from the majority community against its alleged hastiness in implementing the Supreme Court verdict allowing women of all age group at Sabarimala, Nair said the protest of Ayyappa devotees persist.When reporters sought his reaction, the Chief Minister said he does not think that Sukumaran Nair would tell anything against the state government."He is an Ayyappa devotee. Ayyappa and all other gods are with this government which has protected the interest of people belonging to all religions.Gods are always with those who do good for people," Vijayan told reporters in Kannur after casting his vote at a school there.Responding to the CM's statement, Chennithala sought to know whether atheist Vijayan was seeking the blessings of Lord Ayyappa to win the elections."Neither Lord Ayyappa nor his devotees would forgive the Left government for hurting their sentiments," the Congress leader said.K Surendran said Vijayan's remarks over Sabarimala show his "weakness".The atheist woman had been sent to Sabarimala misusing the government machinery, he alleged adding that women were escorted by police in an ambulance at the midnight to enter the hill shrine."Pinarayi Vijayan was the one who had challenged the Ayyappa devotees to hold hartal after the women's entry at Sabarimala," the BJP leader alleged.Former Congress Chief Ministers A K Antony and Oommen Chandy also reacted sharply against Vijayan's Sabarimala comments on the election day.Chandy asked who would believe in Kerala when Vijayan spoke about Sabarimala."Not a single devotee in Kerala will believe his words.No one will forget his negative reply when the opposition asked him to withdraw the government's affidavit at the apex court concerning Sabarimala," he said adding that it was out of fear of failure that the CM was talking about Lord Ayyappa during the poll.If the UDF was voted to power, it would take all possible legal measures to protect the faith of devotees in Sabarimala, Chandy added.Congress Working Committee (CWC) member A K Antony urged Vijayan to tender an apology to Lord Ayyappa and the devotees for what the government had done at the hillock shrine.If the Chief Minister was not ready to express sincere regret, his words about Sabarimala and Lord Ayyappa were just 'hypocrisy ", he said.Meanwhile, ministers A K Balan and Thomas Isaac came out defending the Pinarayi Vijayan over the Sabarimala remarks.Isaac said not Sabarimala but people are discussing development during the election and expressed confidence that the LDF has the support of people from all walks of life.Balan, however, sought the urgent intervention of the Election Commission against the opposition 'misusing' and flaring up the Sabarimala issue on the election day.Alleging that the propaganda was part of a deliberate attempt to fail the Left government, he said God has never been misused so badly ever in the elections."It is unconstitutional and a challenge to the Representation of the People Act," the minister claimed.Criticising Sukumaran Nair, he said he did not believe that NSS general secretary would stoop to the level of turning this election into a struggle between believers and non-believers.

In February 2010, 23 prisoners had escaped from the District Jail in Chittorgarh.Officials scrutinising CCTV footage at Phalodi jail said it appeared that this jail break had been meticulously planned.The police are interrogating the guards posted in the prison. CCTV footage from the road leading to the jail is also being examined.The footage indicates that the prisoners were often roaming in the open space next to the barracks during the day hours. Later in the evening, they were being put in the barracks. During the escape, the prisoners first pushed the constable unlocking the gate. They went on to overpower the caretaker and a guard standing next to him. They then threw a chilli and vegetable solution in the eyes of the guard. Next, they pushed the female guard aside and escaped.Jodhpur MP and Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has criticised the state government over the escape and said: "The security in prisons appears to be deteriorating along with the law and order in the state. Thankfully, the government does not have responsibility of governing the borders connected with our neighbouring country, otherwise the Rajasthan government would have topped the world in that failure as well." It needs to be mentioned here that the Rajasthan police had recently launched Operation Flush Out in which phones and SIM cards were seized from prisoners. Also, more than 100 police officers were suspended for their alleged proximity to prisoners.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/16-prisoners-put-chilli-powder-in-rajasthan-jail-staffs-eyes-escape-235424
06-04-2021||Chandigarh||With 16 per cent TA officers unfit, Armed Forces Tribunal upholds disembodiment of troops||With over 16 per cent of Territorial Army (TA) officers at present being in the low medical category (LMC), the Armed forces Tribunal has observed that having unfit officers would deprive the country of benefits of having a physically and mentally fit and robust officer leadership for units employed in the security of the nation, with direct consequences for the entire country.“The organisation has authorised a total of 503 TA officers of which 396 are posted. Of these, 65 officers are LMC,” the tribunal’s bench comprising Justice Rajendra Menon and Lt Gen PM Hariz observed while vacating the stay imposed earlier on the disembodiment of several officers because of poor physical fitness.In addition to TA officers, the organisation is also authorised 172 officers from the regular army.One of the major challenges faced by the TA Directorate was the management of increasing LMC personnel in TA units.Keeping in view the overall security environment prevailing since May 2020, the TA Directorate at Army Headquarters commenced improving the operational fitness of its units and sub-units, according to the Tribunals orders issued on April 5.Accordingly, in the cases of junior commissioned officers and other ranks, that personnel unsuitable due to their medical condition were disembodied and discharged from service.In the case of officers, the TA Directorate issued instructions to units to initiate cases for LMC officers to be placed on Special Unattached List (SUL).Instructions were also issued to the officers concerned to get themselves medically upgraded where possible during the period in which they are on SUL, failing which case for their termination of service from TA would be initiated.Officers could seek embodiment once they were declared medically fit by the competent authority.Some of the officers aggrieved by this move moved the Tribunal, challenging their placement on the SUL.They averred that they did not meet the criteria for being placed on the SUL, there were no adverse comments by superior officers on their demonstrated performance and no show cause notice was served to them.The Army contended that the concept of TA encompassed the employment of physically and medically fit gainfully employed civilians to support, supplement and augment the resources of the regular army in times of need.Unlike the regular army, TA does not provide a full-time career and apart from mandatory training, additional embodiment was subject to organisational requirements or specific tasks. Further, the policy for the management of LMC cases in the TA was different from that of the regular army.Pointing out that of late there has been an increase in LMC officers in the TA the army claimed that it was seen that many were not keen to get upgraded to take benefit of disability pension on retirement.This attitude defeated the very concept of TA and such officers not only failed to maintain their fitness but owing to such disabilities posed a threat to the mission of their unit and the men under their command.The Tribunal’s bench observed that considering the overall security and operational environment in the country and the continued employment of TA in active operational areas, it was vital for the organisation to institute such measures to ensure the operational effectiveness and capabilities of its units and subunits.Stressing that it was implicit and axiomatic that the TA took necessary measures to ensure fitness standards in the leadership provided by TA officers, the bench remarked that having LMC officers with various medical disabilities and employment restrictions not only affected the successful execution of the mission of TA units but also directly impacted the life and sustenance of the men these officers lead.At present, about 85 per cent of TA infantry units and sub-units are embodied and deployed in an operational role.Several other issues relating to the concept of TA and present rules and regulations governing the TA raised by the petitioners would be heard by the Tribunal in due course.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/with-16-per-cent-ta-officers-unfit-armed-forces-tribunal-upholds-disembodiment-of-troops-235422

We are trying to trace him through all possible channels," Inspector General of Police (Bastar range) Sundarraj P told PTI.The police are also contacting local villagers to check if they have any information related to the missing jawan, he said.Another senior police official posted in Bastar said there is a strong possibility of the jawan being in the captivity of Naxals, because the forces cordoned off the entire encounter site and area around it in the last two days, but could not find him.The CoBRA jawan was part of a squad that had gone for an anti-Naxal operation on Friday night in the forests of Bijapur and Sukma border.On Saturday, a gunfight broke between Tekalguda and Jonaguda villages in which 22 troopers were killed and 31 others injured.Out of the 22 fatalities, the CRPF lost eight men, including seven CoBRA commandos and a jawan from its Bastariya battalion, while eight of the other deceased were from the District Reserve Guard (DRG) and six from the Special Task Force (STF).Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday visited Jagdalpur and Bijapur to review the situation and said the government will intensify its ongoing fight against the Naxal menace.

India is blessed with having a major manufacturer of global vaccines in India,” he said.Responding to a question, Malpass said that he has encouraged more transparency in terms of what the national requirements are for local production, and that extends to countries around the world.“It hasn't been clear, whether in the United States or in Europe, or in South Africa, or in India, what the requirements are of their local production to meet local demands. I've been encouraged by India's ramping up of its domestic vaccination programme, and we're working with them on that. This is a high priority for the world,” Malpass said.“Because capacity constraints are immense, it takes a lot of people to do the scale of vaccination campaign that we are conducting,” he said.The Health Ministry on Saturday said that India has administered a total of 7,06,18,026 COVID-19 vaccine doses till Friday.As such, Malpass said it is important and vital to have early delivery of vaccines to developing countries because it's going to take a long time to do the vaccinations.“So, I think one of the highest priorities for the world is to begin allowing the supply of vaccines to go to developing countries themselves, including the poorest countries, so that the vaccination process can get under way,” Malpass said.By the middle of this year, he said, the World Bank will have 50 countries with the financing contracts in place that allow the funding to be used to buy vaccines as those become available from around the world. The bank is working actively on that, he said.India, he said, is the World Bank's biggest programme, and as such he mentioned climate change issues.“As we work with India and the transitions that are done in order to have cleaner, lower-carbon fuels for electricity, all forms of energy is going to be one of the world's highest challenges, and I know India is working directly on that itself. It's an important country within the world's mix in terms of both greenhouse gas emissions and in terms of adaptation,” Malpass said.According to the Johns Hopkins University data, there are 131,666,045 COVID-19 cases worldwide with 2,858,491 deaths.

06-04-2021||Washington||US court moves extradition hearing of Tahawwur Rana from April 22 to June 24||A US court has postponed the in-person extradition hearing of Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana, who is sought for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, from April 22 to June 24.US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chooljian in her order on Monday moved the in-person extradition hearing of 59-year-old Rana to India to June 24.The court's order came after a conference between Rana's lawyers and those representing the US Government. During the conference, the two sides agreed to hold the in-person hearing of Rana on June 24 at 1.30 pm local Los Angeles time.Meanwhile, Rana's attorneys in additional motion opposed his extradition to India.“The government has not identified a single case since the founding of this country in which a person acquitted by an American jury has been extradited to a foreign country for trial on charges resting on the same conduct,” it said in its 17-page new submission on Monday.The US Government has time till April 12 to submit its response, if any. The US Government so far has supported the extradition of Rana to India.Rana's attorney argued that the US government's position boils down to this: the term "offense" in the India-US Extradition Treaty means whatever the government needs it to mean.In Article 2, the dual criminality provision, where the government needs the term to have a broad meaning, it refers to underlying conduct. In Article 6, it means "conduct" when needed to achieve a plea deal with Headley, and it means "elements" when needed to extradite Rana.“The Court should reject this "heads the government wins, tails Rana loses" approach. Applying ordinary tools of interpretation, it should hold that the term "offense" in Article 6 refers to the underlying conduct, and it should deny extradition,” it argued.Rana, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He has been declared a fugitive by India.Pakistani-American Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.  As per the India-US Extradition Treaty, the Indian government has requested the formal extradition of Rana, and the United States has initiated this extradition proceeding. The US Government has argued that Rana meets all the criteria warranting certification of his extradition to India.These are: the court has both personal and subject matter jurisdiction, there is an extradition treaty between the United States and India that is in full force and effect, and the crimes for which Rana's extradition is sought are covered by the terms of the treaty.In his previous court submission on February 4, Rana's attorney had argued that Rana's extradition is barred under Article 6 of the United States-India extradition treaty because he had previously been acquitted of the offences for which his extradition is sought, and under Article 9 of the treaty because the government has not established probable cause to believe that Rana committed the alleged offences.

"The said handover is to be made at district jail Rupnagar on/before April 8," the letter stated.It also said that Ansari suffered from certain medical conditions and the same may be kept in mind while making arrangements for his transfer.The Supreme Court had directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of Ansari to the Uttar Pradesh police, saying it was being denied on trivial grounds under the guise of medical issues.It had also said that a convict or an under-trial prisoner, who disobeys the law of the land, cannot oppose his transfer from one prison to another and the courts are not to be helpless bystanders when the rule of law is being challenged with impunity.The Uttar Pradesh Police has said that Ansari is facing 52 cases in UP and elsewhere, and 15 of them are in the trial stage.Acting Superintendent of the Banda District Jail Pramod Tiwari had said all arrangements have been made in Barrack Number-15 for Ansari and no other prisoner can access the area."Three prison guards will be deployed inside the barrack," he had said.

This indicates the morale of the forces is still high,” he said.Operation poorly designed: RahulHe also paid tributes to the security personnel killed by Naxals in the state’s Bastar region on Saturday. He said the Modi government had already given priority to end the menace and also assured that the forces would be victorious in the ongoing operation against the left-wing extremists.“In the last five-six years, we have achieved success in setting up our security camps in the hardcore Naxal-dominated areas of Chhattisgarh. The state government and the Centre have achieved dominance in their areas, which has lowered their influence,” Shah said.CRPF DG Kuldiep Singh, who has been camping at the encounter site since yesterday, briefed Shah about the details of the incident.Shah has reportedly asked the security forces to chalk out a re-calibrated strategy to make counter offensive more deadly and effective.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sacrifice-of-martyrs-wont-go-in-vain-amit-shah-235158

Amta in Howrah was the only seat the Congress had won in 2016.Didi a fighter: JayaThe TMC on Monday roped in actor Jaya Bachchan to campaign for the party. A Samajwadi Party representative in the Rajya Sabha, Jaya said she would stay in the state for three daysShe said she respected Mamata for being the ‘single woman fighting all atrocities’. “Though her head and leg were broken, no one could break her heart and brain,” Jaya saidFor Mamata, tomorrow's polling could mean a make or break phase as she faces an aggressive and surging BJP.The pitch in Bengal's 31 seats has been queered by the presence of Indian Secular Front chief Peerzada Siddiqui who could breach TMC's minority base in South 24 Parganas and Hooghly where he commands influence.The popularity of Mamata's nephew and Diamond Harbour MP Abhishek Banerjee will also be watched tomorrow as four of the seven Assembly segments of this parliamentary seat witness polling on Tuesday.Anticipating violence, the Election Commission has imposed Section 144 CrPC in all the 31 Bengal seats going to polls tomorrow - a phase where Swapan Dasgupta of BJP, minister Ashima Patra of TMC and Kanti Ganguly of CPM are in the fray.The fact that Mamata recently labeled ISF chief Peerzada as a BJP prop indicated the latter's ability to tilt scales in Bengal third phase polls where Mamata is locked in a battle to retain her base after the BJP claimed "super shows in previous two phases including a win in Nandigram."In Assam, BJP's Himanta Biswa Sarma is contesting in the third and final phase tomorrow as is BJP state chief Ranjeet Dass. Elections will be held for 40 constituencies where 337 candidates are in fray.The contest is mostly between the ruling BJP and the Congress with Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) the third pole. Sarma, a four-term MLA, is contesting against Congress' Romen Barthakur from Jalukbari. Dass is fighting against AJP's working chief Pabindra Deka and Congress' Santanu Sarma in Patacharkuchi.Nadda’s Hooghly rallies cancelledThe BJP on Monday cancelled both rallies of party president JP Nadda in Hooghly district after he had to rush back to New Delhi for an “urgent meeting”. The BJP party chief’s meeting at Sreerampur was cancelled due to unknown reasons. The TMC claimed Nadda did not turn up as the attendance at these rallies was thin.

Dassault allegedly paid about one million euros (approx Rs 8 crore) to Defsys Solutions in India for making 50 models of the aircraft, which were to be given as “gifts to clients”.“The agency’s (AFA) inspectors found that Dassault had agreed to pay one million euros to a middleman just after the 2016 signing of the Rafale fighter jet deal. That middleman is now accused of money laundering in India in another defence deal. The company said the money was used to pay for the manufacture of 50 large replica models of Rafale jets,” said the report. The inspectors were given no proof that these models were made. Yet, against all apparent logic, the AFA decided not to refer the matter to prosecutors, the report said.Defsys Solutions belongs to the family of Sushen Gupta, arrested by the ED in another case. According to the report, members of the Gupta family had been “acting as middlemen in aeronautical and defence industries for three generations”.Congress media head Randeep Surjewala asked if the government would invoke integrity clause of the Defence Procurement Policy, which bars middlemen in defence contracts and provides for banning the supplier, cancelling the contract and registering an FIR in case of evidence of commissions.“Will this happen now? Does the matter not warrant an independent probe into India’s biggest defence deal as to how much bribe was paid and to whom in the government?” asked Surjewala.Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad trashed the allegations as “corporate rivalry and completely baseless”, accusing the Congress of undermining the armed forces’ morale. He said the Supreme Court had rejected a demand for a probe and the CAG too had found nothing wrong. He alleged Sushen Gupta had links with the Congress, which had been “established in the AgustaWestland case”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/row-erupts-as-french-media-says-commission-paid-in-rafale-deal-235141

He also accused Congress for “weakening the morale of the Armed Forced”. “If we had the Rafale during the Balakot we could have made the strike from our side. They asked for proof for Uri, Balakot. The country has increasingly refusing to take Rahul Gandhi seriously for the kind of utterances he makes with alarming regularity,” the BJP leader said.According to reports, a French anti-corruption agency allegedly raised red flags over a suspicious payment made by Dassault Aviation to an Indian defence company in 2017-18. The report published by Paris-based investigative news website places a fresh spotlight over the controversial 2016 Rafale deal.It claims that the Rafale jet maker was unable to adequately provide documentation for this 2017 contract for aircraft models, leading the anti-corruption agency’s inspectors to suspect that it was a “bogus purchase” or one that was designed to conceal a middleman payment.Indian defence company’s owners are closely connected to alleged defence agent Sushen Gupta, who is under investigation by the CBI in the AgustaWestland case, the report claims.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-dismisses-new-rafale-report-as-completely-baseless-blames-corporate-rivalry-234983

06-04-2021||Kolkata||Stage set for third phase of Bengal polls in 31 seats; Swapan Dasgupta, Kanti Ganguly in fray||A three-cornered battle is on the cards in 31 assembly seats that are set to go to polls on Tuesday in the third phase of Bengal elections, with the BJP seeking to breach TMC fortresses, and Left Front-ISF-Congress alliance hoping to make a mark in areas, where identity politics has gained ground.More than 78.5 lakh voters are eligible to exercise their franchise and decide the fate of 205 candidates—prominent among them being BJP leader Swapan Dasgupta, TMC minister Ashima Patra and CPI(M) leader Kanti Ganguly—in three districts—Howrah, Hooghly and South 24 Parganas.Tight security arrangements have been made to ensure peaceful voting, with 618 companies of CAPF deployed to guard 10,871 polling stations, all of which have been marked “sensitive” by the Election Commission.State police forces will also be deputed at strategic locations to aid the CAPF.With the COVID-19 situation in the state taking a turn for the worse, polling will be held amid strict adherence to health protocols across all 31 constituencies -- 16 in South 24 Parganas (part II), seven in Howrah (part I) and eight in Hooghly (part I).The TMC had won all but one seat of these 31 segments in the 2016 assembly elections. The Congress had managed to bag Amta constituency in Howrah district.The saffron party, however, left the Left and the Congress behind to emerge as the main contender of the Mamata Banerjee-led party after the 2019 general election.The Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha constituency, held by political heavyweight and TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee, will be closely watched, as four of its seven assembly segments will go to polls in the third phase, and the rest will follow suit in the fourth phase on April 10.The Indian Secular Front (ISF), floated by Peerzada Abbas Siddiqui, has turned out to be a cause of concern for the TMC, as the outfit holds sway in several parts of South 24 Parganas and Hooghly districts.TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee, having sensed the ISF’s potential to eat into her party’s minority vote base, had been hitting out at Siddiqui, alleging that he has been propped up by the BJP, a charge vehemently denied by the cleric, who is taking on the ruling party with gusto.Clashes between the ISF and TMC supporters have been reported from Bhangar and Canning East in South 24 Parganas, as the Siddiqui-led party gears up to give the ruling dispensation a tough fight in association with the Left Front and the Congress.Adding to the ruling camp’s woes, the BJP has fielded sitting MLA and TMC turncoat Dipak Halder, who wields considerable influence in the area.Sharpening its attack on the TMC over issues ranging from corruption to political violence, the BJP held power-packed campaigns across the three districts over the past few days, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who addressed several public meetings.Besides, Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP president JP Nadda, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Union minister Smriti Irani held a slew of rallies in these areas.The TMC chief, who is still recuperating from her injuries, traversed the length and breadth of the three districts on her wheelchair, highlighting her government’s development schemes, and hurling barbs at the BJP over price rise, and other Central government policies.

06-04-2021||New Delhi||Congress seeks probe into Rafale deal after French media claim bribes were paid||The Congress on Monday demanded an independent probe into the Rs 60,000 crore Rafale jet deal after a section of the French media citing the national anti-graft agency claimed 1 million Euro commissions in the same.Addressing reporters here, Congress media head Randeep Surjewala also asked the government whether or not it was in order that a ban be placed on Rafale makers Dassault for paying bribes and also a case registered.“India’s biggest defence deal of 36 Rafale fighter aircraft from France’s Dassault Aviation is a sordid saga of loss to public exchequer, squandering of national interests and violation of Defence Procurement Procedure. The devastating sensational revelations in the last evening report of French News portal Mediapart.fr have now revealed the existence of middleman, payment of commission and red flags raised by the French Anti-Corruption Agency – AFA.”Surjewala cited the news report that alleged payment of 1.1 million euro bribes to Indian firm Defsys Solutions and said the French anti-corruption bureau had asked Dassault tough questions on the payments.“Dassault balance sheet said the money was a gift to the client. But when confronted, Dassault told the French anti-corruption agency that it paid an Indian firm that was engaged to prepare 59 models of Rafale. No answers were forthcoming when the French officials asked Dassault why would it engage an Indian firm to make models when it was manufacturing the jet itself?”Noting that ​Defsys Solutions, India, is actually a company undertaking assembly of flight simulators and optical and electronic systems, Surjewala asked the PM whether he would invoke integrity clause of the DPP to black list Rafale as provided by the rules.“Defence Procurement Procedure as also the stated Indian government policy envisages that there will be an ‘Integrity Clause’ in every defence purchase contract. There can be no middleman or payment of commission or bribe. Any evidence of middleman or commission or bribery has serious penal consequences of banning of the supplier defence company, cancellation of contract, registration of FIR and imposition of heavy financial penalties on the defence supplier company. Will this happen now?” asked Congress.What is this about10th April, 2015 – Prime Minister Narendra Modi announces purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft off the shelf during his visit to France. 23rd September, 2016 – Modi government signs a formal agreement with France to buy 36 Rafale aircraft for US$ 8.7 billion or €7.8 billion, i.e., Rs 60,000 crore. An investigation conducted by French anti-corruption agency – AFA has now revealed that after signing of the deal in 2016, Dassault, the manufacturer of Rafale has paid 1.1 million euro to a middleman Defsys Solutions, India​Amount shown as expenditure by Dassault as “gifts to clients”.30th March, 2017: Dassault tells French anti-corruption agency that this was payment for manufacture of 50 models of Rafale.AFA asked Dassault – (a) Why it asked an Indian company to make models of its own aircrafts and that also at €20,000 per piece?(b) Why was this expenditure then entered as “Gifts to Clients”?(c) Were these models ever made? If yes, where and when were they displayed?Reportedly, no reply came.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-seeks-probe-into-rafale-deal-after-french-media-claim-bribes-were-paid-234961
06-04-2021||---||Any other home minister would have had to resign, says Surjewala on jawan killings||New Delhi, April 5The Congress on Tuesday said any other home minister would have had to resign had 22 jawans been killed under his watch during a central forces-led anti-Naxal operation as happened in Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur where Maoists trapped the security personnel killing them.One jawan is still missing.Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “One home minister had to resign just because he changed clothes during the Mumbai terror attacks. Changing clothes is not a big deal. Clothes can get dirty and people can change."He said, "But here you have a Home Minister who continued with poll campaigns for 24 hours after the jawans were killed and cancelled only his last two rallies in Assam."Anti-Naxal operation is the sole responsibility of the Home Minister and the Bijapur operation was a central forces operation in which state forces were aiding, which they dutifully do."But should questions not be asked of a home minister who continued canvassing even after the news that jawans had been killed? Is saying that their sacrifices won’t go in vain enough? Also why was there delay on rescuing the injured? Maybe lives could have been saved with swift response,” Surjewala wondered, saying no one would ask for Amit Shah’s resignation.Meanwhile, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “No Indian jawan should face an enemy without a body armour in the 21st century. It needs to be made available to every soldier.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/any-other-home-minister-would-have-had-to-resign-says-surjewala-on-jawan-killings-234960
