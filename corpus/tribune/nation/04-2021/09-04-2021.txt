Three days later, he wrote a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, in which he alleged that Anil Deshmukh had asked Waze to collect Rs 100 crore per month from bars and restaurants.The Bombay High Court had on Monday directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the allegations against Deshmukh. Soon after the order, Deshmukh, a senior NCP leader, resigned as home minister.Waze is currently in the custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the probe into the explosives-laden SUV. Waze is also under scanner for the alleged murder of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, who was in possession of that SUV.

09-04-2021||Satya Prakash||Payment of extortion money doesn’t amount to terror funding: SC||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 9Holding that payment of extortion money does not amount to terror funding, the Supreme Court on Friday granted bail to a businessman charged with certain crimes under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, 1967.“A close scrutiny of the material placed before the court would clearly show that the main accusation against the Appellant is that he paid levy/extortion amount to the terrorist organization. Payment of extortion money does not amount to terror funding,” said a Bench of Justice L Nageswara Rao and Justice Ravindra Bhat while granting bail to one Sudesh Kedia.Kedia – who was carrying on transport business – was accused of paying money to the members of a terrorist gang TPC and hobnobbing with them for running his business smoothly. An amount of close to Rs 10 lakh was also recovered from his residence.A Ranchi court had dismissed his bail plea and the Jharkhand High Court had upheld the rejection order. However, unconvinced with the allegations, the Supreme Court reversed the order.“Payment of extortion money does not amount to terror funding. It is clear from the supplementary charge-sheet and the other material on record that other accused who are members of the terrorist organization have been systematically collecting extortion amounts from businessmen in Amrapali and Magadh areas… Prima facie, it cannot be said that the Appellant conspired with the other members of the TPC and raised funds to promote the organization,” it said.While dealing with a bail plea under Section 43(5)D of the UAPA, the court was duty-bound to apply its mind and examine the entire material on record to satisfy itself if a prima facie case was made out against the accused, the Bench said.With regard to recovery of money, the top court didn’t agree with the prosecution that the amount is a terror fund. “At this stage, it cannot be said that the amount seized from the Appellant is proceeds from terrorist activity. There is no allegation that Appellant (Kedia) was receiving any money,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/payment-of-extortion-money-doesnt-amount-to-terror-funding-sc-236931
09-04-2021||New Delhi||US sail unlikely to raise diplomatic heat||The sail past by a US Navy ship through the Indian exclusive economic zone (EEZ) has raised political temperatures but may not rock the bilateral diplomatic ties except for the matter of issuance of a public statement by the US Navy which has not happened in the past, said sources.The US routinely challenges what it sees as “excessive maritime claims” of 22 countries. They include the entire South Asian littoral belt, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Pakistan besides close ally Taiwan further in the east.The statement by the US Navy has been unusually made public and there are several voices against its tone and tenor. But sources said the thrust of the latest statement is the same as the ones quietly served through diplomatic channels since the US Navy started carrying out these sails in Indian EEZ from 1992.Initially the sails took place every second year. They became annual affairs in 1999. It didn’t take place in 2018 and the COVID-hit 2020.   Friend or foe, the US has adopted this practice of confronting “inconsistent claims” by 22 countries that it says are “excessive maritime claims”.The US follows a two-pronged approach. Its Department of State diplomatically protests excessive maritime claims and asks the countries concerned to adhere to international law.  The Department of Defence then exercises the US’ maritime rights by conducting tangible, operational challenges against excessive maritime claims.These FON (freedom of navigation) sails are deliberately planned in a manner that does not provoke armed conflict, said sources.The differences between the US and the 22 countries are on a wide range of issues. But the entire rule book is thrown at China while India’s alleged misdemeanours merit a few lines.The US conducts these FONs through the Indian EEZ to contradict New Delhi’s claim that prior consent is required for military exercises or manoeuvres in the EEZ.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-sail-unlikely-to-raise-diplomatic-heat-236930

Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also asked why Gandhi has not vaccinated himself until now and whether he had already vaccinated himself during one of his foreign trips.Terming Gandhi a “part-time politician” who is facing “attention starvation”, Prasad said: “After failing as a part-time politician, has Rahul Gandhi switched to full time lobbying?“First, he lobbied for fighter plane companies by trying to derail India’s acquisition programme. Now, he is lobbying for pharma companies by asking for arbitrary approvals for foreign vaccines,” Prasad said in response to Gandhi’s letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling for “an immediate moratorium on vaccine export and fast-track approval of other vaccines”.Prasad said India is not facing vaccine starvation but “Gandhi is facing attention starvation”.Questioning why Gandhi has not yet taken vaccine, Prasad said:  “Is it an oversight or he doesn’t want it or has he already taken one in many of his undisclosed trips to foreign locations but doesn’t want to disclose?“Rahul Gandhi must know that shortage in Congress ruled states is not of vaccines but of basic commitment towards health care. He should write letters to his party’s governments to stop their vasooli ventures and concentrate on administering the lakhs of vaccines they are sitting upon”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-lobbying-for-fighter-plane-and-pharma-companies-bjp-launches-scathing-attack-against-rahul-236924

09-04-2021||New Delhi||Wife of Delhi bizman, who mixed thallium in her and family members food, dies||Weeks after a Delhi-based builder was arrested for allegedly poisoning his wife and other family members by mixing a toxin called thallium in their food, his spouse died at a hospital here, police said on Friday.Divya Arora, was on ventilator support, and she died on Thursday evening, they said.Police said Varun Arora, the accused, was inspired by articles related to the toxin and its use by former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and used it to kill his mother-in-law and his sister-in-law.He mixed the toxin in their food to take revenge from his wife and her family members for helping her abort their child without his consent.On March 22, police had received information that a woman, Anita Devi Sharma, who was a resident of Inder Puri here, had been declared dead at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.The doctors had opined that the death was caused due to poisoning by thallium which had been detected in her blood and urine.On inquiry, it was found that Sharma’s daughter Divya Arora was also admitted in the ICU of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and she too was undergoing treatment for thallium poisoning. She was on ventilator support.Sometime later, it was also revealed that Priyanka, Sharma’s younger daughter, had died during treatment at BL Kapoor Hospital on February 15 and doctors had detected symptoms of thallium poisoning in her like hair loss and burning feet syndrome.Sharma’s husband Devendra Mohan was also found to have symptoms of thallium poisoning while the maid, who was working at their house, also had undergone treatment at RML Hospital for similar symptoms.Investigations revealed that the deceased woman’s son-in-law Arora had visited them January and brought cooked fish for them.“After we registered the case, Varun Arora was interrogated in which he admitted to have procured thallium and also administering it to his mother-in-law Anita, wife Divya, father-in-law Devender Mohan and sister-in-law Priyanka to take revenge from them. Varun Arora said he had been humiliated by his in-laws,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (west) Urvija Goel had said.Thallium was recovered from his house at Greater Kailash.During interrogation, Varun Arora told police that during the time when his father died, his wife had also gotten pregnant, leading him to believe that his father had come back to his family in the form of the child, police had said.However, when his wife underwent some tests, the doctors told them that there may be some complications during child birth and her life may be in danger. She consulted Varun Arora and also opined that she should abort the child, but he refused, police said.Varun Arora’s wife, however, discussed the matter with her parents and aborted the baby with their help. When Varun Arora came know about it, he planned to take revenge from them.

It stars Satyadeep Mishra, Priyamani Raj and Mrinal Dutt. Saria, who bagged the National Award for best direction last month for his feature "Knock Knock Knock", took to Twitter on Friday and shared the poster of his acclaimed 2015 same-sex romantic-drama, which featured the film's two leads lying in an embrace. The film starred  Dhruv Ganesh and Shiv Panditt. The poster of "His Storyy", shared by ALTBalaji on its social media pages, also showed their characters in a strikingly similar position. In a Twitter-thread, Saria wrote he was disappointed at the makers for "blatantly" copying his poster. "Why is this industry like this? Woke up to find that our painstakingly illustrated, original poster for @loevfilm has just been blatantly ripped off by the geniuses at @altbalaji @ZEE5Premium for their show #HisStoryy. "Thirteen months of back and forth and so many drafts by the amazing minds at @TalkPigeonCo with oversight by @jahanbakshi and amazingly illustrated by artist @rohanpore just ripped off without any decency," the director said. WHY IS THIS INDUSTRY LIKE THIS?

09-04-2021||New Delhi||Non-uniformity of Himalayas foresees significantly large earthquake events||Scientists have found that the Himalayas are not uniform, and have assumed different physical and mechanical properties in different directions. The property present in crystals is called 'anisotropy'—which could result in significantly large earthquake events in the Himalayas. Researchers, including Dr Sushil Kumar, Shubhasmita Biswal, Professor William Mohanty, and Mahesh Prasad Parija from Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG), Dehradun, and Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT KGP), used data from WIHG to show that the North-West Himalayan region exhibits a peculiar characteristic present in crystals, according to an official statement.The NW region of India—an area covering Garhwal and Himachal Pradesh—has been hit by four destructive moderates to great earthquakes since the beginning of the 20th century-the Kangra earthquake of 1905, the Kinnaur earthquake of 1975, the Uttarkashi earthquake of 1991, and the Chamoli earthquake of 1999.These seismic activities manifest large-scale subsurface deformation and weak zones, underlining the need for deeper insights into the ongoing deformation beneath these tectonically unstable zones, it said.The joint study, using seismic waves from 167 earthquakes recorded by 20 broadband seismic stations deployed in the Western Himalaya, suggested that the major contribution of the anisotropy is mainly because of the strain induced by the Indo-Eurasia collision (going on for 50 million years) and deformation due to the collision is found to be larger in the crust than in the upper mantle. It has been recently published in 2020 in the Journal ‘Lithosphere (GSA)’.The inhomogeneity along the Himalayas influences the stressing rate is because of variation in the geometry of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) system, and it controls the rupture size during the earthquake. This lack of homogenous physical and mechanical properties of the Himalayas could help explore new perspectives on deformations taking place at the Himalaya-Tibet crustal belt involved in the formation of the Himalayan Mountains.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/non-uniformity-of-himalayas-foresees-significantly-large-earthquake-events-236882

We will run as many services as required. There is no cause for alarm. We can run trains immediately on demand if there is any rush. This rush is normal during the summer season and we have already announced trains to clear the rush,” he said.With the number of COVID-19 cases on the rise, a sudden surge in passenger movement at railway stations was reported from across the country. Many travellers, speaking to the media, said the fear of an imminent lockdown was the reason behind their trips.“There is no shortage of trains for those who want to travel. I assure everyone that trains will be provided on demand,” Sharma said.The Railway Board chairman also ruled out the need for a COVID-negative certificate to travel by train.He said the Railways has not received any communique yet from Maharashtra to stop or curtail the movement of trains in view of the rising number of coronavirus cases.Thomas appealed to the public not to believe in the rumours doing the rounds of social media regarding overcrowding at railway stations. He urged them to avoid sharing old videos and false reports on social media platforms.In Mumbai, the Central Railway CPRO took reporters on a live tour of the Mumbai area stations via live-streaming of visuals from platforms and circulating areas to highlight that “contrary to what has been reported by certain sections of the media, there is no rush at the stations in the Mumbai area”.In Delhi, the Northern Railway CPRO gave the media a tour of the New Delhi railway station, again to show that there is no “rush”.Presently, on an average, the Indian Railways is running a total of 1,402 special train services per day. A total of 5,381 suburban train services and 830 passenger train services are also operational. Apart from this, 28 special trains are being operated as clones of highly-patronised trains with a high demand.Sharma said additional trains are being run during April-May to clear the rush in the Central Railway with 58 trains (29 pairs) and in the Western Railway with 60 trains (30 pairs). These trains are for high-demand destinations such as Gorakhpur, Patna, Darbhanga, Varanasi, Guwahati, Barauni, Prayagraj, Bokaro, Ranchi and Lucknow among others, he added.In a mass exodus barely a year ago when the nationwide lockdown was announced to curb the spread of the coronavirus, thousands of people walked hundreds of kilometres back to their home states with the Railway services having been suspended.While there is no consolidated data on how many migrant workers lost their lives walking home, the visuals of them carrying their belongings on their heads with their little ones in tow, trudging through the cityscape had captured popular imagination.Asked if there is a possibility of another such eventuality, Sharma said the Railways is ready and on standby to run as many services as needed when the time comes.“Last year, we were not in service. This time, our trains are running and we are ready to provide trains wherever there is a rush and demand. There is no reason to worry,” the Railway Board chairman asserted.

They have asked people to co-operate, and protect themselves by compulsorily wearing masks.Hyderabad Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar on Friday notified the force to deal with all those not wearing masks. He said that it is mandatory to wear a mask, even if someone was alone in a car.The police have been instructed to book violators. In a recorded message shared on social media platforms, including Twitter, Anjani Kumar cited a Delhi High Court judgement which said, that "even if a person was driving alone in a car, it was mandatory to wear a mask"."Corona is still there and is infecting many people. Please protect yourselves and your family by wearing a mask. We will book cases if you don’t wear a mask at public places”, read the Twitter message.“The vehicle could be required to be stopped at a traffic signal or the person could purchase anything from the roadside by rolling down the windows, thus getting exposed to a street-side vendor,” the Commissioner said, adding, that just because one was alone in the car, it would not mean that the car was not a public place.In another statement, in connection with the forthcoming Ramzan month, the Commissioner said, that the city was known for its haleem, and there were about 6,000 to 8,000 cooks involved in the making of the delicacy. There were also about 20,000 people also involved in the business of haleem making.“Please take the Covid-19 vaccine. Protect yourself, protect your customers, protect your family members. There are more than 2,000 haleem outlets in the city. So it’s important to take precautions and hygienically make haleem and celebrate Ramzan in a safe and protected way,” the Commissioner said, winding up the message saying, “yahi aap se umeed hai, yahi aap se guzaarish hai.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wearing-a-mask-made-mandatory-in-hyderabad-236875
09-04-2021||New Delhi||Not even fear of COVID-19 can disrupt protest, say agitating farmers||The alarming rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in Delhi notwithstanding, farmer leaders on Thursday said that nothing, not even the fear of coronavirus, can disrupt their protest against the agri laws.Over the past four months, the farmers have managed to keep their agitation going, withstanding extreme cold, rains, and heat. They devised many ways to deal with these issues - for cold there was ample supply of winter wear, for rain they elevated their beds, and to prepare for the heat, they have started building houses, and arranging for ACs, coolers and fans. Tackling the second wave of COVID-19 won't be very different for them, they said, adding they are prepared with certain basic precautions in place."We have been making announcements from the stage at the Singhu border about the necessity of wearing masks, and washing hands frequently. We are also encouraging the protestors to get vaccinated," said Lakhbir Singh, vice president (Punjab) of All India Kisan Sabha.With multiple health camps at these protest sites, immediate medical assistance is always at the farmers' disposal in case a protestor develops symptoms like fever or breathlessness."If somebody has fever or cold, or any other COVID-like symptoms, then the doctors here take a call. The patient is either admitted to a hospital, or sent back to their village for 8-10 days," said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda).On Friday, India registered a record single-day spike of 1,31,968 new COVID-19 cases. Delhi too, recorded 7,437 fresh cases in its highest single-day spike this year, with the capital's death roll reaching 11,157 on Thursday.According to Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav, farmers do treat the pandemic with a "certain indifference", but also pointed out that none of the protest sites were COVID-19 hotspots either, making it difficult to challenge the farmers' attitude."If you would notice, each of these places has doctors, clinics. They are not doing COVID testing, but if many people are reporting fever and so on, they would get to know because qualified doctors are there in every single morcha. "Some of them have proper hospitals. If there was a surge in fever and breathlessness that would have been noticed immediately," he said.He added that while the habit of wearing masks and washing hands was being cultivated among the farmers, "distancing has not worked", which, he added, was true for most places in the country."Farmers are just like any ordinary Indian citizen… they are just about as careful as other citizens are, or about as careless, as most Indian citizens are," Yadav said.One of the major threats that seems to loom over the farmers' movement with the rising number of COVID-19 cases, is the repeat of what happened to the Shaheen Bagh protest last year - they were forced to end the agitation fearing the spread of the disease.This year, Yadav said, however, the situation was different."That time, there was a sense of doom, a sense of 'you don't know what would happen' with corona. It was just the beginning… we didn't know anything at that point. "Now, that unspecified sense of doom is not there, and therefore, while at that time the government could use that as a pretext to get the protestors to move away, using that now would be utterly cynical," he said. He added that if the government uses the coronavirus as an excuse to remove the protesting farmers, it would only expose their "hypocrisy" with the election campaigning underway in West Bengal."In that case they should ban election campaigning in Bengal. The first thing they should do is to ban BJP's own rallies, where the home minister is addressing the crowds. The hypocrisy of that would obviously be seen," Yadav said.Thousands of farmers from different parts of the country have been protesting against the three farm laws since the last week of November, 2020. While the government has been projecting these laws as major agricultural reforms, farmers have expressed apprehension that the move would lead to the elimination of the Minimum Support Price system, and leave them at the mercy of big corporates.Ask Paramjit Singh if the farmers are afraid of contracting the disease that has already claimed over 1.6 lakh lives in the country, and he said, "what choice do we have?" "Our lives are already on the line. We were afraid of the biting cold, and are afraid of the heat that awaits us, so yes we are afraid of the disease but there is no other option. "We are taking precautions at individual levels by wearing masks and avoiding shaking hands with people, but the movement has to and will continue," the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal) Punjab general secretary said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/not-even-fear-of-covid-19-can-disrupt-protest-say-agitating-farmers-236873
09-04-2021||Kolkata||Mamata’s fulminations against CAPF betrays frustration: Shah||Coming down hard on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, Home Minister Amit Shah said on Friday her fulminations against central forces betrayed frustration over “impending defeat” in the assembly elections and wondered whether she is pushing the state towards anarchy.He exuded confidence that the BJP will win anywhere between 63 and 68 seats where polling has been held in the first three phases. Polling is over in 91 of the state’s 294 assembly constituencies in the three phases.“The frustration of the TMC over impending defeat is very much evident from her action and speeches. I have never seen a chief minister or the president of a political party use the kind of words Mamata Banerjee is using against central forces. Is she trying to create anarchy? Does she want disturbance? Or does she want to win the election through rigging like before?“She should know that central forces do not function under the Home Ministry during elections. They function under the jurisdiction of the Election Commission,” he told a press conference.Shah was responding to the TMC supremo’s claim of CAPF personnel harassing and intimidating electors and asking them to vote for the BJP at the behest of Shah and the Home Ministry.The Election Commission had on Thursday night issued a notice to Mamata Banerjee for her “completely false, provocative and intemperate statements” against central forces performing election duty in West Bengal, provoking a defiant TMC boss to declare she will continue doing so until “the CRPF stops working for BJP”.“I am astonished to see how political interests change the priority of individuals. Earlier she used to say she wants more central forces to be deployed. Now she is against the presence of central forces as her party cannot rig elections due to tight security. She is asking people to gherao central forces,” he said.Shah praised the EC for conducting comparatively more peaceful elections than previous assembly, Lok Sabha and panchayat polls in the state.“Violence in the first three phases has been comparatively less in Bengal than the last three elections for the assembly, panchayats and the Lok Sabha. I want to congratulate EC on it. But there have been incidents. So, it has to be ensured that there is no violence,” he said.Shah said Banerjee’s appeal to the minority community against division of their votes shows minority voters were drifting away from the TMC.“The way Didi has appealed to minority voters to come together and vote for the TMC betrays the fact that her minority vote bank is also slowly slipping away. This is unprecedented,” he said.People of Bengal are peeved about Mamata Banerjee’s failure to check infiltration, her protest against the CAA and appeasement politics, Shah said.“The TMC government has opposed CAA and passed a resolution. The BJP, after coming to power, will undo it. I want to assure all refugees they will get citizenship under CAA,” the home minister said.Unveiling a development roadmap for Bengal and Kolkata, Shah said Rs 22,000 crore will be spent under Kolkata Development Fund for improvement of infrastructure.“Our Sonar Bangla campaign will begin from Kolkata. Kolkata will remain the ‘City of Joy’, and we will also work to transform it into the ‘City of Future’,” he said.Shah claimed the BJP got “unprecedented” support from the people of West Bengal in the first three phases as a result of which the party will win anywhere between 63 and 68 of the 91 seats where polling has been held.Speaking about the surge in coronavirus cases and apprehension that the ongoing election campaign could aggravate the situation, Shah urged everyone to maintain COVID-19 protocols.“The decision to hold elections is taken by the Election Commission after seeking views of all political parties. There is no clear provision on what can be done if the tenure of an assembly or parliament gets over. So, you need to conduct elections.“I think every political party is maintaining COVID protocols and those who are coming to these campaign rallies are doing it too,” he said.Shah dismissed claims by several states about vaccine shortages and insisted they are getting adequate supplies.

Sangeeta had earlier held the post of the district panchyat chairperson. Reacting to her candidature, Samajwadi Party chief spokesman Rajendra Chowdhury accused the BJP of adopting double standards.  “On one hand, it talks about eliminating criminals and on the other, it glorifies them. In the BJP regime, crime cannot be controlled", he said.  When asked, BJP spokesperson Harishchandra Shrivastava said names of all candidates were recommended by the district unit and were forwarded to the party headquarters through the regional unit. All names were finalised by the organisation, he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unnao-rape-convict-kuldeep-sengars-wife-to-contest-up-panchayat-polls-on-bjp-ticket-236871
09-04-2021||Zurich||How worried should we be about links of blood clots to AstraZeneca's vaccine?||Europe's drug regulator on Wednesday said it had found a possible link between AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine and very rare blood clots in adults who received the shot. Britain recommended people under 30 get an alternative COVID-19 vaccine if possible.Here's what we know so far:WHAT HAS HAPPENED?The EMA said its vaccine side effects monitoring system, as of April 4, had received 169 reports of cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), or clots in blood vessels exiting the brain, and 53 cases of splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), or clotting in veins in the abdomen.That's out of some 34 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses administered in Britain and the European Economic Area since vaccinations started almost three months ago.Its safety committee carried out a review of 62 cases of CVST and 24 cases of SVT, of which 18 were fatal.Most of the cases reported have occurred in women under 60, though that could be misleading. Germany and Britain say many more women received AstraZeneca's shot than men.Most cases occurred within 2 weeks of the person receiving their first dose.German vaccination officials who recorded 29 cases of CVST in women aged 20 to 59 who got the AstraZeneca vaccine said the occurrence rate in that group was 20 times higher within 16 days of vaccination than what would have typically been expected.Germany's health ministry has said 1 to 1.4 cases of CVST would have been expected during that time.WHAT HAS BRITAIN'S REGULATOR SAID?The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency reviewed 79 cases of rare clotting coupled with low platelets, with 19 fatalities - 13 women and 6 men. Eleven of the deaths in people under the age of 50 and three under 30.All 79 cases occurred after a first dose of the vaccine.HOW DID REGULATORS COME TO THEIR DECISION?British officials drew on statistics from the University of Cambridge's Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication to explain their recommendations that young people get an alternative shot while older people still get AstraZeneca's.According to the Centre, vaccination with the AstraZeneca shot would reduce admissions to intensive care units by nearly seven in 100,000 people in the group aged 20-29 years old with a high risk of exposure to the virus, while 1.1 people per 100,000 people in the same group were estimated as likely to suffer serious vaccine-related harms.The risk of serious harm due to vaccination falls further the older people get, and ICU admissions prevented by vaccination rise sharply, boosting the AstraZeneca shot's benefit-to-risk ratio. The Centre concluded only 0.4 people for every 100,000 in the 50-59 age group would suffer vaccine-linked harm, while 95.6 ICU admissions per 100,000 people would be prevented.EMA investigators checked if the frequency of events was higher in the vaccinated population than normal background rates drawn from public health statistics or insurance records. This would be combined with a medical analysis of each case and insight from scientific literature.In its findings, the EMA said on March 18 that, on average, just 1.35 cases of CVST might normally have been expected among people under 50 within 14 days of receiving AstraZeneca's vaccine, whereas by the same cut-off date 12 cases had been recorded.By comparison, four women out of 10,000 would get a blood clot from taking oral contraception.Key to the EMA's assessment that benefits continue to outweigh risks are its conclusions about likelihood of an increased risk from clotting, compared with the benefits of preventing COVID-19 and reducing hospitalizations and deaths.WHAT'S THE EU DOING NOW?The EMA said that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects and countries should decide on how to proceed with their national COVID-19 immunisation campaigns.These may vary from nation to nation, the EMA said, depending on factors like how quickly infections are spreading and whether vaccines are available. Its safety committee requested new studies, and changes to ongoing ones, to provide more information about the mechanism behind the rare clots.AstraZeneca and European regulators have said concerns about blood disorders did not emerge during clinical trials.ARE THERE ANY THEORIES FOR WHAT MAY BE LEADING TO THE CLOTS?Among possible causes for these rare cerebral sinous vein clots being investigated are that the vaccine triggers an unusual antibody in rare cases.The EMA said the vaccine may trigger an immune response leading to the unusual clotting, though it acknowledged that scientists have yet to identify any risk factors that might predispose somebody to clotting combined with low platelets.German scientists at Greifswald University concluded the vaccine is linked to the side effects, though their work still requires peer review. Andreas Greinacher, an expert on drug-induced immune responses, said specimens he has examined exhibited unusual antibodies that activate blood platelets, prompting the clots.Greinacher is still seeking clues about why some people had clots and others did not.

The actual rainfall received is 22.1 mm against the normal of 39.5 mm, a departure of (-)44 per cent from March 1 and April 8, according to the government data.There is no impact of COVID-19 on the progress of area coverage under summer crops in the country, the government said.Meanwhile, the live water storage in 130 reservoirs in the country is 83% of live storage of corresponding period of last year and 121% of storage of average of last 10 years as per the updated report of the Central Water Commission as of April 8.Pulses sowing was reported in 8.68 lakh hectare against 5.72 lakh hectare last year, an increase of 2.96 lakh hectare.Area coverage under coarse cereals is 10.86 lakh hectare area against 8.54 lakh hectare last year, an increase of 2.33 lakh hectare.Area coverage under oilseeds is 9.53 lakh hectare against 7.96 lakh hectare area of last year, an increase of 1.57 lakh hectare.The area under rice is 38.80 lakh hectare against 36.05 lakh hectare last year, an increase of 2.75 lakh hectare.The trend of summer sowing progress is very good as on date, said the ministry. The prospect of rabi crops is also very good in the country, it added, stating that there is no impact of the COVID-19 on the progress of area coverage under summer crops in the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rainfall-deficient-by-44-per-cent-in-march-april-agriculture-ministry-236849
09-04-2021||New Delhi||Ramesh Pokhriyal launches NanoSniffer, a microsensor based explosive trace detector||India has developed the world's first micro-sensor based explosive trace detector (ETD), using a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS), called NanoSniffer— the world’s first Microsensor-based Explosive Trace Detector (ETD)”—was launched by Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ on Friday.NanoSniffer provides trace detection of the nano-gram quantity of explosives, and delivers results in seconds.It can accurately detect a wide range of military, commercial, and home-made explosives threats."NanoSniffer can detect explosives in less than 10 seconds. It identifies and categorises explosives into different classes. It detects all classes of military, conventional and home-made explosives, giving visible and audible alerts with sunlight-readable colour display," according to officials.Further, analysis of the algorithms also helps in the categorisation of explosives into the appropriate class, according to a statement by the ministry.It has successfully passed Pune-based DRDO’s High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL) testing, and has also been tested by the country’s elite counter-terror force National Security Guard (NSG), according to an official statement.It has been developed by NanoSniff Technologies, an IIT Bombay incubated startup, and has been marketed by Vehant Technologies, a spin-off from a former IIT Delhi incubated startup Kritikal Solutions.Pokhriyal said: “Given the constant threats, which our nation faces due to geo-political realities, explosives and contraband detection has become a norm at high-security locations like airports, railways and Metro stations, hotels, malls, and other public places.“Checkpoints at such locations are incorporating advanced detection equipment for rapid scanning of people and baggage. Almost all these products for explosive detection are imported at a high cost leading to the loss of valuable foreign exchange by the country. NanoSniffer is a perfect substitute for such products”Developed by NanoSniff Technologies, NanoSniffer is a step towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of a self-reliant India, he added."It is a 100% Made in India product in terms of research, development, and manufacturing. The core technology of NanoSniffer is protected by patents in the U.S. and Europe.“This affordable device will reduce India’s dependency on imported explosive trace detector devices. It will also encourage other institutions, startups, and medium-scale industries to research & develop products indigenously. It’s a perfect example of the lab-to-market product,” he added.The minister said it is a “perfect example of academia and industry collaboration, which will set an example for other startups in India.” NanoSniff Technologies has partnered with Vehant Technologies, a pioneer in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning- based Physical Security, Surveillance and Traffic Monitoring & Junction Enforcement Solutions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ramesh-pokhriyal-launches-nanosniffer-a-microsensor-based-explosive-trace-detector-236848

09-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai court dismisses cop's defamation plea against Arnab||A sessions court here has dismissed a criminal defamation complaint filed by a Mumbai police officer against Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami over certain claims made during the coverage of the Sushant Singh Rajput death case.The plea, by Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Abhishek Trimukhe, was dismissed by the court on April 1, but a detailed order was made available on Thursday.Trimukhe's complaint had also named ARG Outlier Media Pvt Ltd, which owns Republic Media Network, and Goswami's wife, who is a director in the company.The complainant had alleged that there were some tweets by Goswami and others which misrepresented him.Additional sessions judge Uday Padwad found that Trimukhe's complaint was not in conformity with the mandatory requirement ofsection199(2)of the CrPC for the court to take cognisance.As per provisions of 199(2) of the CrPC, any offence falling under Chapter XXI of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) is alleged to have been committed against a public servant in connection with the discharge of his public functions, a court of session may take cognisance of such offence upon a written complaint by a public prosecutor.Upon perusal of the complaint submissions made before the court, the judge noted the complaint, in this case, was filed by the DCP himself and not through a public prosecutor.The judge, however, said the complainant can take his grievances to a magistrate court."It is not that the aggrieved public servant against whom the said offence is alleged to have been committed has no forum to take his grievances to. Hehastheremedytomake a complaint before the competent magistrate," the court said."His filing of the complaint even through the public prosecutor, however, would not confer any jurisdiction on this court to take cognisance of the alleged offence," it added.The DCP had filed the complaint in February under Indian Penal Code sections 499, 500 (defamation) and 501 (printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory).Goswami made "grossly false", "malicious" and "defamatory" statements during the coverage of actor Rajput's death in June last year, the police officer had claimed.The 34-year-old Bollywood actor was found dead in his apartment in suburban Bandra.These defamatory statements were telecast on the channel, Republic Bharat, during a discussion about phone records of actor Rhea Chakraborty, Rajput's girlfriend, the complaint said."The said defamatory attacks have been made with a singular view of assassinating his (Trimukhe's) official character and thereby...maliciously and deliberately causing undue humiliation of the Mumbai Police Department," the complaint had said.Goswami also tweeted the contents of the telecast to a larger audience, the complaint said.

09-04-2021||Satya Prakash||SC asks Centre to deposit compensation amount with it before case against Italian marines is closed||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 9The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre to deposit with it the Rs 10 crore compensation agreed to be paid by Italy to the families of the two Indian fishermen killed by Italian marines off Kerala coast in 2012."We will ask for the amount to be deposited in this court. Only then we will close the proceedings," a Bench led by Chief Justice SA Bobde told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.The CJI said the top court would disburse the compensation money to the kin of the deceased fishermen."Republic of Italy states an amount of compensation in terms of award passed in 2020 will be paid by Italy to India in the particular account specified by MEA. We direct that after such transfer the said amount be deposited in Supreme Court within one week thereafter," it said, posting the Centre's plea for closing the case on April 19.The court was told that Rs 10 crore was to be paid in terms of an award given by a Hague-based international tribunal."Indians are the best negotiators...We have negotiated a good deal...They have paid Rs 10 crore more. Victims have accepted it now," Mehta told the Bench.The Centre had on April 7 urged the Supreme Court to take up its plea for closing judicial proceedings against the two Italian marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen off the Kerala coast in 2012.The Bench had agreed to hear it on April 9 after Mehta said, “There is some urgency since it is between the Indian and Italian government.”The top court had on August 7 last year said it would like to hear the relatives of the two Indians killed by Italian marines off the coast in Kerala in 2012 before closing the case.A day after an international tribunal ruled that India didn't have jurisdiction to try two Italian marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen in Kerala, the Centre had on July 3 moved the Supreme Court seeking disposal of the case pending before it.In an application filed in the top court, the Centre had said it had accepted the award of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).Mehta had told the top court that Italy had assured India that it would prosecute the marines.In its application, the Centre said it would abide by the award in killings of two fishermen by Italian Marines Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone who were on board Italian-flagged commercial oil tanker MV Enrica Lexie when they allegedly fired at two Indian fishermen off the Kerala coast on February 15, 2012.The Hague-based tribunal on July 2 ruled that the two marines should be tried in Italy and asked the Indian authorities to close the criminal case against them.The tribunal, however, had agreed with India's contention that the Italian marines broke the freedom of navigation aspect of UNCLOS and, therefore, the killed fishermen's kin were entitled to compensation.The Supreme Court had in 2014 stayed the criminal proceedings against the two Italian marines before a Special Court at Kollam in Kerala. In 2015, it halted all the proceedings before all courts in India in view of an ITLOS (International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea) order calling upon India and Italy to suspend all criminal proceedings against the two marines.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-centre-to-deposit-compensation-amount-with-it-before-case-against-italian-marines-is-closed-236831
09-04-2021||New Delhi||Foreigners married to Indians cannot enjoy citizenship status after divorce, Centre tells HC||Foreigners registered as OCI cardholders because of their marriage to Indian nationals cannot continue to enjoy that status after their divorce, the Centre has told the Delhi High Court.The submission has been made by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) while defending the decision of the Indian Embassy in Brussels, Belgium asking a Belgian woman to surrender her OCI card after the dissolution of her marriage with an Indian national.The woman has challenged in the high court a provision of the Citizenship Act - section 7D(f) - under which a foreign spouse of an Indian national would lose Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) status on divorce.Defending the provision, the MHA in an affidavit has said that the section under challenge makes a clear classification based on the intelligible differentia as it applies to foreigners who were registered as OCI cardholders on the strength of their spouse being a citizen of India or an OCI cardholder, and whose marriage has been subsequently dissolved.           "The provision has the object of cancellation of registration as an OCI cardholder of such foreigners as they are no more eligible under the Citizenship Act, 1955," the MHA has said in its affidavit filed through central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul.The ministry has said that the woman was issued a Person of Indian Origin (PIO) card by the Embassy of India, Brussels, Belgium on August 21, 2006 on the basis of her marriage with an Indian national. She had legally divorced her husband in October 2011, and subsequently the PIO card issued to her on the strength of the marriage should have been cancelled, but it was not done at that time, the ministry has said.It has further said that an OCI card was inadvertently issued to her in 2017 even though she was not married to an Indian citizen or an OCI card holder at that time.The ministry has also claimed that the woman's OCI status has not been cancelled yet and she was only requested to surrender the card.It has said that a reasonable opportunity shall be given to her to explain her stand before taking any action to cancel her registration as OCI cardholder.The ministry has said that foreigners like the petitioners may apply for a visa under the prevailing laws and rules to legally stay in India.The woman has contended that asking her to surrender her OCI card has no basis in law and "also violates the twin doctrines of legitimate expectation and promissory estoppel for the simple reason that she was already divorced when she received her OCI card on February 15, 2017.She has said in her petition that she received the OCI card when the Indian government merged the Person of Indian Origin (POI) and OCI schemes."Hence, the concerned provisions of the Citizenship Act by way of which a foreign national married to an Indian citizen loses her right to hold an OCI card in case of divorce have no application to her whatsoever," she has claimed in her plea.She had received her POI card in 2006 and it was valid till August 2021, the petition has said and added that she had divorced her husband in 2011 which was communicated to the Indian embassy in Belgium in 2016.        She has also said that she has a daughter, who holds an OCI card, with her ex-husband and since during the prevailing pandemic tourist travel to India is not possible, their only hope of coming here to meet relatives was the OCI card."There is also the very real chance that if the daughter of the petitioner travels to India and is stranded because of some sudden travel restrictions that might be imposed, the petitioner might end up getting separated from her on a medium-term basis," the petition has said.

09-04-2021||New Delhi||Two youths held in south Delhi locality for robbing people using monkeys||Two men were arrested for allegedly using monkeys to threaten and rob people in south Delhi's Malviya Nagar area, police said on Friday.The accused duo, Balwan Nath (26) and Vikram Nath (23), were waiting near the Chirag Delhi bus stand with their two monkeys when the police team nabbed them on Thursday, they said.The police said the two monkeys have been deposited with the Wildlife SOS centre.The accused, who are residents of Okhla Mor in the city, along with their third associate, Ajay used monkeys to threaten people and rob them of their valuables, police said, adding efforts are being taken to catch hold of Ajay, who is still absconding.The accused men had caught the monkeys from the Tughlakabad Fort jungle around three months ago.The matter came to light on March 2, when an advocate from Khirki Extension reported that three men carrying monkeys surrounded them and forcefully robbed Rs 6,000 from him, according to police.When the lawyer was sitting in an auto-rickshaw, the duo made the monkeys sit inside the vehicle with one in the front and the other at the back seat and demanded money from him. When the advocate took out the wallet, the duo robbed him and escaped.Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said, "A case was registered under Indian Penal Code Sections 392 (punishment for robbery) and 34 (acts are done are done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) at Malviya Nagar police station and since it was a peculiar incident involving monkeys, a dedicated team was constituted to nab the culprits." Further, relevant provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 were added against the accused in the case, he said.The team scanned through several CCTV footages and conducted raids in and around Delhi based on inputs from sources and informers, the officer said."On Thursday, our team got a tip-off that two men with monkeys were present at Chirag Delhi bus stand who had committed the robbery earlier and could commit further thefts. We acted upon the information and apprehended them along with the two monkeys," the officer said.During interrogation, the duo confessed to their involvement in the incident along with their associate Ajay who is absconding, he said.The arrested accused are being further interrogated for their other involvements if any, police said.

While our nation is facing vaccine starvation, more than 6 crore doses of vaccines have been exported.”The PM on Thursday said some people were playing politics on vaccines.“Was the export of vaccines also an “oversight”, like many other decisions of this government, or an effort to garner publicity at the cost of our own citizens?” Gandhi retorted on Friday, after non-BJP-ruled states - Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Delhi - sought more say in vaccine strategy, including expansion of vaccine plan, which currently covers only 45-plus people.The PM on Thursday defended the strategy saying it was in coherence with global practice of prioritisation. The PM told CMs to saturate current eligible people first and focus on testing.The PM said vaccine is a long-term strategy and testing is key to Covid containment.The Congress, however, has been demanding vaccine for all.Gandhi on Friday accused the PM of undermining the efforts of scientists through “poor implementation and oversight”. Gandhi said India had achieved abundant experience in designing and executing some of the world's biggest vaccination programmes and yet  in the present case, we have managed to fully vaccinate less than 1 per cent of the population in three months while nations with sizeable populations have managed to vaccinate relatively many more people. “The state governments are repeatedly highlighting vaccine shortages only to receive intemperate statements by the Union Health Minister targeting Opposition-ruled states, undercutting cooperative federalism which you too have stressed as essential,” Gandhi said as Congress-ruled Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh continue to see severe surge in daily cases that reached beyond 1.31 lakh on Friday. Questioning the vaccine export policy, Gandhi said, “Was the export of vaccines also an oversight or an effort to garner publicity at the cost of our own citizens?”Noting that centralisation and individualised propaganda are counter-productive, Gandhi said since public health is a state subject, states must get a say in vaccine plans.“States have been bypassed right from vaccine procurement to registration. Additionally, a large section of the poor has been excluded due to the initial mandatory online registration,” he said, demanding support to vaccine makers to enhance production, fast-track approval to pending vaccines, doubling of vaccine budget and expansion of vaccines to those who need it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/halt-covid-jab-export-open-vaccination-to-all-who-need-it-rahul-tells-pm-236825

09-04-2021||Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh)||Scientists predict second Covid wave to peak from April 15-20; decline by end of May||Scientists are now working on a mathematical model to examine the Covid-19 spread and have predicted that the current second wave will peak somewhere between April 15-20 and then see a decline.The number of 'active' symptomatic cases during this period would hit a high, roughly a week later, at the same level of around 10 lakh cases that the country had seen in September last year, said the scientists.They have predicted after using a mathematical model that the ongoing second-wave of Covid-19 pandemic across the country may see a steep decline by the end of May.During the first wave of Covid-19 infections across India, the mathematical approach, named 'SUTRA', predicted that the initial surge of infections in August would peak by September and lower in February 2021.Scientists, including Prof Manindra Agrawal from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, applied the model to predict the trajectory of the current surge in infections and found that the number of daily new infections was likely to peak in mid-April for this ongoing pandemic wave.Prof Agrawal in the IIT's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, was involved with the national 'super model' initiative, and said that the peak is expected to see between 80,000-90,000 new infections per day."We will cross the peak (during April 15-20) and then there will be a sharp drop over the next 15-20 days," said Agrawal.The national 'super model' had in October last year predicted the pandemic can be controlled by early 2021 with "minimal active symptomatic infections" in February.Asked about the possible explanation of the second wave, Agrawal said there were two reasons or possibly the combination of the two, that might explain what changed in February, which could make it for the sharp rise.He said that it could be due to gatherings linked to opening up of schools, colleges and other working areas where people became comparatively more careless, and the fact that there are some mutations, which are spreading faster.However, like with the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the trajectory of fresh infections would depend on a lot of other factors, including measures rolled out by the government and adherence to safety protocols by the public.A warning in the original prediction by the expert committee in their super model may still apply if the number of Covid-19 cases starts declining in the fourth week of April.The warning was: "However, this number will start rising again if proper practices of masking, disinfecting, tracing, and quarantine are not followed. The downward trend will continue only if we continue with above practices." In the mathematical model used to predict the Covid wave, there are parameters which measure the rate of spread or the contact rate which may explain how many people could be infected on an average by one infected person.Agrawal noted that the model uses three main parameters to predict the course of the pandemic.The first is called Beta, or contact rate, which measures how many people an infected person infects per day. It is related to the R-naught value, which is the number of people an infected person spreads the virus to over the course of their infection.The other two parameters, he explained, are 'Reach', which is a measure of exposure level of the population to the pandemic, and 'Epsilon', which is the ratio of detected and undetected cases."The contact rate had doubled in March and that may be contributing to the very steep rise," said Agrawal.The 'super model' in October had come out with 'conditional' prediction. It had predicted that the Covid-19 would be completely under control provided people continue to observe the same precautions such as practices of masking, disinfecting, tracing, and quarantine However, the IIT Kanpur professor added that the prediction of the new peak is sensitive to the daily new infections data.Even a little bit of change each day, causes the peak numbers to change by several thousand numbers."The reason we had to introduce 'Reach' is that unlike earlier pandemics, which start at a location and suddenly spread fast across a place, but in Covid the spread of the pandemic has been slower due to the many protective measures in place," Agrawal explained.He further said that the 'Epsilon' helps factor in the number of asymptomatic infections across the country. "We try to estimate the undetected and asymptomatic infections," he added.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scientists-predict-second-covid-wave-to-peak-from-april-15-20-decline-by-end-of-may-236806

09-04-2021||Washington||India has accelerated work on Chabahar Port, likely to be declared operational by May: US Congressional report||After a brief halt, India accelerated the work on Chabahar Port early this year and the strategic Iranian port is expected to be operational by next month, a Congressional report has said.In 2015, India agreed to help develop Iran's Chabahar Port and an associated railway that would enable India to trade with Afghanistan unimpeded by Pakistan, the independent Congressional Research Service (CRS) said in its latest report for the members of the US Congress.Prepared for the lawmakers for them to take informed decision, the report, running into nearly 100 pages, said that in May 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Iran and signed an agreement to invest USD 500 million to develop the port and related infrastructure.Even though the Trump administration gave India the "Afghanistan reconstruction" exception from its punitive Iranian sanctions, India largely stopped work on the project until late 2020."It accelerated work in early 2021 and the port is expected to be declared operational no later than May 2021," said the CRS report.CRS reports are prepared by experts and are not considered official report of the US Congress.Iran's economy is highly integrated into those of its immediate neighbours in South Asia, it said, adding that India cites the UN Security Council resolutions as its guideline for policy towards Iran.During 2011-2016, when UN sanctions were in force on Iran, India's central bank ceased using a Tehran-based regional body, the Asian Clearing Union, to handle transactions with Iran, and the two countries agreed to settle half of India's oil buys from Iran in Indian currency.India reduced its imports of Iranian oil substantially after 2011, but, after the sanctions were eased in 2016, India's oil imports from Iran increased to as much as 800,000 bpd in July 2018 - well above 2011 levels.India paid Iran the USD 6.5 billion it owed for oil purchased during 2012-2016. India has not imported Iranian oil since May 2019.The CRS said Iran's economic relations with Pakistan are less extensive than are its economic ties with India.One test of Pakistan's compliance with the sanctions was a pipeline project that would carry Iranian gas to Pakistan - a USD 7 billion project that US officials on several occasions stated would be subject to ISA sanctions.Iran reportedly completed the pipeline on its side of the border but, during Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's visit to Pakistan in March 2016, Pakistan did not commit to complete the line. In 2009, India dissociated itself from the project, it said.

Accordingly, India sent one lakh doses of vaccines to Paraguay, he added. Taiwan’s Foreign Minister said, “In the last few weeks, we have been speaking to like-minded countries and India fortunately has been able to provide some vaccines to Paraguay.”The government in Paraguay had needed urgent help as there had been street protests over its handling of the health crisis. India had sent the one lakh doses on March 26 as “gift”.“The most important trend is the Indian government who is willing to help and the US who has decided they want to help. I think this is going to relieve a lot of pressure for a lot of countries,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-denies-it-midwifed-paraguay-vaccine-supplies-on-taiwans-request-236726

Mamata was referring to “Didi o Didi” taunt by Modi, which has become a common feature at the latter’s election rallies in West Bengal.The phrase “Didi o Didi” has become a hit with the BJP supporters. “Have you ever seen a Prime Minister doing so? Does it look nice?” Mamata asked those gathered at her rally in Domjur in Howrah district of West Bengal. She then narrated the story of a toad mother that kept blowing herself up till she burst. “Don’t cross the Laxman Rekha, nor will I do it,” Mamata said.‘Let EC slap notices, will speak my mind’You (EC) can issue 10 showcause notices to me but my reply will be the same. I will always speak against any division in Hindu, Muslim votes. I will always stand against division of voters along religious lines. —Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal CM“We believe that certain amount of courtesy should be maintained in politics. But the BJP has abandoned all courtesy. The Prime Minister and the Home Minister are running everything with the help of agencies,” Mamata said.Continuing her speech Mamata used a torrent of adjectives against the BJP. She called the BJP a party of rioters and racketeers and liars and cheats ad frauds. Local BJP candidate Rajib Banerjee, who switched to the BJP from the TMC, was called “Mir Jafar” by her. Mamata said if Rajib’s security was forfeited in the April 10 poll in Domjur, she would personally visit the constituency after the results and fulfil all demands of locals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-cross-the-line-mamata-to-modi-over-didi-taunt-236526

India is honoured to be a partner of Seychelles in the development of its security capabilities and in meeting its infrastructural and developmental needs,” the PM said during a virtual summit with Wavel Ramkalawan, the recently-elected Indian-origin President of Seychelles.The game planIndia also handed over a new, indigenous Fast Patrol Vessel (FPV) to the Seychelles Coast Guard to help protect maritime resources. Both leaders also inaugurated several projects, including a new magistrates’ court building, a mini-solar plant and 10 high impact community development projects.India is currently negotiating with Seychelles for taking an island on lease, presumably to set up a naval base on this strategically located Indian Ocean island-country.India seemed set for taking the Resumption Island on lease from Seychelles when Modi visited the country in 2015 andsigned a pact with Ramkalawan’s predecessor. But Bihar-origin Ramkalawan’s party in coalition with three other parties shot down the agreement on environmental grounds.

Born in Srinagar, Punjabi was conferred with the Padma Shri in 2011.An avid writer, Punjabi’s work touched the areas of peace studies, human rights, composite culture, inter-religious conflicts and rise of fundamentalism in South Asia and Sufism. In public life as well as in private, friends recall that Punjabi, a man unapologetically fond of his drink, was also nonchalant about his stout defence of Kashmiriyat and strong opposition to using violence to achieve political ends.Punabi was also well conversant with the Sikh faith and had written a book on the spiritual content of Guru Granth Sahib. “He was a genuinely liberal Kashmiri. If you can believe that somebody is secular, he was one of them,” said Harpal Bedi, a journalist.

The key is to stress testing as much and even more than vaccines.

The PM urged the states to first reach 100 per cent saturation of eligible people.“Vaccination is a long-term strategy. Some people are playing politics on the issue.”He said Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, MP, Gujarat and other states had crossed the previous peak, which was a matter of “concern”. “People have become casual and the administrations too are looking lazy,” he said.

The top court also took note of the fact that what had been directed was only a preliminary enquiry, albeit by an independent agency.The Bench noted that the then Home Minister Deshmukh and the then Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh were working together closely till they fell apart. “The parties were hunky dory... Let the CBI do its job,” it said rejecting the petitions. There were three PILs in the HC seeking a CBI probe against Deshmukh who allegedly asked police officers, including suspended cop Sachin Waze, to extort Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants.

09-04-2021||New Delhi||Middleman had classified MoD info||In a startling revelation, a French media house has claimed that an Indian business intermediary was secretly paid millions of euros by Dassault Aviation, maker of Rafale fighter jets, and French defence electronics firm Thales. The French team had succeeded in removing the anti-corruption clauses from the fighter contract.French media house ‘Mediapart’ published the third and final part of the series on the Rafale deal. It said: “Mediapart has obtained a number of confidential documents from the ED (Indian Enforcement Directorate) case file, which shed new light on the behind-the-scenes events of the Rafale deal”.“Dassault and Thales paid Sushen Gupta several million euros in secret commissions to offshore accounts and shell companies, using inflated invoices for software consulting,” said the report. These payments were besides the questionable contract, , worth 1 million euros, with Dassault for making replica models of Rafale jets.According to information gained by Mediapart, Gupta obtained confidential documents from the Indian Defence Ministry on the dispute between India and France over the purchase costs of Rafale.The report said, in August 2015, “Indian negotiators concluded, in a confidential report, that the overall purchase price for the jets, including their weaponry, should be 5.06 billion euros. But in January 2016, Dassault proposed more than double the price: 10.7 billion euros, excluding the missile equipment.” “For the French camp, Sushen Gupta’s assistance was to prove precious. He obtained confidential documents from the Indian Defence Ministry on the subject of the dispute over the purchase costs. These included the minutes of meetings by the Indian negotiating team.The report said the Indian Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that there were insufficient grounds for opening an investigation into the matter. But that decision was made without the information gathered in the probe by the ED in another case. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/middleman-had-classified-mod-info-236449

I understand that because of the one-year battle, the system can experience tiredness and there can be laxity, but we must tighten it for 2-3 weeks and strengthen the governance,” he said.Modi emphasised on ‘Test, Track, Treat’, Covid-appropriate behaviour and Covid management to contain the pandemic.Along with public participation, our hard-working doctors and health-care staff have helped a lot in handling the situation and are still doing it, he said.“With administration appearing lax in many states, rise in cases has increased problems. To stop the spread of the virus, there is a need to work on a war-footing,” he said.The daily count of positive cases has reached a new record high of over 1.26 lakh, despite having dipped to about 20,000 a few weeks back.At a high-level meeting with senior officials, Prime Minister Modi had on Sunday reviewed the COVID-19 situation and vaccination exercise in the country amid the “alarming rate of growth” in infections and deaths.Modi had said the five-fold strategy of testing, tracing, treatment, COVID-appropriate behaviour and vaccination, if implemented with utmost seriousness and commitment, would be effective in curbing the spread of the pandemic, according to an official statement that was released after the meeting.

We are not inclined to interfere," a Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said for dismissing the petitions filed by Deshmukh and the Maharashtra government.On behalf of Deshmukh and Maharashtra government, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Manu Singhvi contended that a CBI probe can't be ordered on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations."There has to be some element of truth. There has been no case where a CBI inquiry has been ordered based on the basis of an unsubstantiated allegation. Jaishree Patil (petitioner before HC) copied the entire statement of Param Bir Singh and filed a petition. She has cut copy-pasted his letter and on the basis of this, CBI preliminary enquiry were ordered," Sibal submitted.Singhvi argued that the state government wasn't heard before the high court ordered the CBI probe.The Bench noted that the then Home Minister Deshmukh and the then Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh were working together closely till they fell apart. "The parties were hunky dory... Let the CBI do its job," it said. A day after the Bombay High Court ordered a CBI probe into former Bombay Police chief Param Bir Singh's allegations of corruption against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, the state government and the NCP leader had on Tuesday filed separate petitions in the Supreme Court against the high court order.In its order, the Bombay High Court had said even though the state government ordered a high-level committee to probe into the allegations, an inquiry based on Patil's complaint was necessary as per the law.Since the police investigating complaints against the home minister and a serving police officer would not be most appropriate, it is a fit case for ordering a CBI probe, it had noted. The high court had asked the CBI director to conduct a preliminary enquiry (PE) based on Patil's complaint and a letter written by Param Bir Singh to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray that Patil had attached to her complaint. The high court said the CBI need not immediately register an FIR, but it must complete its PE within 15 days and then decide on further course of action.Such allegations, made by a serving police officer, against the state home minister could not be left unattended, and were required to be probed into, if prima facie, they made a case of a cognisable offence, the high court said.A probe by an independent agency was necessary in the case, to "instil public confidence and safeguard the Fundamental Rights of the citizens," it had said.Courts were committed to ensuring the rule of law and preventing any breach of constitutional principles, irrespective of the high office an accused occupied, the HC had noted.There were three PILs in the HC seeking a CBI probe against Deshmukh who allegedly asked police officers, including suspended cop Sachin Vaze, to extort Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants. Deshmukh denied the allegations. In his petition before the SC, Deshmukh sought to assail the high court’s order, contending it was passed without hearing him and ignoring the fact that Maharashtra government has revoked the general consent given to CBI.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-dismisses-pleas-of-maharashtra-govt-deshmukh-against-hc-order-for-cbi-probe-into-allegations-by-mumbai-ex-cp-236374

Described Rohingyas as “absolutely illegal migrants”, the Centre submitted in an affidavit that they posed serious threats to India’s national security.Days after authorities in Jammu detained Rohingyas immigrants as part of the process to deport them, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court by Mohammad Salimullah, a Rohingya refugee, seeking directions for their immediate release and to restrain the Centre from deporting them.The total number of Rohingyas in Jammu is estimated to be more than 6,500.There are several petitions in SC demanding deportation of over 40,000 Rohingyas, who fled to India after violence in the Western Rakhine State of Myanmar and are settled in Jammu, Hyderabad, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi-NCR and Rajasthan.On behalf of Rohingyas, advocate Prashant Bhushan had said their children were subjected to killing, maiming and sexual exploitation and Military in Myanmar has failed to respect international humanitarian law.Registered as refugees under the United Nations High Commission of Refugees (UNHCR), Salimullah had moved the top court in 2017 challenging the Centre’s move to deport Rohingya immigrants on the ground that the decision violated international human right conventions and right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.Citing the MHA’s August 8, 2017 letter to all the Chief Secretaries of all the State Governments/UT Administrations, raising a concern regarding the increased ‘illegal immigrants’ in India and their purported ‘grave security challenge’, Salimullah had said he faced an imminent danger of being deported.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-refuses-to-stop-deportation-of-rohingyas-236357

09-04-2021||Melbourne/Wellington||New Zealand suspends entry for travellers from India due to high Covid cases||New Zealand has for the first time imposed a temporary ban on travellers coming from India, including its citizens, from April 11 to 28 due to a surge in COVID-19 cases among visitors to this country, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Thursday.The travel restriction comes after New Zealand recorded 23 new positive coronavirus cases in managed isolation on Thursday, of which 17 came from India, Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield was quoted as saying by media reports.While arrivals from India had triggered the risk assessment, Prime Minister Ardern said the government would be looking at risks posed by other COVID-19 hotspot countries.The ban will begin from 4 pm local time on April 11 and will be in place until April 28, she said.“This is not a permanent arrangement but rather a temporary measure,” Ardern said, adding that the temporary hold would also help reduce the risk that travellers themselves faced.The ban covers all travellers, including New Zealand citizens and permanent residents. While there have been previous travel bans on travellers from some countries, New Zealand has never suspended travel to New Zealand citizens and residents, Ardern said, adding that she “absolutely understands the difficulty that this temporary suspension will cause” for Kiwis in India.“But I also feel a sense of responsibility and obligation to find ways to reduce risks that travellers are experiencing,” she said.“We have looked into whether we have issues with the accuracy of pre-departure tests - that has not demonstrated that is where the problem lies, so this suspension gives us a bit of time to look at the issue more generally,” she said.Ardern said New Zealand is not looking at temporarily suspending travel from other high-risk countries.“We’re seeing surges in other places, but we just don’t have the higher number of travellers from those places.”                 Health teams would use the time until April 28 to try and plan safer ways to accept travellers from India. But there were no guarantees officials would come up with a better solution, she said.“We haven’t identified anything obvious ... but we have to try and do better,” Ardern said.She wanted to look at the quality of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 testing in other countries and whether tests were being taken in the 72 hours before departure.Ardern said she could not answer whether the halt on arrivals from India would last longer than April 28.New Zealand has not reported any community transmission locally for about 40 days.COVID-19 cases were spiking again, particularly in India and Brazil, and New Zealand was not immune, Ardern said.The government had been reviewing its border settings in recent weeks, Ardern said, adding that ultimately New Zealand wanted to see fewer cases arriving in the country.COVID-19 cases in India hit a record high. India recorded 1,12,389 new cases on Wednesday, according to a PTI tally, taking the overall count to  1,29,14,174.  The single-day rise in coronavirus cases breached the one-lakh mark for the third time in four days. India saw a record daily rise on Tuesday, with over 1.15 lakh new infections.Auckland Indian Association president Narendrabhai Bhana said he had no problem with the New Zealand government’s decision to temporarily suspend flights from India.“We do realise that there are a large number of Covid cases in India at the moment,” he said. “It’s for the safety of our Kiwi citizens.“We really have no problem with the New Zealand Government suspending flights from India until we can get on top of it,” Bhana was quoted as saying by the New Zealand Herald.According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the coronavirus has infected 2,531 people and killed 26 in New Zealand.
