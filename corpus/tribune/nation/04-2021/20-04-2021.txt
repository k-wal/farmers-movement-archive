20-04-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||US may ease Covid vaccine raw material crunch||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 20India’s vaccine production has continued to remain at suboptimal levels despite a conversation between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.“We have taken up the issue very strongly with the US authorities,” said sources, adding that they were expecting a resolution of the US ban on exports of raw materials for vaccines that has hit their manufacturing in India.The White House skirted questions on the request by Serum Institute of India (SII) to lift the export ban on certain raw materials needed for ramping up production of COVID-19 vaccine. At the same time, sources here said shortage of raw material was not the only issue hobbling the SII’s production capacity. “His statements are partly drama-driven out of different compulsions,” they added.Readouts by both Foreign Offices show that the subject was discussed by Jaishankar and Blinken. But the US State Department mentioned it in the passing along with climate change and “other global issues”.  Jaishankar said he “also discussed issues pertaining to our health cooperation”.Hours later, Jaishankar said he was pushing other countries, particularly “some big ones”, to keep raw material flowing for vaccines being manufactured in India.The White House also did not directly take on Serum Institute of India’s allegation that the Biden administration is blocking exports of raw materials that it needs to make Covid vaccines.White House spokesperson Jen Psaki also did not directly comment when asked for more details on reports that the Biden administration recently told India that its request to lift a US embargo on exporting vaccine raw materials would be acted ‘at the earliest’.Washington has invoked the Defense Production Act to preserve vaccine raw materials for its own companies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-may-ease-covid-vaccine-raw-material-crunch-241768
20-04-2021||London||Confusion, panic over India's 'red list' travel ban by UK||Hundreds of Indian students and UK-based Indian-origin families have been sent into a mode of confusion and panic with India being added to Britain's COVID-19 travel "red list", which imposes a ban on entry to the country for all except British or Irish residents.The red list status, which is effective from 4 am local time on Friday, came amid a spike in coronavirus infections in India and also resulted in British Prime Minister Boris Johnson cancelling his planned visit to New Delhi next week. The ban means that those with valid residency rights returning to the UK after the deadline on Friday face the additional financial burden of compulsory hotel quarantine and tests costs, estimated at around 2,000 pounds per person."There's a fair amount of confusion in the Indian community about the rules and what these mean for them. Significant concern is being raised about the cost of quarantine as well as how the new restrictions impact student eligibility for the Graduate visa route for which they need to be in country by particular dates,” said Sanam Arora, Chair of the National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK (NISAU-UK), a representative group for Indian students in the UK."Students were due to travel for their final semesters or indeed for new terms commencing in May. We have urgently written to the Home Office to clarify all these concerns and queries,” she said.The foremost concern among students is that they receive their valid residency permits only on arrival in the UK, which throws their eligibility to enter the UK on a valid visa into doubt. The Home Office had already extended the deadline period for the physical campus presence requirements for students to be able to apply for the new Graduate or post-study work visa later this year. However, many are now not only concerned if that extension will suffice but also the added financial burden that the quarantine requirements add to their planned costs."I was aware of the risks when I planned this trip but the hype and panic doesn't help. It's just so stressful," said one British Indian who had travelled to be with family and now finds herself stranded in the Delhi curfew.India's addition to the travel "red list" was announced in the House of Commons on Monday amid 103 cases recorded in the UK of a new variant of coronavirus first detected in India. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that the decision had been made after studying the data and on a “precautionary basis”."That means that anyone who is not a UK or Irish resident or a British citizen cannot enter the UK if they have been in India in the previous 10 days. UK and Irish residents and British citizens who have been in India in the 10 days before their arrival will need to complete hotel quarantine for 10 days from the time of arrival,” said Hancock.The Opposition Labour Party questioned the minister about details around the transmissibility and vaccine response of the so-called Indian variant B.1.617."A new double-mutation variant is reportedly more potent, and dozens of cases have been detected here in the UK, too. To assuage community concerns, will the Health Secretary clarify that our vaccines are effective against this new variant,” asked Labour's Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi.Hancock responded: “We simply do not know that. We are acting on a precautionary basis."The core of my concern about the variant first found in India is that the vaccines may be less effective in terms of transmission and of reducing hospitalisation and death. It is the same concern that we have with the variant first found in South Africa and is the core reason why we took the [travel ban] decision.” Jonathan Ashworth, shadow health secretary and MP from Leicester – a city with a large Indian diaspora population, raised concerns about his constituents with ties to the region who would need to return to their homes."I hope that there will be support and help in place for constituents such as mine who are legally in India and want to return,” he said.Meanwhile, scientists are divided over whether the Indian variant indeed is more serious than some of the other variants."This variant has a couple of potentially concerning mutations but these are probably not as serious as some of the mutations present in the variants first seen in Kent, South Africa and Brazil," said Dr Jeffrey Barrett, director of the COVID-19 genomics initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in London.

20-04-2021||New Delhi||Judicial backlog: SC paves way for appointment of ad-hoc judges in high courts||As lakhs of cases remain pending in 25 high courts across India, the Supreme Court Tuesday paved the way for the appointment of retired judges as ad-hoc judges to clear the judicial backlog.A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde laid down guidelines for the appointment of ad hoc judges in high courts under Article 224A of the Constitution to deal with judicial pendency of specific categories of cases. Those appointed as ad-hoc judges would get emoluments and allowances on a par with a permanent Judge of that court minus the pension, the top court ordered. Ad hoc judges will be entitled to allowance/perks/perquisites as available to permanent/additional Judge(s), it added. Their tenure may vary on the basis of the need but generally it should be for two to three years, it said. The top court asked the Union Law Ministry to act in tandem with high courts and submit a progress report to it in four months when it will take up the matter again. Noting that India faced a “docket explosion” where it’s difficult to adjudicate on disputes within a reasonable period of time, the top court said, “This crisis situation must be tackled. Some innovation is always the rule of the game. We are faced with the ground reality of almost 40 per cent vacancies remaining in the regular appointments over the last two years”.The order came on a PIL filed by ‘Lok Prahari’ seeking appointment of ad-hoc judges to clear pendency of cases. The Chief Justice of a High Court may initiate the process of recommending a name if the judges’ vacancies is more than 20 per cent of the sanctioned strength, cases in a particular category are pending for more than five years, more than 10 per cent of pending cases are more than five years old, or the rate of disposal is lower than the filing of the cases either in a particular subject matter or generally in the court, the top court said.The Chief Justice of such a high court should prepare a panel of judges after a personal interaction with the judge concerned and taking their consent, it added.The ad hoc judges’ appointments would follow the procedure laid down in the Memorandum of Procedure for appointment of judges and since the nominees were former judges their names need not be sent to the IB or other agencies for clearance, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/judicial-backlog-sc-paves-way-for-appointment-of-ad-hoc-judges-in-high-courts-241766

20-04-2021||New Delhi||Percentage of COVID-19 patients requiring critical care, oxygen down from 2 days ago: Harsh Vardhan||The percentage of COVID-19 patients requiring critical care and oxygen support has gone down as compared to two days ago, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Tuesday after a review meeting with some premier hospitals in the country.  He said that as compared to the figures two days ago, the percentage of COVID-19 patients in ICU is down from 1.93 per cent to 1.75 per cent, those on ventilators down from 0.43 per cent to 0.40 per cent, and those requiring oxygen down from 4.29 per cent to 4.03 per cent.According to a Health Ministry statement, he said these figures do not diminish the fact that there is anxiety in the general population about availability of beds. It is also important for the nation as a commune to access the best medical facilities at all places.Vardhan, who chaired a meeting with the Directors of 10 AIIMS, PGIMER-Chandigarh and JIPMER-Puducherry to discuss the public health response to the pandemic, said, "We are the fastest globally to vaccinate. The fatality rate of 1.18 per cent is one of the lowest in the word and is continuously dipping. The present indicators tell us about the significant control we still have on the emerging situation." He requested the directors to ensure that those who need hospital care are provided thus and those who are in need of oxygen/ventilators are also tended to, the statement stated.He also asked the officials to explore avenues to monitor patients who may not need hospitalisation through telephonic counselling to re-assure them out of their helplessness.In this regard, he also said, "AIIMS have a special responsibility towards providing quality healthcare. You have to ensure that all the hospital facilities are functional. The present capacities can be augmented by re-purposing non-COVID infrastructure to COVID facilities, such that non-COVID healthcare is not unduly affected." He reminded them that the Union Health Secretary had advised for the strengthening of the hospital infrastructure after careful review.Vardhan observed that all the institutes combined have increased 879 general beds and 219 ICU beds. In this regard, he also spoke of the recent attempt by DRDO to open a 500-bed facility in Delhi and the Council Of Scientific and Industrial Research-Central Building Research Institute (CSIR–CBRI)'s attempts to make temporary but durable hospital blocks at the Safdarjung Hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College to house more patients, the statement said.He informed that the AIIMS National Institute of Cancer (NIC) in Jhajjar had added 100 beds to its COVID Block while approximately 80 beds were added at JPNATC, AIIMS New Delhi at his request.Asserting that the recent COVID-19 surge is spreading fast and needs immediate attention, Vardhan detailed efforts to tackle the pandemic so far."In the shortest possible time, we ramped up testing from 1 lab to 2467 labs today with a capacity of more than 15 lakh tests per day, set up hospital infrastructure including COVID Care Centres, COVID hospitals with oxygen beds and ventilator bed."More than 12,000 quarantine centres were established. We also overcame the need for PPE kits, N95 masks. This helped to tide over the pandemic last year," he was quoted as saying in the statement.Regarding the shortage in hands at the hospitals, Vardhan said, “We have to develop our manpower and human resources. Those who are in other departments and units can be used for COVID care with building their skills and capacities with training for a very short duration. Everyone is looking at AIIMS for inspiration and your guidance and support. People respect AIIMS for their professional expertise." Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan laid out his suggestions to the directors of the different institutes.In view of the need to increase oxygen beds and ICU beds in the possibility of a surge, the Union government has already written to the states for supporting the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in their jurisdiction. He suggested that the unutilised hostel blocks, AUYSH block, hostel beds can be used for additional bed capacity to tide over the crisis.

20-04-2021||New Delhi||Satellite-based real-time monitoring of Himalayan glacial catchments can strengthen early flood warning:  Study||Satellite-based real-time monitoring of Himalayan glacial catchments would improve understanding of flood risk in the region and help inform an early flood warning system that could help curb disaster and save human lives, according to a recent study.This should be the future strategy to reduce loss of human lives during glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF), said the study carried out by scientists from IIT Kanpur.The study by Tanuj Shukla and Indra Sekhar Sen, Associate Professor from IIT Kanpur, with support from the Department of Science and Technology has been published in the international journal ‘Science’.Temperature and the numbers of extreme rainfall events are rising at an increased rate because of climate change.Called the Earth’s “Third Pole”, the Himalayan region is home to the largest ice mass outside of the planet’s polar regions. The glaciers in the Himalayas are melting at a faster rate creating new lakes and expanding the existing ones. Besides, the rising temperatures and extreme precipitation events make the region increasingly prone to a variety of natural hazards, including devastating GLOFs.GLOFs occur when either a natural dam containing a glacial lake bursts or when the lake’s level suddenly increases and overflows its banks, leading to catastrophic downstream destruction.In 2013, an avalanche caused the glacial moraine holding back Chorabari Lake in Uttarakhand, releasing a sudden torrent of water, boulders, and debris that scoured the river valley below, resulting in the deaths of more than 5,000 people.With climate change, these events are likely to increase in frequency and magnitude throughout the Himalayas. However, the remote, challenging Himalayan terrain and the overall lack of cellular connectivity throughout the region have made the development of early flood warning systems virtually impossible.In their work, the scientists also point out that the surge of meltwater in mountain streams is most commonly caused by cloud-burst events during the monsoon season (June–July–August) time frame.However, the recent (February 7) sudden surge of meltwater in the river tributary of the Ganga, Dhauli Ganga, during the dry season suggests that this time frame needs to be expanded.The catastrophe in the upper Dhauli Ganga basin is linked to processes other than precipitation events, such as snow avalanches, rock landslides, or other unidentified drivers, and therefore determining all of the potential major and minor drivers behind sudden surges of meltwater into headwater streams is vital for understanding the hazard profile of the region.The IIT Kanpur team suggests that efforts to help mitigate GLOF events in the future should include the creation of a network of satellite-based monitoring stations that could provide in situ and real-time data on GLOF risk.“The integration of monitoring devices with satellite networks will not only provide telemetry support in remote locations that lack complete cellular connectivity but will also provide greater connectivity in coverage in the cellular dead zones in extreme topographies such as valleys, cliffs, and steep slopes,” the authors explained. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/satellite-based-real-time-monitoring-of-himalayan-glacial-catchments-can-strengthen-early-flood-warning-%C2%A0study-241757

Taking advantage of that, a wrong message has gone to society that the parents can easily escape from their liability and the alleged offence,” Justice P Velmurugan has said.The parents should not stop with providing shelter and good education to their children and motivate them to get a job alone.Their first and foremost responsibility is that they should groom their children as responsible citizens, the judge added while dismissing a criminal miscellaneous petition from the parents of a person who were sentenced to two years’ Rigorous Imprisonment in a dowry harassment case, where their daughter-in-law allegedly committed suicide.The court said there has been an increase in instances of women committing suicide due to dowry harassment.On the other hand, the in-laws were escaping from their liability, saying that they were not living with their son.Even though they lived separately, they induced their sons to get dowry in the form of money or jewelry, two or four-wheelers, the judge noted.“Given the nature and gravity of the offence committed by the accused, this Court is not inclined to suspend the sentence,” the judge said and posted the main appeal challenging the sentence to April 28. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-laws-cannot-be-left-out-in-bride-suicide-cases-hc-241750

The government should ensure that such provocative videos propagating falsified information should be admonished.”“On behalf of the medical fraternity, and all healthcare and frontline workers we demand strongly that strictest steps be taken against his inappropriate conduct at the earliest to prevent unrest amongst doctors and anxiety amongst the affected patients and their family,” the RDA letter stated.

The situation seems overwhelming once again, but this time we are better informed about the threat we are dealing with. We’ve the tools to tackle it,” he added.The health minister further said the crisis “shook us to the core”, but it has also emboldened the resolve to rise up to the challenge together. “Today, India is reporting another spike of COVID-19 in many states. It is an extremely challenging task to contain a virus as contagious as this in a country like ours which has a very high population density in big cities and towns,” he said.However, the minister said the government is much better prepared than it was in 2020 and is doing everything it can to bring the crisis under control with timely steps to break the chain of transmission and to expend the vaccination drive.Vardhan also welcomed a suggestion to build a ‘statue of immunity’ and also a centre for studies in immunity. He said affordability, accessibility and equity are the key pillars in the healthcare rendering strategy, and acknowledged that a lot of work would not have been possible without technological advancements. The minister also lauded the role played by the healthcare workers over the last 14 months at a high physical, emotional and mental cost, adding that the country shall always be indebted to them.

20-04-2021||Lucknow||Health services have ‘collapsed’, situation worse in villages: Akhilesh Yadav on COVID surge in UP||With Uttar Pradesh battling a surge in COVID-19 cases, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday claimed that health services in the state have “collapsed” and the situation is worse in villages as compared to cities.Taking a dig at the state government for converting hospitals and other buildings built by the erstwhile SP dispensation into COVID-19 facilities, Yadav said Chief Minister Adityanath is “allergic” to the work carried out by his party during its regime.Uttar Pradesh has registered a record increase in COVID-19 cases on five of the last seven days.The state’s COVID-19 case count stands at 9,09,405 while 10,159 people have succumbed to the disease so far, according to official data. “Health services in the state have collapsed,” Yadav said in a statement issued here.The situation is bad not only in cities, it is worse in villages, where there is no one to hear the voice of the poor villagers, he claimed.Yadav further said, “The CM, who is allergic to the work carried out during the SP’s regime, is playing with the lives of the people”.The chief minister did not care about improving the health services. The Samajwadi Party had put forth this demand. But now as the situation is worsening, the government has decided to convert cancer hospital, Haj House, Awadh Shilpgram built during the SP’s regime into COVID centres, he said.“The priority of the BJP government and its CM is to be in power and win elections without caring about the spread of coronavirus even at his rallies. There is no value of people’s lives for the BJP,” he added.Yadav alleged that the BJP government has been befooling people for the last four years.“Due to the lack of coordination among administrative officers, the situation is worsening day by day,” he claimed.In another statement, Leader of Opposition in the state assembly and senior SP leader Ram Govind Chowdhury demanded the withdrawal of a state government order to impose a fine of Rs 10,000 on those found without masks for a second time.“This is a reminder of the British era and the CM should immediately roll back his decision. The Yogi government has handed over the state to vultures who are targeting the common man by realising fines and black marketing essential commodities,” he said.The party whose PM and CM attended rallies without wearing masks do not have the moral right to penalise the common man for it, Chowdhury said, referring to Modi and Adityanath addressing public meetings in states where assembly elections are underway. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/health-services-have-collapsed-situation-worse-in-villages-akhilesh-yadav-on-covid-surge-in-up-241746

20-04-2021||New Delhi||Less than 4 pc Indian farmers adopted sustainable agricultural practices: Study||Less than 4 per cent of Indian farmers have adopted sustainable agricultural practices and systems, according to a study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).The study, supported by the Food and Land Use Coalition (FOLU), found that scaling up sustainable agriculture would be critical to improve farm incomes and bolster India’s nutrition security in a climate-constrained future. States such as Andhra Pradesh and Sikkim have already taken a lead in sustainable agriculture.Speaking about sustainable agriculture, NITI-Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar said: “Embracing sustainable agriculture could not only lead to better incomes for farmers but also have multiple environmental benefits.”There is a need to rethink current agricultural practices, he said, and added, “Our focus is on promoting sustainable agriculture, especially natural farming, in India. This would benefit small and marginal farmers.” It is also suitable in drier regions of the country as it requires lesser water, he said in a statement.Asserting that India needs mainstream sustainable agriculture, CEEW CEO Arunabha Ghosh said, “We need a fundamental rethink of how we grow food and what we eat.” Sustaining agriculture has the potential to help diversify farmers’ sources of food and income, make farming climate-resilient, optimise use of natural resources and re-build ecosystems. It also offers a vital alternative to input-intensive farming, he said.“We must investigate more and follow the science,” he said and noted that for sustainable agriculture to scale, policymakers must support long-term comparative assessments of sustainable practices and conventional farming, and increase budgetary allocation to promote practices and methods that have the most promise.According to the CEEW study, organic farming has garnered the most policy attention among the eight sustainable agricultural practices receiving budgetary support under various central government programmes.However, it currently covers only 2.8 million hectares (ha) — or two per cent of India’s net sown area of 140 million ha.Natural farming is the fastest growing sustainable agricultural practice in India and has been adopted by around 800,000 farmers. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) has achieved a coverage area of 5 million ha after decades of sustained promotion.Agroforestry and rainwater harvesting, which have received significant attention in national programmes, cover 25 million ha and 20-27 million ha, respectively.Abhishek Jain, Fellow and Director at CEEW and an author of the study added, “It is imperative to broaden the national policy focus from food security to nutrition security and from merely chasing yields to valuing total farm productivity. It would not only reward farmers better, but help elevate the role of sustainable agriculture in India’s nutrition and farmers’ income security.” The CEEW-FOLU study recommended investing in capacity building and facilitating information exchange among farmers because most sustainable agricultural practices are knowledge and skill-intensive.Also, re-aligning government support to reward agricultural outcomes like annual farm productivity and resource-use efficiency would incentivise adoption of sustainable agriculture.Further, focus on rainfed areas would be particularly important to enhance farmers’ incomes and resilience in a changing climate.Finally, it would be crucial that national and state-level agriculture information systems such as the agriculture census capture and integrate data on prevalence of sustainable agriculture practices. This would help raise awareness and scale up sustainable agriculture in the country.The study is based on an in-depth review of 16 sustainable agriculture practices and systems such as organic farming, natural farming, integrated farming systems and conservation agriculture.It also included a primary survey with 180 civil society organisations promoting sustainable agriculture, as well as 40 plus consultations with stakeholders such as the government and agriculture institutions.

20-04-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi cancels Portugal visit; US puts India on ‘high concern’ list||Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cancelled his visit to Portugal next month to attend a meeting with European Union leaders even as more countries have put India on the no-fly list.Though the UK and some other countries have issued advisories against travel to and from India, it is the US advisory issued today that could have a wider impact as it is based on science-based algorithms by the prestigious Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).The ‘Travel Health Notice’ has placed India in ‘Level 4: Very high level of Covid’.The US has advised its citizens to avoid travelling to India, even if they are fully vaccinated.Meanwhile, though the MEA announced the cancellation of PM Modi’s visit to Porto, Portugal, it did not say whether the PM’s second leg to France stands.“In view of the COVID-19 situation, it has been decided, in consultation with the EU and Portuguese leadership, to hold the India-EU leaders’ meeting in a virtual format on May 8,” said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).The India-EU leaders’ meeting in the EU+27 format was to be held for the first time. Last year too, both sides had to settle for a virtual summit due to the pandemic.Barring a slight disagreement over human rights between South Block and the European Union Parliament, India-EU have shown a steady improvement especially in the security sphere.In contrast, China started off the new year brightly with a Comprehensive Agreement on Investments (CAI) with the EU. But it has ground to a halt due to tit-for-tat sanctions on alleged human rights and forced labour issues in Xinjiang. Late last month, the EU Parliament had cancelled its review meeting on the agreement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-cancels-portugal-visit-us-puts-india-on-high-concern-list-241741
20-04-2021||New Delhi||Some Delhi hospitals left with just a few hours of oxygen: Kejriwal||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday urged the Centre to provide medical oxygen to Delhi, saying some hospitals are going to run out of it in a few hours.He had on Sunday termed the shortage of oxygen for coronavirus patients an “emergency”.Kejriwal also wrote to Union Minister of Commerce and Industries Piyush Goyal, seeking his intervention in the matter.“Serious oxygen crisis persists in Delhi. I again urge the Centre to urgently provide oxygen to Delhi. Some hospitals are left with just a few hours of oxygen,” the chief minister tweeted.The Delhi government had on Monday set up a 24-member committee to ensure “rational” use of oxygen for treatment of COVID-19 patients.An order issued by the Health Department said the ‘Oxygen Audit Committee’ will identify areas of wasteful consumption.The consumption of oxygen has undergone a quantum increase with the admission of a large number of serious patients who require oxygen support, it said.

20-04-2021||New Delhi||Reliance increases supply of oxygen to over 700 tonnes a day to COVID-hit states||Billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd has tweaked manufacturing at its Jamnagar oil refineries to produce over 700 tonnes a day of medical-grade oxygen which is being supplied free of cost to states badly affected by COVID-19, sources said. The company’s Jamnagar refineries in Gujarat initially produced 100 tonnes of medical-grade oxygen, which has quickly been ramped up to over 700 tonnes, people aware of the matter said. The supplies being made to states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh will provide relief to over 70,000 critically ill patients every day. The company plans to raise medical-grade oxygen production capacity to 1,000 tonnes, sources said, without giving a timeline. An email sent to the company for comments remained unanswered. Medical-grade oxygen is not a product that was produced at the Jamnagar refineries, which convert crude oil into products such as diesel, petrol and jet fuel.But with demand for oxygen rising due to a rapid surge in coronavirus cases, Reliance has installed equipment and set up processes to produce and supply medical-grade oxygen. Sources said industrial oxygen is being diverted to produce medical-grade oxygen. “Every day nearly 700 tonnes of oxygen is being supplied to states across India. This will provide relief to over 70,000 critically ill patients daily,” one of the persons said. The entire supply of oxygen, including transportation in special tankers at minus 183 degrees Celsius is made at no cost to the state governments, sources said, adding this was a part of the company’s CSR initiative. State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) too have begun diverting oxygen produced at their refineries to supplement the availability of medical oxygen in states worst hit by COVID-19. IOC on Monday said it has “begun the supply of 150 tonnes of oxygen at no cost to various hospitals in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab”. Separately, BPCL said it has started supply of 100 tonnes of oxygen at no cost. Oil refineries can produce limited volumes of industrial oxygen in air-separation plants meant for nitrogen production. Scrubbing out other gases such as carbon dioxide can convert it into medical-use oxygen with 99.9 per cent purity.

20-04-2021||New Delhi||India can scale up COVID-19 vaccination by adopting streamlined approach using tech: Nilekani||India can scale up its COVID-19 vaccination efforts to inoculate 5-10 million people a day by adopting a streamlined approach using technology and having over 50,000 vaccination points, Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani said on Tuesday.Welcoming the government’s decision to open up vaccination to people over 18 years starting May 1, Nilekani said a lot of technology enhancements have already been made to make the system scalable that is now handling vaccination of 2-3 million people a day.“I had laid out the road map about nine or 10 months ago on how we need a scalable digital infrastructure for vaccinating 5-10 million people a day and I think a lot of that actually is reflected in the latest version.“For example, we are the only country in the world where everybody gets a digital vaccination certificate immediately... Then as we open up, as they did yesterday, which I think is a welcome move, you will have lots and lots of points where people will come in,” he said.Explaining further, Nilekani, who is referred to as the architect for Aadhaar, said this needs to be done in a streamlined manner.“Let’s say 50,000 vaccination points, then it will be very easy to go to 5-10 million. Already in, we were at 2-3 million a day, a lot of credit goes to RS Sharma, who took over the National Health Authority just a couple of months back, and brought in a lot of technological enhancements that have made the system scalable.“Obviously, we need the vaccines and people to give the vaccines to but digital backbone is important and India has developed something that is truly remarkable,” he said.The former UIDAI chairman said face authentication is being used for vaccination and not face recognition.“What is being used will be face authentication by comparing your photograph when you give your Aadhaar number, so it’s no different from a fingerprint authentication, iris or OTP authentication,” he said.Nilekani added that facial recognition is scanning a database to look for a person. “No such thing is being contemplated, just face authentication because people are often not able to use fingerprint, it’s a way of being inclusive.”         He also said this will help in accelerating vaccination, and the transaction time would be very important.He further stated that technology is an important tool to help citizens provide access to quality healthcare, education, and financial services.He was speaking at the first edition of Microsoft ExpertSpeak, in conversation with Microsoft India president Anant Maheshwari.Maheshwari said digital skilling is a step towards bridging the existing digital divide in the country.In this direction, Microsoft Corp has helped over 30 million people in 249 countries gain access to digital skills, of which close to 3 million are from India, he said.The top executive outlined a number of initiatives being run by the company in collaboration with NSDC, Nasscom and others towards cybersecurity and imparting digital skills.“It’s really about government, industry, and companies coming together,” he added.

20-04-2021||New Delhi||HC displeased over huge wastage of vaccines; asks Centre to vaccinate whom all it can||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday expressed displeasure over “huge wastage” of vaccines and asked the Centre to vaccinate whomsoever it can to ensure there is no wastage.A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said according to news reports there is a daily wastage of six per cent of vaccines and till now 44 lakh vaccines out of 10 crore have been wasted, maximum in Tamil Nadu.“This is a huge wastage. Give it to those who want it. Whomsoever you can vaccinate, please vaccinate. Whether 16 year old or 60 year old, all need vaccination. The pandemic does not discriminate,” the court told the Centre.The court said young people are being affected more this time round, and lot of young lives have been lost.It said if at the end of a day, a few shots are available in a vial, then it be given to someone whether they fall in the approved categories for vaccination or not.The observations by the bench came during the hearing of a disposed of petition related to COVID-19 tests which was revived on April 19 (Monday).The high court Monday noted that the virus has raised its “ugly head” once again and the pandemic is raging with much greater intensity and “it is evident that the healthcare infrastructure is at the stage of imminent collapse”.

20-04-2021||Kathmandu||Nepal’s ex-King Gyanendra, Queen Komal test COVID-19 positive after attending Maha Kumbh in India||Nepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah and former Queen Komal Shah have tested positive for the coronavirus on their return from India after participating in the Maha Kumbh at Haridwar, according to a media report on Tuesday.The 73-year-old former King and 70-year-old former Queen recently returned from India where they had taken a holy dip at Haridwar’s Har Ki Pauri during the Maha Kumbh—a religious congregation of Hindu seers and devotees, according to the Health Ministry.Their samples for the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test were confirmed positive for the COVID-19 infection, The Himalayan Times reported.According to the report, hundreds of people had gathered at the airport in Kathmandu to welcome the former king and queen during their arrival back home.The authorities have also initiated a contact tracing to test anyone who came in contact with the royal couple.Shah was crowned as the king of Nepal in 2001 after his elder brother Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev and his family were killed in a massacre at the Royal Palace.An investigation blamed Birendra’s son Dipendra, who was among the dead, for the massacre.Shah stepped down in 2008, after a popular revolt forced him to abdicate, and the centuries-old monarchy was abolished, turning the country into a republic by the Constituent Assembly.He became deeply unpopular when he seized direct control of the nation in 2005, claiming mainstream parties had failed to tackle the deadly Maoist insurgency.He has kept a low-profile and has occasionally made public appearances.Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week appealed to the sadhus to observe the remaining duration of the Kumbh only in a “symbolic” manner in view of the coronavirus pandemic.The Maha Kumbh formally began in Haridwar on April 1 with several restrictions imposed on devotees coming to attend the event amid rising cases of COVID-19 in various states including Uttarakhand.A negative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test report not older than 72 hours before arrival was made mandatory for devotees gathering for the event.It was for the first time in the history of the grand religious congregation held on the banks of the Ganga in Haridwar once in 12 years that its duration was curtailed to just one month due to the pandemic.In normal circumstances, the Maha Kumbh is held for nearly four months. Its last edition was held in Haridwar from January 14 to April 28 in 2010.

20-04-2021||New Delhi||Govt to provide Rs 4,500-cr booster to vaccine manufacturers for ramping up capacity||Looking to ramp up supplies ahead of the opening of Covid-19 vaccination to all citizens over 18 years of age, the government has approved a payment of about Rs 4,500 crore as advance to vaccine makers like Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech against future supplies, sources said.SII will supply 200 million doses and Bharat Biotech is to supply another 90 million doses to the government by July at a pre-agreed rate of Rs 150 per dose.Sources said the finance ministry has relaxed rules to allow advance payment without bank guarantee to help the vaccine makers ramp up production.SII will get Rs 3,000 crore in advance and Bharat Biotech about Rs 1,500 crore.Commenting on the decision during a media briefing, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said the finance minister has approved to provide credit line to vaccine manufacturers and this approval does not require vetting by the Cabinet.“I think the finance minister has approved and this is part of her powers to approve these funds because it is in the form of credit line, and will be backed with the adequate supplies of vaccines to support the government procurement and vaccination programme of the government of India,” he said.Earlier this month, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla had said the company would require around Rs 3,000 crore to ramp up production capacity for making vaccines for COVID-19.The decision to provide credit line was hailed by SII.“On behalf of the vaccine industry in India, I would like to thank and applaud Shri @narendramodi Ji, @nsitharaman Ji, for your decisive policy changes and swift financial aid which will help vaccine production and distribution in India,” Poonawalla said in a tweet on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the government on Monday allowed citizens over the age of 18 years to receive Covid-19 vaccination from May 1 as it seeks to control the rapid spread of the virus.Under the third phase of its vaccination strategy, manufacturers will be required to supply 50 per cent of their monthly doses to the government and the rest to state governments or the open market.Vaccination will continue as before in the government of India vaccination centres free of cost for the eligible population—healthcare and frontline workers and all people above 45 years of age.Latest data showed that over 2.59 lakh coronavirus infections pushed overall cases in India to more than 1.53 crore, making the country the second-worst affected nation after the US, which has reported more than 3.1 crore infections. India’s deaths from COVID-19 rose by a record 1,761 to over 1.8 lakh.          With regard to impact of surging COVID-19 cases on the economy, Goyal said, India Inc is completely satisfied with the steps taken by the government to deal with the situation.The government decision on vaccination for all above 18 years taken on Monday will give a boost in maintaining economic activity, he said.The Commerce Minister said he had discussions with three industry chambers and they have informed that their members would like to pay and implement the vaccination for their employees.Chambers have their intention to import vaccine if at all available, he added.

20-04-2021||Mumbai||Pharma co-director denies stocking Remdesivir vials in Mumbai||The Bruck Pharma director, who was questioned by Mumbai police over the company's Remdesivir stock, has denied stocking the vials in the city and claimed the consignment has been moved to a godown in Daman, a police official said on Tuesday.Remdesivir is listed for use in serious COVID-19 patients. In view of a sudden spike in demand for the drug due to the surge in COVID-19 cases, the Centre last week banned its export till the situation improves.The Mumbai police on Saturday questioned Rajesh Dokania, the director of the Daman-based pharmaceutical company that manufactures Remdesivir vials, following information that around 60,000 vials were going to be flown abroad by air cargo, despite a ban on the export of the drug.During his questioning, the police sought to know the whereabouts of the drug stock, the official said."The pharma company director claimed the stock was moved to the firm's godown in the neighbouring Union Territory of Daman as its export was banned and denied stocking the vials in Mumbai," the official said.The police are verifying the information provided by the pharma firm executive, he said.Dokania was questioned at the BKC police station here and was later allowed to go. But, the police asked him to remain present for inquiry whenever he is called.On learning that Dokania was being quizzed, Fadnavis and another state BJP leader Pravin Darekar had rushed to the police station on Saturday night.They said the BJP was reaching out to pharma companies due to the shortage of Remdesivir in the state."It was our sincere attempt to get Remdesivar for Maharashtra," Fadnavis had said.The former CM had also said permission was taken from the FDA commissioner to donate the stock of Remdesevir vials to the Maharashtra government, as the drug stocked for export cannot be diverted to the domestic market without the nod of the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) or the FDA.The communication from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to the pharmaceutical company was not shared with the BKC police station, which was acting independently on the information available with them, a Mumbai police spokesperson had said.The pharma company director was called for an inquiry in order to trace and seize about 60,000 vials of the key anti-viral drug based on specific inputs, the police said.The inquiry was necessary in light of complaints of rampant hoarding and black marketing of Remdesevir and its shortage being faced by citizens, they said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pharma-co-director-denies-stocking-remdesivir-vials-in-mumbai-241716
20-04-2021||Chandigarh||IIT study calls for satellite-based real-time monitoring of Himalayas to mitigate disasters due to climatic changes||In the backdrop of glacial outbursts and extreme weather events expected to increase because of climatic changes, a study by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) has called for a satellite-based real-time monitoring of Himalayan glacial catchments that can improve understanding of flood risk in the region and help inform an early flood warning system to help mitigate disasters.This should be the future strategy to reduce loss of human lives during glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF), the study by two professors at IIT Kanpur, with support from the Department of Science and Technology, suggests.The study has been published this week in Science, a peer-reviewed academic journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.Temperature and the number of extreme rainfall events are rising at an increased rate because of climate change.The Himalayan region, also called the Earth’s Third Pole, is home to the largest ice mass outside of the planet’s polar regions. Glaciers in this region are melting at a faster rate, creating new lakes and expanding the existing ones.In addition, rising temperatures and extreme precipitation events make this region increasingly prone to a variety of natural hazards, including devastating GLOFs.GLOFs occur when either a natural dam containing a glacial lake bursts or when the lake’s level suddenly increases and overflows its banks, leading to catastrophic downstream destruction as happened in 2013 after an avalanche caused the glacial moraine holding back Chorabari lake in northern India to give way, releasing a sudden torrent of water, boulders, and debris down the river valley below, resulting in the deaths of more than 5,000 people.With climate change, these events are likely to increase in frequency and magnitude throughout the Himalayas. However, the remote and challenging Himalayan terrain and the overall lack of cellular connectivity throughout the region has made the development of early flood warning systems virtually impossible.The scientists have also pointed out that the surge of melt-water in mountain streams is most commonly caused by cloudbursts during the monsoon time frame.However, the sudden surge of melt-water in Dhauli Ganga, a tributary of the Ganga, in February, which is a dry season, suggests that this time frame needs to be expanded.The catastrophe in the upper Dhauli Ganga basin is linked to processes other than precipitation events, such as snow avalanches, rock landslides and other unidentified drivers, and therefore determining all of the potential major and minor drivers behind sudden surges of melt-water into headwater streams is vital for understanding the hazard profile of the region, the scientists said.The IIT team suggested that efforts to help mitigate GLOF events in the future should include the creation of a network of satellite-based monitoring stations that could provide in situ and real-time data on GLOF risk.The integration of monitoring devices with satellite networks will not only provide telemetry support in remote locations that lack complete cellular connectivity but will also provide greater connectivity in coverage in the cellular dead zones in extreme topographies such as valleys, cliffs, and steep slopes,” the study said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iit-study-calls-for-satellite-based-real-time-monitoring-of-himalayas-to-mitigate-disasters-due-to-climatic-changes-241713

Delhi Government expressed gratitude for the timely support of Union Government for augmenting their hospital beds capacity, during last year and this year,” it is said in the statement, which also mentioned that the Delhi government’s efforts to ramp up testing and reduce the turnaround time for the test results were also outlined.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-home-secretary-reviews-covid-19-situation-in-uts-241711
20-04-2021||Aditi Tandon||Bharat Biotech to expand Covaxin production to 700 million doses a year||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 20Bharat Biotech on Tuesday announced scaling up the manufacturing capacity to produce 700 million doses of Covaxin annually.The current production capacity is 1.6 lakh doses a day.Manufacturing scale-up has been carried out in a stepwise manner across multiple facilities at Hyderabad and Bengaluru, the firm said.Inactivated vaccines, while highly safe, are extremely complex and expensive to manufacture, resulting in lower yields when compared to live virus vaccines.Capacity expansion in vaccines manufacturing is a long and tedious process, requiring investments of millions of rupees and several years. Bharat Biotech is able to expand Covaxin manufacturing capacity in a short timeline, mainly due to the availability of new specially designed BSL-3 facilities, first-of-its-kind for manufacturing in India that have been repurposed, and pre-existing expertise and knowhow to manufacture, test and release highly purified inactivated viral vaccines.  Manufacturing partnerships are being explored with our partners in other countries, who have prior expertise with commercial scale manufacture of inactivated viral vaccines under biosafety containment.   To further increase capacities, Bharat Biotech has partnered with Indian Immunologicals (IIL) to manufacture the drug substance for Covaxin.The technology transfer process is well under way and IIL has the capabilities and expertise to manufacture inactivated viral vaccines at commercial scale and under biosafety containment.Bharat Biotech uses a proprietary adjuvant Algel-IMDG that has now proven to be a safe and effective adjuvant, especially to stimulate memory T cell responses. The synthesis and manufacture of the IMDG component has been successfully indigenised and will be manufactured at commercial scale within the country. This is the first instance where a novel adjuvant has been commercialised in India. The protocols for manufacturing, testing and release of inactivated vaccines have been tried, tested and validated across several of vaccines; these also meet the requirements of WHO, Indian and other regulatory authorities. These protocols have delivered consistent results over a 15-year period with more than 300 million doses supplied globally, with excellent safety and performance record.Covaxin has received Emergency Use Authorisations in several countries across the globe with another 60 in process.EUAs have now been obtained from Mexico, the Philippines, Iran, Paraguay, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Guyana, Venezuela, Botswana, Zimbabwe, among several other countries. EUAs are in process in the USA and several European countries. Pricing for international markets and supplies to govt’s under EUAs have been established from $15-20/dose.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bharat-biotech-to-expand-covaxin-production-to-700-million-doses-a-year-241706

Middlemen brought in without price controls. No vaccine guarantee for weaker sections. GOI’s Vaccine Discrimination- Not Distribution- Strategy,” he said in a tweet.• No free vaccines for 18-45 yr olds. • Middlemen brought in without price controls. • No vaccine guarantee for weaker sections. GOI’s Vaccine Discrimination- Not Distribution- Strategy!  The government on Monday announced that all adults will be eligible for COVID vaccination from May 1 while private hospitals and states will be able to buy doses directly from manufacturers.The decisions aimed at scaling up inoculation came as 25 lakh cases were added in just 15 days in the country and several states like Maharashtra, Delhi, Punjab and Rajasthan demanded that the age restriction of 45 years be removed for the vaccination.Under the third phase of the vaccination drive commencing next month, the vaccine manufacturers would be free to supply 50 percent doses to state governments and in the open market for which they will have to make an advance declaration of the price before May 1, according to an official statement.

20-04-2021||Beijing||Leaders’ consensus to maintain peace at borders cannot be ‘swept under carpet’, India tells China||India has told China that the significance of the consensus reached between their leaders to maintain peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) cannot be "swept under the carpet" and called for the complete disengagement of troops in eastern Ladakh to rebuild bilateral ties strained by the "serious incidents" which has strongly impacted the public opinion.In a candid address to the ICWA (Indian Council of World Affairs)-CPIFA (Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs) virtual dialogue on April 15, Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri also questioned the Chinese officials ignoring the "significant consensus" reached by the leaders of the two sides about the importance of maintaining peace along the LAC.In his lengthy speech, Misri said no country could set the agenda for itself without agreements from other countries, in an apparent reference to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its flagship project the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor over which India has raised concerns as it is being laid through the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The BRI is a multi-billion-dollar initiative launched by President Xi Jinping when he came into power in 2013. It aims to link Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Gulf region, Africa and Europe with a network of land and sea routes.China also claims sovereignty over all of South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims."In a multi-polar world, no country can set the agenda by itself without prior agreement and consultation, and then expect everyone else to come on board. No single country can expect a discussion to focus only on issues of its own interest while ignoring those raised or reflected by others,” Misri said.About the consensus between the leaders of the two countries for good relations, he said, "It has often been pointed out by friends in China that we should stick to the consensus between our leaders. I have absolutely no quarrel with that.""Indeed, I agree wholeheartedly. At the same time, I should point out that equally significant consensus has been reached between our leaders in the past as well, for instance the consensus that I just referred to on the importance of maintaining peace and tranquillity, and it is important to stick to that consensus as well," he said."We have also seen a tendency in some quarters to sweep this situation under the carpet and characterise it as just a minor issue and a matter of perspective. This, too, is inadvisable as it can only take us further away from a sustained solution to present difficulties and deeper into an unfulfilling stalemate,” he said."In fact, it would be tantamount to running away from the problem and in a direction opposite to that where the promise of our closer development partnership lies,” he said.While the leaders "recognised the inevitable presence of competition in the relationship, they also simultaneously prioritised cooperation and shunned containment, because they believed that containment was neither feasible nor advisable in respect of either country", he said.Though the border mechanisms were tested on multiple occasions, they "helped maintain the all-important peace and tranquillity on the borders, thereby helping create the environment in which the India-China relationship grew spectacularly between 1988 and 2019,” he said."But we must acknowledge that these enabling structures and the fundamental premise of the closer developmental partnership have been placed under considerable strain by the serious incidents and the resultant violation of peace and tranquillity at the LAC in Eastern Ladakh in April 2020 and thereafter. The impact on public opinion has been particularly strong," Misri said.Indian and Chinese troops are locked in a prolonged standoff in eastern Ladakh since May last year. Soldiers from both sides completed withdrawal of troops from the North and South banks of Pangong Lake in February. But the disengagement has not taken place yet from various other areas in eastern Ladakh.Top Commanders of the two militaries held the 11th round of talks on April 9 to disengage the troops from Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang areas in Eastern Ladakh.

Then how can Fadnavis' nephew (who is only 22) can get the vaccine. The lives of BJP leaders' and families are important. Are the common people insects isn't their life worth anything," the Maharashtra Congress said in a sharp tweet.Though Tanmay Fadnavis removed his social media video soon after an uproar erupted, his uncle Devendra Fadnavis is being slammed with many demanding to know how the youngster got the jab, who cleared it when even the eligible people are deprived of the vaccine.Since past couple of weeks, Maharashtra government has repeatedly urged the Centre to increase its share of vaccine quota considering the huge number of Covid cases and fatalities which are the highest in the country.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/devendra-fadnavis-22-year-old-nephew-tanmay-gets-covid-vaccine-draws-flak-241699

Shri Guru Singh Sabha gurdwara in Uttar Pradesh's Noida Sector-18 is providing two meals a day to the infected patients at their doorstep.Giani Gurpreet Singh, Head Granthi of Shri Guru Singh Sabha, told IANS,"We had been running this service since September last year, later we stopped our services for a few months due to improvement in the Covid situation, but after April 8 we have resumed this service." "I have started getting calls from places other than Noida. We are not able to help every person in need because we do not have enough manpower," he added.He said, "Some people from different sectors in Noida have joined us and taken the responsibility of helping the local people." The food from the gurdwara is delivered in a disposable packet at the doorstep of the infected person. However, once the food is placed at the gate, the food packet is not retrieved again.Apart from the gurdwara, other people associated with this service deliver food to nearly 100 to 150 infected persons at their homes every day. Due to the shortage of people volunteering for this service, we are facing some difficulties in carrying out the service which would be overcome soon.Gurpreet said, "We are writing the names of the people on the food packet itself, which takes a little more time, but in the future this process will be computerised so that time can be saved and food is delivered to more and more people."At present, food is being sent to Covid-infected persons for two square meals a day. People call the gurdwara's number to join in the service, after which they reveal their address.After noting down the address of an individual, a person from the gurdwara writes the name of that person and provides further help. Gurpreet also receives calls from places other than Noida, but has to refuse them as the service is only applicable for Noida.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doorstep-food-delivery-by-noida-gurdwara-for-covid-hit-241693

A net increase of 1,02,648 cases recorded in the total active caseload in a day.Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala cumulatively account for 62.07 per cent of India's total active cases."The daily positivity rate (7-day moving average) continues to show an upward trend, currently stands at 15.99 per cent.India's cumulative recoveries have surged to 1,31,08,582 with 1,54,761 recoveries being registered in a span of 24 hours.The National Mortality Rate has been falling and currently stands at 1.18 per cent, the ministry said. It said 1,761 deaths were reported in a span of 24 hours.Ten states account for 82.74 per cent of the new deaths.Maharashtra saw the maximum casualties (351).

20-04-2021||New Delhi||India likely to waive customs duty on COVID-19 vaccine imports||The government is likely to waive 10 per cent customs duty levied on imported vaccines in a bid to keep low the cost of overseas vaccines that are being eyed to supplement domestically made shots ahead of opening COVID-19 vaccination to all citizens over 18 years of age, sources said.While Russia’s Sputnik V vaccines are due to arrive this month or latest by next month, manufacturers like Moderna and Johnson and Johnson have been urged to seek emergency use approval in India.The government presently levies 10 per cent customs or import duty plus a 16.5 per cent I-GST and social welfare surcharge on vaccines coming from overseas. These taxes would make the imported vaccines costlier than the ones made by Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech.“A customs duty wavier is being considered,” a source aware of the matter said.Another source said a decision is likely to be made “very soon”.As and when, foreign vaccine manufacturers approach the government with a formal proposal for allowing import of vaccine, the waiver would be given, government sources explained.No proposal has been made so far, Finance Ministry sources added.The government earlier this month allowed emergency use of imported vaccines to curb spread of coronavirus infections. With 2.59 lakh new infections, the caseload has crossed 1.53 crore, making India the second-worst affected nation after the US, which has reported more than 3.1 crore infections. India’s deaths from COVID-19 rose by a record 1,761 to over 1.8 lakh.Sources said discussion on duty exemption on vaccines started sometime in December last year when overseas manufacturers such as Pfizer sought approval to supply its vaccines to India.The Finance Ministry and its indirect tax collection arm had done some preliminary calculations on the implications of a duty waiver but a decision was put off until the government approved use of imported vaccines, they said.The government, which on Monday allowed citizens over the age of 18 years to receive COVID-19 vaccinations from May 1, currently regulates the sale and purchase of all Covid shots in the country.Under the third phase of its vaccination strategy, manufacturers will be required to supply 50 per cent of their monthly doses to the government and the rest to state governments or the open market.

20-04-2021||New Delhi||Cyber agency asks Indian FB users to enhance account privacy after global data leak||Country's cyber security agency CERT-In has advised Facebook users to strengthen their account privacy settings after a recent global 'data scraping' incident in the social media platform was detected that affected about 61 lakh Indians."As the Facebook platform evolves and grows, parts of your account could be public. Data could also be collected and shared in ways you don't know about," the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team or CERT-In said in a public advisory issued on Monday.It is the federal technology arm to combat cyber attacks and guard the Indian cyber space against phishing and hacking assaults and similar online attacks."It has been reported that globally there has been a largescale leakage of Facebook profile information. The exposed information includes email addresses, profile ID, full name, job occupation, phone numbers and birth date."According to Facebook, the scraped information does not include financial information, health information or passwords, however information from more than 450 million unique Facebook profiles globally, including approximately 61 lakh Indian individuals, has been made publicly available in multiple cyber criminal forums for free," the advisory said while explaining the breach.A cyber security expert had spoken about this online leak earlier this month, which was acknowledged by the company, stating that "this is old data that was previously reported on in 2019. We found and fixed this issue in August 2019". The CERT-In said that Facebook has claimed that this 'data scraping' happened by using the "contact importer" feature of the platform, which allows users to find other users by using their phone numbers."Facebook stated that this feature was changed in September 2019, following the discovery that threat actors were abusing the feature."However, while Facebook modified the feature in 2019 to thwart this kind of abuse, the phone numbers of 450 million global users had already been harvested by malicious actors, along with other identifying information on users," it said.Dejargonising the term 'data scraping', the advisory said it refers to the process of using automated software or scripts to harvest public information from sites, such as any information users make publicly available in their profiles like names, city, occupation, among others."Cyber criminals may scrape data from sites for a variety of purposes, including spamming, information gathering and social engineering attacks."They can also sell scrapped data for a profit to other cyber criminals, marketing companies or call centres," it said.The advisory, while asking users of this popular social media platform to follow good cyber hygiene practices, also said that Facebook has advised individuals to "make sure that their privacy settings reflect what information they want to share publicly and who they want to be able to look them by phone number".Facebook, it added, has also recommended account holders to enable two-factor authentication also known as 2FA.It also recommended that users can consider changing their profile settings to "private" or "friends" only as data scrapers can use "public" information of an individual to "match and combine with data from other breaches to access even more of their personal information and accounts".It also asked users to adjust their settings to who can find and contact them on Facebook and consider whether to set them all to "friends" or stricter for stronger security.In a similar incident reported in March 2018, Facebook data of over 5.62 lakh Indians was allegedly compromised as UK-based Cambridge Analytica had accessed information of about 87 million users globally.      The Central Bureau of Investigation is now probing this data breach on charges of profiteering and manipulating elections by illegal harvesting of Indian user data.India is among the biggest markets for Facebook and its group companies, WhatsApp and Instagram, and according to government data, the country has 41 crore Facebook users, 53 crore WhatsApp users and 21 crore users of Instagram.

20-04-2021||Gurugram||Delhi lockdown: Migrants queue up at bus stands to rush home||After the Delhi government imposed a weeklong lockdown from Monday night to curb the spike in Covid cases, in a replay of last year's migrants crisis, a large number of people gathered at bus stations here on Tuesday to flee from the city, fearing the shutdown of the public transport may force them to walk hundreds of kilometers.Last year, hundreds of migrant labourers had left the city on foot in the absence of public transport during the lockdown.Hundreds of people, including children, women and elderly queued up at Rajiv Chowk, Sector-12, Sector-34, Khandsa and Sector-37 bus stations on Tuesday with their belongings to head home leaving their jobs and employment back in the city.Ram Lal, a migrant labourer waiting for a bus at the bus stand, told IANS, "I am going to the village in Bihar due to the lockdown, how can the poor man give rent and survive without earning. Due to lockdown in Delhi maximum employees of our company are working from home but we are helpers, we have no such facilities. Our company has been closed. I have to take care of my family. I will not come back here now."Tulsi Kumar, another migrant labourer told IANS, "I am going to my village in Uttar Pradesh. After the lockdown, work will be stopped, then how will I take care of myself and my family. I will come back after the situation becomes normal." The labourers could be seen at several bus stops across the city. At Sector-12 bus stop where only one bus heads towards Madhya Pradesh before the lockdown in Delhi, now after the lockdown four buses are heading for Madhya Pradesh."We are paying Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 for our destination which is a huge amount, but we have no other option but to pay this amount as I just want to reach my native place at any cost rather than stay here without any work," Rawal Singh told IANS.Like them, many others from various parts of the city are heading to the bus stands from where they will catch a bus to their villages.However, majority of them said, this time corona fear is not in their mind, the only thing in their mind is how to reach home without walking on foot.It is estimated that nearly 20 per cent of labourers from Gurugram have left the district."The spike in Covid-19 cases is a worrisome concern for us but the lockdown in Delhi has panicked workers despite our request they are not ready to stay here. This will affect the industries a lot. Hundreds of workers have already left the city and more are going back. The industries are now facing labour crunch which will cause delays in productions," Aman Khanna, an owner of an automobile unit told IANS.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-lockdown-migrants-queue-up-at-bus-stands-to-rush-home-241685

20-04-2021||United Nations||Cyclone Amphan of 2020 resulted in USD 14 billion economic losses in India: UN report||Cyclone Amphan, which made landfall in May last year near the India-Bangladesh border, was the costliest tropical cyclone on record for the North Indian Ocean, with reported economic losses in India of approximately USD 14 billion, a flagship UN report has said.The ‘State of the Global Climate 2020' report, released on Monday, said that extreme weather combined with COVID-19 dealt a double blow for millions of people in 2020.However, the pandemic-related economic slowdown failed to put a brake on climate change drivers and accelerating impacts.The year 2020 was one of the three warmest years on record, despite a cooling La Niña event. The global average temperature was about 1.2 degree Celsius above the pre-industrial (1850-1900) level.The six years since 2015 have been the warmest on record; 2011-2020 was the warmest decade on record.“This is a frightening report. It needs to be read by all leaders and decision-makers in the world. 2020 was an unprecedented year for people and the planet. It was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. But this report shows that 2020 was also another unprecedented year of extreme weather and climate disasters,” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said at the launch of the report compiled by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).The report added that with 30 named storms, the 2020 North Atlantic hurricane season had its largest number of named storms on record.“Cyclone Amphan, which made landfall on May 20 near the India-Bangladesh border in the eastern Bay of Bengal, was the costliest tropical cyclone on record for the North Indian Ocean, with reported economic losses in India of approximately USD 14 billion,” it said. “Large-scale evacuations of coastal areas in India and Bangladesh meant that casualties from Amphan were far lower than the number of casualties from previous comparable cyclones in the region. Nevertheless, 129 lives were lost across the two countries,” it said.About 2.4 million people were displaced in India, mostly in West Bengal and Odisha, and 2.5 million were displaced in Bangladesh due to the cyclone, it added.The report also noted that India had one of its two wettest monsoon seasons since 1994, with nationally-averaged rainfall for June to September 9 per cent above the long-term average. Heavy rain, flooding and landslides also affected the surrounding countries.

20-04-2021||Washington||We understand India's pharmaceutical requirements, Biden admn says on vaccine's raw material supply issues||The Biden administration has conveyed to New Delhi that it understands India's pharmaceutical requirements and promised to give the matter a due consideration, observing that the current difficulty in the export of critical raw materials needed to manufacture COVID-19 vaccines is mainly due to an Act that forces American companies to prioritise domestic consumption.President Joe Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump had invoked the war-time Defence Production Act (DPA) that leaves US companies with no option but to give priority to the production of COVID-19 vaccines and Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) for domestic production to combat the deadly pandemic in America, the worst-hit nation.Since the US has ramped up the production of COVID-19 vaccines – mostly by Pfizer and Moderna – so as to meet the goal of vaccinating its entire population by July 4, the suppliers of its raw material, which is in high demand globally and sought after by major Indian manufacturers, are being forced to provide it only for domestic manufacturers.Among other things, the DPA that was enacted in 1950 authorises the president to require businesses to accept and prioritise contracts for materials deemed necessary for national defence, regardless of a loss incurred on business.The issue received global attention in recent days after Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the Serum Institute of India (SII), tagged President Biden in a tweet.“Respected @POTUS, if we are to truly unite in beating this virus, on behalf of the vaccine industry outside the US, I humbly request you to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the US so that vaccine production can ramp up. Your administration has the details," he tweeted.The SII is the world's largest producer of COVID-19 vaccine. Neither the US nor India has released details of the raw material that it is asking from the US.In recent weeks, India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu has been taking up the matter with the Biden administration officials. During his meetings with the US interlocutors, the top Indian diplomat has sought a smooth supply of certain inputs for production of COVID-19 vaccines in India.In addition, officials from the two sides have held discussions to ease the supply of critical materials, considering their increased requirements in both the US and India.“The US side has clarified that there are no export restrictions on such items and that domestic regulations have only prioritised use of these materials for production of vaccines in the US,” sources familiar with the conversations told PTI on Monday.Informed sources said that the Biden administration has conveyed to India that they understand India's requirements and has promised to give the matter a due consideration. The US officials, in these meetings, have acknowledged the larger framework of the India-US health cooperation. It is believed that the US Embassy in Delhi is also in contact with the relevant Indian stakeholders.

The people who use NATO-kind of analogy either don’t understand us at all and don’t know what our Independence means to us. One explanation I have is complete ignorance and lack of understanding of the Indian mindset,” he said at All India Management Association’s (AIMA) National Leadership Conclave today.S Jaishankar, External Affairs Minister Military alliances not India’s heritageMilitary alliances have never been India’s heritage... The people who use NATO-kind of analogy either don’t understand us at all and don’t know what our Independence means to us.“Or these people are using these words deliberately to discourage or dissuade or mislead us from doing what is in our own interest,” he said.Jaishankar suggested a military alliance would be tantamount to abandoning India’s independence of approach. On Quad, he said it was very reasonable in international relations to have countries with convergences and shared interests to work together.“But I wouldn’t exaggerate and wrongly create the imagery of a NATO military alliance, cold war etc. That has never been India’s heritage.

20-04-2021||---||Harsh Vardhan’s reply to ex-PM: Congress fuelled Covid vaccine hesitancy||New Delhi, April 19Political bickering over Covid response continued today with Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in a letter to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh alleging that Congress-ruled states fuelled vaccine hesitancy with one sitting Chief Minister directly inciting people against an indigenously developed vaccine.Harsh Vardhan, Health Minister ‘Your party leaders took jab in private’Some Congress leaders even shamed the vaccines in public but took their doses in private. A word of advice from you to them may have ensured better cooperation from these people.Responding to a letter Singh wrote to his successor PM Narendra Modi yesterday, Vardhan said the Congress’ advice to not go by absolute vaccination numbers could not be selective. Singh had yesterday advised the government to look at the proportion of population inoculated and not just absolute numbers.“Your advice to not get tempted to go by absolute numbers, but to go by percentage of population covered, is not incorrect. I am sure that you will agree with me that this is a practice that must be followed uniformly and junior members of your party too must follow your advice. It can’t be that the discussion on total cases, active cases or mortality is based on absolute numbers, which the Congress often tries to do, but the vaccination numbers continue to be touted as a percentage of the population covered,” said Vardhan.The Health Minister wrote it was shocking that senior members of the Congress were yet to utter a single word of gratitude towards the scientist community and that many Congress members and Congress-ruled states “had taken extraordinary interest in spreading falsehoods regarding the efficacy of these vaccines, thereby fuelling vaccine hesitancy”.“Some Congress leaders even shamed the vaccines in public but took their doses in private. A word of advice from you to them may have ensured better cooperation from these people,” Vardhan said.The minister said: “Irresponsible public pronouncements by some Congress leaders resulted in a below national average vaccination coverage of senior citizens and even front-line workers in some of the Congress-ruled states which had now become big contributors in the second wave and their test positivity ratio was alarmingly high.”‘Apologise to Manmohan’Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot and former Maharashtra CM Ashok Chavan attacked Health Minister for his “contemptuous response” to the letter by Manmohan Singh and demanded an apology.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/harsh-vardhans-reply-to-ex-pm-congress-fuelled-covid-vaccine-hesitancy-241497

All imported vaccines will be available in the open market for anyone to buy.The manufacturers would need to declare the prices for the 50 per cent stock (meant for other than Union Government sources) before May 1 to enable states, hospitals and private establishments to procure it based on transparent pricing declarations.The Liberalised and Accelerated Phase-3 Strategy of the National Covid-19 Vaccination Programme was finalised today at a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said that by April 30, the government hoped to cover a significant number of the vulnerable and was, therefore, ready to expand.The Central Government-run vaccination centres will continue as before to provide free of cost jabs to the already defined eligible population—health and frontline workers and everyone above 45 years of age.From May 1, private hospitals will have to procure their supplies of Covid-19 vaccine exclusively from the 50 per cent reserve earmarked for the open market and will also need to declare what price they would charge per dose. “The eligibility through this (open market private) channel will be opened up to all adults above 18,” said a government statement amid growing demands to allow inoculation for all adults.The national vaccine drive that began on January 16 covered health and frontline workers, 60-plus and 45 to 59-year-olds with morbidities in the first phase and 45-plus people in the second. The policy came as India’s Covid cases crossed 1.50 crore with 25 lakh cases added in 15 days and active cases surpassed the 19-lakh mark.Division of supply1 Vaccine makers to reserve 50% doses for the Central pool2 They will be free to give the rest to states or in the open market3 Division of supply (50% Centre and 50% rest) will apply only to India-made vaccines4 Imported vaccines will be entirely used in open market5 The Centre, from its share, will allocate vaccines to states and UTs based on extent of infectionManmohan tests +ve, admitted to AIIMSFormer Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (88), who tested positive for Covid-19, was admitted to AIIMS with mild fever on Monday.

20-04-2021||New Delhi||India to open up COVID vaccination for all adults over 18 from May 1||India has decided to open COVID vaccinations for all adults starting May 1 with the pandemic surging to record highs and fatalities rising with each passing day.The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who said India had been vaccinating people at a world-record pace and would continue to do so with greater momentum. Also readNo evidence of the young being at greater risk in ongoing COVID wave: ICMRIn other major decisions, vaccine makers will need to reserve 50 per cent doses for the Centre and be free to give the rest to states or the open market. All imported vaccines will be available for the open market and will not be reserved by the Centre.The expansion of the COVID inoculation drive was being demanded from all quarters ever since the drive began on January 16 with health and frontline workers being vaccinated along with 60 plus and 45- to 59-year-olds with morbidities. In the second phase from March 1, vaccination was opened for above 45 years, accounting for more than 80 per cent COVID mortality in the country.The private sector was also roped in to augment capacity.As the drive is set to be expanded, the government said it was regularly in touch with all vaccine manufacturers and has sent multiple inter-ministerial teams onsite to understand each one’s requirements and provide proactive and customised support in the form of grants, advance payments, more sites for production to ramp up manufacturing.The Centre said it would support Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute to expand capacity.The Liberalised and Accelerated Phase 3 Strategy of the National COVID-19 Vaccination programme decided today has several hallmarks, the top being that from May 1, vaccine manufacturers would supply 50 per cent of their monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) released doses to the Centre and the rest to states and in the open market. Manufacturers would transparently make an advance declaration of the price for 50 per cent supply that would be available to states and in open market before May 1. Based on this price, states, private hospitals, industrial establishments would be able to procure vaccine doses from the manufacturers. Private Hospitals would have to procure their supplies of COVID-19 vaccine exclusively from the 50 per cent supply earmarked for the open market.Private Vaccination providers will have to transparently declare self-set vaccination price. The eligibility through this channel would be opened up to all adults—that is, everyone over 18. Vaccination will continue as before in the Centre’s vaccination centres, provided free of cost to the eligible population as defined—health workers, frontline workers and all people above 45 years of age. All vaccination (through government of India and open market channel) would be part of the National Vaccination Programme and will have to follow protocols such as being captured on CoWIN platform, linked to AEFI reporting and all other prescribed norms. Stocks and price per vaccination applicable in all vaccination centres will also have to be reported real-time. The division of vaccine supply 50 per cent to the Centre and 50 per cent to other-than-Centre channel would be applicable uniformly across for all vaccines manufactured in the country.  However, Government of India will allow the imported fully ready-to-use vaccines to be entirely utilised in the other-than-government of India-channel. The Government of India, from its share, will allocate vaccines to states and UTs based on the criteria of extent of infection (number of active COVID cases) performance (speed of administration). Wastage of vaccine will also be considered in this criterion and will affect the criteria negatively. Based on the above criteria, statewise quota would be decided and communicated to the States adequately in advance. Here are the important decisions that were taken at the meeting:—Liberalised and Accelerated Phase 3 Strategy of Covid-19 Vaccination from  May 1.—Pricing, Procurement, Eligibility and Administration of vaccines being made flexible in Phase 3 of the World’s Largest Vaccination drive—All stakeholders given flexibility to customise to local needs—Vaccine manufacturers incentivised to further scale up their production, as well as attract new national and international players—Vaccine manufacturers empowered to release up to 50% of their supply to state governments and in the open market at a pre-declared price —States empowered to procure additional vaccine doses directly from the manufacturers, as well as open up vaccination to any category of people above the age of 18 for the same—Government of India’s vaccination drive to continue as before, providing free vaccination for essential and priority populations as defined earlier i.e HCWs, FLWs, and population above 45 years||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-open-up-covid-vaccination-for-all-adults-over-18-from-may-1-241289
20-04-2021||Aditi Tandon||No evidence of the young being at greater risk in ongoing COVID wave: ICMR||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 19India’s apex medical research body ICMR on Monday shared data from hospitalised COVID patients during the first and the second wave of the pandemic, saying that there is no evidence of the younger population being at greater risk in the ongoing wave and that the proportion of death in the hospitalised patients also hasn’t changed between the two spells.What has changed is more hospitalised patients (47.5 pc) reporting shortness of breath in the second wave than in the first (41.7 pc), significantly raising the requirement of supplemental oxygen in the country in the ongoing wave.Also more asymptomatic people have been admitted to hospitals in the second wave, of which the ICMR has done interim analysis and larger studies are ongoing.More than 70 per cent of the hospitalised COVID patients in both waves have been over 40 years old, data from 9,485 patients (6,642 between September and November 2020 and 1,405 between March and April 2021) shows.Only marginally higher number of youth (0 to 18 years) have been hospitalised this time — 5.8 per cent as against 4.2 per cent last year despite the opening up of economic activities, the ICMR study says.Even the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme data, which the Member Health NITI Aayog today shared, shows 31 per cent of the 49,000 COVID infected last year were under 30 years as against 32 per cent among 50,000 positive persons this time.“The proportion of 30- to 40-year-olds has remained static at 21 per cent between the two waves. The conclusion is that there is no overarching extra risk to the youth of becoming COVID positive this time. There has been no shift in the age prevalence of COVID in India. The older people continue to be more vulnerable,” Paul said today.The government experts also came out to caution people against irrational use of Remdesivir noting that no study in the world had shown it reduced mortality.“Remdesivir is only to be used in moderately ill COVID patients who are hospitalised, and have very low oxygen levels and lung damage. It is of no use in mild patients. In fact, UK has only given paracetamol, hydration and multi-vitamins to mild patients and that’s the way management,” AIIMS-New Delhi Director Randeep Guleria said, noting that Remdesivir was no magic bullet and this anti-viral injection was not meant to be taken at home.On plasma therapy, the AIIMS Director said large studies in India had shown it was not useful in COVID patients.On Tocilizumab, he said it was meant for severely ill COVID patients in whom cytokine storm had set in and no other treatment— steroids, anti-coagulants, etc — was working.Paul also said people must understand Remdesivir was not a mainstay drug for COVID and was used in hospitalised patients only because no other effective anti viral was available.“Remdesivir is an experimental drug cleared for emergency use. It is not to be taken in home settings,” said Paul.The experts’ message to people with mild illness was not to panic and to follow basic home management.ICMR chief Balram Bhargava said oxygen remained critical to COVID management and its use has increased because several people got admitted to hospitals out of panic.Medical oxygen availability was being ramped up across India, said Paul.All about Covid drugsMild patients will recover at home with paracetamol, hydration, multi vitaminsRemdesivir: No magic bullet; useful only in hospitalised patients with low oxygen; doesn’t reduce deaths; of no use in mild patientsSteroids: Useful in moderate to severely ill, but must be given at the right time, mortality is higher if given before oxygen levels fall too lowPlasma: No evidence that it’s usefulTocilizumab: Needed in less than 2 per cent Covid patients who are severely ill and in whom steroids and other drugs have stopped working||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-evidence-of-the-young-being-at-greater-risk-in-ongoing-covid-wave-icmr-241265
