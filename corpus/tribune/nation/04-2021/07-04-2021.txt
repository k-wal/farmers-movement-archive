07-04-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi asks parents to not pressurise children; tells children that board exams are another step in long life||Ahead of the upcoming Class X and XII board examinations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday gave a new formula “Involve, Internalise, Associate and Visualise” to students to sharpen memory. Addressing the fourth edition of ‘Pariksha pe Charcha’, PM Modi said when things are visualised in mind, it becomes easy to memorise them.“Memory by association concept works well in the early years so involve yourself in whatever you are doing. If you are sitting at home with a book in hand but thinking about friends, school, food, then you will not remember anything,” he said in the virtual discussion on upcoming board examinations. In this context he also asked students to refer to the updated version of his book ‘Exam Warriors’.The one-and-a-half-hour plus session saw students, parents and teachers asking the prime minister questions ranging from exam fears to tackling difficult subjects to inculcating values systems in children and their food preferences and also how the COVID-19 pandemic had affected education during the year.  “Marks do not decide your future. An exam is just the beginning of a fruitful career. Students and parents should not consider exams the end of life,” he said, asking children to keep their mind calm and fresh while entering the examination hall.“The best solution is to leave all your tensions outside the exam hall. And you should also think that you have done all the preparation you had to. Now, your focus should be on answering the questions well,” he said.When one student asked about losing a year due to COVID-19, the prime minister said the pandemic has also taught lessons.  “People learnt the true value of many essential things. The pandemic has taught to fight the unexpected. People have realised the importance of not taking anything for granted like regular school days, attending office. The emotional bonding between family members has strengthened during the pandemic. Covid forced us to maintain social distancing but it strengthened families’ emotional bonding,” he said.He advised parents to be more involved with their children, understand their strengths and weaknesses but not pressurise them. “Parents are so busy these days that that they do not have time to recognise the real strength of their children. This is the reason parents depend upon mark-sheets to judge their children. There is much more to a child than marks.  “We start believing that kids are our instruments of social status and when kids fail, we say they are not motivated enough. As a result, the kids unintentionally become instrument of their parents’ dreams,” he said.As he requested teachers to guide their students on time management, his advice to students was to maintain proper schedule and tackle hard subjects and topics in the morning. Citing his own example, he said when “your mind is fresh, you will have sharper concentration”.“I will advise students to invest energy equally on all issues, distribute your time equally. I take up all the difficult issues early in the morning. I take decisions better when my mind is fresh,” he saidTo a student, his advice was to do what makes him happy during the free time.“If I have free time, I like to sit on a swing,” the PM said. He also asked parents to inculcate values they want in their children through examples.“How many of you have asked those who work for you to participate in your celebrations? We should lead our children with example. We should make sure that they see us performing our social duties,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-asks-parents-to-not-pressurise-children-tells-children-that-board-exams-are-another-step-in-long-life-235967
07-04-2021||Sitalkuchi (WB)||BJP Bengal chief says TMC workers attacked his car in North Bengal||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s West Bengal president Dilip Ghosh on Wednesday alleged that Trinamool Congress workers attacked his car with bombs and bricks in Cooch Behar district of North Bengal, a charge denied by the ruling party.Ghosh said that the car’s window glasses including the one on his side were smashed in the attack that took place at Sitalkuchi after a public meeting of his party.After breaking the glass, a brick also hit him, he said.“If this is the situation, how can one expect free and fair polls in Cooch Behar, where people had voted for change in the 2019 Lok Sabha election,” Ghosh said in a video message.Cooch Behar district will go to polls in the fourth phase of assembly elections on April 10.The BJP won seven seats in North Bengal, including Cooch Behar, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.It was alleged that TMC workers returning from a rally of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, which was held in another nearby town, got embroiled in a clash with BJP activists attending Ghosh’s meeting.“I was waiting in my vehicle after our meeting for the people to leave when we were attacked with firearms, bombs, bricks and sticks by people holding TMC flags. It was like a Talibani attack,” Ghosh said.It was alleged that several country-made bombs were hurled at his car.He claimed that the police did not act to prevent the attack on him and BJP supporters.Ghosh said that if the Election Commission does not take immediate action, polling in constituencies in Cooch Behar will be a “farce”.TMC spokesman Kunal Ghosh said that the ruling party was not involved in the attack. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-bengal-chief-says-tmc-workers-attacked-his-car-in-north-bengal-235963
07-04-2021||New Delhi||PM Modi to hold virtual summit with newly elected India-origin President of Seychelles||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold a virtual summit with the newly elected India-origin President of Seychelles who holds the key to India’s bid to set up a naval base on this strategically located Indian Ocean island.In his interaction with Wavel Ramkalawan, PM Modi will announce India’s participation in a new magistrates’ court building, hand over a new naval ship, inaugurate a mini solar plant and announce 10 high impact community development projects.India was well on course for a naval base in Seychelles when in 2015, PM Modi signed an agreement with Ramkalawan’s predecessor Danny Faure who visited India in 2018 to affirm the pact.But Bihar-origin Ramkalawan’s party in coalition with three other parties shot down the agreement on environmental grounds as the site, Resumption Islands, is close to a UNESCO World Heritage Site.Now, with the priest-politician Ramkalawan himself as President, PM Modi would be hoping to resuscitate the project.India’s ultimate game plan is to achieve greater proximity with four island nations in the Indian Ocean—Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius and Seychelles – that are collectively called Vanilla Island nations.South Block is also planning a stand-alone summit with the Vanilla Group after the last one held in 2019. It will also partner with France, which has maintained post-colonial ties with these nations in sensitive areas such as defence and security.After the change in government in Seychelles, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar visited Victoria in November last year to create a more conducive political environment for the revival of proposal to lease an island from Seychelles.As is the case with Mauritius, over half of Seychelles’ maritime and air assets and most of the training is provided by India. In the latest case, India will gift Seychelles a Rs 100-crore indigenously built Fast Patrol Vessel (FPV) for anti-smuggling and search and rescue operations.  The ‘PS Zoroaster’ will be the fourth gifted FPV. The others include PS Topaz (2005), PS Constant (2014) and Patrol Boat Hermes (2016). Seychelles was among the first beneficiaries of India’s Covid assistance. India shipped over four tonnes of life saving medicines and 50,000 doses of vaccine doses to Seychelles under the Vaccine Maitri initiative.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-to-hold-virtual-summit-with-newly-elected-india-origin-president-of-seychelles-235958

07-04-2021||New Delhi||Ahead of crucial by-polls, trouble brews in Karnataka BJP||Amid the high-voltage political activity across the country, including Maharashtra, Karnataka too appears to be undergoing a political churning ahead of crucial by-polls scheduled on April 17.While the ruling BJP is facing a tough challenge in the Belagavi Lok Sabha and the Basavakalyan and Maski Assembly segments, Chief Minister BS Yeddiyurappa seems to have been to fend for himself amid string of charges against him.Sources, in fact, say his fate depends upon the result of the three constituencies.“The BJP is facing trouble from within rather than the opposition Congress,” say sources.Persistent attacks against the chief minister by colleagues and disgruntlement MLAs following a series of controversies have taken their toll. The party is facing “serious issues” in all the three seats, including Belagavi which is considered as among its core constituencies.The decision to field Mangala Angadi, wife of late Union minister Suresh Angadi (from Belagavi) has created a rift among party cadres. Dissenters are calling the decision “against the BJP’s declared stance against dynasty politics”, they say.Trouble has been brewing in the Karnataka BJP for several weeks, in fact months, now. However, despite the controversies the central leadership has not made any move to make amends, making many believe that perhaps it is waiting for the “right time” to make any decision related to Yeddiyurappa, a strongman in his own right.The incumbent CM has been battling criticism from senior BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, who has been relentlessly questioning his style of functioning and his son’s “alleged interference in government affairs”. However, apart from a general show-cause notice, he has not faced any disciplinary action. There was this sex CD case allegedly involving Ramesh Jarkiholi following which he quit from the Cabinet.Recently another minister, KS Eshwarappa, wrote to the Governor, accusing Yediyurappa of lapses and running the state in an authoritarian way, have only added to the problems of the CM. “The internal party strife may hurt the BJP in by-polls but the central leadership is waiting for the right time to make changes,” say party leaders in know of developments in Karnataka.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-crucial-by-polls-trouble-brews-in-karnataka-bjp-235920

Following a detailed probe into the matter, we nabbed the three men,” he said.“The three accused received Rs 1.5 lakh from the ISI agent via Dubai-Mumbai ‘angadia’ (courier) route for setting the shops on fire,” he said.Vanzara is a petty criminal and came in contact with the ISI agent through Facebook, the official said.Baba Bhai, without revealing his identity or motive, offered money to Vanzara to kill random people and set shops afire, the official claimed.“Vanzara had earlier taken Rs 25,000 from the ISI agent through Paytm to buy a gun,” Singh said.Deputy Commissioner of Police Chaitanya Mandlik said Baba Bhai used to send friend requests to people having criminal mentality and those in need of money.“We traced some of the IP addresses, used by the ISI agent to chat with Vanzara, to Karachi, which establishes the ISI connection. This was a money trap laid by them to lure Indian citizens to spread terror and cause economic losses,” Mandlik said.The trio and the unidentified ISI agent, who was giving instructions to them from abroad, have been booked under Indian Penal Code Sections 121 (waging war against the government) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy), and relevant provisions of the UAPA, the police said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-linked-isi-terror-module-busted-in-gujarat-3-held-235906
07-04-2021||New Delhi||Anil Ambani's son Anmol lashes out against lockdowns; says it is only about control not health||Anmol Ambani, the eldest son of industrialist Anil Ambani, has lashed out against a new round of lockdowns being imposed amid the surge in COVID-19 cases, saying such restrictions do not concern health but control and that they destroy the very backbone of the society and economy.The 29-year-old former executive director of Reliance Capital Ltd in a series of tweets lambasted the new semi-lockdown rules hurting small businesses and daily wage earners."Professional 'actors' can continue shooting their films. Professional 'cricketers' can play their sport late into the night. Professional 'politicians' can continue their rallies with masses of people. But YOUR business or work is not ESSENTIAL. Still don't get it?" he said in a tweet. He had in the past too voiced opposition to such restrictions and retweeted videos and comments denouncing them."What does essential even mean? EACH INDIVIDUALS WORK IS ESSENTIAL TO THEM," he said tweeting with hashtag #scamdemic.Lockdowns, he said, are key in "continuing and enabling greatest wealth transfer in human history.""The mistake is that the people think this is simply inefficient governance. it's not. It's a coordinated, thought out set of policies designed to enable a new world order to be brought in," he said.For an economy that was seeking nascent recovery after the world's strictest lockdown last year pummelled business, a resurgence of the pandemic is posing a serious threat. States have announced partial lockdowns in response to infections rising by record levels.While Maharashtra has shut all non-essential services through April, the national capital has started night curfew.The specter of another lockdown is now the biggest headwind for local businesses."These lockdowns were never about and have nothing to do with health," Ambani tweeted. "They destroy the very backbone of our society and economy, from the daily wage workers, self-employed and SMEs to the restaurants and dhabas, fashions and clothing stores." Lockdowns also destroy and diminish health by closing gyms, sports complexes and playgrounds, he said, adding that exercise, sunlight and fresh air are some of the strongest pillars of good health and strong immunity."And don't forget the psychological damage this is doing to children who are growing up through this madness and are being programmed to believe this is normal," he said.Stating that lockdowns worsen inequality, he said shutting down of brick-and-mortar stores benefits digital and e-commerce companies, farmland is corporatised and colonised and data and privacy are sold to new-age empires."This is not about health. This is about control, and I would think most of us are unknowingly and unconsciously falling into the trap of a much larger and very sinister plan," he said. "To control every aspect of your life - A technocracy exactly like China - A totalitarian bio-surveillance fascist state-controlled from the outside." Anmol, however, said he has faith in India and its people. "That we will resist this global coup d etat and not let our country get colonised even more. All we need to do is wake up to the truth. Stand for love, peace, unity and compassion." Anil and his elder brother Mukesh Ambani, who in 2005 split business set up by their father Dhirubhai Ambani, have seen contrasting business fortunes.While Mukesh rose to become Asia's richest expanding the oil and petrochemical business he inherited into retail and telecom, Anil slipped out of the billionaire list after the telecom, energy and capital business that he got did not perform so well.Anmol tweeted about inequalities that lockdowns create."It's no coincidence that the losses of the common man are gains of the wealthiest," he said, adding that lockdowns accelerate this "wealth transfer." He later retweeted one Jeremy R Hammond comment that "Note that by their own definition, #lockdown measures including stay-at-home orders and business closures are 'a crime against humanity' and 'an attack on the civilian population'." On April 5, he commented on a media report of migrant workers in Mumbai planning to return to their native places after lockdown, saying, "Planned destruction of the economy, livelihoods and lives. This is new age colonisation and very few realise it. Classic IMPERIALISM. Colonisation of your mind, body and soul. Take back your power. Go back to your roots." On April 2, he said, "the plan is to perpetually keep us in a state of emergency. It seems like this festival week will be used to impose further totalitarian measures. Testing is only being increased to justify more lockdowns and puch the quackcines. Resist.""The more you listen/obey, propagate the fear, the longer this will carry on," he said on that day.On March 27, he said, "This lockdown nonsense will keep happening if you don't resist. It's just a control tactic and has nothing to do with your health.

07-04-2021||New Delhi||COVID-19 variants, susceptible population, slack in following COVID appropriate behaviour behind second wave: Experts||Slack in following COVID appropriate behaviour, a susceptible population and spread of variants could be among the main reasons for the second wave of coronavirus that has hit the country, healthcare experts have said.The number of new coronavirus cases in India touched a record daily high since the outbreak of the pandemic with over 1.15 lakh new infections being reported in a span of 24 hours, pushing the nationwide COVID-19 tally to 1,28,01,785 on Wednesday.             The single-day rise in cases breached the one-lakh mark for the second time in three days.Dr Giridhara R Babu, Professor and Head, Lifecourse Epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India, said three important factors can be responsible for the surge of cases."Although the government has not acknowledged it as there is no clear evidence, there is definitely a role of new variants of concern which are more infectious and probably some of them are immune escape variants also and they are spreading faster than the earlier versions," Babu told PTI. Immune escape variants are not detected by the immune system. Some mutations confer this property to the virus and the antibodies are unable to detect it.  The Brazil variant is generally not detected by antibodies and then there is a sub-group of South African variant that is also not detected, he said. "Most importantly, the pace of vaccination is not as fast as one would expect India to be in. The pace at which the vulnerable have to be covered is not satisfactory," he said. He said it is very difficult to specifically say if the variant factor is responsible for the surge in India because genome sequencing has not been done to the levels that are expected. "So we are left guessing but nothing else can explain why cases are surging so fast and affecting the areas that presumably had higher levels of antibodies in serosurveys," he said.Talking about the possibility of re-infection, he said it might be happening because of waning antibodies. "There is a role for reinfections, but it has not been studied in detail. As a result, there are a greater number of people who are susceptible," he said.Babu further said environmental factors and community behaviour are also playing their part. "Almost everything we do, whether it is rallies, melas, marriage, all this lead to transferring of infection from one person to another. "Unless we act on each of these, work on understanding the virus and reducing its geographical area, building host immunity by speeding up vaccination and changing the environmental factors that facilitate faster spread, we can't really expect that the wave will be controlled. "Right now, it is surging ahead as a combination of all these may be at play," he said.Speaking in the same vein, epidemiologist Dr N K Arora said the upsurge is because of "4-5 factors acting simultaneously". He said all viral infections come in a wave, which is a natural phenomenon, and COVID-19 reached its crescendo in September last year. After ebbing, it is again seeing a crest.He said the fear factor which was there in the initial six months of this pandemic has come down significantly as the economy has opened up, people have started moving out and have become less careful when it comes of COID-appropriate behaviour, he said. Moreover, social gatherings have increased and people have also started going out on vacations."All this is linked to the decline in fear factor and the perception that it is a mild disease," he said. He also noted that wearing masks has drastically reduced.Responding to a question on whether new variants of the coronavirus could be responsible for the surge, Arora said there are several aspects to the issue."If we look at variant isolation rate versus the number of cases coming up it looks like they might be contributing but not a significant proportion of this upsurge is because of the variants," he told PTI.He said the number of susceptible people in the community is still very high which is leading to this upsurge.Prof Jayaprakash Muliyil, the former Principal, Christian Medical College, Vellore and the Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the National Institute of Epidemiology, said a new susceptible pool has emerged because of people being a little less anxious about COVID. Earlier, people were frightened, but now the same population is less worried.On the role of variants, he said they could increase the attack rate, but there has to be a susceptible population. “A new variant which completely ignores previous immunity acquired due to the infection is a very remote possibility and presently there is no evidence that it is operating,” he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-variants-susceptible-population-slack-in-following-covid-appropriate-behaviour-behind-second-wave-experts-235901

My brother was injured when he tried to stop them from attacking me," Muhsin told a television channel from the hospital on Wednesday.Abdullah, their father, also said his sons were attacked by the assailants in front of his eyes.Though the attackers had targeted Muhsin, the younger son was killed when he tried to stop their bid against his brother, he added.While IUML alleged that the ruling CPI(M) was behind the killing of Mansur, the Left party dismissed the charge and took a stand that it was not a political murder.However, putting the ruling party in a fix, police on Wednesday said it was suspected to be a political murder and said more than 10 people might be involved in the incident.Kannur district police chief R Ilango, who visited the crime scene, said investigation is going on and the prime focus is to nab all the accused at the earliest."We suspect it to be a political murder. The investigation is going on and so we cannot come to a final conclusion at this stage.  We are probing the conspiracy angle also," he told reporters here.The officer also said a special investigation team would be constituted to probe the case.Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala and senior IUML leader P K Kunhalikutty lashed out at CPI(M) over the crime."CPI(M) is unleashing violence across the state out of fear of failure in the assembly polls. The UDF workers are facing threat in many places.The Youth League activist' murder is condemnable. The Left party should be ready to end violence," he said at Haripad.Terming Mansur's murder as a "pre-planned" one, Kunhalikutty said there were reports that one of the attackers had put a social media post hours before the murder that the IUML would remember this day forever, giving indications to the heinous act.However, CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan denied that it was a political murder.Meanwhile, as a mark of protest, the Congress-led UDF opposition is observing a hartal at Koothuparamba on Wednesday.Koothuparamba assembly constituency in the northern Kerala district of Kannur witnessed a fierce contest between K P Mohanan of the Lok Janatantrik Dal, a partner of the ruling CPI(M) led Left Democratic Front (LDF) and Pottankandy Abdullah of the IUML.Meanwhile, several incidents of violence between the activists of various political parties were reported across the state since the culmination of polling on Tuesday.Clashes between Congress and CPI(M) activists were reported at Haripad and Kayamkulam.Yova Morcha district vice president, Sreejith Parakkalayi was hacked by an unidentified gang at Kanhangadu in Kasaragod district last night.He was admitted to a hospital in Mangalure with injuries and the BJP alleged that CPI(M) was behind the incident.At Kayamkulam, a youth congress activist and booth agent in Tuesday's election, Soman, was hacked allegedly by CPI(M) workers.A BJP leader's house was attacked at Kollam last night and the saffron party suspected the involvement of the Marxist party behind the act. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/muslim-league-worker-killed-in-post-poll-clash-in-kerala-235889

The abdominal swelling started 4-5 years back and was slowly increasing in size.It started rapidly increasing in size from the last year and started causing discomfort to the girl and she was having pain and difficulty in breathing.Due to fear of the Covid-19 disease, the patient's family reportedly did not approach any hospital to seek medical care.In March, the family finally visited sir Ganga Ram hospital and met Dr Tarun Mittal (laparoscopic and bariatric surgeon) Department of General and Laparoscopic Surgery one week back from the surgery."At that time her abdomen was grossly distended and a huge lump was felt encompassing the full abdomen during a clinical examination. We were surprised that the swelling has reached such a huge size without causing many complaints," Mittal said."An urgent CT scan was done to find the nature and origin of the swelling which showed a large lobulated mass (30x20x14cm) in the retroperitoneal area." After proper evaluation and counselling of the parents and the girl's surgery was planned and the two tumours were operated on March 25 with full precautions, the surgeon said."During surgery, it was confirmed that a large retroperitoneal mass was present occupying whole of the abdominal cavity and was densely adherent to vital structures including large blood vessels and intestine."Utmost precautions were taken that vital structures including blood vessels and intestine are not injured during the surgery," Mittal said.In a successful surgery that lasted three hours, the doctor said the tumour was removed totally.Asked about the current situation of the girl, the doctor told IANS that she underwent an uneventful surgery but now she is perfectly fine and participating in her all-daily work like a healthy person.The surgical team was led by Tarun Mittal along with Dr Ashish Dey and Dr Anmol Ahuja, and the anaesthetist team included Dr Jayashree Sood and Dr Ajay Sirohi."The tumour was completely excised and measured 32x22 cm and weighed 5kg. The tumour was sent for histopathological examination. The girl recovered well and was discharged within few days of surgery," the doctor said.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/girl-aged-12-with-5-kg-tumour-gets-new-life-after-surgery-235878
07-04-2021||New Delhi||Plea in Delhi HC for regulatory body to review non-film songs, music videos having vulgar content||A PIL in the Delhi High Court on Wednesday contended there is a need for a regulatory body to review non-film songs and music videos as many of them contain obscene or vulgar content that are available for viewing without any restrictions.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh issued notice to the ministries of Information and Broadcasting and Electronics and Information Technology seeking their stand on the plea by two lawyers who are also seeking an immediate ban of such content.The petitioners - Neha Kapoor and Mohit Bhadu—who are both practising advocates have sought a direction to the central government to set up a body "for regulating/reviewing the contents/lyrics of non-film songs and their music videos, which are released and streamed and made available on various platforms/ applications".In their plea, filed through advocate Rishu Singh, the petitioners have claimed that such songs and videos are not only available on TV and radio for public viewing, but are being circulated on applications like YouTube, Gaana.com and Instagram.They have contended that non-regulated content has a negative impact on the minds of the general public.They have claimed that some of these songs and music videos promote use of drugs, alcohol and also objectify women and the same were not acceptable.The petition contends that such songs and videos have an adverse effect on teenagers and small children whose thinking can be influenced by such content."Such non-film songs have the effect of eroding the Indian value system and instigating the listeners, especially the youth in believing that drugs, alcohol and most importantly objectifying women is acceptable and these things are necessary to survive at par with your peers in the society," the petition has alleged.  Besides seeking creation of a regulatory body, the plea also seeks a "ban of all such non-film songs available on the internet having obscene/vulgar content with immediate effect". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-in-delhi-hc-for-regulatory-body-to-review-non-film-songs-music-videos-having-vulgar-content-235877

In over 15 hours journey, he was not given water and food on the way and was also denied medical aid. Due to this, he became unwell and reached Banda jail in a semi-unconscious state," Afzal Ansari, the BSP MP from Ghazipur, told PTI.Afzal Ansari, however, did not elaborate on how did he get to know about the treatment meted out to his brother during his transfer to the Banda jail.Also read: Gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari brought back to UP's Banda jail from Punjab"The Yogi Adityanath government has left behind Britishers by such acts. Contrary to the jail manual, Mukhtar has been kept in isolation barrack. Those who have to protect laws are creating terror. It would have be better that he (Mukhtar) was made to stand at some road crossing and shot dead." he said.The Uttar Pradesh government in an statement issued here said, "Undertrial Ansari was brought from Punjab's Ropar jail at about 4.50 am to Banda prison gate by a special team and he finally got entry at 5 am. All his belongings were checked and no objectionable items were found. A team of Banda Medical college doctors did his check-up and found no immediate health issues." "Mukhtar Ansari would be tested for COVID-19 later in the day inside the jail. According to the Supreme Court orders, with the help of district administration and Chief Medical officer, Banda, his health arrangements are  being ensured," the statement said.ADG, Prison Anand Kumar has given strict instructions for round-the-clock security of Mukhtar Ansari, who is also Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA from Mau.Elaborate arrangements have been made inside the prison, where he will be kept in barrack number 16, which will be under 24-hour camera surveillance, the statement said, adding the entire Banda jail is covered with CCTV cameras and is being monitored by senior officers from jail headquarter command centre in Lucknow.For outer security of the jail, additional force of PAC has been deployed and Banda city magistrate has been made incharge jail superintendent for administrative and security arrangements, it said.Two new deputy jailors have been deputed and additional head jail warder and jail warder have been made available to the prison, the government statement said.Afzal Ansari also claimed that the blood-sugar level and blood pressure of Mukhtar Ansari, who has diabetes, have increased and alleged that the jail administration is not accepting the request to provide him a doctor."Instead of treating him, he was being administered injection to put him to sleep," Afzal Ansari alleged. He further claimed that his brother was kept in the ambulance for over one-and-half-hours even after reaching the Banda jail."At around 9 am, some persons known to Mukhtar reached the jail to meet him but were returned from the prison premises. Mukhtar is an undertrial and despite this he is getting treatment like a convict," he said, adding "such a treatment was never given to any undertrial in the history of the country".After spending over two years in a Punjab prison, Mukhtar Ansari was brought back to Banda jail in the early hours of Wednesday.He was ferried in an ambulance guarded by a strong posse of gun-toting security personnel throughout his 900-km journey from Rupnagar to the Uttar Pradesh town in the Bundelkhand region.Mukhtar Ansari was lodged in Rupnagar jail in January 2019 in connection with an extortion case.

07-04-2021||New Delhi||SC to hear on April 9 plea of Mukhtar Ansari's wife for his protection in UP||The Supreme Court will hear on Friday the plea of the wife of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari seeking directions to the Uttar Pradesh authorities to ensure that her husband's life is “protected” in the state besides being accorded fair trial in cases against him.A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy, as per the apex court's website, would hear on April 9 the plea of Afshan Ansari, who has also expressed apprehension about possible attempts to eliminate her spouse in Uttar Pradesh.Uttar Pradesh Police on Tuesday got Ansari's custody from its Punjab counterpart as per the direction of the apex court. He is accused of heinous crimes in several cases lodged against him in Uttar Pradesh.The plea in the apex court has alleged that there is a “genuine, persistent and grave threat” to Ansari's life in Uttar Pradesh and there are “very high chances” that he will be eliminated if adequate protection or safeguards towards his life are not directed by the apex court.The plea said several attempts had been made on his life in the past by political rivals.It sought direction that transit of her husband from one jail to another as also to the court be video-graphed at all times and be carried out in the presence of officers of central police force such as CRPF.The top court had on March 26 directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of Ansari, who was lodged in Ropar jail there since January 2019 in connection with an alleged extortion case, to Uttar Pradesh Police.The fresh plea has sought directions to the Uttar Pradesh authorities to provide adequate safeguards and protection to her husband while he is shifted to district jail Banda in Uttar Pradesh from Punjab.She has also sought directions to the authorities to provide protection to Ansari, an MLA from Mau constituency, while he is lodged in Banda jail or any other jail as may be decided by the special judge (MP/MLA court) in Allahabad and also while he is produced before the courts in Uttar Pradesh.The plea has sought directions to the authorities to ensure that life of Ansari is protected and his rights under Article 21 of the Constitution are safeguarded while attending trial in all cases against him in Uttar Pradesh.    “The threat to the life of the petitioner's husband (Ansari) is not merely an apprehension, but has also been substantiated in the past by several attempts made on his life by political rivals,” it claimed.“There is a hanging threat to the life of the petitioner's husband and there are very high chances that he will be eliminated if adequate protection or safeguards towards his life are not directed by this court,” it said.

07-04-2021||New Delhi||SC to hear on Fri Centre's plea to close cases against Italian marines who killed Indian fishermen||The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to hear on April 9 the Centre's plea seeking closure of cases against two Italian marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen off the Kerala coast in February 2012.The Centre told the top court that it has contacted the victims' family members and due compensation has been paid to them. A bench of Chief Justice Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian was informed by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who mentioned the matter for urgent listing, that on last occasion the court had asked the Centre to contact the victim's family.  “They were contacted. They have been paid the due compensation. They are here also,” Mehta said. The bench then said that it will take up the matter for further hearing in next week.Mehta requested the bench to take up the matter for hearing on Friday saying “there is some urgency since it is between the Indian and Italian government”. The bench then said “ok” and agreed to hear the plea on Friday.On August 7 last year, the top court had made it clear to the Centre that it would not pass any order on the plea seeking closure of cases against two Italian marines, accused of killing two Indian fishermen, without hearing the victims' families, who should be given adequate compensation.It had asked the Centre to make the victims' family members as parties to its plea seeking closure of Italian Marines case.The Centre had told the top court that Italy has assured the Indian government that it would prosecute the Marines there as per law and that maximum compensation will be ensured to the victims' family members. The apex court had said it appreciates the steps taken by Italy to prosecute these marines but the court was concerned with the adequate compensation to victims' kin.While referring to the case against the marines pending before the special court, the top court had said that without applying for withdrawal of prosecution of case how the Centre can approach it and seek closure of the matter.The Centre had referred to the last year's ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) at Hague which held that India was entitled to get compensation in the case but can't prosecute the marines due to official immunity enjoyed by them.On July 3 last year, the Centre had moved the top court seeking closure of judicial proceedings here against the Italian marines.In February 2012, India had accused two Italian marines, Salvatore Girone and Massimiliano Latorre, on board the MV Enrica Lexie -- an Italian flagged oil tanker -- of killing two Indian fishermen who were on a fishing vessel in India's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).The Centre had said the arbitration under United Nation Convention on the Law of Sea (UNCLOS), which was instituted on a request from Italy, has delivered its Award on May 21, 2020.It said the Tribunal upheld the conduct of Indian authorities with respect to the incident and highlighted the material and moral harm suffered by the Indian fishermen on board the St. Antony on February 15, 2012.“It held that the actions of the Italian Marines breached India's freedom and right of navigation under UNCLOS Article 87(1)(a) and 90,” the application had said, adding, that the Tribunal had observed that, in principle, India and Italy had concurrent jurisdiction over the incident and a valid legal basis to institute criminal proceedings against the Marines.It said the Tribunal took note of the commitment expressed by Italy to resume its criminal investigation into the events of February 15, 2012 and decided that India must take necessary steps to cease to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over the marines.Latorre, who had suffered a brain stroke on August 31, 2014, was first granted bail and allowed by the apex court on September 12, 2014 to go to Italy for four months and after that, extensions for his stay have been granted to him.  In Italy, Latorre had to undergo a heart surgery after which the top court had granted him extension of his stay in his native country.  On September 28, 2016, the apex court had allowed Latorre to remain in his country till the international arbitral tribunal decided the jurisdictional issue.  On May 26, 2016, Girone was also granted bail with conditions and allowed by the top court to go to his country till the jurisdictional issue was decided.  The complaint against the marines was lodged by Freddy, the owner of fishing boat 'St Antony' in which two Kerala fishermen were killed when marines opened fire on them allegedly under misconception that they were pirates.

A five-foot-long Indian Rock Python was rescued by the Wildlife SOS Rapid Response Unit after it was sighted at the Taj Mahal ticket counter. The snake was kept under observation for a few hours and later released in its natural habitat.The tourism police officials stationed at the West Gate of the historical monument found a 5-foot-long Indian Rock Python on Tuesday morning at the ticket counter. Taking quick action, they immediately reported the incident to Wildlife SOS on their 24-hour helpline number (+91-9917109666).A two-member team geared up with necessary rescue equipment immediately reached the location to carry out the rescue operation. After ensuring that the police staff were at a safe distance, the rescuers carefully transferred the python to a safe transport carrier.Vidhyabhushan Singh, Tourism Police Constable, who called Wildlife SOS, said, "The python was spotted near the ticket counter window by local tourists. Since the Wildlife SOS team had carried out such rescues from the premises in the past as well we immediately alerted them." Kartick Satyanarayan, Co-founder and CEO of Wildlife SOS, said, "We are thankful to the tourism police at the Taj Mahal for their support and for alerting Wildlife SOS to this emergency. Operations involving snakes are highly sensitive. We have trained rescuers who are efficient and employ precautions so as to avoid causing further stress to the animal."Baiju Raj M.V, Director Conservation Projects for Wildlife SOS, said, "Over the years, we have rescued several reptiles and birds from the Taj Mahal premises as it is close to the Taj Nature Walk green belt."

In 2020, India's economy contracted by a record 8 per cent.However, compared to the previous projections, the change in 2021 forecast is pretty small, she noted."In the case of India, we have a pretty small change. It's 1 percentage increase for growth for 2021. This came in with high frequency," she said in response to a question.Malhar Nabar, Division Chief of the research department at the IMF, told reporters that the current forecast that the IMF has for India already takes a fairly conservative view on the sequential growth for the Indian economy for this year.

Of these, 65 officers are LMC.

In the Capital, the curfew came into force from Tuesday, while in the UT it will be imposed from Wednesday.Farm stir, local poll behind Punjab surgeHealth Minister Harsh Vardhan said the surge in Punjab was mainly event-driven with marriages, local body poll and farmers’ agitation playing their part. He said this at a virtual interaction with 11 high-burden states.Aim is to protect vulnerable lotThe basic aim is to reduce death through vaccination… the aim for any country is to protect those who are the most vulnerable. The aim is never to administer the vaccine to those who want it but to those who need it. — Rajesh Bhushan, Union Health SecretaryThe Centre is focusing on aggressive containment in 50 districts of the three most-affected states, including nine in Punjab, where Central teams reached today to start daily reporting of testing, treatment and tracking data.Health Minister Harsh Vardhan held a review meeting with his counterparts in 11 states of concern (Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Gujarat, MP, TN, Delhi, Haryana, Kerala and Chandigarh) and told them that the pandemic situation could still be salvaged with the implementation of Covid-appropriate behaviour and basic strategies of test, track and treat that helped India reduce daily cases to a low of 8,635 on February 2.“If winning strategies are implemented seriously, cases will drop as fast as they rose,” Vardhan said, adding that “people abdicated protocols with impunity”.The government today also said the ongoing “Covid vaccine for all adults” debate had no scientific rationale and no research had yet shown that the expansion of jabs could induce greater herd immunity.“All we know is that the currently available vaccines prevent mortality and severity of disease, which is why all nations have prioritised vaccine strategies. Trivialisation of the vaccination issue will put us off track. We must accept the current national strategy and focus on removing vaccine hesitancy among eligible groups, achieving 100 per cent coverage,” NITIAayog member (Health) VK Paul said on a day when India administered record 43 lakh doses among 8, 31,10,926 cumulative doses so far, much faster than any other nation.Although Paul said the US, UK, Australia and Switzerland had all chosen to vaccinate the vulnerable and elderly and no nation had yet covered under 50 people (India is covering 45 plus), New York today expanded the jab for 16 to 29-year-olds.Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan shared vaccine strategies of western nations saying, “Covid vaccine is finite. It has two goals – preventing deaths and protecting health systems. It has to be given to those in need; not to those desirous of it.”The clarifications came as the Indian Medical Association wrote to the PM to expand vaccines to all above 18 years and the Maharashtra CM asked for the eligible age group to be lowered to 23.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-says-next-4-weeks-critical-but-no-shots-for-all-as-of-now-235647

As the HC had given the CBI only 15 days to complete probe, the CBI had taken swift action, officials said.Mumbai-based lawyer Jayshree Patil — on whose petition the HC had ordered the probe — also filed a caveat in the Supreme Court to pre-empt any chances of ex parte order on the petitions filed by the government and Deshmukh who was forced to resign after the HC order.In his petition, Deshmukh said the HC order was passed without hearing him and ignoring the fact that the Maharashtra Government had revoked the general consent given to the CBI. He said the HC did not give an opportunity to the police to respond to the charges.“Presently, the CBI is being headed by an interim Director, the legality of which is also sub judice before the SC. This also is a factor that should have been taken into account, before the High Court passed the order,” Deshmukh argued.Describing it as an “extraordinary” and “unprecedented” case that warranted an independent inquiry, a Bombay High Court Bench headed by Chief Justice Dipankar Dutta had said Singh’s allegations against Deshmukh had put at stake citizens’ faith in the state police.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-govt-deshmukh-move-sc-against-cbi-probe-order-235650

But paths of Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US special presidential envoy John Kerry crossed at a hotel here and they talked about climate-related matters. TNSNoting that Russia was the only partner that transferred cutting-edge military technology to India, Lavrov said talks touched on manufacturing of state-of-the-art weapon systems.“In this strategically important area, Russia is a major foreign contractor for New Delhi. I am sure deepening of Russian Indian military cooperation serves the national interest of both countries,” said Lavrov.Denying that he had said the US exercised pressure on India, Lavrov said there were no discussions on statements from the US against arms trade with Russia.Both sides touched on cooperation in energy, including nuclear, peaceful exploration of space and manned programs, rocket engine building, satellite navigation, the Russian Far East and the Arctic.Fresh from a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi last month, Lavrov said though Russia-China relations at the summit-level were at their highest level in history; there were no discussions on a military alliance. Whether it was a Russia-China military alliance or talks of a Middle East NATO or an Asian NATO, “we believe it is counter-productive. Our Indian friends have the same position,” he observed.Lavrov hinted that in addition to an in-person summit of BRICS leaders in India next month, Moscow was also encouraging the idea of a Russia-India-China summit.In a pre-visit interview, he had said Russia was closely watching the process of normalisation at the LAC and welcomed the agreements reached after Jaishankar-Wang Yi telephone conversation on February 25 aimed at resolution of the situation.Afghanistan was a major area of discussions between the two Foreign Ministers as were other “thorny issues” in the neighbourhood such as Yemen, Syria and Iran. Lavrov described India as a “key player” for a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan and “definitely should be engaged in international efforts supporting Afghan national reconciliation process.” Jaishankar said a durable peace would require harmonising interests of all, both within and around that country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-russia-discuss-defence-production-235651

Modi flew to Howrah from Cooch Behar and addressed a second rally there before returning to New Delhi.With Muslims constituting 30 per cent of the voters, their support is key for Mamata, who has frequently been accused of pampering the religious minority group for the sake of votes.“You are saying you can sense that the Muslim vote bank is also not under your control any more… they have also deserted you,” Modi said. The PM said the appeal made by Mamata to the minority community was a sign that she had lost the elections.“Didi, you criticise the Election Commission. But if we had asked the Hindus to unite and vote for the BJP, we would have got eight or 10 notices from the Election Commission. Editorials would have been written condemning us in the country and abroad,” Modi said.In response, Mamata said, “Narendra Modi doesn’t have any political courtesy. He (Modi) is teasing me and it shows how important I have become for them. I don’t mind it. I respect the chair of the Prime Minister, but I haven’t seen a liar like Narendra Modi. He is spreading misinformation. They are bringing goons from other states to disturb the harmony and culture of Bengal,” Mamata said while addressing a rally.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-pm-trade-barbs-over-minority-votes-in-bengal-rally-235659

07-04-2021||New Delhi||Farmers’ protest, events behind Punjab surge: Harsh Vardhan||Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday said the COVID-19 spread in Punjab was mainly event-driven with marriages, local body elections and farmers’ agitation playing their part.In a virtual interaction with the health ministers of 11 high burden states, including Punjab’s Balbir Singh Sidhu, this evening, Vardhan said about Punjab, “In Punjab, the UK variant of the virus has been found in over 80 per cent cases. Cases are surging and genome sequencing has also established the presence of the variant. This case surge is mainly event driven with marriages, local body elections, and farmers’ agitation playing a part.”On Haryana’s disease graph, Vardhan said the infection spreading to smaller towns is a matter of concern.“What is happening calls for introspection and action. Laxity is evident in this constant surge. Even right now everything is in our control and if we stick to strategies that helped us contain the infection until February we can bring down the cases,” said Vardhan.He said 50 central teams in Punjab, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh will send daily feedback on containment progress to the Health Ministry for corrective action.The minister also said the recent spate of elections, Kumbh, reopening of offices, outdoor events by people and complete disregard for masks had led to the current surge.“The fight against COVID is no rocket science. We just need to do more of the same—masks, hand hygiene, social distancing,” Vardhan said, urging states to stringently remind people of the lost lessons.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-protest-events-behind-punjab-surge-harsh-vardhan-235477
07-04-2021||Washington||IMF projects India’s growth rate to jump to impressive 12.5 per cent in 2021||The IMF on Tuesday projected an impressive 12.5 per cent growth rate for India in 2021, stronger than that of China, the only major economy to have a positive growth rate last year during the COVID-19 pandemic.The Washington-based global financial institution, in its annual World Economic Outlook ahead of the annual Spring meeting with the World Bank, said the Indian economy is expected to grow by 6.9 per cent in 2022.Notably in 2020, India’s economy contracted by a record eight per cent, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said as it projected an impressive 12.5 per cent growth rate for the country in 2021.China, on the other hand which was the only major economy to have a positive growth rate of 2.3 per cent in 2020, is expected to grow by 8.6 per cent in 2021 and 5.6 per cent in 2022.Chief Economist at IMF Gita Gopinath said: “We are now projecting a stronger recovery in 2021 and 2022 for the global economy compared to our previous forecast, with growth projected to be 6 per cent in 2021 and 4.4 per cent in 2022”.In 2020, the global economy contracted by 3.3 per cent.“Nonetheless, the outlook presents daunting challenges related to divergences in the speed of recovery both across and within countries and the potential for persistent economic damage from the crisis,” she said in her foreword to the report.According to the report, after an estimated contraction of –3.3 per cent in 2020, the global economy is projected to grow at 6 per cent in 2021, moderating to 4.4 per cent in 2022.The contraction for 2020 is 1.1 percentage points smaller than projected in the October 2020 World Economic Outlook (WEO), reflecting the higher-than-expected growth outturns in the second half of the year for most regions after lockdowns were eased and as economies adapted to new ways of working.The projections for 2021 and 2022 are 0.8 percentage point and 0.2 percentage point stronger than in the October 2020 WEO, reflecting additional fiscal support in a few large economies and the anticipated vaccine-powered recovery in the second half of the year, the report said.Global growth is expected to moderate to 3.3 per cent over the medium term, reflecting projected damage to supply potential and forces that predate the pandemic, including aging-related slower labour force growth in advanced economies and some emerging market economies.In a blog post, Gopinath said the pandemic is yet to be defeated and virus cases are accelerating in many countries.Recoveries are also diverging dangerously across and within countries, as economies with slower vaccine rollout, more limited policy support, and more reliant on tourism do less well, she said.Gopinath said policymakers will need to continue supporting their economies while dealing with more limited policy space and higher debt levels than prior to the pandemic.This requires better targeted measures to leave space for prolonged support if needed. With multi-speed recoveries, a tailored approach is necessary, with policies well-calibrated to the stage of the pandemic, the strength of the economic recovery, and the structural characteristics of individual countries, she said.“Right now, the emphasis should be on escaping the health crisis by prioritising health care spending, on vaccinations, treatments, and health care infrastructure. Fiscal support should be well targeted to affected households and firms.“Monetary policy should remain accommodative (where inflation is well behaved), while pro-actively addressing financial stability risks using macroprudential tools,” she said.Once the health crisis is over, policy efforts can focus more on building resilient, inclusive, and greener economies, both to bolster the recovery and to raise potential output, Gopinath said.“The priorities should include green infrastructure investment to help mitigate climate change, digital infrastructure investment to boost productive capacity and strengthening social assistance to arrest rising inequality,” she added.The global economy shrank by 4.3 per cent last year, over two-and-a-half times more than during the global financial crisis of 2009.According to Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker, the COVID-19 has so far infected 131,707,267 people and killed 2,859,868 people across the world since it first broke out in central China’s Wuhan city in 2019. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/imf-projects-indias-growth-rate-to-jump-to-impressive-12-5-per-cent-in-2021-235457
07-04-2021||Aditi Tandon||No scientific rationale for ‘Covid vaccine for all’ debate: Govt||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 6As clamour increases for expansion of the ongoing COVID vaccine drive to include all above 18 years, the government on Tuesday said there was no scientific rationale or reason behind the “jab for all adults” debate.Citing evidence of vaccine strategy across the world, including in western nations like the US, UK, Australia and Switzerland, the Health Ministry today said no country was administering COVID vaccines without age specific or vulnerability specific criteria and most had not begun vaccinating people below 50. Also read: Official: Biden moving vaccine eligibility date to April 19 India from April 1 is vaccinating 45 plus people and has so far given 8.1 crore doses reaching a milestone of 43 lakh doses in the last 24 hours.“This narrative of vaccine for all adults will deflect us from our focus. Let’s concentrate on the current strategy, inoculate all eligible people and do it fast,” Member Health NITI Aayog VK Paul said noting that no research had yet shown that expansion of vaccinations would guarantee herd immunity.“This narrative of vaccines should not be trivialised. No vaccine research has shown yet that the immunity is achieved by expanding the scale of vaccination.  It is not scientifically proven that herd immunity will be reached by vaccinating all. What has been shown is that currently in use vaccines reduce deaths and severe disease and prioritisation of populations based on predilection for deaths is key and is being done worldwide,” Paul said.He cited WHO guidance on vaccines which is to reduce death and disease by targeting the most in need.“Vaccine strategy is simple. Vaccines are not to be given to those desirous of vaccines. They are to be given to those in need of vaccines,” said Bhushan, after Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray wrote to Prime Minister demanding lowering the vaccine age to 25.The government presented global data on now the US, UK, Germany, Switzerland, Australia had also prioritised populations to be inoculated.“The thought behind vaccinations is to cover those more vulnerable to deaths. Globally, vaccine is finite. We will lose focus of our path is this vaccine narrative goes on being trivialised,” said Paul urging states to accept the Indian vaccine strategy and remove current hesitancy.The government, meanwhile, said Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab were of utmost concern to them, and that peak of the current wave could not be predicted.Paul said the next four weeks are critical.The Centre has sent 50 multi-disciplinary teams to the three most affected states and these will report back on daily testing, tracking and treatment indicators to help contain the pandemic surge which Paul said was “rising alarmingly”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-scientific-rationale-for-covid-vaccine-for-all-debate-govt-235452
07-04-2021||New Delhi||Maharashtra: NCP leader Anil Deshmukh appeals Bombay High Court's probe order in Supreme Court||A day after the Bombay High Court ordered a CBI probe into former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh’s allegations of corruption against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, the state government and the NCP leader on Tuesday filed separate petitions in the Supreme Court against the high court order.Mumbai-based lawyer Jayshree Patil—on whose petition the Bombay High Court had ordered the CBI probe—also filed a caveat in the Supreme Court to preempt any chances of ex-parte order on the petitions filed by Maharashtra Government and Deshmukh, who was forced to resign after the high court’s order.In his petition, Deshmukh sought to assail the high court’s order, contending it was passed without hearing him and ignoring the fact that Maharashtra Government has revoked the general consent given to CBI. He said the high court did not give an opportunity to the state police to respond to the allegations.“Presently, the CBI today is being headed by an interim Director, the legality of which is also sub-judice before this Hon’ble Court. This also is a factor that should have been taken into account, before the Court passed the Order that it did,” Deshmukh submitted in his petition.Describing it as an “extraordinary” and “unprecedented” case that warranted an independent inquiry, a Bench of the Bombay High Court headed by Chief Justice Dipankar Dutta had said Singh’s allegations against Deshmukh had put at stake citizens’ faith in the state police.Such allegations, made by a serving police officer, against the state home minister could not be left unattended, and were required to be probed into, if prima facie, they made a case of a cognisable offence, the high court said.It said a probe by an independent agency was necessary in the case, to “instil public confidence and safeguard the Fundamental Rights of the citizens”.The high court had said even though the state government had ordered a high-level committee to probe into the allegations, an inquiry based on Patil’s complaint was necessary as per the law.Since the police investigating complaints against the home minister and a serving police officer would not be most appropriate, it is a fit case for ordering a CBI probe, it had noted.The high court had asked the CBI director to conduct a preliminary enquiry (PE) based on Patil’s complaint and a letter written by Param Bir Singh to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray that Patil had attached to her complaint.The high court said the CBI need not immediately register an FIR, but it must complete its PE within 15 days and then decide on further course of action.Courts were committed to ensuring the rule of law and preventing any breach of constitutional principles, irrespective of the high office an accused occupied, it had said.,There were three PILs seeking a CBI probe against Deshmukh who allegedly asked police officers, including suspended cop Sachin Vaze, to extort Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants. Deshmukh denied the allegations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-ncp-leader-anil-deshmukh-appeals-bombay-high-courts-probe-order-in-supreme-court-235434
07-04-2021||Ropar||UP Police take custody of gangster-turned-MLA Mukhtar Ansari||Uttar Pradesh police took custody of gangster-turned-MLA Mukhtar Ansari from Ropar jail authorities here on Tuesday.Ansari was lodged at Ropar jail in January 2019 after he was brought by Punjab police from Banda jail in Uttar Pradesh on a production warrant allegedly for demanding money from a businessman.As the Ropar jail authorities initially denied handing over him to UP police, the UP government moved the Supreme Court which on March 26 ordered the Punjab government to shift him to Uttar Pradesh. Following this, Punjab's home department had written to the Uttar Pradesh government to take custody of Ansari from Ropar jail by April 8.A police team from Banda in a convoy of eight vehicles, including a vajra van and an ambulance, reached Ropar jail around noon where security was beefed up using barricades in front of the jail. Two hours after completing formalities, the Uttar Pradesh cops took him away at 2.07 p.m. in an ambulance.Meanwhile, the controversial private ambulance in which Ansari was taken to appear before Mohali court from Ropar jail on March 31 was also taken away by UP police yesterday evening. The said ambulance was found abandoned 10 km away from Ropar on Anandpur Sahib road on Sunday.The ambulance was found registered using fake documents at Barabanki in the name of a private hospital situated at Mau from where Ansari is a BSP MLA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-police-take-custody-of-gangster-turned-mla-mukhtar-ansari-235427
07-04-2021||Washington||Masks, ventilation stop COVID-19 spread better than social distancing, study says||Masks and a good ventilation system are more important than social distancing for reducing the airborne spread of COVID-19 inside a room, a modelling study suggests.In the research, published in the journal Physics of Fluids, the researchers created a computer model of a classroom with students and a teacher.They then modelled airflow and disease transmission, and calculated airborne-driven transmission risk.The classroom model was 709 square feet with 9-foot-tall ceilings, similar to a smaller-size classroom.The model had masked students—any one of whom could be infected—and a masked teacher at the front of the classroom."The research is important as it provides guidance on how we are understanding safety in indoor environments," said Michael Kinzel, an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida in the US."The study finds that aerosol transmission routes do not display a need for six feet social distancing when masks are mandated," Kinzel said.The study highlights that with masks, transmission probability does not decrease with increased physical distancing, which emphasises how mask mandates may be important to increasing capacity in schools and other places, according to the researchers.The team examined the classroom using two scenarios -- a ventilated classroom and an unventilated one -- and using two models, Wells-Riley and Computational Fluid Dynamics.Wells-Riley is commonly used to assess indoor transmission probability and Computational Fluid Dynamics is often used to understand the aerodynamics of cars, aircraft and the underwater movement of submarines.Masks were shown to be beneficial by preventing direct exposure of aerosols, as they provide a weak puff of warm air that causes aerosols to move vertically, thus preventing them from reaching adjacent students, Kinzel said.The researchers noted that a ventilation system in combination with a good air filter reduced the infection risk by 40 to 50 per cent compared to a classroom with no ventilation.This is because the ventilation system creates a steady current of air flow that circulates many of the aerosols into a filter that removes a portion of the aerosols compared to the no-ventilation scenario where the aerosols congregate above the people in the room.These results corroborate recent guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that recommend reducing social distancing in elementary schools from six to three feet when mask use is universal, Kinzel said."If we compare infection probabilities when wearing masks, three feet of social distancing did not indicate an increase in infection probability with respect to six feet, which may provide evidence for schools and other businesses to safely operate through the rest of the pandemic," Kinzel said.The results suggest exactly what the CDC is doing, that ventilation systems and mask usage are most important for preventing transmission and that social distancing would be the first thing to relax, the researcher added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/masks-ventilation-stop-covid-19-spread-better-than-social-distancing-study-says-235407
07-04-2021||Vibha Sharma||BJP not an election machine, aims to win hearts: Modi on party's 41st Foundation Day||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 6Amid elections to four states and UT, including West Bengal where his party is engaged in a bitter contest with the ruling TMC, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the BJP is not an election-winning machine but a movement to win hearts of the people. Speaking on the party’s 41st ‘Sthapna Divas’ (foundation day) the PM accused BJP’s rivals of building “false narratives” around issues to create “political instability” in the country. “The 21st century is watching the end of dynastic rule. Masks of false secularism are also coming off, the BJP government’s ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas’ has ensured that,” the Prime Minister said, addressing party cadres.Asking them to remain watchful of such attempts, the Prime Minister said “imaginary fear” is being spread on issues like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), labour laws, and farm laws with the purpose to create “political instability” in the country. “Therefore, rumours are spread in the country, confusion is created… Sometimes they say the Constitution will be changed, sometimes that reservation will be quashed and sometimes that farmers’ land will be snatched,” he said, asking cadres to create awareness among the people on welfare schemes run by the Central government and combat “false narratives” by opponents on issues like farm laws and the CAA.Meanwhile, slamming those calling the BJP an “election-winning machine”, PM Modi said critics have never understood the maturity of Indian democracy. “When the BJP wins elections, it is called ‘election-winning machine’ but when others win, the party and its leaders are praised. “People who call BJP an ‘election-winning machine’ have not been able to measure the intelligence of its voters, they will never be able to understand their aspirations and dreams. The truth is that BJP is not an ‘election-winning machine’, but a continuous movement to win hearts of the country,” he said.Lauding cadres, PM Modi said what is visible in public is just a “tip of the iceberg” as majority remains hidden and working at grassroots. “It is because of them the BJP is the largest party in the world,” he said, also mentioning how many party-men were killed and attacked but they remained steadfast to their ideology. At the same time, he also asked them to be “humble” in the party’s electoral wins and achievements and continue working for welfare of people. “Set a 25-year personal goal as well as one for the party,” he said.Making a pitch of the nation above party, the PM said the government is being evaluated on its delivery system. He specifically mentioned how government’ schemes have empowered small farmers and women, citing the triple talaq law, increased maternity leave and greater property rights. Attacking the opposition, Modi said, “Parties that began with help from local aspirations, became a family-based party later. These parties, who were wearing a mask of secularism, are finally being unmasked.”Stating that the BJP respects and honours even its political rivals and those opposed to its ideologies, the PM said: “We do not believe in political untouchability.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-not-an-election-machine-aims-to-win-hearts-modi-on-partys-41st-foundation-day-235392

Nobody from the government or the CRPF informed us about the incident," Meenu, the wife of Minhas, told reporters at her residence in Barnai area on Jammu-Akhnoor road.She said she made frantic efforts to reach out to the CRPF headquarters in Jammu to know the whereabouts of Minhas. "I was told that there is nothing we can share with you. Once we get a clear picture, we will come to you," Meenu said as having been told by the CRPF officers.With her daughter in her lap who also pleaded for the safe return of her father, she said an officer also visited her house and repeated the assurance.She said Minhas had not picked up the phone since "we talked for the last time" on Friday at 9.30 pm when he was leaving for duty.Meenu said it was the government's duty to ensure his safe return to his family."My husband served the country for the last 10 years and now it is the turn of the government to ensure that he returns to us hale and hearty," she said surrounded by relatives who were there to support the family through the ordeal."Minhas joined the CRPF in 2011 and he has been serving the nation for the last 10 years. He was transferred to Chhattisgarh only three months back from Assam," she said, holding back her tears."I got a telephone call from a person who introduced himself as a local reporter from Chhattisgarh. He wanted me to send a picture of my husband along with an appeal to the Naxals," Meenu said.However, she did not respond to his calls after discussing the matter with her family.Meenu appealed to Lt Governor Manoj Sinha to take up the matter with the Union government and urge the prime minister and home minister for his safe return.

07-04-2021||Kolkata||Violence, attack on candidates in the third phase of Bengal polls||Five candidates, including two women, were assaulted, while clashes between rival political groups erupted during the third phase of polling in West Bengal on Tuesday.However, despite the violence, voter enthusiasm was high with 77.68 per cent of voters casting their ballots till 5 pm, two hours before polling ended.Polls were conducted with strict adherence to COVID-19 protocols, officials said.Voting in 16 seats in South 24 Parganas district (part II), saw 76.68 per cent votes being cast by 5 pm. While 77.93 per cent votes were cast in seven seats in Howrah (part I) and 79.36 per cent in eight in Hooghly (part I), they added.“Voter turnout of 77.68 per cent was recorded till 5 pm in 31 seats,” an EC official said.Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee, however, alleged “blatant misuse” of central forces to “influence voters”.“The blatant misuse of Central forces continues unabated.
