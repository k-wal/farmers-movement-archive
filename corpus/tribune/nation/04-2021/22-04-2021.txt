22-04-2021||New Delhi||HC asks Delhi govt to provide medical assistance to construction workers infected with COVID-19||The Delhi High Court on Thursday directed the AAP government to provide medical assistance to the construction workers who got infected by COVID-19.The high court directed the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board, which comes under the Delhi government, to implement its direction of providing medical assistance and not to involve in any complicated procedure which would render the order infructuous.“The counsel has suggested and we find merit in it that if any construction worker is found COVID-19 positive, he should be provided medical assistance on production of RT-PCR report,” a Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said.The Bench was hearing an application seeking to be impleaded as a party to a petition of advocate Rakesh Malhotra related to COVID-19 testings and infrastructure, which was revived by the high court itself on April 19, in view of surge in coronavirus cases.The application by National Campaign Committee for Central Legislation on Construction Labour, represented through advocates Shyel Trehan and Chirayu Jain, sought direction to the Delhi government and the Board to frame expeditious procedure for medical relief under The Building and Other Construction Workers (BOCW) Act for building workers and their dependants who get infected by COVID-19.The counsel said that Section 22(1)(f) of the BOCW Act and Rule 280 of Delhi BOCW Rules provide for medical assistance to be paid in case a building worker or their dependant is affected by major ailment and the financial assistance shall be Rs 2,000 for the first five days and Rs 200 each for remaining days, subject to maximum of Rs 10,000.The high court had on April 19 said that the Centre and AAP government had miserably failed to think about migrant workers during the 2020 lockdown and lessons were required to be learnt from it as daily wagers were again going to face the grim reality with the imposition of fresh six-day lockdown in the national capital in the wake of second wave of COVID-19.                      The high court had said as the Delhi government has announced a six-day lockdown from the night of April 19 to April 26 morning, the reports showed that migrant workers are again going back to their native places from here.The Bench had directed the Delhi government to arrange funds for providing food and other essential items to daily wagers and if need arises, withdraw the amount from the corpus under the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Cess Act.It had added that the Delhi government shall utilise the services of contractors who used to prepare mid-day meals in schools which are closed now.The high court, on its own, has revived the disposed of petition filed by Malhotra, noting that the virus has raised its “ugly head” once again and the pandemic is raging with much greater intensity and “it is evident that the healthcare infrastructure is at the stage of imminent collapse”.

22-04-2021||New Delhi||Red Fort violence: Court allows Delhi Police to obtain Deep Sidhu’s voice sample||A court here on Thursday allowed Delhi Police plea to obtain the voice sample of actor-activist Deep Sidhu, accused in connection with the Red Fort violence on the Republic Day.                       Metropolitan Magistrate Sahil Gupta allowed the application in which the police claimed that in order to authenticate the voice of the accused in several videos (Facebook live, TV interviews etc.), it was necessary that his voice was matched with the voice in those video clippings.Sidhu was arrested on February 9 and was granted bail by a Delhi court on April 16 in the case.       He was later arrested in another related case and is currently in judicial custody, while his bail application is pending in the matter.In its application, the police said that during the investigation, it came to the notice that accused was live on Facebook page and also made various posts on the date of incident.    “These video clips/Facebook live have been taken on record which contain the voice of accused,” the police told the court, while seeking his voice sample.The application was opposed by Sidhu’s counsel, saying that the police plea was an infringement of his fundamental rights.While allowing the police plea, the court termed as ‘premature’ the arguments made by the counsel for the accused that the application was vague and lacked any concrete detail of the videos for which the voice sample was required, saying that “the manner in which investigation is to be done is the prerogative of the investigating agency”.“Also, at the stage of investigation, one cannot assume that by obtaining the voice sample, false evidence by tampering with the video clips could be imputed against the accused.    “The admissibility and quality of evidence is a question to be determined during the trial and not at the stage of investigation,” the court said.The court added, “In light of above observation, the application of the IO (investigating officer) is hereby allowed. The accused Deep Sidhu was, in FIR No. 98/21, remanded to 14 days in Judicial Custody.”“Production warrant be issued against the accused with direction to Jail Superintendent to produce the accused at FSL, at a convenient time allocated by FSL, under more favourable conditions for the purpose of recording his voice sample in the presence of his counsel,” the court said.On January 26, thousands of protesting farmers who reached ITO from the Ghazipur border clashed with police, the agency claimed in its FIR registered in connection with the Red Fort violence, adding that many of them driving tractors reached the Red Fort and entered the monument, where a religious flag was also hoisted.In the FIR, police said two magazines with 20 live cartridges were snatched from two constables by protestors who also damaged vehicles and robbed anti-riot gear.

22-04-2021||Beijing||China offers support, assistance to India to combat rising COVID-19 cases||China on Thursday offered to provide the necessary support and assistance to India to deal with the sharp increase in the COVID-19 cases in the country.Asked about the spike in the coronavirus cases in India by the official Chinese media, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing here that the COVID-19 "pandemic is a common enemy of all mankind that necessitates international solidarity and mutual assistance"."China takes note of the recent grave situation in India with a temporary shortage of anti-epidemic medical supplies," he said."We stand ready to provide India with necessary support and assistance to get the epidemic under control," he said. China reported the first COVID-19 case in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and since then the deadly disease has snowballed into a pandemic, affecting more than 143,915,000 people and over 3,060,500 deaths worldwide.According to Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker, the US alone has reported 31,862,987 cases and 569,404 deaths from the deadly virus.The US has alleged that the COVID-19 may have emanated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) which is a P-4 bio lab, a charge strongly denied by China.A team of WHO experts, which probed the origin of the coronavirus, concluded last month that “all hypotheses” included the allegation that COVID-19 could have emanated from a bio lab "remained open".World Health Organisation (WHO) Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, while receiving the report of the international experts' team which visited Wuhan, said on March 30 that "as far as the WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table".

For Govt of India @ Rs 150 And State Govts @ Rs 400 Can’t the GoI subsume any additional cost from PM CARES & help rapid vaccination across India?” tweeted KTR with the hashtag SabkaSaathSabkoVaccine. There is growing resentment among non-BJP parties over the different pricing in the cost of the vaccine. The local Congress leaders said Sonia Gandhi too had written to the prime minister objecting to non-uniform pricing of the vaccine. Meanwhile, Telangana continues to witness a shortage of vaccines for the past many days while the CoWin portal continues to register appointments. People are returning disappointed day after day due to the non-availability of the vaccines.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-objects-to-non-uniform-vaccine-price-242705
22-04-2021||---||PM Modi calls for concrete action on climate change||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 22Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday called on world leaders to take “concrete action at high speed” to combat the impending disaster of climate change.Pointing out that humanity’s ongoing battle against Covid is a timely reminder that the grave threat of climate change has not disappeared, PM Modi said the world needs to take large scale action with global scope in order to avert another human catastrophe.The Prime Minister was the second national leader invited by Biden to speak on the opening day of the two-day virtual climate summit, after the Chinese President Xi Jinping. Biden had delivered the inaugural address which was then addressed by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was the next leader to speak after PM Modi.PM Modi also announced the joint launch with Biden of the India-US climate and clean energy agenda partnership. The issue was discussed between PM Modi and US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry here earlier this month. “Officials of the two countries will pursue ways in which they can deepen their partnership on climate and clean energy in this critical decade,” read a State Department readout of Kerry’s India visit.While pointing out that India has encouraged several global initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and the Coalition for Disaster Resilience, PM Modi said the world needed to “go back to basics” in order to save the environment.   India’s per capita carbon footprint is 60% lower than global average because the lifestyle of its people is still rooted in sustainable traditional practices. “I want to emphasise the importance of lifestyle change. The guiding philosophy of back-to-basics must be an important pillar of strategy for the post-Covid era,” he observed.Earlier, Biden outlined an aggressive target which, he said, “will set America on a path of a net-zero emissions economy by no later than 2050”. The White House’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% is nearly double the target set by the Obama administration in 2015.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-calls-for-concrete-action-on-climate-change-242701
22-04-2021||Thiruvananthapuram||Keralites donate price of vaccine to CM’s distress relief fund||A day after Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan announced free vaccines for everyone in the state, several enterprising Keralites have gone a step further, voluntarily donating the price of the vaccine to the CM’s Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF).Social media has been flooded with screenshots of donations to the CMDRF and the distress relief website shows that over Rs 20 lakh has been received on Thursday alone.Vijayan had on Wednesday said the Left government would provide the vaccine against COVID-19 free of cost for everyone in the state.The statement came on a day the Serum Institute of India announced a price of Rs 400 per dose for its COVID-19 vaccine ‘Covishield’ for state governments and Rs 600 per dose for private hospitals.“Vaccines will be provided free of cost for everyone in Kerala. We don’t have the habit of changing our stance like others. We had announced free vaccines in the state,” Vijayan had said.A social media user who goes by the handle, Red Indian, tweeted that “Vaccine is a right.But Since the union government has abdicated its responsibility” and the Kerala government has decided to take it up, “I, as a citizen, am contributing to the #CMDRF, Kerala.”“Keralites, since the central Govt has shamelessly passed all the burden to the states’ shoulder on the price of vaccines, it’s time for us to stand with our state and support it.”“Support everyone around you and please donate to CMDRF, irrespective of your political inclinations,” a handle which goes by the name @Advaidism, tweeted.Another user posted that he was sure that the Kerala government would provide vaccine free of cost for him and so he was donating the money for two doses of vaccine—as per Serum Institute of India’s price—to Kerala CMDRF.“This is the least I can do.I urge all my friends to do the same,” the user tweeted.A Keralite, who is settled in the UAE, said he received the vaccine free in that country.“My parents in Kerala has taken the vaccine and I donate that amount to Kerala CMDRF as a small support to the government.#FreeVaccinetoAll,” he tweeted.The campaign has gained momentum as Keralaites have taken it up as a protest against Centre’s vaccine policy.Most of the users are posting images of the donation certificate of Rs 800, the cost for two doses of vaccine. Some have posted images of the contribution made for a higher amount as the cost of vaccines for their whole family.The SII had, in a statement, said, “Fifty per cent of our capacities will be served to the Central government’s vaccination drive and the remaining 50 per cent will be for the state governments and private hospitals.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/keralites-donate-price-of-vaccine-to-cms-distress-relief-fund-242698

22-04-2021||Mumbai||Reconsider policy of not vaccinating at home: Bombay HC to Centre||The Bombay High Court on Thursday asked the Union government to reconsider its stand that door- to-door COVID-19 vaccination was not feasible, saying it must consider the plight of old people and the disabled.A Division Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice GS Kulkarni said the government cannot just “leave old people to die”.The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had on Wednesday informed the court that door-to-door vaccination was not possible due to various reasons including the possibility of contamination and wastage of vaccine.The Centre’s reply came in response to a public interest litigation filed by lawyers Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari.The PIL sought door-to-door vaccination programme for senior citizens above the age of 75, the specially abled persons and those who are bed-ridden or wheelchair-bound.The high court said there are many elderly people and others who cannot move out of house due to illness.“Don’t close the chapter saying it is not possible. This ought not to be the policy. The Union government will have to give a relook to its policy and do something for the elderly people.“The policy needs a relook by experts. You cannot leave old people to die,” Chief Justice Datta said.The judges also noted that in Indian culture, children and elderly people are given priority.“Both the children and elderly people are not in a position to function independently so we have to take care of them,” Justice Kulkarni said, adding that vaccine is the only certain way of ending the pandemic.The court also cited the example of Israel where the majority of population has been vaccinated, and Los Angeles in the United States where people are being vaccinated while sitting in their cars.“They do not even have to go into the vaccine centre. We also need to advance ourselves,” Justice Kulkarni said.Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh argued that many senior citizens suffer from serious ailments and they must be kept under medical observation for half an hour after they get the jab.This was not possible in a door-to-door drive, he said.The court said some middle way must be found, as such people with co-morbidities need the vaccine all the more.The HC also sought to know about the vaccine availability in Maharashtra.Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said the present stock will last only three or four days, but it would be replenished soon.The court said people should be intimated whether the vaccine is available at a particular centre so that they do not travel in vain.“Centralised information has to be available. Otherwise, it will be like the Mumbai floods where a person sitting in south Mumbai has no idea what the situation is in the suburbs and ends up travelling there and getting stuck in water for hours,” Justice Kulkarni said.The next hearing will be on May 6.

22-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra orders inquiry against Param Bir Singh over graft charges||The Maharashtra Home Department has ordered an inquiry against former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh in connection with the allegations of corruption levelled against him by an inspector, sources said on Thursday.As per the orders, Maharashtra DGP Sanjay Pandey has been asked to probe the allegations against Singh, they said.The allegations were made by police inspector Anup Dange, who was suspended last year and reinstated in the force recently.As per Dange’s claims, Singh had demanded Rs 2 crore from him to revoke his suspension. The inspector had written a letter to the Additional Chief Secretary (Home) about Singh’s demand.Singh had, however, denied the allegations levelled by the inspector.Based on the complaint, the home department ordered an inquiry into the charges against Singh, the sources said.Maharashtra DGP was not available for his comment on the issue.This is a second inquiry that the state government has ordered against Singh.The home department had earlier asked the DGP to conduct an inquiry against Singh for alleged dereliction of duty in connection with the probe into the recovery of an explosives-laden vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence in Mumbai on February 25.Param Bir Singh, who was under flak for the handling of the case, was unceremoniously transferred from the prestigious post of Mumbai police chief on March 17.On March 20, Singh had written a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray alleging that the then Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had indulged in “malpractices” and asked suspended police officer Sachin Waze to collect Rs 100 crore every month from bars and hotels.Deshmukh later resigned as a minister after the Bombay High Court ordered a CBI probe into the allegations made by Singh.

22-04-2021||Tapan (WB)||Modi govt has enough money but would not provide vaccines free of cost: Mamata||Asserting that the Centre should not allow differential pricing of COVID-19 vaccines, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday said people should be able to avail the shots free of cost.Banerjee, during a rally here, claimed that the Narendra Modi government, despite having enough money in its coffers, is “reluctant” to provide vaccines free of cost.Pointing out that Covishield is priced at Rs 150 for the Centre, Rs 400 for states and Rs 600 for private hospitals, the TMC supremo said, “Is it a joke? Why is that one vaccine is being sold at different rates? Vaccines should not be commercialised.“The Centre has a lot of money in PM Cares Fund but it wouldn’t provide vaccines free of cost. Why couldn’t they (central leaders) do the needful all these months?”Alleging that “this COVID-19 rage was Modi’s contribution” to the country, she said, “So far, you (PM) have done nothing, you did not alert people or take necessary precautions when there was time. Now, amid the rise in cases, you are asking people to buy doses and get vaccinated!”Citing Israel, where masks are no longer mandatory, as an example, Banerjee said, “What happened in India? Until recently, the Modi government did not allow states to undertake the vaccination drive on their own, and that has only led to a delay in the process.”Underscoring that the TMC government has administered 43 lakh doses, she said, “As of now, we are inoculating 40,000-50,000 people every day. The state has sought one crore more shots.”She gave assurance that her government will administer vaccines for free to people above 18 years of age after May 5.Banerjee urged voters to rise above religious differences and “prevent divisive forces such as the BJP to gain a strong foothold in Bengal—which is the land of Tagore, Nazrul and other luminaries”.

We will initiate criminal action under Section 188 of the IPC (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and other relevant provisions.”Of the 690 passengers, 189 were tested and six were found infected with the virus. Many were exempted from testing as they were transit passengers on way to neighbouring states like Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura, Sattawan said.The Assam government had on Wednesday night announced that all people coming from outside will have to undergo seven days of compulsory home quarantine, as the state’s COVID-19 tally shot up to 2,29,138 with 1,150 fatalities.

22-04-2021||New Delhi||SC terms COVID-19 situation 'national emergency', agrees to hear Vedanta plea of free oxygen supply||The Supreme Court Thursday termed the COVID-19 situation as almost a "national emergency" while agreeing to hear Vedanta's plea for the opening of its Sterlite copper unit at Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu on the ground that it would produce a thousand tonnes of oxygen and give it free of cost to treat patients.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde was unimpressed with the objection of the Tamil Nadu government which initially sought a hearing of Vedanta''s plea on Monday and opposed its opening on various grounds including that it has been rejected by the apex court earlier."We understand all this. We will ensure compliance of all environmental norms by the plant and its oxygen producing facility would be allowed to operate. We are on the oxygen plant," the bench, also comprising Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, said when senior advocate C S Vaidyanathan, appearing for Tamil Nadu, objected to the plea of the company."There is almost a national emergency and you (Tamil Nadu) don't put spokes in the solution. We will hear it (plea of Vedanta) tomorrow," the bench said in the hearing conducted through video conferencing."The country is in dire need of oxygen and the Centre is augmenting oxygen from whichever source. Vedanta wants to make its plant operational, but let Vedanta only make it operational to manufacture oxygen for health purposes," Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said.“Between protecting environment and protecting human life, we must lean in favour of protecting human life,” Mehta said.Senior advocate Harish Salve, appearing for Vedanta, sought urgent hearing of the plea during the day itself and said people are dying on daily basis and we can produce and supply oxygen to treat COVID-19 patients."We can start in five to six days if you give a go-ahead today. The company can manufacture tonnes of oxygen there every day and is ready to supply them free of cost," Salve said.The Tamil Nadu government, however, referred to the records and said no oxygen production can be started by the company before two to four weeks.The bench would hear the interim application on Friday.The top court had earlier refused to accord an early hearing to the plea related to mining major Vedanta's Sterlite copper unit at Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu which is closed since May 2018 over pollution concerns.The apex court on December 2 last year had rejected the interim plea of Vedanta Ltd that it be permitted to inspect its Sterlite copper plant and to operate it for a month to assess the pollution level.Vedanta had sought handing over of the plant for three months saying it requires two months to start the unit and the company should be allowed to run it for four weeks to ascertain whether it's polluting or not.While holding that interim plea of Vedanta for the opening of the plant for four weeks cannot be allowed, the bench had made clear that the final hearing in the matter can be heard after the physical hearing starts in the apex court.Earlier, the interim plea by Vedanta was opposed by the Tamil Nadu government which had claimed that the plant had been “polluting consistently”.In August last year, Vedanta had moved the apex court challenging the Madras High Court order refusing to allow reopening of the Tuticorin plant.  The high court had upheld the orders of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) directing the closure of the unit in May 2018.Vedanta had approached the high court in February 2019, seeking to reopen the Sterlite plant which was closed following a May 23, 2018 order issued by the TNPCB in the backdrop of violent protests against the unit which left 13 people dead in police firing on May 21 and 22, 2018.It had filed the petition in the high court as suggested by the Supreme Court, which had on February 18, 2019, set aside the National Green Tribunal order that allowed the opening of the Sterlite plant.

22-04-2021||Melbourne||Australia to reduce flights from India, among other high-risk Covid countries||Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday announced a reduction in flights from high-risk Covid nations, like India, following an alarming rise in coronavirus cases across the world.After a national Cabinet meeting in Canberra, Morrison said: "What we have agreed to - and this particularly relates to the chartered services we're running into the Northern Territory - we will be reducing by some 30 per cent the numbers coming through our chartered services in the months ahead."While the list of high-risk countries was still being finalised, Morrison said the announcement was made keeping in view India's worsening second wave of coronavirus.India registered over 3.14 lakh new coronavirus cases on Thursday, the highest-ever single-day count recorded in any country, taking the total tally of COVID-19 cases in the country to 1,59,30,965."We will also be limiting the departure exceptions for Australians travelling to high-risk countries…to India. As time goes on, and the pandemic continues to rage, there are countries that are frankly of greater risk than others," Morrison said."The Chief Medical Officer, working with others and the DFAT (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade), will be seeking to put a list of high-risk countries in place," he said, adding that the list would be similar to that of the UK's COVID-19 travel "red list".Morrison said new rules to return to Australia would now be applied for those coming from such high-risk nations.“If you have been in a high-risk country in the previous 14 days, before getting on your last point of embarkation to Australia, then you would need to have had a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test 72 hours before leaving that last point of embarkation,” Morrison said.Morrison said these new steps reflected that this is a global pandemic which is raging.“Australians are living like few others anywhere else in the world. We take those border arrangements very seriously. This is a way of matching that risk,” the prime minister said, explaining how strict border controls had led to fewer cases in Australia.''We have been working hard to get Australians home, particularly since last September. And there will continue to be the opportunity for those to return from places like India, but in very controlled circumstances," he said.Earlier on Thursday, Western Australian (WA) Premier Mark McGowan sought travel suspension from India after an outbreak in a quarantine hotel in Perth.McGowan said on April 3, a family of three returned to Perth from the UK and on April 10, a couple returned from India and tested positive for COVID-19 a few days later.Gowan said genome sequencing linked the strain the two families were now suffering from. He said somehow there was transmission between two rooms with closed doors.There were another 18 guests on that floor at the time of transmission.“Since the 10th of April, there have been 13 security guards, 31 various hotel staff, one doctor, and two CCTV installers, on that floor. All of these people will be re-tested as soon as possible," he said. Health authorities are investigating how the transmission occurred.The coronavirus has so far claimed 910 lives, along with 29,603 confirmed infections, in Australia, according to Johns Hopkins University.

This planet of ours is a delightful habitat. Its life is our life, its future our future," he said.The Dalai Lama stressed on the need to work together to find solutions to environmental issues."In the face of such global problems as the effect of global heating and depletion of the ozone layer, individual organizations and single nations are helpless. Unless we all work together, no solution can be found,” the spiritual leader said.He raised the concerns of water scarcity and said the welfare of citizens is at extreme risk."Today, more than ever, the welfare of citizens in many parts of the world, especially of mothers and children, is at extreme risk because of the critical lack of adequate water, sanitation and hygienic conditions," the Dalai Lama said."It is concerning that the absence of these essential health services throughout the world impacts nearly two billion people. And yet it is soluble. I am grateful that Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, has issued an urgent global call to action," he added.The spiritual leader noted that interdependence is a fundamental law of nature."Ignorance of interdependence has wounded not just our natural environment, but our human society as well. Therefore, we human beings must develop a greater sense of the oneness of all humanity. Each of us must learn to work not only for his or her self, family or nation, but for the benefit of all mankind," he said."In this connection, I am glad that (US) President Joe Biden will be hosting a Leaders' Climate Summit on Earth Day this year, bringing together world leaders to discuss an issue that impacts all of us," he said.He also emphasised on the importance of environmental education and personal responsibility to sustain the planet.

He has assured complete support to Delhi in facilitating lifting of Delhi’s quota of oxygen from Orissa. He has put a spl officer on the job. Thank u sooo much Sir. Delhi is indeed grateful,” Kejriwal tweeted.He said Delhi had a daily quota of 378 MT of medical oxygen that has been increased to 480 MT, and thanked the Central government for it. But, he said, more supplies are needed as according to estimates Delhi needs 700 MT of oxygen daily.Delhi received its quota of oxygen as fixed by the Centre from other states, he said, but added, some states stopped trucks headed to the national capital.    “This is not fair. This is a huge calamity and we need to fight it unitedly. If we are divided, India will not survive,” Kejriwal said.He appealed to state governments to help each other during the pandemic and promised to provide them surplus oxygen, medicines and doctors if the COVID-19 situation came under control in Delhi.

22-04-2021||New Delhi||Covid-19: Small hospitals in Delhi grapple with limited oxygen supply||Several small hospitals in Delhi struggled to replenish oxygen supply for coronavirus patients on Thursday morning, even as some big healthcare facilities received fresh stock overnight. Hospitals in the city have been grappling with a shortage of oxygen supply amid spiralling COVID-19 cases.The Delhi High Court had on Wednesday night ordered the Centre to “forthwith” provide oxygen by whatever means to hospitals here facing shortage of the gas in treating serious COVID-19 patients, observing it “seems human life is not important for the state”.The central government, represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, assured the court that it will facilitate supply of the increased allocation of 480 metric tonnes of oxygen to Delhi and the same will reach the national capital without any obstructions.However, several private hospitals complained that no help has reached them.                Officials at the 210-bed Mata Chanan Devi Hospital sent an SOS to the Delhi government as their “oxygen supplier didn’t fulfil commitments”.“Around 40 patients are in ICU. We got 500 kg oxygen last night. The supplier was supposed to give more at 4 am, but they have not been picking up calls since then,” ICU Head Dr A C Shukla said.“With the Delhi government’s intervention, we have got 21 D-type cylinders, but a continuous supply is needed. The situation is very serious,” he added.Dr Pankaj Solanki, who runs 50-bed Dharamveer Solanki Hospital, said the hospital is using the “back up” which will last till Thursday afternoon.Dr Solanki said he had informed officials concerned to transfer out 30 patients.“The oxygen crisis is at its worst. It is adding more pressure on the functioning. No one is able to help,” his tweet posted on Wednesday evening read.Big hospitals said they received fresh stock overnight and more is likely to come in soon.Dr. Suresh Kumar, the medical director at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, said three tankers carrying oxygen reached the facility last night.“At 8:30 am, we have around 8 hours of oxygen left. More is coming,” he told PTI.An official at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital said supply was replenished around 6 am.“The stock will last 12 hours. Supply from a private vendor is awaited,” he said.Officials at the Burari Hospital said they have “sufficient stock” till afternoon.On Wednesday, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia accused the Haryana government of blocking medical oxygen supply to Delhi.The Haryana government vehemently refuted the allegations, underlining that no one in the administration had hampered anything.Sisodia had claimed that an official of the Haryana government stopped oxygen supply from a plant in Faridabad.He had said a similar incident occurred in Uttar Pradesh a day ago and it led to a crisis in some hospitals, adding the oxygen supply had been restored now.Delhi logged 24,638 coronavirus cases and 249 deaths on Wednesday, as the positivity rate stood at 31.28 percent—meaning almost every third sample turned out to be positive—amid a growing clamour for oxygen and hospital beds in the city.       Only 18 ICU beds for COVID patients were available in hospitals across Delhi at 11 pm, according to government data.On Tuesday, the city had recorded 28,395 cases and 277 fatalities, both highest since the pandemic began ravaging countries. The positivity rate was 32.82 percent, highest so far.The city has reported over 1,350 deaths due to the deadly virus in the last 7 days. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-small-hospitals-in-delhi-grapple-with-limited-oxygen-supply-242643
22-04-2021||New Delhi||Punjab among 19 states, UTs allocated Remdesivir by Centre||To meet the burgeoning challenge of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Centre has allocated a supply of Remdesivir to 19 States and UTs beset with a "high burden" of cases.The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said these allocations were "interim", made for the period from April 21 to April 30, 2021, to further address reports of shortages in certain regions of the country."This initial allocation is dynamic and will be reviewed constantly in consultation with the States, to ensure all needs can be met within the available supplies," Health Ministry said.Remdesivir being an investigational therapy drug given in acute and severe COVID-19 cases, where oxygen support is a must, the allocations have been made to 14 states to which medical oxygen is allocated and 5 other states where the high volume of supplies are being observed.Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh are among the states in which medical Oxygen is allocated, and which have been supplied with Remdesivir.The others are Chhatisgarh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu.The states where a high volume of supplies are observed are Telangana, West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar and Jharkhand.The allocation includes bulk purchases made by the States as well as supplies through private distribution channels.All States not covered by the above-mentioned allocation will be considered for allocation when their supply orders are placed with the manufacturers.Keeping in mind the sudden surge in demand in the country for Remdesivir, the manufacturing capacity of domestic Remdesivir manufacturers has been ramped up.The production capacity is being ramped up from a current level of 38 lakh vials per month to 74 lakh vials per month, and 20 additional manufacturing sites have been approved.To smoothen the supply chain, manufacturers have been mapped to the States concerned.Control Room has been set up by National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) which will be responsible for monitoring the operations as per the allocations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-among-19-states-uts-allocated-remdesivir-by-centre-242642

The policy implies that the Government of India has abdicated its responsibility to provide free vaccination for citizens between the age group of 18 to 45 years. This is complete abandonment of the Government's responsibility towards our youth,” Gandhi said.She said as a consequence of the policy, the vaccine manufacturer, i.e., the Serum Institute of India announced a differential pricing mechanism, viz, Rs. 150 per dose for the Central Government, Rs. 400 per dose for State Government and Rs 600 per dose for Private Hospitals.Serum Institute had, however, clarified the cost for centre and state would both be Rs 400 a dose.Gandhi said citizens will be compelled to pay high rates to be vaccinated and this will bleed the finances of state governments.“This begs the question, how can the same vaccine manufactured by the same company have three different prices? There is no rationale or justification that allows for such arbitrary distinction. In these unprecedented times, how can the Government of India permit such brazen profiteering from people's misery?” she asked.She asked, “at a time when medical resources are scarce, hospital beds are unavailable, oxygen supply and availability of essential medicine is dwindling rapidly, why is your Government allowing a policy that reeks of such insensitivity.”Gandhi also said that even with regards to the 50 per cent quota for vaccination available with the Central Government, the allocation must be transparent and equitable, in line with the spirit of cooperative federalism.“Indian National Congress has already demanded a re-evaluation of this policy. Surely, any reasonable person will agree on the benefit of a uniform price for vaccination. I would urge you to intervene immediately and reverse this ill-considered decision. The nation's goal must be to ensure that everyone over 18 years is given the vaccine, regardless of their economic circumstances,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reverse-vaccine-pricing-policy-ensure-uniformity-sonia-gandhi-urges-pm-242632

22-04-2021||Aligarh (UP)||Five COVID-19 patients die at UP hospital, family members allege oxygen shortage||Five coronavirus patients died at a private hospital in Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh allegedly due to a shortage in oxygen supply.The incident took place at Naurangabad locality in Gandi Park area here on Wednesday, according to police.However, Dr Sanjeev Sharma, the owner of the hospital, denied the claims and said the hospital had adequate oxygen stock.Shyam Kashyap, whose 50-year-old brother Anil was among those who died at the hospital, told media persons that hospital authorities tried to cover up the lapse by arranging 40 oxygen cylinders after the tragedy took place."If the hospital had sufficient stock of oxygen, then why did it suddenly ask authorities for oxygen supply at 9 pm on Wednesday?" he asked.nAgitated family members of the deceased persons created a ruckus at the hospital, following which senior police officials rushed to the spot and defused the tension.The hospital owner said none of the patients died due to lack of oxygen.Sharma said all the five persons were on ventilator and their death was a "mere coincidence".Meanwhile, City Magistrate Vineet Kumar said, "At around 9 pm on Wednesday, the hospital authorities called for an emergency supply of oxygen which was given by 10 pm." Kumar said the incident was being investigated. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/five-covid-19-patients-die-at-up-hospital-family-members-allege-oxygen-shortage-242627
22-04-2021||New Delhi||Centre's COVID-19 vaccination drive will lead to profiteering by pvt companies: Forum||A national association of doctors and scientists have accused the Centre of lending the COVID-19 vaccination drive to "profiteering" by private companies rather than ensuring public financing of the programme.In a statement, the Progressive Medicos and Scientists Forum, said on Wednesday that the Centre's move is "bound to lend the vaccine prices to market manipulation for maximising private profits"."Rather than ensuring entirely public financing of vaccination, which makes far better epidemiological and economic sense, the government has lent even the vaccination drive to profiteering by private companies by announcing that 50 per cent of all the doses shall now be routed through the open market."This is bound to lend the vaccine prices to all manner market manipulation for maximising private profits. Promises of free vaccination, it appears, are good only for winning elections, and dumping the people thereafter," it said.The forum said the central government commands the financial resources to extend grants to, and thereby demand the answerability of private manufacturers."In a situation where there is already a critical shortage of vaccine doses, this implies that the states shall have to bargain at their level with the manufacturers for the best price, and shall in (all) probability have to out-bid each other to be able to secure enough doses to meet their respective demands."The situation demanded of the Centre to procure vaccine supplies at a much reasonable cost through the public sector and extend liberal grants to the states," it added.The Centre had on Monday announced that everyone above 18 years of age would be eligible to get vaccinated against COVID-19 from May 1. It also allowed states, private hospitals and industrial establishments to procure the vaccine doses directly from manufacturers.Under the third phase of the national vaccination drive commencing next month, the vaccine manufacturers would supply 50 per cent of their monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) released doses to the central government. They would be free to supply the remaining 50 per cent doses to state governments and in the open market.

22-04-2021||London||UK’s Heathrow Airport refuses to allow extra flights from India ahead of ‘red list’ ban||Heathrow Airport in London, the UK’s largest and busiest airport, has declined requests from at least four international aircraft carriers to land eight extra flights from India on Thursday, ahead of the coronavirus pandemic “red list” travel ban which comes into force from Friday.The airport said the decision to decline requests for additional flights was taken to ensure that the existing pressures on the border are not “exacerbated”, resulting in long queues and crowds at passport control on arrival.India’s addition to the travel “red list” was announced in the House of Commons earlier this week amid 103 cases recorded in the UK of a new variant of coronavirus first detected in India. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that the decision had been made after studying the data and on a “precautionary basis”.“That means that anyone who is not a UK or Irish resident or a British citizen cannot enter the UK if they have been in India in the previous 10 days. UK and Irish residents and British citizens who have been in India in the 10 days before their arrival will need to complete hotel quarantine for 10 days from the time of arrival,” said Hancock.It has since triggered considerable confusion and panic as hundreds of Indian students and other UK-based British Indians scramble for return flights ahead of the Friday deadline. London-based family-owned travel agency, Tickets to India, is among the agents who have been working round the clock to try and sort out charter flights to carry Indian-origin passengers back to the UK.“Hundreds of British nationals are still requesting seats but there is very little time to arrange a second charter before Friday,” said the company, which was working on getting clearance for one Qatar Airways A350 to bring 300 passengers back before the cut-off time (4am local time) on Friday.The UK Civil Aviation Authority said it had received several applications for charter flight permits from India to the UK, but many have been declined or withdrawn as they did not meet the qualifying criteria.“We are in a global health pandemic – people should not be travelling unless absolutely necessary,” a UK government spokesperson said.“Every essential check helps avoid the risk of importing dangerous variants of coronavirus which could put our vaccine rollout at risk,” the spokesperson said.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was forced to cancel his India visit due to the surging coronavirus cases in India, told a Downing Street briefing earlier this week that the so-called “Indian variant” is still a variant under investigation, not a “variant of concern” as Public Health England (PHE) and other authorities continue to investigate its transmissibility and any vaccine resistance.A briefing document drawn up by PHE officials shows that between March 25 and April 7, a total of 3,345 arrivals from India were registered in UK border travel data, being collected through compulsory passenger locator forms at the airport. Of the arrivals so far 161 – or 4.8 per cent – tested positive for COVID-19 after a PCR test.The travel ban means that those with valid residency rights returning to the UK after the deadline on Friday face the additional financial burden of compulsory hotel quarantine and tests costs, estimated at around 2,000 pounds per person.The National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK (NISAU-UK), a representative group for Indian students in the UK, has been working on trying to seek some reprieve for Indian students from the additional and unforeseen financial burden.“Significant concern is being raised about the cost of quarantine as well as how the new restrictions impact student eligibility for the Graduate visa route for which they need to be in the country by particular dates,” said NISAU UK chair Sanam Arora.The Home Office had already extended the deadline period for the physical campus presence requirements for students to be able to apply for the new Graduate or post-study work visa until June-end and a further extension is reportedly being considered.Meanwhile, the government has indicated that students with valid visas but yet to collect their biometric residence permits (BRPs) would qualify for entry, subject to all the additional quarantine rules.

22-04-2021||New Delhi||Amid spurting COVID-19 cases, Delhi witnesses surge in demand for oximeters, oxygen concentrators||Whether the expensive oxygen concentrator or the humble steam inhaler, people in Delhi are going all out shopping for both "prevention and cure" in view of the surge in COVID-19 cases, leading to demands for these medical devices hitting the roof.With reports of hospitals gasping for oxygen and patients waiting for beds, people are seen making a beeline to chemist shops and returning home with bags full of "medical essentials", including oximeters, thermometers, oxygen cans etc.“These are not normal times. Everyone is fearful of catching the virus and will buy everything possible to keep the family members protected or if, god forbid, they test positive (for COVID-19), help in the cure."Last year, we were buying masks, hand sanitiser and infrared thermometers. This year, thanks to the ferocious second wave, we are buying oximeters, oxygen sprays and are even considering buying the super-expensive oxygen concentrator for the family," said city-based businessman Dinesh Thappa (45).The fear is reflecting on the market also as many chemists are running out of their stocks of oximeters and oxygen concentrators and witnessing an "unprecedented hike" in the demand for steam inhalers and infrared thermometers."Oximeters and thermometers are selling at a rate of knots. Right now, I do not have oximeters in my shop. There is a good 60-70 per cent shortage, which was not the case even last year," Gaurav Arora of the Kiran Medicos in Ramesh Nagar said.He said he has placed an order for oximeters, but it will take time for the supply to arrive.Delhi recorded 24,638 fresh COVID-19 cases and 249 deaths due to the viral disease on Wednesday while the positivity rate stood at 31.28 per cent, meaning almost every third sample tested positive, amid a growing clamour for oxygen and hospital beds in the city.Only 18 ICU beds for COVID-19 patients were available in hospitals across Delhi as of 11 pm Wednesday, according to government data.Yatendar Kumar, who runs a pharmacy store in Pragati Vihar, also confirmed a steep rise in the demand for oximeters and steam inhalers over the last few days.There is also a huge demand for preventive care online with Snapdeal's sale of steam inhalers going up by "three times" compared to the pre-pandemic levels."We are seeing a significant rise in orders for devices, including oximeters, thermometers and electric steam inhalers. In fact, the demand for electric steam inhalers has been high all throughout this period and is three times more than the pre-pandemic levels."There is a four-time spike in the search for kadha, giloy and amla juice and other immunity-boosting products. However, we are also working within the limitations of various lockdowns and prioritising delivery of the orders that users have said are required urgently," a Snapdeal spokesperson told PTI.Amid reports of an oxygen shortage, the "oxygen concentrator" is drawing the attention of people, especially those from the affluent sections of the society.It is a portable medical device used for delivering oxygen to individuals with breathing-related disorders. It filters the surrounding air, compressing it to the required density, and then delivers purified medical-grade oxygen into a pulse-dose delivery system or continuous stream system to the patient."If you have a patient who is not able to breathe properly and requires oxygen, and is unable to find space in the hospital, then a concentrator can be helpful," Dr Richa Sareen, consultant pulmonologist at the Fortis Hospital in Vasant Kunj here, said."The machine is charged via electricity and is small, concentrating the oxygen of the room, thereby providing hyper oxygen. With a cylinder, one has to refill the oxygen once it empties out. However, with a concentrator, the same is not required," she added.Both Arora and Kumar said they have been getting queries on the availability of oxygen concentrators on a daily basis for the last few weeks.Arora said earlier, an oxygen concentrator used to cost around Rs 40,000-50,000 but now, with the surge in demand, the price has gone as high as Rs 1 lakh for some devices.

22-04-2021||Mumbai||Oxygen tank that leaked in Nashik was activated just 3 weeks ago||The tank from which liquid oxygen leaked at a civic-run hospital in Nashik, killing 22 Covid patients, was operationalised just 21 days before the incident, an official said on Thursday.The incident occurred on Wednesday afternoon when the patients, who were either on ventilator or oxygen support, suffocated to death after their oxygen supply stopped suddenly because of a malfunction in the main storage at Dr Zakir Hussain Hospital in Maharashtra's Nashik city.The police registered an FIR on Thursday against unidentified persons under Section 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC following a complaint by a senior inspector of Bhadrakali police station, Nashik Police Commissioner Deepak Pandey said."The oxygen tank, having a storage capacity of 13 KL, was operationalised on March 31," another police official said quoting information provided by the hospital's superintendent.White fumes engulfed the area after the leakage, said the official who was present at the spot.He said the police also got to know that the oxygen tank belonged to (Vadodara-based) Inoxcva company and was taken on rent for 10 years from Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation (a Japanese company which supplies industrial gases like oxygen and nitrogen to a wide range of industries).Patients were being provided oxygen from the round white-coloured tank, installed on the hospital premises, via a pipeline, he said.According to the official, the leakage occurred when oxygen was being filled into the tank from a tanker.He said the oxygen leakage started around 12.20 pm. An employee managing the tanker present at the spot and the hospital administration staff tried to stop the leakage.Later, the hospital administration called an engineer who rectified the malfunctioning and the leakage was stopped between 1.45 pm and 2 pm, the official said."The patients died due to disruption of the oxygen supply following leakage from the tank," he said.It happened because of "negligence and carelessness" on part of some people who were yet to be identified, he said.Accordingly, an FIR had been registered against unidentified persons, the official said.

The study was undertaken in two districts, each of Haryana, Delhi, Gujarat and Maharashtra.The total sample size was 4,400. Of these, 1,600 were interstate migrant workers, 800 local workers, 400 employers, 800 government officials and 800 scholars and NGO representatives.The study through its seven objectives, including examining the discrimination and impediments faced by the workers in accessing social security and health rights, recommended to the Centre and state governments for remedial actions.Besides, the objective was to analyse laws and policies at the Centre and state levels with respect to the workers’ social security and health rights.Documenting the enabling factors and best practices in providing social security and health rights to workers was study’s other goal. It batted for awareness generation about schemes and facilities among interstate migrant workers.Instituting 24x7 national and state-level grievance redressal helpline and creation of quota for them with regard to MGNREGA are among the other recommendations.It expressed the need to enhance access to National Social Assistance Programme for these workers and fast tracking the implementation of “One Nation One Ration Card”.Other key suggestions||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nhrc-study-recommends-inter-state-migration-council-242313

We are shocked and dismayed hospitals running out of oxygen but steel plants are running,” the high court said.A Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said responsibility to ensure oxygen supply is squarely on the Union Government shoulders and if necessary, entire supply of oxygen to industries, including steel and petroleum, can be diverted for medical usage.“If Tatas can divert oxygen they are generating for their steel plants to medical use, why can’t others?

Following an order by Lt Governor Anil Baijal, the Delhi Government formed a committee to oversee the relief work.Migrant labourers continue to crowd railway stations and bus terminals disregarding social distancing norms and Covid-19 protocol in a bid to return to their native places.A senior DDMA official said, “We propose to give Rs 5,000 to the registered construction workers as Covid relief due to lockdown with effect from April 20. The registration and renewal are being kept open and newly registered workers will also be covered.”Currently, Delhi has 1.71 lakh registered construction workers. In the past one year, the government conducted special camps to register the workers. Last year, the state twice provided an ex gratia relief of Rs 5,000 to the 55,000 registered construction workers during the lockdown.Officials said the state health department had also been asked to link all major construction sites with dispensaries to provide medical care, while the area district authorities will deploy adequate manpower at the construction sites for the arrangement of food packets/ration provision.They added that a 24x7 functional helpline number would also be set up for grievance management and all distress calls would be promptly attended.The seven-member committee comprising senior Delhi Government officials has been tasked to ensure the welfare of daily wagers, migrant workers, labourers and construction workers in compliance with the Delhi High Court directions, the DDMA said in an order.“The finance department has been asked to arrange adequate funds, if required, in addition to the funds available with the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board for ensuring overall welfare,” the order said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-prevent-exodus-delhi-govt-offers-migrants-rs5-000-each-242315

22-04-2021||Shubhadeep Choudhury||Mamata: Second Covid wave Modi-made disaster||Tribune News ServiceKolkata, April 21Addressing an election rally at Balurghat in Dakshin Dinajpur district, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee today attacked the Prime Minister over the resurgence of Covid-19, terming it a “Modi-made disaster” and demanded that he quit if unable to provide adequate medical supplies to combat the disease.“The Covid-19 pandemic had subsided in the country but has surged in a second wave owing to the monumental failure of the Central government and negligence and total incompetence on its part,” she said addressing public meetings at Chanchal in Malda and at Harirampur in Dakshin Dinajpur districts.As the Election Commission did not accede to Trinamool Congress’ request to hold the last three of the eight-phase election in West Bengal on a single day, Banerjee said she was forced to combat the sharp rise in infections in the state as its chief minister as well campaign for Trinamool Congress, her party.She also ruled out the possibility of a lockdown in the state amid spurting Covid-19 cases and said a universal vaccination drive for people aged 18 years and above would start soon.She alleged that 65 per cent of the drugs manufactured in the country to tackle the pandemic have already been exported.On Wednesday, Banerjee held a meeting with state government officials on how to contain the spread of the virus. The meeting was held through video-conferencing.Later, she addressed a press conference at Malda to brief the mediapersons about various steps undertaken by her in view of the Covid situation.Interacting with the media, Mamata also appealed to the Election Commission (EC) to allow hospitalised Covid patients to cast their votes through postal ballots.“There are about 7,500 people admitted to various hospitals due to Covid. Some of them may be in hospital because their oxygen saturation point is low but they are in a position to vote. It is up to the EC to find a way to collect postal ballots from such people,” the Chief Minister said.Banerjee added that she had requested the Centre to supply one crore doses of Covid vaccine to the state for immediate use. She had given instruction to officers to take step against hoarding of oxygen by unscrupulous traders, she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-second-covid-wave-modi-made-disaster-242319

Wang said both sides should bear in mind the overall interests of the long-term development of China-India relations.They should, therefore, place the boundary issue “at an appropriate position” in bilateral relations and bring China-India relations back to the track of sound and steady development.Wang began by pointing out that China's position on the boundary issue is consistent and clear-cut.“We are committed to maintaining peace and stability in the border areas and firmly safeguarding national territorial sovereignty and security,” he said while recalling that recently China and India have maintained close communication through diplomatic and military channels.“On the basis of realising disengagement in the Galwan valley and the Pangong Lake area, the two sides have had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on promoting the settlement of the remaining issues in the western sector of the China-India boundary,” he observed.Minister for External Affairs S Jaishankar has repeatedly stated that a peaceful and tranquil border is a prerequisite for advancing bilateral India-China ties. New Delhi has put on hold several investment proposals from China. Estimated at $2 billion when the ban was put in place last year, some investment proposals also have third country implications.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-wants-india-to-meet-halfway-on-border-disputes-242321

Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said 6,600 MT of the 7,500 MT daily production of oxygen was being supplied to states on demand. “Barring nine industries, oxygen supply has been ordered to be diverted for medical use. The order was further refined today and even the plants that don’t have a captive oxygen plant will no longer be in exempted category,” he said.The government said during the last wave peak, about 3,500 MT requirement of oxygen had been noted.Bhushan said 70 PSA (pressure swing absorption) plants would be operational by month-end while 33 were already functional. In all, 162 PSA plants have been sanctioned.Asked how India couldn’t gauge the second wave threat, the Health Secretary said, “This is not the time to discuss why and how we missed the second wave. We have to focus all our energies on saving lives.”Bhushan said expressions of interest (EOI) for importing 50,000 MT of oxygen had been received and were being evaluated.In Nashik, District Collector Suraj Mandhare said initial information was about 24 patients dying at the municipal corporation-run Zakir Hussain Hospital after their medical oxygen supply was interrupted following a storage tank leak.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has ordered a high-level probe to determine the cause of the mishap. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the tragedy “heart-wrenching”. The families of the deceased looked crestfallen with some saying the doctors attributed the deaths to Covid and pneumonia whereas the deaths happened due to blockages of oxygen supplies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oxygen-leak-kills-24-patients-in-nashik-242322

In contrast, none of the protesters from Punjab came forward to receive the jab at the special booth put up by the health authorities at the Tikri border on Wednesday.BKU leader (Rajewal) Pargat Singh said a decision was taken not to go in for vaccination after a discussion with other farm unions in Tikri. “We do not have faith in the local administration and will call private doctors from Punjab, if needed,” Pargat Singh added.After the SKM’s appeal to farmers, the state Health Department constituted 10 teams for the testing and vaccination of the agitating peasants. Health Minister Anil Vij had earlier this week announced that RT-PCR testing and vaccination would be conducted at the protest sites in Haryana.Civil Surgeon Dr Jaswant Singh Punia said a meeting was held with Dr Balbir Singh, coordinator, Sadbhawna Mission, SKM, at the Singhu border on the vaccination programme. “Dr Balbir Singh promised to soon provide us a list of farmers above the age of 45 years. If they want, we will set up another vaccination centre at the hospital for farmers in Singhu,” said Dr Punia.“We have also made an arrangement for the vaccination of farmers near Rasoi Dhaba in the Kundli area,” he said.Dr Balbir Singh, SKM medical coordinator, meanwhile, said the group was already insisting on Covid protocol and the need to wear a mask.The health authorities in Tikri said their efforts to convince the protesters to get vaccinated would continue. “Some of the farmers refused to get vaccinated, saying that they had already got the jab in Punjab. Our efforts to motivate the farmers for vaccination will continue,” said Dr Vinay Kumar, Senior Medical Officer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1-133-protesting-farmers-get-jab-in-singhu-none-at-tikri-242337

Going ahead, 50 per cent of our capacities will be served to the Government of India vaccination programme and the remaining 50 per cent to state governments and private hospitals."It said globally, other vaccines were much costlier--the US variants cost Rs 1,500 a dose and the Russian and Chinese Rs 750 per shot.Of the 1,27,605,870 doses administered till Wednesday morning, 11,60,65,107 (90 per cent) were Covishield and 1,15,40,763 Covaxin, the Health Ministry said. Fifteen states have administered only Covishield.The SII said even the Centre would need to procure the vaccine at Rs 400 a dose (as against Rs 150 earlier) as the price mechanism would change from May 1.The company’s declaration is in line with the new liberalised vaccine policy of the Centre, which mandates Indian vaccine makers to declare prices for states and private hospitals in advance of May 1. From May 1, private hospitals will have to procure vaccine stocks directly from manufacturers and the Centre will discontinue providing stocks.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged the Centre’s vaccine strategy was no less than demonetisation. “The common people will stand in queues, suffer loss of wealth, health and life and in the end only a few big industrialists will benefit. Disaster of the country is an opportunity for Modi’s friends,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covishield-price-rs-400-for-govt-rs-600-pvt-clinics-242349

The efficacy against asymptomatic cases is 70 per cent, which suggests decreased transmission in Covaxin recipients, the report said.Krishna Ella, CMD, Bharat Biotech, said, “Covaxin has demonstrated an excellent safety record in human clinical trials and in usage under emergency use.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covaxin-kills-double-mutant-strain-icmr-242351
22-04-2021||Ajay Banerjee||Delayed by snow, two lifelines to Ladakh reopen||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 21After several spells of snow in March and April, the high Himalayan passes on the two road routes to Ladakh have reopened, facilitating the movement of tonnes of supplies like rations, fuel and equipment needed by the armed forces to the plateau.The Srinagar-Kargil-Leh route across the 11,500-foot-high Zoji La had opened in mid-February but fresh snow and avalanches left it unusable. The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) re-established connectivity on Wednesday as ten trucks, carrying essential fresh supplies, traversed the Zoji La towards Kargil.The original plan was to open the pass for Army and civil traffic by February-end or early March. However, continuous bad weather conditions, poor visibility and heavy snowfall resulted in triggering of avalanches, thus delaying the opening.The 425-km Manali-Leh route had opened in March-end, but intermittent snow had led to its closure. A couple of hundred vehicles passed through the stretch for 25 days or so till the route got blocked with a fresh spell of snowfall.The road routes to Ladakh are important as Indian and Chinese troops are locked in a military standoff. Before the LAC crisis, the two roads normally opened by April-end or early May depending upon the snow melt. Snow-cutters are deployed to open the route. The window to ferry material by the two road routes — via Manali and Srinagar — is open till October.Once the passes close, the only option is to fly out supplies from the logistics hub in Chandigarh. But even these flights have time restrictions. Planes have to fly out of Leh before noon as a rise in temperature coupled with rarefied oxygen affect engine performance.Key border routes||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delayed-by-snow-two-lifelines-to-ladakh-reopen-242328
22-04-2021||---||3rd Indian vax by August: Govt||New Delhi, April 21Ahead of the expansion of the inoculation drive to cover adults from May 1, the government today said the third India-made vaccine—a collaboration between Biological E and Biotechnology Department—was expected by August and talks with foreign vaccine makers were progressing well.VK Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog, said Biological E and Biotechnology Department vaccine’s Phase 1 and 2 trials were over and Phase 3 trials would start soon.“They are submitting their data for review. They have a huge production capacity of seven crore doses. We hope the vaccine will be available from August,” he said.The ICMR also shared data to show only 2 to 4 persons in every 10,000 inoculated with Covaxin and Covishield reported breakthrough infections (Covid after receiving the vaccine dose).“The narrative on breakthrough infections is quite distant from reality. The incidence of breakthrough infection in India is very low. Even if Covid infection occurs after the first and the second dose of the vaccine, it does not cause severe disease. The risk of infection is there, which is why masks are important, but the risk of severe infection reduces considerably,” he said.Out of 93, 56, 436 people who received the first doses of Covaxin, 4,208 (0.04 %) had breakthrough infection. The proportion was the same for those who received the second dose of Covaxin (695 got Covid out of 17,37,178).Likewise, 10,03,02,745 people received Covishield first dose and of them 17,145 (0.02 %) got breakthrough infection. Out of 1,57,32,754 who got the second dose of Covishield, 5,014 reported breakthrough infection.The government also clarified that from May 1, the Centre would not allocate vaccines to private hospitals. “From May 1 the Centre will keep 50 per cent capacity of vaccine production and the remaining 50 per cent will be meant for state governments and private hospitals. The previous system of Centre allocating to private hospitals will not exist anymore, nor will the previous price mechanism of the cost of Rs 250 a dose for private hospital vaccination. This does not mean vaccines will be available at chemist shops. Adults will be able to get their shots through the state government route or private hospitals,” Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/3rd-indian-vax-by-august-govt-242329
22-04-2021||Washington||Ex-cop guilty of killing Floyd||A US grand jury has found former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin guilty on all three charges he faced over the custodial death of African-American George Floyd last year, a chilling incident that sparked worldwide protests against racism and excessive use of force by the police.EDIT: The Floyd verdictThe 12 jurors found Chauvin, 45, guilty of unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in one of the most closely watched cases in recent memory in the US.Chauvin was filmed kneeling on Floyd’s neck during his arrest on May 25 after a convenience store clerk in Minneapolis alleged that Floyd tried to pass a counterfeit USD 20 bill.Joe Biden, PresidentChauvin pinned down Floyd, 46, with his knee on the pavement of an intersection for more than nine minutes. “I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe,” were his last words. Chauvin pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. He faces up to 40 years in prison, according to US media reports. With only his eyes visible, the rest of his face hidden behind a surgical mask, Chauvin watched as the verdict was announced. A deputy handcuffed Chauvin and escorted him to a side room. He was later transferred to the Minnesota Correctional Facility. Judge Peter Cahill said sentencing was expected in eight weeks.The Floyd family’s lawyer, Ben Crump, released a statement following the conviction, saying the verdict “goes far beyond this city and has significant implications for the country and even the world... Justice for Black America is justice for all of America. This case is a turning point in American history for accountability of law enforcement and sends a clear message we hope is heard clearly in every city and every state.” The statement also demanded that the other three officers who played their own role in the death of Floyd must still be held accountable for their actions.President Joe Biden said: “We can’t stop here. In order to deliver real change and reform, we can and we must do more to reduce the likelihood that a tragedy like this will ever happen to occur again.”In an address to the nation soon after the verdict, Vice-President Kamala Harris said black Americans and black men in particular had been treated throughout the course of history as less than human.“Today we feel a sigh of relief. Still, it cannot take away the pain. A measure of justice isn’t the same as equal justice. This verdict brings us a step closer and the fact is we still have work to do,” Harris, the first Black American Vice-President, said. She urged lawmakers to pass the George Floyd Bill aimed at reforming policing in the US. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ex-cop-guilty-of-killing-floyd-242331

22-04-2021||New Delhi||'Beg, borrow or steal': HC asks Centre to ensure oxygen supply to hospitals for Covid patients||Issuing unusually strong strictures on the Modi government and private industries, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday ordered the Centre to “forthwith” provide oxygen by whatever means to hospitals here facing shortage of the gas in treating serious COVID-19 patients, observing it “seems human life is not important for the state”.“You are not exploring all avenues to augment oxygen supply. Beg, borrow or steal,” the court told the Centre, and asked why is it not waking up to the gravity of the emergency situation. It also warned that certainly all hell will break loose with the stoppage of medical oxygen to the hospitals.The court was conducting an urgent hearing on a public holiday on a plea filed by Balaji Medical and Research Centre, which owns and runs various hospitals in the name of Max, stating that if supply of oxygen is not replenished on an immediate basis, the lives of the patients who are critical and on oxygen support will be endangered.“Do you want to see thousands of people dying in the country?” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli asked, as it came down heavily on the Centre for not diverting sufficient oxygen supply from industries to hospitals.During the extraordinary hearing, the court said the responsibility to ensure oxygen supply lay squarely on the Central government’s shoulders and if necessary, entire supply of oxygen to industries including steel and petroleum can be diverted for medical usage.“Why is the Centre not waking up to the gravity of the situation? We are shocked and dismayed hospitals running out of oxygen but steel plants are running,” the court said, and added “how the government can be so oblivious of the reality”.“There is no sense of humanity left or what? This is really really ridiculous and shocking. You are concerned about industries when people are dying. It an emergency you should realise. It seems human life is not important for the state.” The court directed the Central government to protect the fundamental right to life of citizens who are seriously ill and require medical oxygen and to supply the same by whatever means it is required. “Our concern is not just for Delhi, we want to know what the Central government is doing with regard to oxygen supply across India,” it said and added, “what is the Central government doing. If this is the situation in Delhi, we are sure it is the same in other states.”“Do you want to see thousands of people dying in the country? Is running steel plants so important and urgent?,” the bench said, and added that today, the country is facing an emergency situation where hospitals are short of oxygen which is also going to end in few hours.The court said the steel and petrochemical industries are oxygen guzzlers and diverting oxygen from there can meet requirements of hospitals.“If Tatas can divert oxygen they are generating for their steel plants to medical use, why can’t others? This is the height of greed. Is there no sense of humanity left or not.”  The court said transportation of oxygen from the place of production to the place of supply is also a challenge and time consuming activity as it is done only through highways in the normal course.“The Central government shall consider ways and means for transportation of oxygen either by creating a dedicated corridor so that the supply lines are not obstructed or even airlift it from the place of production to the place of usage,” it said.The court said heavens are not going to fall if the industries, including steel and petroleum, run on lower capacity till oxygen is imported.It said certainly all hell will break loose with the stoppage of medical oxygen for hospitals.“We are constrained to direct the Centre to forthwith implement this order and take over supply of oxygen from steel plants and if necessary also from the petroleum plants, to supply it to hospitals.”The court said such industries will have to stop their productions till the situation in hospitals improves and directed them to increase their oxygen production generated by them and give it to Centre for supply in other states for medical use.The petition said there are six Max hospitals in the national capital and NCR and are treating 1,400 COVID-19 patients.The bench was informed by the counsel for M/s Inox, which supplies oxygen to hospitals in Delhi, that certain quantity is on its way from a UP plant to Max Hospital, Patparganj here and will reach in two hours.On the apprehension that there could be some obstructions and law and order problem, the court directed the Centre that a safe passage be provided to oxygen supply from the place of production to the place of supply.

Thousands of employees claim LT every year.Under rules of the government’s LTC scheme, all tickets arc to be purchased directly from the airlines or by utilising the service of authorized travel agents. Booking tickets through other agencies is not permitted and nor is any request for relaxation of rules for booking the tickets through such agencies is considered. The government also permitted non-entitled employees to travel by air on LTC to certain places like Jammu and Kashmir, Port Blair and the north-east.All the ministries and departments were also advised to bring it to the notice of all employees that any misuse of LTC will be viewed seriously and the employees will be liable for appropriate action under rules.In order to keep a check on any kind of misuse of LTC, ministries and departments were advised to randomly get some of the air tickets submitted by the official verified from the airlines concerned with regard to the actual cost of air travel vis-a-vis the cost indicated on the air tickets submitted by the officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ltc-claims-of-govt-employees-over-past-10-years-be-scrutinised-as-air-tickets-are-forged-242218
22-04-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||Mumbai woman shares her phone number on Twitter for ventilator, gets sent obscene photos||Last week, Mumbai resident Shasvathi Siva was in for a shock. Desperate for information on ventilators and plasma for a relative who was critically ill, Siva had shared her phone number on Twitter, as many others like her have taken to doing lately. She found a ventilator, but that wasn’t all she got.As her number passed around, she found herself getting unsolicited and traumatising messages, complete with obscene photos.“The day after I put out my emergency request, I found myself fielding three to four calls a minute. I was speaking to blood banks, coordinating with donors, figuring if they qualified at all, and a million different things for my suffering loved ones,” she writes in her opinion piece in Vice. “All in all, it was draining, exhausting and demotivating. But somewhere in the middle of these calls—a lot of which were genuinely helpful—I got a call from a man who asked how I knew the person who’d posted about my SOS. ‘Doesn’t matter,’ I said. ‘Are you looking to donate blood?’ He replied, ‘No, are you single?’” she writes.That wasn’t the only call she got. As her number passed around, she found herself answering more and more such calls.“Been looking for plasma donors, and my no has been around in some groups + stories. I've fielded calls from men asking me if I'm single, if I can share photos, my dp is nice etc, and 1 "friend" who said he'd help if 'at least now you go on a date with me' Some men are DISGUSTING,” she wrote in a tweet on April 15.Thereon, it escalated. On April 16, she woke up to six men video-calling her simultaneously. What’s more, she was sent three obscene photos.“I thought it wouldn't get worse, but since this morning, I've received (on whatsapp) 3 dick pics, and 7 men trying to video call me continuously. Even in a medical emergency, men think only with their genitals. Women: NEVER, EVER let your number out in public forums,” she wrote in a tweet.“I went into deep shock, but I couldn’t immediately process it. My emotional range went from revulsion, anger and fear to hopelessness and a mix of other emotions you don’t need in such tough times even as I automatically deleted these photos to protect myself. I requested the tweets and stories that carried my number to be pulled down, because I couldn’t deal with how wildly,” she writes in Vice.“My advice to women would be to never let your phone number out on a public forum. I know this blanket advice can’t work in all situations, and the onus does not lie on us to protect our inboxes and DMs from perverts,” she writes.As India’s COVID crises escalate, several people have taken to using social media to desperately look for hospital beds, ventilators, oxygen tanks and medicines.  I thought it wouldn't get worse, but since this morning, I've received (on whatsapp) 3 dick pics, and 7 men trying to video call me continuously. Even in a medical emergency, men think only with their genitals.Women: NEVER, EVER let your number out in public forums. https://t.co/CAJJKiQmR6||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-woman-shares-her-phone-number-on-twitter-for-ventilator-gets-sent-obscene-photos-242217

The incidence of breakthrough infection is very low. Even if Covid infection occurs after the first and the second dose of the vaccine, it does not cause severe disease. The risk of infection is there which is why masks are important but the risk of severe infection reduces considerably,” VK Paul, Member Health NITI Aayog said.ICMR data show that out of the 93,56,436 people who received first doses of COVAXIN, 4,208 (0.04 pc) had breakthrough infection. The proportion was the same for those who received second doses of COVAXIN (out of 17,37,178 who got the second dose, 695 got Covid).Likewise, 10,03,02,745 people received Covishield first dose and of these 17,145 (0.02 pc) got breakthrough infection.Out of 1,57,32,754 who got the second dose of Covishield, 5,014 reported breakthrough infection.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/only-2-to-4-in-10-000-indians-had-breakthrough-infection-after-covid-vaccination-242209
22-04-2021||New Delhi||COVAXIN works against double mutant; reduces hospitalisation, shows Phase 3 interim data||In a major boost to made in India Covid vaccine enterprise, indigenous shot COVAXIN has been shown to successfully neutralise the double mutant detected in certain parts of India and the world.The Indian Council of Medical Research lab National Institute of Virology announced the development today saying the Bharat Biotech-ICMR made COVID vaccine was effective against multiple strains of the SARS-Cov2 virus.The ICMR had earlier isolated UK and Brazil strains and shown COVAXIN was effective against these.The results of COVAXIN working against the double mutant were announced on Friday simultaneous to another major research declaration that reveals COVAXIN has 78 to 100 pc efficacy against severe COVID disease.Bharat Biotech and ICMR today jointly shared the interim results from Phase 3 trials of COVAXIN saying these “demonstrate overall interim clinical efficacy of 78 pc and 100 pc efficacy against severe COVID-19 disease”.The second interim analysis is based on more than 87 symptomatic cases of COVID-19.The firm said due to the recent surge in cases, 127 symptomatic cases were recorded, resulting in a point estimate of vaccine efficacy of 78 pc against mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease.“The efficacy against severe COVID-19 disease was 100 pc with an impact on reduction in hospitalizations. The efficacy against asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was 70 pc, suggesting decreased transmission in COVAXIN recipients,” the results said.Safety and efficacy results from the final analysis will be available in June, and the final report will be submitted to a peer-reviewed publication, ICMR and Bharat Biotech said.The Phase 3 study enrolled 25,800 participants between 18-98 years of age, including 10 pc over the age of 60, with analysis conducted 14 days post 2nd dose.COVAXIN was developed with seed strains received from the National Institute of Virology and the phase 3 clinical trial was co-funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research, making it a true public, private partnership towards public health.Krishna Ella, Chairman and Managing Director, Bharat Biotech, said, “Efficacy against SARS-Cov-2 has been established. COVAXIN has demonstrated an excellent safety record in human clinical trials and in usage under emergency use. COVAXIN is now a global innovator vaccine derived from Research and development from India. The efficacy data against severe COVID-19 and asymptomatic infections is highly significant, as this helps reduce hospitalizations and disease transmission, respectively”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covaxin-works-against-double-mutant-reduces-hospitalisation-shows-phase-3-interim-data-242191
22-04-2021||New Delhi||Protesting farmers reject allegations they are blocking oxygen transport to Delhi||Farmers protesting at several Delhi borders on Wednesday rejected as "false propaganda" allegations that they were not letting medical oxygen carriers into Delhi, thus putting lives of several Covid patients at risk. BJP MP Parvesh Verma on Tuesday night had alleged that transportation of medical oxygen into Delhi was hampered due to the road blockade caused by protesters.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a representative body of several protesting farmer unions, said on Wednesday that they had kept a way open for emergency services since day one of their agitation."Not a single ambulance or essential goods service has been stopped. It is the government that has put strong and multilayer barricades (nails), not the farmers. Farmers are fighting for human rights and they support every human's rights," the morcha said."A false propaganda is being spread against farmers that they have blocked the roads and are not letting oxygen into Delhi. This is completely false news. Yes, we are protesting but not against Covid patients, corona warriors or common citizens. We are against the government's discriminatory policy on agriculture," it added.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting on various borders of Delhi since November last year, seeking a repeal of three farm laws enacted last September.Making the allegations, Verma had tweeted on Tuesday night, "I spoke to hospitals. I was told that only a few hours of oxygen supply is left and due to road blockade by protesters at Ghazipur border, the transportation of oxygen is getting difficult. The protesters must open the road," he had tweeted.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had on Tuesday urged the Centre "with folded hands" to provide medical oxygen to Delhi. His deputy Manish Sisodia had said that there would be chaos in the city if the stocks were not replenished by Wednesday morning.Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain had also sent an SOS to Union minister Piyush Goyal at 10.20 pm, saying "oxygen at GTB Hospital may not last beyond 4 hrs".Some major government and private hospitals in Delhi received fresh stock of medical oxygen in the early hours of Wednesday, averting a crisis just in time, according to officials.

22-04-2021||Nashik/Mumbai||24 Covid patients die after oxygen tank leak at Nashik hospital||At least 24 COVID-19 patients on ventilator support suffocated to death on Wednesday when their oxygen supply stopped suddenly because of a malfunction in the main storage at a civic-run hospital in Nashik in Maharashtra, officials said.The government will probe if the tragedy at the Dr Zakir Husain Hospital was due to negligence, Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said.A private company looked after the tank maintenance at the hospital, District Collector Suraj Mandhare said, adding technicians closed the tank valve preventing more deaths. Oxygen tanker leaked while tankers were being filled at Dr Zakir Hussain Hospital in Nashik, Maharashtra. Operation to contain the leak is underway. Nasik Municipal Corporation Commissioner says 23 patients were on ventilator and it is feared that 10-11 patients have lost lives. pic.twitter.com/0bBBptfWe1  Three days before the tragedy, the Union health ministry’s COVID-19 data compiled between March 16 and April 15 from major cities showed Nashik the worst-hit city in the country in terms of cases per million residents.Wednesday’s disruption of medical oxygen supply was caused by leakage from a storage plant, officials said.Of the 150 patients admitted to the hospital, 23 were on ventilator support at the time of the incident while the rest were on oxygen support, a senior civic official said.The municipal corporation shifted cylinders from other facilities in the city to help the patients at the hospital after the leak, which was noticed around 12.30 pm, an official said. Hospital officials then contacted municipal commissioner Kailash Jadhav seeking technical help to stop the leakage.A 13 kilolitre oxygen tank was set up on the premises of the hospital, located in the Dwarka area of Nashik.“Around 10 am, a socket of the oxygen storage tank broke and the leakage started. When the hospital staff came to know about it, they deployed jumbo cylinders to supply oxygen to the patients and started shifting some of the patients,” an official said.The leakage has been stopped, the tank repaired and the oxygen supply is being normalised, he said.Soon after the incident, people rushed to the hospital hindering rescue operations.“An oxygen tanker had reached the hospital premises when the leak happened. Technicians who came with that tanker and technicians at the hospital broke open the lock of the tank and closed the valve which prevented the further leakage of oxygen,” he said.All of them were on ventilator support, the minister said. The family of each deceased will be given financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh each from the CM relief fund.“The liquid oxygen which was filled in the tank has the temperature of around (minus) 180-degree celsius. There is extreme pressure on the walls of the tank which supplies oxygen to patients on ventilator support,” Tope said.Jadhav said no patient is in a serious condition now.The oxygen level was around 25 per cent in the storage tank at the time of the incident, he said.Two oxygen tanks were set up at the hospital recently and the maintenance work was given to a private company.An official said the incident occurred when oxygen was being filled in one of the tanks from a tanker, which disturbed the supply to the patients who were on ventilators as well as to those dependent on oxygen for breathing.Leela Shelar, who lost her 60-year-old mother in the tragedy was inconsolable. “My mother was admitted on Tuesday and put on ventilator support,” she said.Shelar said as her mother complained of difficulty in breathing, she had requested the nursing staff to help, but they didn’t pay heed.“I didn’t admit my mother here to die like this,” she said while fighting back her tears.Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari expressed anguish over the tragedy.Police dispersing a crowd of onlookers and the entry at the hospital was restricted after the incident.Nashik police commissioner Deepak Pandey said people’s emotions are intense, adding arrangements for adequate police deployment have been made. The area has been sealed, he added.A video of oxygen purportedly leaking from the storage plant went viral on social media in the morning.Relatives of the deceased reached the hospital soon after hearing of the incident and are demanding that stringent action be taken against those responsible for the tragedy.

22-04-2021||New Delhi||Serum prices Covid vaccine for pvt hospitals at Rs 600/dose; for state govts at Rs 400/dose||Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker, on Wednesday announced a price of Rs 400 per dose for its COVID-19 vaccine 'Covishield' for state governments and Rs 600 per dose for private hospitals.The company also said for the next two months, it will address the issue of limited capacity by scaling up vaccine production."Going ahead, 50 per cent of our capacities will be served to the Government of India's vaccination program, and the remaining 50 per cent of the capacity will be for the state governments and private hospitals," Serum Institute of India said in a statement.Following the government directives, the price of the Covishield vaccine is Rs 400 per dose for state governments and Rs 600 per dose for the private hospitals, it added.Considering the global vaccine prices, "we are ensuring that our vaccines are affordable in comparison to any other vaccines in the world", Serum Institute said.The American vaccines in the private market cost more than Rs 1,500 per dose, while Russian and Chinese vaccines cost greater than Rs 750 per dose, it added."... owing to the complexity, and urgency of the situation it is challenging to supply it independently to each corporate entity. We would urge all corporate and private individuals to access the vaccines through the state facilitated machinery and private health systems", Serum Institute said.After 4-5 months, the vaccines will be made available in retail and free trade, it added.The vaccine major said it welcomes the recent announcement made by the Ministry of Health and Finance Ministry to accelerate India's vaccination drive."The promising directives will help to scale up vaccine production, and allow state governments, private hospitals, and vaccination centres to procure vaccines directly," it added.On Tuesday, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla had also said in a tweet, "On behalf of the vaccine industry in India, I would like to thank and applaud Shri @narendramodi Ji, @nsitharaman Ji, for your decisive policy changes and swift financial aid which will help vaccine production and distribution in India".IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT pic.twitter.com/bTsMs8AKth  Covishield comprises over 90 per cent of the 12.76 crore COVID-19 vaccines administered across the country so far, according to government data on Wednesday.Of the 127,605,870 COVID-19 vaccination jabs administered till now, 11,60,65,107 are of Covishield, while 1,15,40,763 are Covaxin, according to the government's CO-WIN portal.Central Govt will continue to pay Rs 150 per dose for Covishield. State govts will now be charged Rs 400 a dose. This is not cooperative federalism. This will bleed dry the already reeling state finances. Atrocious!We demand One Nation, One Price for Centre & State governments. pic.twitter.com/YiOIWosNee  According to the sources, the government is likely to waive 10 per cent customs duty levied on imported vaccines in a bid to keep the cost of overseas vaccines low, which are being eyed to supplement domestically made shots ahead of the opening of COVID-19 vaccination to all citizens over 18 years of age.
