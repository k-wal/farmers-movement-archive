He also thanked the French aerospace industry for ensuring timely delivery of the jets.“Air Chief Mshl RKS Bhadauria on an official tour to France lauds pilots and sees off the next batch of Rafales on a non stop flight to India with mid air refueling by French Air force and UAE.“Thanks France especially FASF and French Industry for timely delivery & pilot training on schedule despite COVID,” the Indian embassy in France tweeted.The Indian embassy did not mention the number of aircraft flagged off by the IAF Chief but people associated with the event said four jets formed the new batch that left from France’s Merignac airbase.In his brief remarks, the IAF Chief said some of the Rafale aircraft have been delivered a “little bit” ahead of time and it has contributed to the overall combat potential of the Indian Air Force (IAF).Ahead of his visit, military officials in Delhi said that his trip to France is expected to boost cooperation between the IAF and the French Air and Space Force (FASF).“This ferry, which is fifth from here, marks the end of the third batch of our pilots and all our maintenance crew. The Rafale training centre has provided world class training and it is because of the level and quality of training that we were able to operationalise the aircraft quickly,” he said.He also thanked the French government, the French Air Force for providing the required support for the training programme as well as for ferrying of the aircraft to India.The arrival of the new batch of the aircraft will pave the way for the IAF to raise a second squadron of the Rafale jets. The new squadron will be based in Hasimara air base in West Bengal.The first Rafale squadron is based in Ambala air force station. A squadron comprises around 18 aircraft.India had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 for procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of around Rs 58,000 crore.So far, 14 Rafale jets are operating in the IAF and the number will go up to 18 after the arrival of the new batch.The first batch of five Rafale jets arrived in India on July 29 last.On Tuesday, Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria held talks with Gen Philippe Lavigne, Chief of Staff of French Air and Space Force (FASF), on ways to further expand cooperation between the two sides. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iaf-chief-in-france-flags-off-four-rafale-aircraft-for-india-242240
21-04-2021||New Delhi||Remdesivir needs to be used only in 7-11 per cent Covid patients: Experts||Amid panic buying and prescription of a range of Covid management tools including anti viral injection Remdesivir and medical oxygen, top experts urged people on Wedneday not to see Remdesivir as a wonder drug and added that the anti-viral injection is to be used only in 7- 11 per cent of Covid patients.On oxygen they said, it is a drug to be used very judiciously like a security blanket and not to be wasted.AIIMS New Delhi Director Randeep Guleria said most of the active cases who are in home isolation or in the hospital don't actually need any specific treatment. "A very small percentage require Remdesivir. If we work together, use oxygen and Remdesivir judiciously, there will be no shortage anywhere," Guleria said.The expert noted that healthy individuals with oxygen saturation in the range 93-94 pc do not need to take high flow oxygen just to maintain their saturation at 98-99 pc. “Oxygen is like a drug. If oxygen is less than 94 you need close monitoring but you still may not need oxygen," Guleria stated to drive home the point that taking oxygen intermittently is an absolute waste of oxygen. There is no data that shows that this will be of any help to the patients and is therefore ill-advised.Medanta chief Naresh Trehan said the hospitals had enough oxygen only if they used it judiciously. Trehan said Medanta had drafted a protocol saying Remdesivir is not to be given to everyone who tests positive.“It is to be given only after doctors look at test results, symptoms, comorbidities of a patient. Remdesivir isn't not a Ramban, it only decreases viral load in people who need it,” Trehan said.Dr. Guleria said more than 85 per cent people will recover without any specific treatment in the form of Remdesivir. “Most will have symptoms like common cold, sore throat and over five to seven days they will recover with symptomatic treatment. Only 15 per cent will get moderate disease,” Guleria said advising cross ventilation to reduce the risk of infection in closed places. Dr Devi Shetty said ideal oxygen level was over 94."You need to see a doctor if O2 is falling after exercise," he said, advising a Covid test if anyone has symptoms.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/remdesivir-needs-to-be-used-only-in-7-11-per-cent-covid-patients-experts-242238

21-04-2021||New Delhi||Keep border issue at ‘appropriate position’, focus on long term ties: China to India||The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has hoped that India will work with China to meet each other halfway on the border dispute.Chinese MFA spokesperson Wang Wenbin made these observations when he was asked to reach out to India's Ambassador to China Vikram Misri recently stating that there was a tendency to sweep the situation at the border under the carpet and characterise it as just a minor issue.Wang’s subsequent comments showed the divergence in the thinking of New Delhi and Beijing on this issue. Wang said both sides should bear in mind the overall interests of the long-term development of China-India relations. They should, therefore, place the boundary issue “at an appropriate position” in bilateral relations and bring China-India relations back to the track of sound and steady development.Wang began by pointing out that China's position on the boundary issue is consistent and clear-cut.“We are committed to maintaining peace and stability in the border areas and firmly safeguarding national territorial sovereignty and security,” he said while recalling that recently China and India have maintained close communication through diplomatic and military channels.“On the basis of realising disengagement in the Galwan Valley and the Pangong Lake area, the two sides have had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on promoting the settlement of the remaining issues in the western sector of the China-India boundary,” he observed.Minister for External Affairs S Jaishankar has repeatedly stated that a peaceful and tranquil border is a prerequisite for advancing bilateral India-China ties. New Delhi has put on hold several investment proposals from China. Estimated at $2 billion when the ban was put in place last year, some investment proposals also have third country implications.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/keep-border-issue-at-appropriate-position-focus-on-long-term-ties-china-to-india-242235
21-04-2021||Paris||France to impose entry restrictions on travellers from India||France will impose new entry restrictions on travellers from India to fight a contagious coronavirus variant spreading in that country, an official said on Wednesday.The restrictions come in addition to those previously announced regarding four other countries — Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and South Africa — that will be implemented starting from Saturday.Government spokesman Gabriel Attal also confirmed that France will lift its ban on domestic travel as planned on May 3, but will maintain its nighttime curfew, now in place from 7 pm to 6 am. Nonessential shops, closed since the partial lockdown of the country at beginning of April, won’t reopen before mid-May, he said.France suspended all flights from Brazil earlier this month in an effort to curb the spread of a new COVID-19 variant found in the South American country. The temporary measure is to be replaced Saturday by tight travel restrictions regarding a list of now five countries, including a mandatory 10-day quarantine with police checks to ensure people arriving in France observe the requirement.France is also requiring more stringent testing for the coronavirus on travellers from these countries, who will need to pass a mandatory antigen test upon their arrival, in addition to a pre-boarding PCR test.A variant first identified in England is now responsible for about 80% of the virus cases in France, while the variants first seen in Brazil and South Africa make up less than 4% of French infections, Health Minister Olivier Veran said last week.Attal said on Wednesday that daily numbers of new infections are tending to decrease in the country — yet they still reach more than 30,000 people per day on average. With almost 6,000 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units and hospitals close to capacity, Attal said France may be close to reaching a “peak.”      He noted “encouraging” signs, but this is “not sufficient enough.” “The epidemic is decreasing twice as slow as in November especially due to the English variant,” he said. “The pressure on hospitals is extremely strong.”                    Nursery and primary schools will reopen on April 26 after a three-week closure as planned, followed by high schools on May 3, Attal said.France intends to gradually reopen nonessential shops, some of its cultural places and cafe and restaurant terraces starting from mid-May.President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday praised the acceleration of the vaccination campaign in the country, with more than 2.5 million jabs injected last week.France has reported more than 100,00 deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic.

21-04-2021||New Delhi||7,500 MT oxygen being produced in India daily, 6,600 MT allocated to states for medical use: Govt||Amid reports of oxygen shortage in the country, the Centre on Wednesday said of the total 7,500 metric tonnes of oxygen being produced in India per day, 6,600 metric tonnes, as on date, is being allocated to states for medical use and assured that efforts are being made to increase its supplies in the coming days.At a press conference, NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr V K Paul appealed to the states, hospitals and nursing homes to ensure rational use of oxygen as it was a “life-saving” drug for coronavirus infected patients.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, “We are producing 7,500 metric tonnes of oxygen per day of which 6,600 metric tonnes is being allocated to the states for medical purposes.“Presently, we have issued instructions that, leaving a few industries, the supply to industries will be restricted so that more and more oxygen can be made available for medical use,” he said.Bhushan further said that a 24x7 control room has been set up where state governments can raise the problems bring faced by them like if their truck is stuck somewhere or the if movement is being hindered.“When you deal with such a huge challenge, such a big pandemic and multiple stakeholders, then at times there is panic and confusion, and the onus and responsibility is on the Union and state governments to work together and respond promptly so these challenges are addressed,” Bhushan said.The officials said they are also evaluating applications from suppliers abroad for import of oxygen.In view of the increasing demand for medical oxygen, the Centre floated a tender for import of 50,000 MT of medical oxygen and a pre-bidding meeting was held on Tuesday, according to official sources.The Health Ministry has been directed to finalise the tender for the same and also explore possible sources for import identified by the missions of MEA.Besides, the Health Ministry on Sunday said 162 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants sanctioned by Government of India for installation in public health facilities in all states will augment oxygen capacity by 154.19 MT.Out of 162 PSA oxygen plants, 33 have been installed and 59 will be installed by the end of April, while by the end of May, 80 plants will be installed.          In addition to the 162 plants already sanctioned, states have requested for more than 100 such additional plants which are also being sanctioned, the ministry had said in a tweet.“The entire cost of 162 PSA oxygen plants amounting to Rs 201.58 crore has been borne by the central government.This also includes 7 year maintenance cost to start from 4th year onwards after three years of warranty,” the ministry had said in a series of tweets.Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants manufacture oxygen and help hospitals become self-sufficient in their requirement for medical oxygen while also reducing the burden on the national grid for supply of medical oxygen.The Centre on Sunday banned the supply of oxygen for industrial purposes except in nine specified industries in view of shortage of the essential public health commodity in several states amid a spike in COVID-19 infections.The decision will come into effect from April 22.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/7-500-mt-oxygen-being-produced-in-india-daily-6-600-mt-allocated-to-states-for-medical-use-govt-242230

21-04-2021||Nagpur||Bombay HC pulls up Maharashtra Government on Remdesivir procurement, allocation||The Bombay High Court came down heavily on the Maharashtra government on Wednesday for its extremely callous behaviour towards the issue of procuring and allocating Remdesivir injections for COVID-19 patients and said the authorities are shirking their responsibilities.The critical remarks by the Nagpur bench of the high court came in the backdrop of a nationwide scramble for the anti-viral drug being widely used to treat COVID-19 patients.A division bench of Justices SB Shukre and SM Modak was irked that its April 19 order, directing the state government to supply 10,000 Remdesivir vials to Nagpur, badly affected by COVID-19, on that very day, was not complied with completely.In strong remarks, the court noted that it was ashamed to be a part of this “nasty and evil society” and was unable to do anything for the coronavirus patients of Maharashtra.The bench was hearing a bunch of petitions on the issue of the pandemic, lack of medical facilities in hospitals and the hurdles being faced by affected people.The bench noted that the affidavits filed by the Joint Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Nagpur, and the Additional Collector have made contradictory statements on why the order could not be complied with.We find that these officers have now started to shirk their responsibilities in giving certain relief to COVID-19 patients and in a way, they are also on the path to violate their fundamental duties, the court observed.It added that at this stage it was refraining from passing any adverse order and giving the authorities concerned an opportunity to correct themselves.The Joint Commissioner (FDA), in his affidavit, said the Maharashtra government has no authority to control, distribute and allocate Remdesivir and that the process is handled by Mumbai-based Haffkine Bio Pharmaceutical Corporation Ltd.He told the court that pharma companies send vials to their depots in Maharashtra from where they are dispatched to hospitals. The affidavit said at present there is a shortage of Remdesivir in Maharashtra, the worst COVID-19-hit state.The bench then pointed out that on the last hearing it was told that a state-level committee has been appointed to allocate Remdesivir injections to hospitals across districts in Maharashtra."Whose responsibility is allocation? This is highly objectionable. This shows extreme callousness and now the government is trying to shirk its responsibility. Is it not the state government's job to find a solution at its level," Justice Shukre said.The bench further noted that the authorities are not providing any solace or relief to coronavirus patients and are refusing to even comply with court orders."Are you not ashamed of yourselves? We are ashamed to be a part of this nasty and evil society where we are not able to do anything for the unfortunate patients of Maharashtra," Justice Shukre said.“What nonsense is going on here...you (government) won’t do anything on your own and when we are trying to provide a solution you do not follow that too. You cannot walk away from your responsibilities,” the court said.The bench directed the court-appointed Nagpur COVID- 19 Committee, headed by the Nagpur Divisional Commissioner with the Nagpur Collector as its Member Secretary, to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday and make efforts to procure Remdesivir vials on an urgent basis for Nagpur.The bench also took note of a recent incident of Mumbai where police unearthed an alleged malpractice where the director of a Gujarat-based company was trying to sell 60,000 vials of Remdesivir in the black market.It said the Nagpur police should carry out periodical checks, surprise raids and inspections to stop such malpractices.Nagpur Collector Ravindra Thakare told the court that around 4,000 vials of Remdesivir are expected to be received on Wednesday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bombay-hc-pulls-up-maharashtra-government-on-remdesivir-procurement-allocation-242224
21-04-2021||New Delhi||Digital platforms emerge as lifelines for people as COVID cases spike||With COVID cases touching new highs, digital platforms - right from Twitter to Tinder - have become lifelines for people looking for hospital beds, medicines and oxygen for the patients.A total of 2,95,041 fresh infections were registered in a span of 24 hours, while the active cases crossed the 21-lakh mark with a record 2,023 daily fatalities, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Wednesday.“My grandmother needs oxygen machine (5L). She’s aged 80. Location: Kalyan, Mumbai. Have tried all numbers that I have seen here, still not able to get,” read a tweet.Another one urged people for leads on finding a hospital bed in Noida.Social media timelines on platforms like Twitter and Facebook are filled with desperate requests by family members and friends of patients for hospital beds and medicines. These posts have been reshared to amplify the reach to a larger audience.While social media platforms had played a significant role last year too amid the lockdown, the situation is grim this year. The unprecedented surge in cases has placed tremendous strain on healthcare services and resources across India, and hospitals are running short of beds and medicines.Interestingly, a Twitter user, Sohini Chattopadhyay narrated how a plasma match was found for a friend through a dating app Tinder.Chattopadhyay went on to add, “Dating app 1, govt 0”.While there are calls for help, others are also proactively sharing information on various social media platforms.Social media posts and WhatsApp messages are aplenty with collated lists of hospitals with available beds, names and phone numbers of distributors of medicines like Remdesivir (used in the treatment of COVID) and even food delivery services for COVID patients.Various actors and social media influencers are also updating their accounts with details of COVID-19 resources. Some people have gone the extra mile to verify the information, which is often crowdsourced, to benefit the masses.Misinformation has been a major challenge for social media platforms in the past. Tech giants Google, Facebook and Twitter have been stepping up efforts to curb misinformation around COVID-19 on their platform.Facebook, for example, is working with independent third-party fact-checking entities, covering many Indian languages, to identify misinformation around COVID-19.It had also launched a Coronavirus Information Centre to provide the latest news and updates from MyGov Corona Hub, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) and global health organisations.

21-04-2021||New Delhi/Chandigarh||Sisodia says Haryana official blocked oxygen supply; state govt rejects charge||Deputy Chief Minister Sisodia accused the Haryana government on Wednesday of blocking medical oxygen supply to Delhi, where several hospitals scrambled to save lives of coronavirus patients amid its shortage for the second consecutive day.The Haryana government vehemently refuted the allegations, underlining that no one in the administration had hampered anything.Addressing a press conference, Sisodia said the AAP government had been demanding that the Centre increase Delhi’s quota of oxygen from 378 metric tonnes to 700 metric tonnes. Read also: Haryana being forced to give oxygen to Delhi: Anil VijThe central government, which decides the quota of oxygen for states, is yet to take a step in this direction, the deputy chief minister said.“We again demand that the Centre increase our oxygen quota to 700 MT in view of the increased consumption. Patients from several states, including Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, are admitted in city hospitals,” Sisodia said.He claimed that an official of the Haryana government stopped oxygen supply from a plant in Faridabad.Sisodia said a similar incident occurred in Uttar Pradesh a day ago and it led to a crisis in some hospitals, adding the oxygen supply had been restored now. He demanded that states should get their allotted share of oxygen without others interfering into it.Reacting to it, Haryana Chief Secretary Vijai Vardhan told PTI: “No supply has been stopped to Delhi. This is not true.”Earlier in the day, Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij alleged that a tanker carrying medical oxygen for COVID patients in hospitals, which was going from Panipat to Faridabad, was “looted” by the Delhi government and said all oxygen tankers will now move with police escort.Several hospitals in Delhi alleged that the Haryana government was not allowing vendors to supply oxygen to them and there was only limited stock left as hundreds of coronavirus patients battled for their life in these facilities.“The vendor, as per its representative, is not being allowed by the Haryana government to supply oxygen cylinders and liquid oxygen to Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital, Pusa Road. Supply left is sufficient only for five hours,” the official said.A spokesperson of St Stephen’s Hospital said: “The Haryana government has not been allowing our vendor to supply oxygen to us. Of the 350 patients in the hospital, around 200 are on oxygen support,” he alleged.Manipal Hospitals CEO said Pramod Alagharu their supplier was willing to supply oxygen from its Faridabad unit. “However, an officer has taken control over the plant. We have only 12 hrs of supplies left,” he said.Faridabad Deputy Commissioner Garima Mittal denied the allegations.“There is absolutely nothing like that. Some storage tankers of the company were reaching Faridabad plant from Meerut and once they reach as usual, they will fill and supply,” Mittal told PTI.From the Faridabad plant, the supplies go to 32 hospitals, out of which 25 are in Delhi, Vardhan said, adding that the supply would reach in routine.Some major government and private hospitals in Delhi received a fresh stock of medical oxygen in the early hours of Wednesday, averting a crisis just in time, according to officials.This stock should last till 9 am on Thursday, an official said.Delhi reported a record 28,395 coronavirus cases and 277 deaths on Tuesday, with the positivity rate shooting up to 32.82 per cent—meaning every third sample came out positive.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sisodia-says-haryana-official-blocked-oxygen-supply-state-govt-rejects-charge-242220
21-04-2021||Tirupati||TTD declares 'Anjanadri' in Tirumala is Hanuman's birthplace||The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, which governs the ancient shrine of Lord Venkateswara at Tirumala here, on Wednesday announced that Lord Hanuman's birthplace was Anjanadri, a hillock at Japali Theertham located about 5 km from north of the hill temple.The announcement, on 'Ram Navami' day, was made by a TTD constituted committee of scholars from different fields led by Prof Muralidhara Sharma, Vice-Chancellor of National Sanskrit University here, in the presence of Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit.TTD Executive Officer K S Jawahar Reddy and Additional Executive Officer AV Dharma Reddy were also present.The committee said Anjandri is the birthplace of Lord Hanuman, popularly known as Sri Anjaneya Swamy in South India, according to a TTD official.A booklet with 'epigraphical, scientific and mythological evidence', projecting Anjanadri, one of the seven hills at Tirumala, as the birthplace of Lord Hanuman was released by Muralidhara Sharma on the occasion. Muralidhara Sharma said the panel has gathered some "significant smithereens of evidence" based on the references in ancient literature, inscriptions, historical and astronomical calculations as well.The TTD booklet, with 20 pages titled in Telugu as 'Sri Anjaneyaswamy Vari Janmasthalam Tirumalaloni Anjanadri' (Tirumala's Anjanadri is Sri Hanumans birthplace), was unveiled on the occasion. It was distributed among media persons and other TTD officials, a TTD official told PTI.  The booklet would also be uploaded on the TTD website for the benefit of the public, the official added.Purohit, who came here to offer worship to Lord Venkateswara on the occasion of  Rama Navami, hailed the committee's efforts and expressed satisfaction over its report projecting Anjanadri as the birthplace of Sri Hanuman, the official said.  In December last, TTD executive officer KS Jawahar Reddy had constituted a high-level committee of scholars from various fields to study and gather evidence to establish that Anjanadri is the place where Lord Hanuman was born.TTD's claim on the topic of Hanuman's birthplace has created a stir in religious, archaeological, and political circles in Karnataka because Hampi near Ballari is considered 'Kishkindha Kshetra' or monkey kingdom for ages.   While some archaeology and history scholars have dismissed the TTD's claim, the Karnataka unit of Vishwa Hindu Parishad has said the TTD should take some more time and hold discussions with scholars and religious heads before arriving at any conclusion.In Hindu mythology, there are different versions of where the monkey-God was born. Some tales have Hanuman as being born in a cave in Anjan village in Gumla district of Jharkhand while some others claim his birthplace as Maharashtra's Anjaneri hills near Nashik. The temple of Lord Venkateswara is located on Venkatadri hill, the seventh and Narayanadri, Seshadri and Garudadri are among the other hills of Tirumala. Hanuman is also hailed as 'Vayuputra' and as son of Anjana Devi who did 'tapas' in the one of the seven hills of Tirumala and it was named after her as 'Anjanadri.' Besides Muralidhara Sharma, the committee of scholars includes Prof Sannidhanam Sudarshana Sharma, Vice-Chancellor of Sri Venkateswara Vedic University here, Prof Muralidhara Sharma, Vice-Chancellor of National Sanskrit varsity, professors Ranisadasiva Murthy, Sri Janumaddi Ramakrishna and Sankaranarayana of the National Sanskrit University.

21-04-2021||  Hyderabad||In Telangana, uninterrupted ambulance sirens become order of the day||In Hyderabad, constant horns of vehicles that usually rend the air have been replaced by a more worrying sound—those of ambulance sirens making their way around the city.Telangana’s COVID crisis deepens—the state reported 6,542 new Covid-19 new cases during 24-hour—stretching its healthcare to capacity and leaving patients scrambling for hospital beds.Even the hospitals that admit a patient or two want an advance deposit of up to Rs 5 lakh before the treatment is started.    Lack of oxygen, medicines and apathy have only worsened the situation in the second wave of COVID-19. Telangana has imposed a night curfew from 9 pm to 5 am till May 1, but the road traffic is hardly gone down. The state’s vaccination drive that received a boost during the centrally encouraged ‘Tika Utsav’ has been shut for the past few days with the hospitals having no clue about when they will get the vaccine stocks.  The situation is so bad that the Chief Minister’s daughter, a Nizamabad MLC, has started a helpline of her own. The helpline is receiving about 300 calls each day seeking help in getting hospital beds, medicine like Remidesivir or just an oxygen cylinder. Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) himself is in isolation after contracting the virus, while most members of the cabinet are seen visiting 'dargas' and temples praying for the chief minister. She has certainly shown more leadership compared to others in her father’s cabinet.    The central government’s Cowin portal continues to book appointments for the first and second doses of vaccination at various places in the state even when these vaccination centres are shut. The Apollo Hospital in Secundrabad said that there is a waiting list of one month for anyone wanting a second shot after the vaccine supplies resume. Most hospitals like Virinchi, Century, Care, Star, etc have no vaccine supplies for the past few days.     Telangana has announced a centralised online system to show the availability of beds today and claims to reveal real-time availability of hospital beds in Government and private hospitals across Telangana on the website health.telanagana.gov.in. Surprisingly, data shows only 20 occupied beds in Gandhi Hospital which is the main COVID-19 Hospital, zero bed occupancy in 7 out of 10 COVID hospitals in Hyderabad—contrary to the situation on the ground. As per the information available here 16,140 COVID positive patients are undergoing treatment at government and private hospitals and there are 27,061 vacant hospital beds across the State. There are 9,838 vacant beds in Government hospitals while 17,223 vacant beds are available in private hospitals.  The past 24 hours have seen 20 deaths, the highest single-day toll in the second wave so far. The state has seen 3,67,901 positives cases and 1,876 deaths so far.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-telangana-uninterrupted-ambulance-sirens-become-order-of-the-day-242214
21-04-2021||New Delhi||India ranks 87th in global energy transition index||India has been ranked at the 87th position among 115 countries in the Energy Transition Index (ETI) that tracks nations on the current performance of their energy systems across various aspects, according to a report.The report from the World Economic Forum (WEF) released on Wednesday and prepared in collaboration with Accenture also draws on insights from ETI.The top 10 countries in the index are Western and Northern European countries, and Sweden is in the first position followed by Norway (2nd) and Denmark (3rd).“China (68) and India (87), which collectively account for a third of global energy demand, have both made strong improvements over the past decade, despite coal continuing to play a significant role in their energy mix,” the report said.As per the report, India has targeted improvements through subsidy reforms and rapidly scaling energy access, with a strong political commitment and regulatory environment for the energy transition.“China’s improvements primarily result from reducing the energy intensity of the economy, gains in decarbonising the energy mix through the expansion of renewables and strengthening the enabling environment through investments and infrastructure,” it added.The index benchmarks 115 countries on the current performance of their energy systems across three dimensions—economic development and growth, environmental sustainability, and energy security and access indicators—and their readiness to transition to secure, sustainable, affordable, and inclusive energy systems.The latest report is based on a revised ETI methodology that takes into account recent changes in the global energy landscape and the increasing urgency of climate change action.As per the report, 92 out of 115 countries tracked on the ETI increased their aggregate score over the past 10 years, which affirms the positive direction and steady momentum of the global energy transition.“As we enter into the decade of action and delivery on climate change, the focus must also encompass speed and resilience of the transition. With the energy transition moving beyond the low hanging fruit, sustained incremental progress will be more challenging due to the evolving landscape of risks to the energy transition,” Roberto Bocca, Head of Energy and Materials at WEF, said.Other countries in the top 10 are Switzerland (4), Austria (5), Finland (6), the United Kingdom (7), New Zealand (8), France (9) and Iceland (10).

21-04-2021||Balurghat (WB)||Second Covid wave Modi-made disaster: Mamata Banerjee||Lashing out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday alleged that the second Covid wave in the country and its management is a “Modi-made disaster”.Addressing an election rally at Balurghat in Dakshin Dinajpur district, the TMC chief asserted that West Bengal would be run only by a "Bengal engine government" and not by "Modi's double-engine"."The second Covid wave is more intense. I would say this is a Modi-made disaster. There are no injections or oxygen. Vaccines and medicines are being shipped abroad even as there is a scarcity of these items in the country," she told the rally.She claimed that this election is a fight to save West Bengal and "protect the honour of the Bengali mother"."Our state will be run by a Bengal engine government and not by Modi's double-engine government. We will not allow Gujarat to capture our state or run it from Delhi. Bengal will rule Bengal," she said.The term "double-engine government" often used by BJP leaders denotes the government of the same party at the Centre and the state.The TMC chief also urged people not to vote for Left-Congress-ISF alliance candidates claiming that voting for them would strengthen the BJP's hand.Banerjee said the Centre had said seven months ago that the pandemic had subsided."Now, with elections under way in West Bengal, the BJP is bringing in people from other states and spreading the infection among the people here," she said.She said that her administration is finding it difficult to set up safe homes as many government accommodations are being used to house central forces."We are finding it difficult to set up safe homes. Although we have increased the number of beds, I would suggest that patients who don't have severe symptoms, please remain in home-isolation," Banerjee said.He also asked Covid patients with mild symptoms to cast their vote after 6 pm.Banerjee claimed that the BJP is saying different things at different places on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).She said that refugees who had come to West Bengal had been given land rights. "You are all citizens of the state. So don't worry. I will act as a watchman," she said.Banerjee said that in the last 10 years, the TMC government had built roads, hospitals, bridges, stadia and an industrial centre in Dakshin Dinajpur district.Elections to the 294-member state Assembly are being held in eight phases from March 27 to April 29. Results will be announced on May 2. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/second-covid-wave-modi-made-disaster-mamata-banerjee-242178
21-04-2021||New Delhi||Centre's Covid vaccine strategy 'abject failure': Priyanka Gandhi||Slamming the government's alleged lack of preparedness to deal with the COVID-19 second wave and terming its vaccine strategy "abject failure", Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Wednesday said the BJP-led Centre cannot shift the blame as Jawaharlal Nehru isn't in-charge, Narendra Modi is and he should protect Indians.In an exclusive interview with PTI, the Congress general secretary said constructive suggestions from opposition parties are being dismissed as politicisation rather than being accepted in the spirit that the nation is in crisis, every single life matters and, therefore, "all of us must stand together and do whatever we can to save lives regardless of our politics". "They (government) are wasting time engaging in pettiness, making a minister respond to a letter addressed by a former prime minister who served this nation selflessly and with dignity to the present Prime Minister, Union Ministers are blaming state governments for increased oxygen consumption and central government press releases are targeting Opposition governments," she said.Priyanka Gandhi's remarks come two days after Health Minister Harsh Vardhan responded  to former prime minister Manmohan Singh's letter with suggestions on COVID-19 management, and alleged that the second wave of the pandemic was fuelled by Congress-ruled states as they were busy raising doubts about vaccines rather than vaccinating people.Talking about the Congress' long-standing demand for universalisation of COVID-19 vaccination and the government's inoculation strategy, Priyanka Gandhi slammed the government for exporting vaccine doses for a "PR exercise".Thanks to 70 years of forward-thinking governance, today India is the largest manufacturer of vaccines in the world, she said."The Union government enabled the export of six crore vaccines between January and March 2021. A huge PR exercise was conducted with photos of vaccines arriving in countries like Mauritius, Guyana and Nepal being circulated. During this same period, Indian citizens received only three to four crore doses," she said."Why didn't the government prioritise Indians first. Why did the prime minister place self-promotion above the nation? In a state like UP with a 22 crore population, only 1 crore doses have been administered," the Congress general secretary in-charge Uttar Pradesh said. Foreign agencies purchased vaccines from Indian vaccine manufacturers much before the Indian government placed an order and several large countries placed advance orders for vaccines twice the size of their population, she said, adding that India placed its first order only in January 2021. The Modi government's lack of foresight has compelled India to become an importer of vaccines today and even now, their "vaccine strategy is flawed and discriminatory", Priyanka Gandhi said."Why are free vaccines not being made available to 18-45 year olds? The new variants are supposedly even more virulent and many young people are affected. And why is the government allowing middlemen into the equation without price controls?" she said.This is not a coherent strategy, it is an "abject failure", Priyanka Gandhi said.Asked about Union minister Piyush Goyal's statement that states must keep oxygen demand under control, she said Goyal's "heartless comment" shows the "brutal coldness" at the heart of this administration. "They see precious human life in terms of demand and supply. But then what can one expect from a government led by a prime minister who is continuing to hold public rallies and  laughing on stage while lakhs of people are crying for help, the healthcare system is reeling under a massive pandemic and lakhs of Indians are fighting for their lives," she said.On the shortage of medical grade oxygen and critical medicines like Remdisivir, she said that due to the very governments that Prime Minister Modi holds responsible for every ill in the country, India's capacity as one of the world's largest producers of oxygen was built over decades. India produces 7,500 Metric Tonnes of oxygen per day, at the peak of the last wave the cumulative use of oxygen in hospitals across the nation was less than half this quantity per day, she pointed out. "We produce enough oxygen, the government has simply not created the adequate logistics to supply it across India. It had the entire period between the first and the second wave to do this. It did nothing," she alleged.India has exported about 9,300 Metric Tonnes of Oxygen in the last 12 months, Priyanka Gandhi said and asked who is responsible for the deaths due to lack of oxygen.India has exported 1.1 million injections of Remdesivir in the last six months and since December production of crucial medicine was reduced, she said. "Export has been stopped only five days back, Why? Who can they shift the blame onto? Jawaharlal Nehru isn't in charge, Narendra Modi is. He should step up to the plate. He is the Prime Minister. It is incumbent on him to protect Indians, to give them a sense of safety and to fight this battle from the front," Priyanka Gandhi said.She asserted that the Congress is firm in its commitment towards the people of India to remain constructive and supportive during this crisis. "We have not and will not politicise this unprecedented human tragedy under any circumstances. We will, however, continue to push the government to act, we will continue to raise issues that need to be addressed urgently to save lives, they can label us in whichever terms they like," she asserted.  "We fully understand our responsibility towards our country. Manmohan Singh ji, the Congress President (Sonia Gandhi) and Rahul ji have all offered our party's constructive cooperation to the prime minister time and again," Priyanka Gandhi added. India has been regularly registering over 2 lakh COVID-19 cases daily.

He and at least four other poultry farm owners in his area also faced the same issue, following which he submitted a complaint to us," said Rajendra Mokashi, senior police inspector, Loni Kalbhor police station.The complainant stated he had purchased the poultry feed from a company based in the neighbouring Ahmednagar district of the state."He mentioned in the application that after consuming that feed, hens at his farm have stopped laying eggs," Mokashi said.He said the police consulted the block level animal husbandry officer in Ahmednagar over this issue."The official told us that it is a common phenomenon that sometimes a particular feed does not suit hens and they stop laying eggs after consuming it," said Mokashi.Citing the official, Mokashi said such instances of hens not laying eggs after they were given a new feed had occurred in the past.Once hens are fed the old feed they started laying eggs again, he said."We also spoke to the concerned poultry farm manufacturer who told us to have received similar complaints about the feed from some other customers as well.

Now when the number of cases in the second wave of is spiralling, the Centre has chosen to tactically indulge in empty rhetoric and shy away from its responsibility for making available vaccines to the people of the country,” she wrote. She alleged that the announcement made on Monday did not address major issues like ensuring quality, efficacy and stable flow of supply of required number of doses by the manufacturers and also the price at which the vaccines are to be purchased by the states.“It is apprehended that the announced policy may lead to unscrupulous mechanisms in the market, including pricing of vaccines, as it appears to be based on market prices which may put the common people under huge financial burden,” Banerjee wrote. — TNSClub remaining 3 poll phases, TMC urges ECDemanding polling to be held in the remaining Assembly constituencies of West Bengal in one go instead of three phases as originally scheduled, the TMC on Tuesday submitted a memorandum to the Chief Electoral Officer pressing the need for deploying all available manpower to battle Covid. tns||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-vaccine-policy-hollow-didi-to-pm-242097

The assessee was represented by senior counsel Puneet Bali and advocate Surjeet Bhadu.The Joint Commissioner of State Taxes and Excise, Parwanoo, had provisionally attached the appellant’s receivables from its customers.

We have to do our best to avoid a lockdown and our focus should rather be on micro containment zones.”He further said the country can improve the health of its economy and also take care of the health of the people this way.Some states have announced lockdowns in their worst-hit regions. Delhi is also under a week-long lockdown that will end on Monday.Modi further said the nation now has vaccines to support India’s cold chain system and noted that it has launched the world’s largest vaccination campaign with two made-in-India vaccines.India is the fastest in the world to administer 10 crore, 11 crore and now 12 crore vaccine doses, he said, as he dwelt at length during his short speech about a string of announcements made by his government to deal with the worst health crisis ever to hit the country.In his address to the nation, Modi said the people were undergoing suffering but “we need to fight it out with all our might” and expressed confidence that the coronavirus will be defeated with the combined efforts of the people.“I want to thank our doctors and all our healthcare workers for working non-stop in this fight against the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said.Modi noted that the pharma sector was working relentlessly to meet all COVID-19 challenges, including vaccine development and supply.The prime minister said that the shortage of oxygen cylinders has come across as a major problem and said all stakeholders were working collectively to meet this challenge.The situation is different from last year when there was no COVID vaccine in the country or infrastructure to produce PPE kits and other much-needed medical goods, he noted.He said lockdown should be the last option and the focus should be on micro-containment.“If we all follow COVID-19 protocols, there will be no need to impose lockdowns,” Modi said.He urged the people to reduce their movements and get vaccinated.Modi also said the children have a key role in convincing elders that they should not leave their homes without proper reasons or for some important work. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-surge-pm-modi-says-lockdowns-should-be-last-resort-241756
21-04-2021||New Delhi||Power to order provisional attachment of property, bank account draconian in nature: SC||The Supreme Court said on Tuesday the power to order a provisional attachment of the property including bank account of the taxable person is draconian in nature and must be based on tangible material.A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah said the exercise of the power for ordering a provisional attachment must be preceded by the formation of an opinion by the Commissioner that it is necessary so to do for the purpose of protecting the interest of the government revenue.      “Before ordering a provisional attachment the Commissioner must form an opinion on the basis of tangible material that the assessee is likely to defeat the demand, if any, and that therefore, it is necessary so to do for the purpose of protecting the interest of the government revenue,” the bench said.It also clarified that the expression “necessary so to do for protecting the government revenue” implicates that it cannot be protected without ordering a provisional attachment.The top court said the Commissioner is duty-bound to deal with the objections to the attachment by passing a reasoned order which must be communicated to the taxable person whose property is attached.The apex court’s judgement came against an order of Himachal Pradesh High Court which dismissed the writ petition instituted under Article 226 of the Constitution challenging orders of provisional attachment.The petitioner Radha Krishan Industries challenged the orders issued on October 28, 2020 by the Joint Commissioner of State Taxes and Excise, Parwanoo in Himachal Pradesh provisionally attaching the appellant’s receivables from its customers.        The provisional attachment was ordered while invoking Section 83 of the Himachal Pradesh Goods and Service Tax Act, 20172 and Rule 159 of Himachal Pradesh Goods and Service Tax Rules, 2017. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/power-to-order-provisional-attachment-of-property-bank-account-draconian-in-nature-sc-241752
21-04-2021||New Delhi||Economic interests cannot override human lives, cut down industrial use of oxygen immediately: HC||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday said that economic interests cannot override human lives and suggested some reduction in steel and petroleum production to divert oxygen to COVID-19 patients.A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said if the lockdown continues then everything would come to a halt and therefore, what would be the need for steel, petrol and diesel during such a situation.“During lockdown, what would be the development,” the court said and asked the Centre why it was waiting till April 22 to ban industrial use of oxygen.“Shortage is now. You have to do it (ban) now. Look into taking some oxygen from steel and petroleum industries. They have big pockets and big lobbies, but tell them if they have to cut production, then they can cut production. Lives have to be saved,” the bench said.The court cited the example of a central government counsel whose father was admitted in hospital and was on oxygen support, but due its scarcity, oxygen was being provided at a reduced pressure to him to conserve it.“Can you ask him to hold on till April 22,” the court asked.It said if nothing was done, then “we are heading for a bigger disaster”.               “We might end up losing nearly a crore of people. Are we willing to accept that,” the bench said.It also suggested increasing the COVID beds in hospitals that have their own oxygen generating capacity.The observations by the bench came after perusing the Centre’s affidavit which said there was presently no gap in oxygen supply to Delhi and that industrial use of oxygen was banned with effect from April 22.The Ministry of Health, represented by Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, told the high court that there has been an inordinate increase of 133 per cent in the projected medical oxygen required, as on April 20, between the initial estimate of 300 metric tonnes and revised estimate of 700 metric tonnes submitted by Delhi. The ministry said all the states, including Delhi, have to rationalise the use of oxygen and prohibit abnormal usage and administering oxygen to the patients who do not clinically require the same. “States have to undertake oxygen consumption monitoring in hospitals including private hospitals and to undertake facility-wise/hospital-wise oxygen inventory mapping and advance planning for timely replenishment so that supply can be efficiently managed,” it said.It said that states of Kerala and Madhya Pradesh have come out with simple guidelines to efficiently manage use of oxygen in view of its scarcity. The Centre also informed the high court that it has provided Delhi government hospitals with around 1,390 ventilators.Earlier in the day, the court had asked the Centre whether oxygen supplied to industries can be diverted for COVID-19 patients.“Industries can wait. Patients cannot. Human lives are at stake,” the bench said.It said it has heard that doctors at Ganga Ram Hospital were being forced to reduce oxygen being given to COVID-19 patients admitted there as there was scarcity of oxygen.The ministry, in the affidavit filed through central government standing counsel Monika Arora, has also said that in order to increase the capacity of medical oxygen in Delhi, eight Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) Oxygen Generation plants are being installed by the support of PM CARES Funds.“These plants would enhance capacity of medical oxygen by 14.4 metric tonnes,” the ministry’s affidavit said.The observations by the bench came during the hearing of a disposed of petition related to COVID-19 tests and the high court revived it on April 19 by noting that the virus has raised its “ugly head” once again and the pandemic is raging with much greater intensity and “it is evident that the healthcare infrastructure is at the stage of imminent collapse”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/economic-interests-cannot-override-human-lives-cut-down-industrial-use-of-oxygen-immediately-hc-241732
21-04-2021||---||Ensure one nation-one price for COVID vaccines: Cong on Centre’s new policy||New Delhi, April 20The Congress on Tuesday questioned the government’s new liberalised COVID vaccine policy for all adults from May 1 saying non-determination of one pricing by the Centre would lead to unhealthy bidding abs profiteering.The policy unveiled yesterday said the Centre would continue to provide free jabs to health, frontline and 45 years plus people at Government vaccine centres but the remaining persons — 18 years plus to under 45 years would need to get the jabs from the open market.“This government keeps talking about one nation one election, one nation one constitution, one nation one ration card. Why not one nation one price for COVID vaccines? Why multiple prices — one for the Centre, one for state governments and one for private hospitals? There should be one uniform price for all segments of vaccines,” Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said today.Former finance minister P Chidambaram, meanwhile, said though the policy required vaccine makers to make an advance declaration of self-certified price for vaccines before May 1, it is unclear how that price would be determined.“There are only two domestic vaccine manufacturers. Will they collude to determine the price? In what transparent formula will the pricing be fixed? This would be anti-competitive and would open doors for unhealthy bidding,” Chidambaram said.The former FM also demanded that the Centre address vaccine needs of every state individually considering the vaccine procurement would exert additional pressures on already cash strapped states.“Under the modified vaccine policy, the states will bear the responsibility and cost of vaccinating the poorer sections who are below the age of 45 years and are neither Health Care workers nor Frontline workers, as defined by the central government. The central government appears to have abdicated its responsibility towards the poor by excluding them from the central government’s vaccination programme. In a country where the median age is 28 years, to leave those who are below the age of 45 years out of a public-funded programme is, to say the least, callous. The migrant workers who live and work in other states and are the lifeblood of the economy of our cities will be the worst affected by this directive,” said Chidambaram.He added that by liberalising the pricing of vaccine, and by not fixing a price for states at the same rate as it is available to the Union Government, the government is paving the way to unhealthy price bidding and profiteering.“States with limited resources will be at a considerable disadvantage. States that are already weighed down by shrinking GST revenues, lower tax devolution, reduced grants-in-aid and increased borrowing would have to bear this additional burden. Meanwhile, nobody knows where the thousands of crores of rupees collected under PM-CARES are being deployed,” the Congress veteran noted calling the news policy regressive and inequitable.The Congress also asked whether any foreign vaccine manufacturer had agreed to export to India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ensure-one-nation-one-price-for-covid-vaccines-cong-on-centres-new-policy-241715
