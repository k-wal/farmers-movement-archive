Agreed to continue discussions in this respect.”    The Ministry of External Affairs said the two ministers discussed the outstanding issues related to disengagement from all friction points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.“The External Affairs Minister conveyed that while the process of disengagement had commenced earlier this year, it remained unfinished. He emphasized that it was necessary that this process be completed at the earliest,” it said in a statement.“Full restoration of peace and tranquility in the border areas would enable progress in the bilateral relationship. The two Ministers agreed to continue further dialogue at the official level on this matter,” the MEA said.India and China reached a five-point agreement to resolve the eastern Ladakh border row during talks between Jaishankar and Wang at a meeting in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meet.The pact included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC                India and China were locked in military standoff at multiple friction points in eastern Ladakh since early May last year. The two sides completed withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of Pangong lake in February following a series of military and diplomatic talks.Both the militaries are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points.There was no visible forward movement in disengagement of troops in the remaining friction points as the Chinese side did not show flexibility in their approach on it at the 11th round of military talks with the Indian Army on April 9.There were also reports of China further strengthening its positions in some of the friction points.About his talks with Wang, the external affairs minister said he also highlighted the importance of supply chains and openness to air flights in these circumstances.“Welcomed his assurances in that regard, as also more openness to Indian chartered flights. Discussed the international cooperation aspects of the public health response to this difficult situation,” he said.There were reports of difficulties being faced by some US firms in sending medical shipments to India from China.Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Thursday said there was an impact on some of the supplies following suspensions flights by Sichuan Airlines.

On behalf of the Chinese Government and people, as well as in my own name, I would like to express sincere sympathies to the Indian Government and people,” according to the message from President Xi to Prime Minister Modi.“The Chinese side stands ready to strengthen cooperation with the Indian side in fighting the pandemic and provide support and help in this regard. I believe that under the leadership of the Indian Government, the Indian people will surely prevail over the pandemic,” Xi said.“Humanity is a community with a shared future. Only through solidarity and cooperation can countries around the world ultimately defeat the pandemic,” the Chinese president said.India on Friday logged 3,86,452 new coronavirus infections, the highest single-day rise so far, pushing the total tally of COVID-19 cases to 1,87,62,976, while active cases crossed the 31-lakh mark. The death toll increased to 2,08,330 with 3,498 new fatalities.On Thursday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi promised to do the utmost in supporting India’s fight against the COVID-19 surge and said that anti-pandemic materials produced in China were entering India at a faster pace.In his letter to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Wang said that the Chinese side “shares empathy for the challenges facing India and expresses sincere sympathy”.“The coronavirus is the common enemy of mankind, and the international community needs solidarity and coordination for a concerted response. The Chinese side firmly supports the Indian Government and people in fighting the pandemic,” he wrote in the letter.Wang said that anti pandemic materials produced in China are entering India at a faster pace to help India fight the epidemic.The messages from President Xi and Foreign Minister Wang to Prime Minister Modi and External Affairs Minister Jaishankar came amidst  tensions along the disputed border between India and China.The militaries of the two countries are yet to agree on disengagement from the remaining areas of eastern Ladakh after the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of Pangong Lake in February following a series of military and diplomatic talks.The two sides are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points.Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told media briefing here on Friday that China has exported 26,000 ventilators and oxygen generators to India this month. Since April, China has exported more than 26,000 ventilators and oxygen generators, more than 15,000 medical monitors, and nearly 3,800 tonnes of medical materials and medicines to India, he said in response to a question.China’s relevant anti-epidemic materials and medical equipment companies are working hard and working around the clock to speed up production, he said.He also said cargo flights to India are in smooth operation. In the recent two weeks, multiple flights have been conducted from China to India, he said.On April 26, state-run Sichuan Airlines, which operates 11 cargo flights to India has suspended causing disruption of procurement of oxygen concentrators by private companies to from India to augment supplies. After media reports, the airline has retracted its decision and said it is working out a new plan to resume the services.But so far it has not announced any new schedule.China reported the first COVID-19 case in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and since then the deadly disease has become a pandemic, affecting more than 150,618,000 people and over 3,168,500 deaths worldwide. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-president-xi-jinping-writes-to-pm-modi-offers-help-to-fight-covid-19-surge-246378

30-04-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||Four-point narrative to counter India’s Covid handling||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 30The Government has framed a four-point narrative to work its way out of a second and more devastating wave of Covid-19 that has forced the country to seek help from every available avenue and reversed its claim of being the pharma factory of the world.While diplomatic missions have been actively trying to counter the avalanche of criticism about Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the foreign media, the Government’s narrative provides them with enough ammunition to frame a coherent narrative, said sources.The first point is that the second wave is especially vicious because of the highly infectious double mutant. As a result, the health system got overwhelmed, which is not unusual and this state of affairs will not last long. The situation is quite similar to the health systems of advanced American and European economies that got similarly swamped at certain inflexion points last year.The second is that the country does not really suffer from oxygen shortage, but the problem is that its main consumption and production centers during the second wave are located in different parts of the country and affected by logistical issues. The emergency imports of oxygen generating equipment will bridge the gap till the logistical issues are sorted out. This was most recently articulated by Health Minister Harsh Vardhan when he said there is no shortage of oxygen in the country.The third is about the situation regarding Covid vaccines and life-saving injections. Here too, India needs help to fill the temporary shortfall in Remdesivir injections because of the sudden and steep rise in the number of patients. Indian companies are producing 60,000 injections against the current demand of 3-4 lakh injections. Imports are required till Indian companies ramp up production to the current demand. Similarly vaccine production would now get a boost from the raw material being sent from the US Government’s stocks while New Delhi will meet the “temporary’’ gap with imports from an array of countries.The fourth point is that the aid pouring in from overseas does not mean a shift in India’s position about being self reliant during national disasters. While previous calamities such as the Tsunami were highly localised and affected only a part of India, the second Covid wave has hit the most populous parts of the country. This was articulated by Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla who described the current situation as “very very unusual’’ and said this was not the time for looking at things from a policy point of view.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/four-point-narrative-to-counter-indias-covid-handling-246372

30-04-2021||New Delhi||COVID going to tier 2, 3 cities, rural docs must be trained: AIIMS chief||AIIMS New Delhi chief Randeep Guleria on Friday said COVID 19 was now entering tier 2 and 3 cities and it had become essential to train even village doctors in handling the disease.The government on Friday tasked 14 regional centres of excellence including AIIMS New Delhi, PGI Chandigarh, JIPMER Puducherry and AIIMS Bhubaneshwar and Bhopal to conduct training of government and private doctors across smaller towns and even villages in the management of COVID, a new disease.The Centre also issued guidelines on the management of COVID in children with more and more infections being seen in those under 18 years.Guleria also said it was crucial to reduce cases and appealed to people to launch “break the chain movement” by gifting masks to those who are not complying and also by preventing crowding.Health infrastructure can work to a limit but is cases continue to rise like this, the situation will become very challenging, the AIIMS chief warned.He said the second wave's rate of rise has been too rapid for the health infrastructure to cope and doubling rate of cases has reduced drastically.“Going forward, proper management of COVID is key. The pandemic is going to tier 2, 3 cities. Training of doctors is needed to handle the new disease. The Ministry has formed 14 regional centres of excellence at 14 locations to conduct mentoring of doctors in COVID training so that everyone is ready to manage the infection when it strikes,” Guleria said today.He asked everyone to avoid misuse of drugs after Health Ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal revealed evidence of a hospital found administering plasma, tocilizumab and Remdesivir simultaneously to a patient potentially endangering his life.“People think Remdesivir and steroids will help. These are not needed.  COVID 19 has two phases – the first is when the virus spreads in the body causing fever and congestion. Sometimes when it spreads to lungs, oxygen falls and anti viral drugs are given. The second phase is when the immune system fails, and body inflames. That is when steroids are needed. If given early, steroids can promote viral replication which is already on in the first phase. Regional Centres of Excellence will train even rural doctors in COVID management,” said Guleria.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-going-to-tier-2-3-cities-rural-docs-must-be-trained-aiims-chief-246366
30-04-2021||New Delhi||HCs should avoid unnecessary, off-the-cuff remarks: SC||High courts should avoid making unnecessary and “off-the-cuff remarks” during hearings as they may have serious ramifications, the Supreme Court said on Friday.The apex court’s advice came during hearings on COVID-19 related pleas after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, appearing for the Centre and the Bihar government respectively, said that such remarks gave the impression as if authorities were doing nothing.The high courts of Madras and Delhi have been very critical, making strong observations against the Centre and various authorities for the way they have been handling the severe second wave of COVID-19.A Bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud, hearing the suo motu case on COVID-19 management in the country, took note of the submissions of the Centre and Bihar government and cautioned restraint to high courts.“Even when we are criticising a judgement of a high court, we do not say exactly what is in our heart and we exercise a degree of restraint. We would only expect that as freedom has been given to the high courts to deal with these issues, certain of-the-cuff remarks, which are not necessary may be avoided,” said the Bench which also comprised Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat.Government officials, including those who are COVID-19 infected, are working tirelessly to deal with the pandemic situation, the lawyers said.Castigating officers on duty is “very demoralising”, Kumar said.The Bench said judges also know that this is a new time where, every word said by them become part of social media.“All we can say that we expect a degree of respect and restraint”, the Bench said.The top court said particularly, in sensitive matters, it tended to exercise some caution and restraint.“It is not because we are fearful of our remarks. Of course, we are independent. It is only because of the serious ramifications which off-the-cuff remarks about private citizens may have,” Justice Chandrachud said.“Sometimes judges make some observations to elicit proper response from lawyers, which should not be considered as those remarks against anyone,” it said.The Bench said when judges say something in court, it is only to elicit information and response from lawyers so as to enable an open dialogue.“It is not the conclusion on anything, it is only to test the hypothesis of the lawyer and the other side”, it said.Sometimes, high court judges are stressed about local conditions and at times, they may make strong remarks, the Bench said, adding but “we must not be so fragile as to get offended by them”.

30-04-2021|| Hyderabad||Telangana gets go ahead to transport COVID vaccines by drones||Vaccines may soon be delivered with the help of drones in Telangana after the state received permission for deployment of drones to conduct experimental delivery of COVID-19 vaccines within Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) Range.  According to the objective of the project, once tested and if it succeeds this will result in faster vaccine delivery and improved healthcare access by ensuring primary healthcare delivery at the citizen's doorstep.

The nine members head their own committees or departments involved in fighting the pandemic.“The CM has constituted a new Team-9 for effective management of COVID-19 and related work. This team will directly report to the CM and carry out important work in different fields,” a government spokesperson said.It will take policy decisions and ensure their implementation, giving reports directly to the chief minister, he said.The members include the state’s Medical Education Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna, whose group will work on vaccinations, and the availability of hospital beds and human resources.

30-04-2021||New Delhi||Treat available oxygen as critical commodity: Centre to states||The Centre on Friday said it has asked the states to treat the available oxygen as a critical commodity and undertake an oxygen-consumption audit at all hospitals, including private ones, amid a shortage of the life-saving gas in several parts of the country.Addressing a press conference, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Lav Agrawal said from the start of the pandemic, the government had identified oxygen-supported beds as major clinical interventions.   He said the government had procured 1,02,400 oxygen cylinders at the national level in April-May 2020 and distributed those among the states.“We have requested the states to treat the available oxygen as a critical commodity and also to ensure a rational use of oxygen,” Agrawal said.Listing out the steps taken by the Centre to augment the supply of oxygen, he said the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) has issued instructions for fixing the price of liquid medical oxygen.Agrawal said 162 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants of 154-MT capacity each have been sanctioned across the country. Of these, 52 plants are already installed, 87 have been delivered and work to commission these plants at the earliest is on.The PSA plants can enable hospitals for in-situ generation of oxygen.Agrawal said the states have been allotted 8,593 MT of oxygen.“An order for 1,27,000 oxygen cylinders was placed on April 21 and the deliveries are expected to start in a couple of days. These include 54,000 jumbo cylinders (D type) and 73,000 regular cylinders (B type).“Additionally, 551 PSA plants have been sanctioned to be implemented by the Union health ministry. These plants will be installed in different public health facilities,” he added.The states have been advised to ensure a rational use of oxygen, prohibit abnormal use by monitoring non-closure of valve during no-use, stop unnecessary oxygen administration to patients who may not require it clinically and for monitoring private health facilities that indulge in pushing oxygen cylinders as part of home-based COVID care packages, Agrawal said.In the second wave of the pandemic, the rate of rise of the infection has been rapid, which has put an immense strain on the health infrastructure. The doubling of COVID-19 cases has also been rapid, which should ease if the turnover time reduces, he added.The pandemic is spreading to tier-2 and tier-3 cities, so it is very important to train doctors about treating this new disease, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said while underlining that misuse of drugs like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab has to be avoided.

The drug has also proved to be safe on liver and kidney parameters, it said.“Clevira, an antiviral formulation, has received regulatory approval as a supportive treatment for mild to moderate COVID-19 cases,” the Chennai-based pharmaceutical company said.“Clevira was developed primarily to treat dengue patients in 2017. Last year, as the COVID-19 cases surged in the country, it was repurposed as supportive treatment for mild to moderate coronavirus symptoms. The product is available across India and is priced at Rs 11 per tablet,” the company said.A clinical trial was conducted on 100 people in May-June last year and the results were “promising”, it said.The selected 100 participants were randomised into two groups with 50 patients each during the 30 day-trial conducted at Government Medical College Omandurar and Government Estate in Chennai after approval from the Tamil Nadu government.The control group comprised patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and received standard care treatment as per hospital regulation as well as the WHO/Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines.The test group patients also received Clevira tablets twice daily orally after food for 14 days.“It was found that Clevira significantly reduced the time taken for clinical recovery, which was noted in terms of reduction in pyrexia or body pain, normalisation of the respiratory rate (less than 24/minute) and improvement in oxygen saturation level (more than 94 per cent),” the company said.Besides 86 per cent of patients tested negative for the infection on (day 5) and 100 per cent of patients turned out to be COVID-19 RT-PCR test negative on (day 10) after consuming Clevira tablets.The clinical trial results were submitted to the Tamil Nadu government, ICMR and the Ministry of AYUSH in 2020.“After rigorous scrutiny and deliberations, the drug got approval to be used as a supporting measure for treating mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms by the Ministry of AYUSH regulators, a first-of-its-kind approval in India through various stages of scrutiny at the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) and the Interdisciplinary Technical Review Committee (ITRC),” the company said.C Arthur Paul, Manager International Business, Apex Laboratories, said, “The antiviral drug increases the white blood cell (WBC), platelet and lymphocyte counts significantly within the normal range apart from reducing the viral load, hence the recovery from all signs and symptoms is much faster.”   Significant reduction in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) is evident that the drug elicits anti-inflammatory property, he said.“Clevira is proven effective as an analgesic, antipyretic and reversal of thrombocytopenia. It is absolutely safe for people with liver or kidney ailments and can be safely co-administered with other drugs. It can also be used as a prophylactic treatment for primary contacts of COVID-19 positive patients and frontline healthcare workers,” the official noted.The drug is recommended for all age groups from the age of 2 years, Paul added.The company said the drug is available across India.

Two trains, one from Rourkela to Haryana carrying 47.11 MT LMO in 3 tankers and another one from Angul to Haryana carrying 32 MT in 2 tankers are on their way to their destinations. These trains will deliver much needed oxygen supply to the residents of Haryana in a safe and timely manner.”According to the Railways, Madhya Pradesh would receive its second Oxygen Express carrying 47.37 MT LMO from Bokaro to Sagar and Jabalpur in four tankers. “Train started from Bokaro on 29 April 2021 and is currently moving uninterrupted towards its destination. Train is expected to reach its destination by today evening,” it added.Noting that Uttar Pradesh has continuously been replenishing its Oxygen supply, it said the state will receive its seventh Oxygen Express, which is expected to start shortly from Bokaro carrying three tankers of LMO. “In order to further boost up the oxygen supply, the UP government has also requested to transport 10 feet ISO containers loaded with Liquid Oxygen from Jamshedpur to Lucknow,” it said.Advance and additional planning are required to transport ISO containers and Railways Officials are currently working on the best possible options to move ISO containers safely and securely, it said, adding that it is expected that ISO containers carrying liquid medical oxygen would start loading on May 1, 2021, at Jamshedpur.So far, the Indian Railways has delivered more than 664 MT of LMO to Maharashtra (174 MT), Uttar Pradesh (356.47 MT), Madhya Pradesh (64 MT) and Delhi (70 MT).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/more-oxygen-expresses-on-way-to-haryana-mp-telangana-up-indian-railways-246344
30-04-2021||New Delhi||Adopt cooperative attitude, SC tells Delhi govt in getting medicines, oxygen supply to COVID-19 patients||Amid an ongoing blame game between the Centre and the Delhi government over shortage of oxygen for hospitals in the national capital, the Supreme Court on Friday asked the AAP government to adopt a cooperative attitude in getting essential medicines and oxygen supply to COVID-19 patients.“Please adopt a cooperative attitude at the time of a human crisis. A spirit of dialogue... Politics is during elections and not at the present situation,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud told the Delhi government counsel.The Bench, however, noted that the Centre had a special responsibility with regard to needs of citizens of Delhi.“Delhi represents the nation and there is hardly any one ethnically Delhiite. Forget about someone not lifting oxygen. You have to push through since you have to save lives... You have a special responsibility as the Centre,” Justice Chandrachud told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.“As a national authority which has a responsibility to the national capital you are answerable to citizens,” the Bench—which also included Justice LN Rao and Justice SR Bhat—told Mehta.“We have told the Centre how it has a special responsibility towards Delhi...but we need to send a message to the highest levels of your government that in this humanitarian crisis we don’t want lives to be lost in political bickering... interact with the Centre...ask your Chief Secretary to speak with the Solicitor General,” the Bench told senior advocate Rahul Mehra who represented the Delhi government.“It will be followed in letter and spirit,” Mehra assured the Bench.Mehra said “What has fallen from you (SC) will be respected.”The top court had last week taken suo motu cognisance of the COVID-19 management and asked the Centre to present a national plan to deal with the health crisis with regard to supply of oxygen and essential drugs, method of vaccination and lockdown.The Bench said the government should not leave vaccine pricing and distribution to manufacturers.It sought to know why the Centre was not buying 100 per cent of COVID-19 vaccine doses as it was better placed to determine equity and disbursement.“Why can’t the Centre follow the national immunization program policy with respect to COVID-19 vaccines?” it asked.Noting that vaccine manufacturing was publicly funded and hence vaccines became ‘public goods’, it wondered why the Centre can’t buy full doses of COVID-19 vaccines.“Why shouldn’t the court issue directions under Section 100 and Section 92 of the Patents Act to enable generics to manufacture COVID-19 drugs without the fear of legal action?” it asked.After a prolonged hearing, the Bench said, “We will issue a slew of interim directions which will govern the scene for the next 10 days...We will formulate a proper order. It is about important policy changes that Centre needs to consider.”Noting that the order will be dictated in the evening and uploaded on its website tomorrow morning,” the Bench listed the matter for further hearing on May 10.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/adopt-cooperative-attitude-sc-tells-delhi-govt-in-getting-medicines-oxygen-supply-to-covid-19-patients-246343

Casinos will also remain shut. However, industrial activities will be allowed to function,” Chief Minister Pramod Sawant had said while announcing the curbs on Wednesday.Vaccination centres will function normally during the period, he had said.The Indian Medical Association’s Goa unit on Friday demanded that the lockdown be continued for 15 days or at least till positivity rate drops to 10 per cent.“We wish the lockdown is extended by another 15 days or more to have the Break the Chain effect which will definitely help in making the COVID-19 graph go in a downward trend,” IMA Goa president Vinayak Buvaji said in a letter to the chief minister.Goa has so far recorded 88,028 COVID-19 cases and 1,146 deaths. As on April 29, the tiny coastal state had 20,898 active cases.On Wednesday, the state had reported 3,101 COVID-19 cases, while on Tuesday, the daily count was 2,110.

30-04-2021||New Delhi||Facebook to roll out vaccine finder tool on mobile app in India||Facebook on Friday said it is partnering with the Indian government to roll out a vaccine finder tool on its mobile app in India, which will help people identify places nearby to get inoculated. The social media giant had, earlier this week, announced a US$ 10 million grant for emergency response efforts for COVID-19 situation in the country. "Partnering with the Government of India, Facebook will begin rolling out its Vaccine Finder tool on the Facebook mobile app in India available in 17 languages to help people identify places nearby to get the vaccine," Facebook said in a post on the platform.In this tool, vaccine centre locations and their hours of operation have been provided by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW). The cumulative number of COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in the country has crossed 15.22 crore. Also, more than 2.45 crore people have registered themselves on the Co-WIN digital platform ahead of the Phase-3 of the COVID-19 vaccination for those above 18 years that is set to start from May 1.Facebook said its tool will also show walk-in options (for 46 years and above) and a link to register on the Co-Win website and schedule vaccination appointment. The massive rise in infections in the second wave of the pandemic has led to hospitals in several states reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds. Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have emerged as a lifeline, connecting those looking for oxygen cylinders, hospital beds, plasma donors, and ventilators with possible donors. Facebook said it is partnering with organisations such as United Way, Swasth, Hemkunt Foundation, I Am Gurgaon, Project Mumbai and US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) to deploy the funds announced to help augment critical medical supplies with over 5,000 oxygen concentrators and other life-saving equipment like ventilators, BiPAP machines and to increase hospital bed capacity. The company is also supporting NGOs and UN agencies in the country with ad credits and insights to reach the majority of people on Facebook with COVID-19 vaccine and preventive health information.    The platform is also providing health resources to people from UNICEF India about when to seek emergency care and how to manage mild COVID-19 symptoms at home. "The information is accessible and prominent on Facebook's COVID-19 Information Center and in Feed. On Instagram, we are promoting this information via Guides in Explore," it noted.Twitter too has set up a COVID-19 SOS page that helps surface information from those offering or seeking immediate help during this crisis. "We have also built a series of Twitter Moments to help you get the facts from the most reliable sources, because we know not all the information you see on the service is credible. These dedicated Moments about vaccine safety, how to stay safe and more, include detailed and accredited information from organisations like the MoHFW and World Health Organization, among others," it added. Twitter is also expanding its efforts to surface credible COVID-19 information with home Timeline prompts featuring the latest information about COVID-19 vaccines in English and Hindi. This, it said, will help those looking for up-to-date, localised information about vaccine safety, vaccine eligibility and other details.Twitter said it is currently matching 'Tweep' donations at 300 per cent organisations including Oxfam India, Akshay Patra Foundation, Child Rights and You and Rise Against Hunger India. It has made a separate US$ 100,000 donation to Hemkunt Foundation to support their work in donating oxygen cylinders.

30-04-2021||Nagpur||Isolation hitting mental health of COVID-19 patients: Experts||Undergoing treatment in isolation without the presence of family members or loved ones can leave a negative impact on the mental health of COVID-19 patients as they may lose hope of recovering from the illness, medical experts feel.They say that the presence of family members and regular interaction with them should be made an integral part of the coronavirus treatment standards as it has a therapeutic effect on the patients."Not permitting close family members to stay with or visit COVID-19 patients is cruel and inhumane, as infected persons often lose hope of recovering when they feel they are struggling alone," said Dr Indrajit Khandekar of Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (MGIMS) in Wardha.He said that relatives who wish to stay with their loved ones, who are suffering from coronavirus, should be allowed to do so by wearing masks."The presence of close relatives and regular interaction of patients' family with doctors and nurses should be an integral part of the treatment standards," he said.Interacting with the loved ones can be extremely therapeutic for patients and can give them the desire to survive in most difficult situations, he said.Dr Khandekar further explained that some patients, who are unable to carry out their routine activities, such as eating, drinking and answering nature's call, need constant help and moral support, which only a family member can give.It is not possible for healthcare workers to look after each and every patient personally and provide help 24/7, he said.Speaking about the point raised by Dr Khandekar, assistant professor of psychiatry at AIIMS Nagpur, Dr Sonakshi Jyrwa, said one needs to adopt a 'balanced approach' while treating COVID-19 patients.At AIIMS Nagpur, a team of mental health professionals screen all patients post admission, counsel and provide them moral and psychological support they need, while a dedicated team engages with their family, updates them about their clinical status and counsels them, she said.Such interventions have been found to be effective under present circumstances, she said.While in case of critical patients or those with high support needs, the hospital may permit caregivers who are infected with coronavirus, which includes family members with mild symptoms, to be admitted in the same ward, Dr Jyrwa said.Apart from this, the inherent risk of infection, besides the requirement of additional resources, such as PPE kits, and the training, monitoring and assistance of family members to ensure its effective use, in an overburdened healthcare system will be a challenge, she said."Finding a balanced approach is the key. Every healthcare organisation must prepare policies that are patient/family-centric that does not strain and impede the effective functioning of hospitals during the pandemic," Dr Jywra said.

30-04-2021||New Delhi||Sorabjee was champion of freedom of press, committed to democratic value: CJI Ramana||Chief Justice NV Ramana on Friday condoled the passing away of eminent jurist and former attorney general Soli Sorabjee saying he had “deep commitment to democratic values” and was a champion of “freedom of press”.The CJI, in a statement, expressed shock over the demise of the legal luminary and said, “In his nearly 68-year long association with the judicial world, he made immeasurable contribution in enriching the global jurisprudence of Human Rights and Fundamental Rights.”             Justice Ramana said the matters Sorabjee had argued before the courts, the judgments he could secure as well as “the books, essays, papers of international repute and the newspaper articles that he had authored; the independent opinions he could tender to the government in his capacity as the Attorney General – they all stand testimony to his deep commitment to democratic values”.Sorabjee not only lived up to the mandate of Attorney General as enshrined in the Constitution but also raised the bar in discharge of his constitutional duties, the CJI said.“Being a champion of ‘Freedom of Press’, he effectively used the media as a platform to elucidate the nuances of complicated legal issues on almost daily basis till recently, literally giving lessons of law to millions of common people who otherwise could not have followed what was happening in the judicial world. His ability to adapt to the new trends in media was remarkable,” he said.The CJI further said that he personally gained immensely from reading Sorabjee’s literary works, listening to his lectures and arguments and his “sagacious guidance and advise”.“His humane and compassionate approach defined his legal work. He will be remembered as a legend who added strength to the pillars of democracy. I pay my humble tributes to the departed soul. I convey heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and countless fans of Shri Soli Sorabjee, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Supreme Court of India where he will continue to command respect forever,” the CJI said in the statement.          Sorabjee, 91, who is survived by wife, a daughter and two sons, passed away on Friday morning after getting infected with COVID-19. He was admitted to a private hospital in south Delhi. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sorabjee-was-champion-of-freedom-of-press-committed-to-democratic-value-cji-ramana-246319

30-04-2021||New York||US denies issuing new guidance to Americans to leave India||The US State Department has denied that it has issued new guidance to American citizens in India to leave the country as reported by some media.Department Spokesperson Ned Price said on Thursday that there has been "some misreporting, perhaps a misperception, that we provided revised guidance to private American citizens in India. That is not true."He clarified that the department had only reissued a routine travel advisory for India that also applies to "80 per cent of the countries."He said, "There was a 'pro forma' reissuance of the travel advisory, the Level 4 travel advisory that had previously been in effect, given Covid (is) not only in India but also globally as well." "I believe 80 per cent of countries around the world– are now at Level 4 Travel Advisories," he said."So when it comes to our guidance to Americans in India, that did not change. What did change was the ability of American (diplomatic) family members to depart India on a voluntary basis should they choose to do so," he explained.Price also said that a notification by the State Department approving voluntary departure of family members of US government employees in India did not amount to requiring them to leave the country.He clarified that the "'authorised departure' doesn't force anyone to leave; it doesn't require anyone to leave. It gives these family members the option to depart if they wish. Departure, again, is not required." Asked if the US considered stopping all flights from India, Price said that decision "is something that is determined in close coordination and under the advice of public health professionals at CDC (Centres for Disease Control) and HHS (Department of Health and Human Services).The CDC has four levels of Covid-19 risk assessment for countries, ranging from Level 1 "low" to Level 4 "very high." India is one of about 135 countries currently on CDC's Level 4 list which includes most developed countries like Britain, the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark.The countries in the other three less riskier levels are almost all developing nations with the exception of a few like Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and Iceland.The Smart Traveler Enrollment Programme (STEP) notification issued on Wednesday that Price referred to said that "US citizens who wish to depart India should take advantage of available commercial transportation options," but did not say they should leave as claimed in some media reports."Citing the CDC's Level 4 Travel Health Notice for India due to Covid-19, notification said, "Do not travel to India due to Covid-19. Exercise increased caution due to crime and terrorism." IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-denies-issuing-new-guidance-to-americans-to-leave-india-246306

PTITo ensure smooth supplies, no visas will be applicable for the crew of two special US flights that will land on Friday morning.

We are looking at it in terms of a situation that is very unusual, that is unprecedented, that is exceptional and we will do whatever it takes to meet the requirements of our people.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-40-countries-to-help-india-fight-covid-shringla-246150

30-04-2021||Shubhadeep Choudhury||TMC in Bengal, BJP in Assam: Exit polls||Tribune News ServiceKolkata, April 29Two major survey agencies projected Trinamool Congress’ victory in West Bengal as the exit poll results started streaming in following the conclusion of the final phase of voting in West Bengal on Thursday.While the exit poll predicted retention of power by the LDF in Kerala, lady luck seem to be shining on MK Stalin with the DMK set to bag majority in Tamil Nadu.Times Now-CVoter predicted 158 seats for the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress, 115 for the BJP and 19 seats for the Sanjukta Morcha.The Republic-CNX gave 138-148 seats to the BJP, 128-138 toTMC and 11-21 seats to Sanjukta Morcha. ABP-CVoter gave 152-164 seats to the TMC, 109-121 to BJP and 14-25 to Sanjukta Morcha.In the 294-member West Bengal Assembly, 148 seats are required to attain simple majority. While predicting victory to the TMC, all three exit poll predicted over 100 seats for the BJP that had secured only three seats in the last Assembly elections in 2016.In the event of TMC having only a slender majority over the BJP, the latter might persuade some newly elected TMC legislators to switch sides and join the BJP, thus enabling the saffron party to form its maiden government in the state.In Tamil Nadu, Republic-CNX predicted 160-170 seats for the DMK and 58-68 for the AIADMK. ABP-CVoter gave 160-172 seats to the DMK and 58-60 to the AIADMK.According to ABP-CVoter, the LDF will retain power in Kerala by wining 71-77 seats in the 140-member Assembly. The UDF will secure 62-68 seats, while the BJP could get up to two seats.While AajTak-Axis and Chanakya predicted comfortable victory for the incumbent BJP-led NDA in Assam, ABP-CVoter foresaw neck-and-neck fight between the NDA and Congress-led Grand Alliance for the 126-member Assembly.If Republic-CNX is to be believed, the NDA might get 16-19 seats and Congress-led SDA 11-13 in the 30-member Puducherry Assembly. ABP-CVoter gave NDA 19-23 seats.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-in-bengal-bjp-in-assam-exit-polls-246130

We have placed orders for 67 lakh doses.”About three lakh are expected by May 3.Several private hospitals also said they would have to delay vaccinations for people whose second doses were due as stocks were running thin.In reply to a procurement request from Dr Aqsa Sheikh, in-charge of private vaccination centre at Hamdard University, the SII wrote back, “Due to our current obligations to meet the government‘s existing requirement and meet additional demand emanating from state governments under the liberalised and accelerated vaccine policy, it is challenging to meet independently the requirement from a large number of private hospitals. Therefore, we urge you to access the vaccines once these become available via the private marker supply channels which would take about five to six months from now.”The Centre for its part denied shortages of vaccine supplies and said 16,16,86,140 doses had been sent free to states and UTs, of which 15,10,77,933 had been consumed as of today and 1,06,08,207 doses were yet to be utilised.Revised norms for home isolationNew cases 3,79,257Deaths in 24 hrs 3,645Disease burden 1.83 crGovt recommends Ayush 64The Ministry of Ayush has recommended it for mild to moderate symptoms||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-await-supply-private-clinics-flag-crunch-for-second-dose-246132

PTI“We’ve already had loss of lives in Delhi due to oxygen…. You have to meet oxygen demand head-on and you can’t duck it,” a Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.Noting that the projected demand of Delhi was 700 MT a day while its allocation was only 480-490 MT a day, the Bench refused to accept Mehta’s submission that the incoming quantity of 340-370 MT to Delhi was sufficient.It wondered how Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra got 543 MT and 1661 MT against the demand of 445 MT and 1500 MT, respectively.The Centre had to either show some justification for this or make amends now that the situation had been brought to its attention, it said, posting the matter for further hearing on Friday.Mehta said the Centre would give the reasons for giving more oxygen to MP and Maharashtra. Noting that it’s a “dynamic situation”, Mehta said the court should trust the system.Producing a chart of oxygen demand by several states and the allocations made to them, senior advocate Rahul Mehra – representing Delhi Government – pointed out that only Delhi was not being given what it was asking for. Others were getting more than or close to what they were asking for, he added.Mehra urged the court to direct the Centre to provide 1K MT oxygen, saying beds alone can’t save Covid-19 patients.Meanwhile, the Delhi Government told the HC that it had withdrawn the order to create Covid-19 facilities for judges, staff and their families in a five-star hotel here.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-madhya-pradesh-maharashtra-oxygen-quota-exceeded-demand-delhi-plea-ignored-hc-246134

"There are states which received less than what they had asked for…The kitty is being rationalised,” he said, requesting the court not to get into pan-India allocation.Noting that it’s a “dynamic situation”, Mehta said the court should trust the system.Producing a chart of oxygen demand by several states and the allocations made to them, senior advocate Rahul Mehra – representing Delhi Government – pointed out that only Delhi was not being given what it was asking for.

30-04-2021||Pune||India will need 5 lakh ICU beds, 3.5 lakh medical staff in next few weeks, says leading surgeon||Forecasting that the Covid pandemic is only going to get worse, noted surgeon Dr Devi Prasad Shetty has said that India will need an extra 5 lakh ICU beds, 2 lakh nurses and 1.5 lakh doctors in the next few weeks, and also suggested radical solutions to meet the challenge.At present, India has only 75,000 to 90,000 ICU beds and almost all are already occupied - when the second wave of the pandemic hasn't even reached its peak yet, he said.India is reporting about 3.5 lakh cases a day, and experts say the number could go up to 5 lakh cases daily at its peak.While most of the newspaper headlines and prime time television coverage has been over the lack of oxygen for the patients in ICUs, "I am having sleepless nights for the next headline, which is going to be that patients are dying in ICUs because there are no nurses and doctors to take care of them," he said."And this is going to happen. I do not doubt it now," said Dr Shetty, the chairman and founder of Narayana Health, a chain of 21 medical centres in India, in his online address at the Symbiosis Golden Jubilee Lecture Series in Pune recently.He pointed out that for every patient who tests positive, there are five to 10 people who are positive but not tested. That means more than 15 to 20 lakh people are getting infected every day in India even now. Statistically, five per cent of the positive patients need an ICU bed, irrespective of their age. On an average, a patient in ICU spends at least 10 days there."So you can just imagine what the scenario is. Know what we need to do? We need to create at least five lakh additional ICU beds in the next few weeks," he said."Unfortunately, beds do not treat patients. We need nurses, doctors and paramedics in that order," he said, pointing out that managing Covid patients successfully in ICUs depends mostly on nurses, not doctors.Even before the start of the pandemic, government hospitals across the country had a shortage of 78 per cent of medical specialists."Now, we need to produce at least two lakh nurses and at least one and a half lakh doctors in the next few weeks who are dedicated to managing Covid for the next one year. Because the current pandemic is likely to last for about four to five months. And then we should be prepared for the third wave," he said.Dr Shetty then proceeded to provide out-of-the-box solutions for meeting that need. He said India has about 2.2 lakh nursing students who have finished their three-year GNM (General Nursing and Midwifery) or four-year BSc courses in various nursing schools and colleges across the country who are preparing for their exam scheduled to take place in the next few weeks.He suggested that the Ministry of Health, along with the Indian Nursing Council, should consider these students as graduates and deploy them to work in Covid ICU wards for one year, after which they will be given graduation certificates.They could also be given preference over others in government jobs, he said."Take the approach of drafting for the armed forces when there is an impending war with the enemy country ... This is not peacetime. It is wartime."If that is done, I am convinced most of these girls and boys will join the fight against Covid. The battle cannot be won by doctors of my age. No war can be fought by people of my age. You need young people. Most of them are vaccinated and they are naturally in a better position to fight Covid in case they get it.He said there are also 1.3 lakh young doctors today, working not in Covid ICUs but preparing for NEET exams to get into post-graduate courses where only 35,000 positions are available. An online test for NEET should be conducted immediately and results declared in a few days.After allowing the 35,000 seats, there will still be one lakh young doctors who are left out, who didn't get the PG seats. They should be offered a chance during the next year's PG selection if they work in the Covid ICU for one year, he said.Additionally, there are about 25,000 doctors who have finished their postgraduate training and haven't yet appeared for the exam. This batch of medical specialists should be told that they can skip the exam and get the degree provided they work in the Covid ICUs for one year, he suggested.Also, there are between 90,000 and one lakh doctors who graduated from overseas universities who haven't been able to pass a national entrance exam. "Identify 20,000 brightest of these kids and ask them to work in Covid ICU for one year for getting a permanent registration," he said. "If we can do this successfully in the next few weeks, believe me, we would have conquered the Covid battle.Otherwise, the consequences can be very very very serious, mainly because just admitting a patient to a Covid ICU and giving him oxygen is not going to save his life," he concluded."When the oxygen drops, they need proning. And somebody has to monitor their blood gases. All this is done by nurses and junior doctors."The current doctors and nurses who are taking care of Covid patients across the country have done a fantastic job during the first wave. Now they are tired. They are fed up. They are burnt out. A number of them are getting infected."Unless we create a parallel workforce for Covid ICUs, believe me, there can be a problem," he said.He acknowledged that all his speculation about the number of Covid patients and the estimate of ICU beds needed might be wrong."But what if I am right and it is too late," he said.

30-04-2021||New Delhi||Facebook 'mistakenly' blocked posts calling for Modi to resign||Social media giant Facebook on Thursday said it had temporarily blocked a hashtag calling for the Prime Minister's resignation "by mistake" and that it wasn't done on government orders.The development comes amid reports that social media companies are being asked to remove posts that are critical of the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic."We temporarily blocked this hashtag by mistake, not because the Indian government asked us to, and have since restored it," a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement.According to reports, a hashtag calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi was briefly blocked on Facebook on Wednesday. Users searching the hashtag were given a message that said such posts were "temporarily hidden here" because "some content in those posts goes against our Community Standards".India is registering a record number of COVID-19 cases daily that has put extreme pressure on the healthcare infrastructure of the country.The massive rise in infections in the second wave of the pandemic has led to hospitals in several states reeling under a severe shortage of medical oxygen and beds.Social media timelines are filled with SOS calls with people looking for oxygen cylinders, hospital beds, plasma donors and ventilators. Organisations across the spectrum have come forward to support the fight against the COVID pandemic.Recently, Twitter and other social media platforms removed about 100 posts and URLs after the government asked them to remove content that was critical of the handling of the current medical crisis or spreading fake news around the pandemic.Reports citing Lumen database, an independent research project studying cease and desist letters concerning online content, suggested that more than 50 posts - including those by a Member of Parliament, MLA and filmmakers - were removed by Twitter on government request.Government sources had said the social media platforms were asked to remove the posts and URLs (uniform resource locators) to "prevent obstructions in the fight against the pandemic" and disruption of public order due to the said posts.They had added that the order was issued in view of the misuse of social media platforms by certain users to spread fake or misleading information and create panic about the pandemic in the society "by using unrelated, old and out of the context images or visuals, communally sensitive posts and misinformation about COVID-19 protocols".

30-04-2021||New Delhi||RSS 'upset' with Modi over handling of Covid situation?||At a time when the Narendra Modi government is facing all-round flak for "leading India into the Covid catastrophe", it appears that the BJP's ideological fountainhead, the RSS, is "upset" with the way the situation is being "handled" by party leaders and becoming increasingly "uncomfortable" over the "indefensible situation".Sources say, "Naturally everyone is worried but now is not the time (to criticise).""It will not help anyone, things should come under control first. We are helping out in every way we can. But there is no way anyone can defend this type of a situation," they said.Notably, earlier this year, Sangh's highest decision-making body, the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS), had passed a unanimous resolution praising several initiatives of the Narendra Modi government such as the Vande Bharat Mission, Vaccine Maitri campaign, Shramik special trains and the ongoing Covid vaccination drive, besides hailing the society for the resilient fight it put up to combat the dreaded virusLast year, Dattatreya Hosabale, the current General Secretary of the Sangh, had praised Prime Minister Modi for "his timely intervention in containing Covid-19" and steps in dealing with the unprecedented situationMeanwhile, it so appears that many in the BJP are worried over the repercussions of the "early" praise for the PM.On March 17, the party's Parliamentary party passed a resolution lauding the Prime Minister's handling of the pandemic. Meanwhile, in February, its national executive praised the PM and his government’s response to the Covid pandemic and economic management amid a global slump.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-upset-with-modi-over-handling-of-covid-situation-245861
