17-04-2021||New Delhi||8 Indian states highly vulnerable to climate change: Report||Eight Indian states—Jharkhand, Mizoram, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh and West Bengal—are highly vulnerable to climate change, according to a national climate vulnerability assessment report.These states, mostly in the eastern part of the country, require prioritisation of adaptation interventions, the report pointed out.Among the states, Assam, Bihar and Jharkhand have over 60 per cent districts in the category of highly vulnerable districts.Lack of forest area per 100 rural population was found to be one of the major drivers of vulnerability for Assam despite the fact that the state has a forest cover of 42 per cent, followed by low road density, the report said.In case of Bihar, the report cited poor health infrastructure to be the key vulnerability driver in 36 districts, followed by a high percentage of marginal and small operational holders in 24 districts.The lack of implementation of the rural employment scheme MGNREGA, causing a lack of alternative livelihood opportunities, appeared as a key driver in 14 districts of Bihar, followed by a lack of women’s participation in the workforce in 11 districts.Lack of crop insurance and rainfed agriculture were key drivers of vulnerability for Jharkhand.The report, titled ‘Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Adaptation Planning in India Using a Common Framework’, which identifies the most vulnerable states and districts in India with respect to current climate risk and key drivers of vulnerability, was released by Department of Science and Technology (DST) Secretary Ashutosh Sharma.Himachal Pradesh, Telangana, Sikkim and Punjab have been categorised as lower-middle vulnerable states. Uttarakhand, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Nagaland, Goa and Maharashtra have been categorised as states with low vulnerability.“We have seen how extreme events are on rise both in terms of their number and severity. Mapping the parts of India that are vulnerable to such changes will help initiating climate actions at the ground level.“The report should be made easily accessible to all stakeholders so that it can benefit climate-vulnerable communities across India through development of better-designed climate change adaptation projects,” said Sharma.He also suggested that the maps should be made available to people who need it.“Assessing vulnerability was the first step towards assessing climate risk. There are two other components like hazard and exposure that need to be also assessed to arrive at overall climate risk.“DST would take up these assessments in the next phase along with sectoral vulnerability assessments and assessments at sub-district levels,” said Akhilesh Gupta, Head, Climate Change Programme (CCP), DST.Prof NH Ravindranath, retired climate change expert from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), explained that the report has helped identify the most vulnerable states, districts and panchayats and will aid in prioritising adaptation investment, developing and implementing adaptation programmes.Director of IIT Mandi Professor Ajit Kumar Chaturvedi and Director of IIT Guwahati T G Sitharaman hoped that the report will be taken up by the states for initiating climate action.A total of 94 representatives from 24 states and two Union Territories participated in the nationwide exercise jointly supported by the DST and the Swiss Agency for Development & Cooperation (SDC).Corinne Demenge, Head, Swiss Cooperation Office, Embassy of Switzerland in India, hoped that the assessments will contribute to the development of more targeted climate change projects and that they will support the implementation and the potential revisions of the State Action Plans on Climate Change.“The assessments can further be used for India’s reporting on the Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement. And finally, these assessments will support India’s National Action Plan on Climate Change,” she added.The assessment will help policy-makers in initiating appropriate climate actions. It will also benefit climate-vulnerable communities across India through development of better-designed climate change adaptation projects.In a developing country such as India, vulnerability assessment is considered as an important exercise to develop suitable adaptation projects and programmes. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/8-indian-states-highly-vulnerable-to-climate-change-report-240461

17-04-2021||New Delhi||COVID-19: Lawyer files a PIL in SC; seeks directions to stop mass gatherings||As COVID-19 cases keep rising in the country, an advocate has filed PIL in the Supreme Court seeking directions to stop mass gatherings in Haridwar for the ongoing Kumbh Mela, saying it posed a grave public health threat during the pandemic.Highlighting the threat posed by political rallies in West Bengal, petitioner Sanjay Kumar Pathak also sought directions to the Election Commission to take corrective steps.Pathak said lakhs of people were attending Kumbh Mela without following the COVID-19 norms such as wearing face masks and observing physical distancing. There was no protocol in place to ensure devotees getting infected at Haridwar didn’t go on to spread the virus when they returned to their home districts, he pointed out.Even though it was evident from the second week of March that a new surge of COVID-19 had started, the Centre, the government of Uttarakhand and the National Disaster Management Authority didn’t take steps to discourage people from gathering at Haridwar, the petitioner alleged.Between April 13 and 14, more than 1,000 COVID-19 cases were reported in Haridwar and the Nirwani Akhada chief died on April 15 due to COVID19, the petitioner said.“Photos and videos from the event show that COVID19 (sic) protocols like physical distancing and wearing masks are not being followed at the event. Blatant violations by the Kumbh mela attendees were ignored... On the other hand, India reported 1,68,912 new cases of Corona positive”, the PIL submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-lawyer-files-a-pil-in-sc-seeks-directions-to-stop-mass-gatherings-240448

People of Maharashtra are following ‘Majha Kutumb, Majhi Javabadari’ dutifully. It is time the CM (chief minister) also follows his duties in the spirit of ‘Majha Rajya, Majhi Javabadari’,” the commerce and industry minister said.Meanwhile, Thackeray appealed to the industrial sector to plan a COVID-appropriate work-style to ensure that the economy is not impacted in case of a “third wave of coronavirus”.The chief minister said a task force of the industrial sector will be set up for coordination with the state government.“Maharashtra needs oxygen supply and all oxygen produced is being used for medical purpose. I contacted prime minister Narendra Modi about the need for oxygen supply, but he wasn’t available on phone yesterday since he was busy with the West Bengal poll campaign. But the Centre is cooperating with the state,” Thackeray is quoted as saying in a release issued by the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO).Thackeray further said though the number of COVID-19 waves cannot be predicted, the trade and industry should plan accordingly to tackle the next wave by adopting the “COVID-appropriate work style and set up testing and vaccination facilities.He also called for raising a special infrastructure for the health of workers, increasing the number of isolation beds, developing work-from-home setup and staggering the work hours.In a letter addressed to the Prime Minister, Thackeray had said that medical oxygen requirement in the state is projected to reach 2,000 metric tonnes per day by April-end from the present consumption of 1,200 MT per day.Citing logistical hurdles in the transportation of liquid medical oxygen from neighbouring states, Thackeray had sought permission under the National Disaster Management Act to airlift oxygen from steel plants in eastern and southern parts of the country.Medical-grade oxygen is used for the treatment of critical COVID-19 patients and in other cases of respiratory diseases. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tried-to-discuss-oxygen-issue-with-pm-on-phone-but-he-was-busy-in-wb-polls-uddhav-240443

When I rushed to the hospital, a nurse told me that they couldn't save him,” Kailash said.But then another nurse told him that he was alive but struggling to breathe, he added."Around 5 pm, I was told that my father needed tracheostomy (a surgical procedure carried out to help a person breathe). Late in the evening we got a call saying he died during the procedure. When we reached the hospital, the management said they cannot hand over the body as my father had tested COVID-19 positive," Kailash said.“The next morning they gave us the death certificate but my brother said he wanted to see the body. When they showed him the body, it was of another person's. My brother went inside the ward to find my father on ventilator support," he claimed.The hospital then retracted the death certificate and Kori's family returned home, only to receive a call in the evening informing that Goralal had finally succumbed. This time the sad news turned out to be true.Asked about the mix-up, hospital dean Dr Sunil Nandeshwar said Goralal's heartbeats stopped when he was being put on ventilator but he was resuscitated. "In the meantime, a nurse misunderstood the situation and gave the wrong information," he said."The story is being blown out of proportion. We spent more than an hour resuscitating him but nobody is talking about that,” Dr Nandeshwar said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hospital-declared-covid-19-patient-dead-twice-before-he-actually-died-family-claims-240432

17-04-2021||New Delhi||Pakistani drugs smuggler nabbed from border fence in Punjab||In a first-of-its-kind operation, anti-narcotics agencies have nabbed a Pakistani national while attempting to smuggle drugs from along the India-Pakistan border fence in Punjab, officials said on Saturday.Twenty-eight-year-old Amjad Ali alias Majid Jutt, a resident of Kharak village in Lahore, was nabbed by the Border Security Force (BSF) troops in the Khemkaran front area of Ferozepur district on the intervening night of April 6-7 when he and his associates were about to push in over 20 kg of heroin from under the fence to their Indian contacts.A total of 20.5 kg of heroin, a mobile phone, a power bank and a 13-feet-long PVC pipe (used to push in drug packets from under the border fence) were recovered by the BSF from Ali, they said.As it was a case "of utmost importance related to inter-border drug trafficking", the probe was handed over to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), deputy director general (north) of the central agency Gyaneshwar Singh said."It is an international drugs syndicate working from across the border. Suppliers are sitting across the fence and pushing in the drugs into India," he said.In a video provided by the NCB, the arrested Pakistani national confesses to have been nabbed by BSF troops in the dead of the night on the said day from the "zero line" of India-Pakistan border.Seen handcuffed and flanked by NCB officers, he claims in the video that while he and his two associates were about to push in drugs to the Indian side, the BSF fired and the two men with him and those on the Indian side fled as he ducked to save himself."The BSF caught me after opening the gates of the border fence," he is heard saying.NCB deputy director (operations) K P S Malhotra said this was the "first operation in which a Pakistani national was arrested alive" from the international front area.There have been numerous instances of the BSF shooting dead drug smugglers along this border in the past.Malhotra said a man identified as Jarnail Singh has also been arrested by the NCB from Vadodara in Gujarat on Saturday on leads provided by the Pakistani man.Jarnail Singh, the receiver of the 20.5 kg heroin being smuggled from across the India-Pakistan border that day, is a resident of Ferozepur and has been absconding since the BSF nabbed the Pakistani man, he said."Amjad Ali was put to sustained interrogation, which led to unearthing of the entire drug syndicate, which is being controlled by two Pakistani nationals who are, residents of Lahore and Kasur districts of Pakistan." "The Indian side receivers have also been identified. Raids have been conducted at possible hideouts in Punjab and Gujarat," Malhotra said.The NCB said it will "also raise this issue at appropriate international forums and will also seek assistance in arrest of the Pakistani nationals who are involved with Amjad Ali in drug trafficking".We are going to take the help of Interpol to nab and nail the international operatives of this syndicate, Gyaneshwar Singh said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistani-drugs-smuggler-nabbed-from-border-fence-in-punjab-240403
17-04-2021||Mumbai||Centre asked export companies not to supply Remdesivir to Maharashtra, alleges NCP minister, BJP hits back||NCP leader and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik on Saturday alleged that the central government has asked export companies not to supply Remdesivir medicine to the state.He also said that the BJP, which is in power at the Centre, was more interested in winning elections than tackling the coronavirus crisis.The BJP hit back saying that Malik should either give proof or apologise for levelling “false” and “baseless” allegations, and said he should step down from the post.Malik’s allegations come days after the Centre banned the export of Remdesivir injections in view of a sudden spike in demand due to the surge in COVID-19 cases. Remdesivir is listed for use in serious coronavirus patients in the Clinical Management Protocols for COVID-19 as an investigational therapy.Taking to Twitter, Malik, the state minority affairs minister, said, “It is sad and shocking that when Government of Maharashtra asked 16 export companies for Remdesivir, we were told that the Central government has asked them not to supply the medicine to Maharashtra. These companies were warned, if they did, their license will be cancelled.” He said this was a dangerous precedent and under these circumstances, the state government will have no choice but to seize the stock of Remdesivir from these exporters and supply it to the needy.In his earlier tweets, he said, “There are 16 export oriented units in the country that have 20 lakh vials of Remdesivir. Since exports are now banned by the government, these units are seeking permission to sell this medicine in the country, but the central government is denying the same.” “The government says it should be sold through seven companies that are producing it. These seven companies are refusing to take responsibility. This is a decision making crisis.“While there is a requirement of this medicine and availability too, a quick decision is the need of the hour. This problem must be solved and the vials must be supplied to the government hospitals in all states immediately,” the NCP leader added.Speaking to reporters later, Malik said, “Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was trying to speak to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over phone (on the issue), but was told that he (PM) is on a tour of West Bengal...This shows that the BJP is more interested in winning elections than tackling this crisis.”  When contacted, state BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhaye reacted sharply, saying, “Instead of making such wild and baseless allegations, Nawab Malik should provide proof or else he should apologise. It is high time that Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) stops the blame game and does its job of handling the pandemic.”   BJP MLA Atul Bhatkhalkar also said that Malik should provide proof of his allegations that Centre has asked the Remdesivir exporters not to sell their medicine in the state.In a video message, he said, “Malik just said that the Centre has pressurised Remdesivir companies not to sell their exportable stock in Maharashtra or they will face action. I want Malik to provide proof of it or he should resign from his post as state minority affairs minister.” “Malik’s allegations are nothing but absolute lie and shamelessness. He should also apologise to the citizens of the state. There is an acute shortage of beds and oxygen but the ministers are hiding,” he added.Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra Legislative Council and BJP leader Pravin Darekar demanded Malik’s resignation for making “false” accusations against the union government.“Malik has levelled these allegations simply to hide the incompetence of the state government. The people in the state are dying because of lack of oxygen supply. Malik made the charges to divert the attention,” he said.“The minister should come give proof to support his allegations or step down from the post,” he said.After union government’s ban on exports of Remdesivir, a sizeable stock of which is in Maharashtra, the state government had requested the Centre to allow these companies to sell it in domestic market. Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope and FDA minister Rajendra Shingane had admitted that the state would face a shortage of 12,000 to 15,000 vials till April 21.

Now, it is also moving towards villages. There is a terrible shortage of tests in cities and RT-PCR is less than half of them while the rest are antigen. One has to wait for testing in Lucknow, Noida, Ghaziabad, Benaras, Allahabad. If the state is to be saved, do maximum RT-PCR testing," she said.Priyanka's attack on the government came amid a steep rise in coronavirus cases in the country with over two lakh new infections daily in the last three days.

17-04-2021||New Delhi||COVID vaccines don't stop one from getting infected, but help in reducing severity||COVID-19 vaccines do not stop one from getting infected but instead help in curing the disease faster and reducing its severity, said health and development economist Professor Anup Malani.He also said that reinfection can be one of the reasons behind the recent surge in cases in the country.Malani, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School and the university's Pritzker School of Medicine, has been leading a series of COVID-19 serosurveys in cities and states across India with economic development-focused think-tank IDFC.In an interview with PTI, Malani said, "I fear this is the biggest misunderstanding around India and even in other countries today. Previous infection and vaccines do not stop you from being infected. That was never how immunity worked. Instead, natural and vaccine-acquired immunity is helpful because it helps you clear the infection faster once you are infected."             "This has two benefits – it helps you avoid death or other serious health harm from the infection, and it helps reduce the probability you will infect someone else. So it is possible to be reinfected, but the harms of the infection will be lower," he said.The level of reinfection in the population depends on the prevalence of the infection and the prevalence of immunity, natural or vaccine acquired, Malani said."The level of reinfection is driven up by more activity (like large gatherings), and down by immunity rates.  What may be going on in India is that activity recently increased at a faster rate than immunity. This is the most optimistic interpretation of the surge,” he said.Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) Director General Balram Bhargava earlier this month had said that reinfection of cases are around one per cent."We have studied the data of reinfection cases in India. Globally, reinfection cases are around 1 per cent,” he had said.India is battling to a massive surge in COVID-19 cases.The number of new coronavirus cases hit a record daily high since the outbreak of the pandemic with 2,34,692 new infections being reported in a span of 24 hours, pushing the nationwide COVID-19 tally to 1,45,26,609, according to health ministry data updated on Saturday.Malani said there can be two possibilities behind the recent surge in cases – one is people are not wearing masks and gathering, and the other is emergence of new strains of the coronavirus.“First is that people are not wearing masks and gathering more. The second is that there are new strains that are more transmissible. But the question we must ask is why people are more non-compliant now? Is it that they are just tired of COVID, or they think the vaccination campaign is reducing risk -- even if they personally are not vaccinated -- or fatality rate has fallen as more people are naturally immune,” he said.On ways to tackle the second wave, Malani said wearing masks, more testing, tracking peoples' recovery or death, and sequencing positive cases can be among the ways to handle the surge. “What is best to do in response to the surge really depends on what the explanation is for the surge. If the optimistic explanation is correct (that is activity increased faster than immunity in February and March), then the solution is that we should increase vaccination," he said.The health and development economist said raising immunity levels is better than reducing activities like gatherings as he fears that people are less compliant with or tolerant of lockdowns now."If the pessimistic scenario holds, which is new strains have emerged and existing or vaccine immunity is less effective against them, and so they have the same or higher infection fatality rate, then we have to start first with lockdowns. But we should be smarter about them," Malani said, adding that previously, "we seemed to mainly want to stop activities". The aim should be to stop crowding, "while contact tracing and quarantining are helpful, it also causes people to avoid being tested or reporting symptoms. This can just mask the problem", he said.           On nationwide lockdown, Malani said lockdowns seem to harm the poor more than the rich. "But the new thing we've discovered is that lockdowns can cause people to move to escape them.  Perhaps we will see lockdowns in Maharashtra causing people to leave the state to return to their ancestral homes in other states.  This could actually increase crowding at train stations and thus, the level of infection," he said. "It could also spread the infection.  If a national and abrupt lockdown is not possible, and I don't think it is feasible, then we need to use more intelligent strategies. Wearing masks is the easiest. We can engage in economic activity and mask, so opposition to this form of control should be less,” he said. Maharashtra is among the 12 high-burden states in the country. Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are also part of this group. The number of active coronavirus cases in the country has surpassed the 16-lakh mark, the health ministry's data showed. Registering a steady increase for the 38th day in a row, the tally of active COVID-19 cases has climbed to 16,79,740 in the country, accounting for 11.56 per cent of its total caseload, while the national COVID-19 recovery rate has dropped to 87.23 per cent.Of the fresh cases reported on Saturday, Maharashtra reported 63,729, followed by Uttar Pradesh(27,426) and Delhi (19,486), according to the data.

17-04-2021||Washington||Researchers led by Indian-origin scientist identify genes that fight virus causing COVID-19||US researchers led by an Indian-origin scientist have identified a set of human genes that fight SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19, a study that could help in understanding the factors that affect disease severity and suggesting possible therapeutic options.The study by scientists at Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute in San Diego, California, was published in the journal Molecular Cell.The genes in question are related to interferons, the body’s frontline virus fighters.“We wanted to gain a better understanding of the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2, including what drives a strong or weak response to infection,” says Sumit K. Chanda, professor and director of the Immunity and Pathogenesis Program at Sanford Burnham Prebys and lead author of the study.“We’ve gained new insights into how the virus exploits the human cells it invades, but we are still searching for its achilles’ heel so that we can develop optimal antivirals,” he said.Knowing which genes help control viral infection can greatly assist researchers’ understanding of factors that affect disease severity and also suggest possible therapeutic options, the institute said in a press release.Soon after the start of the pandemic, clinicians found that a weak interferon response to SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in some of the more severe cases of COVID-19.This knowledge led Chanda and his collaborators to search for the human genes that are triggered by interferons, known as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which act to limit SARS-CoV-2 infection.Based on knowledge gleaned from SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused a deadly, but relatively brief, outbreak of disease from 2002 to 2004, and knowing that it was similar to SARS-CoV-2, the investigators were able to develop laboratory experiments to identify the ISGs that control viral replication in COVID-19, the statement said.“We found that 65 ISGs controlled SARS-CoV-2 infection, including some that inhibited the virus’ ability to enter cells, some that suppressed manufacture of the RNA (Ribonucleic acid) that is the virus’s lifeblood, and a cluster of genes that inhibited assembly of the virus,” Chanda said.“What was also of great interest was the fact that some of the ISGs exhibited control across unrelated viruses, such as seasonal flu, West Nile and HIV, which leads to AIDS”.As a next step, the researchers will look at the biology of SARS-CoV-2 variants that continue to evolve and threaten vaccine efficacy.The overall global COVID-19 caseload has topped 139.6 million, while the deaths have surged to more than 2.99 million, according to the Johns Hopkins University.

According to an official statement issued by the poll panel, the seizure included cash, liquor, drugs, freebies and precious metals.Tamil Nadu, where political parties offer cash and inducements to voters, topped the list. It was followed by West Bengal, where the enforcement agencies have made seizures to the tune of Rs 300.11 crore, it said. Seizures worth Rs 122.35 crore were made in Assam, while Kerala fared the best among the states, reporting seizure to the tune of only Rs 84.91 crore. In Puducherry, the authorities made seizures worth Rs 36.95 crore, the poll panel said.The total amount of seizure across the four states and Puducherry is a record Rs 1,001.44 crore, which is a huge jump from the Rs 225.77 crore worth of seizure made in the states during the 2016 assembly elections. “The stupendous rise in seizure figures is because of better preparedness and multi-pronged strategy of the commission. The EC conducted exhaustive reviews at various levels,” the EC statement read.The EC had deployed five special expenditure observers and 321 expenditure observers for close monitoring. As many as 259 assembly seats were marked as Expenditure Sensitive Constituencies for a more focused vigil, it said.In bengal, Rs 300.11 crore seized||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cash-liquor-freebies-tamil-nadu-tops-the-list-says-election-panel-240128

Maharashtra’s oxygen demand is going through the roof as the state continues to contribute the most to daily Covid burden.The PM has told officials to ensure seamless movement of tankers carrying oxygen throughout the country and the government said it had exempted tankers from registration of permits to enable quick movement.“The states and transporters have been asked to move tankers round the clock with drivers working in shifts to ensure faster turnaround and adequate capacity to meet the surge in demand. Cylinder filling plants will also be permitted 24-hour working with necessary safeguards.“The government is allowing industrial cylinders to be used for medical oxygen after due purging. Similarly, nitrogen and argon tankers will be automatically allowed to be converted to oxygen tankers to overcome the potential shortage of tankers,” the officials told the PM.Meanwhile, the Health Ministry today initiated the process of tendering to import 50,000 MT of medical grade oxygen. The oxygen supply situation remains critical in 12 high-burden states with the demand expected to soar by April 30. These states are Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. The government will supply 4,880 MT, 5,619 MT and 6,593 MT to these 12 states on April 20, 25 and 30 to meet their demands.Chemicals and Fertilizer Minister DV Sadanand Gowda today said the production of Remdesivir injection, the anti-viral used in hospitalised Covid patients on oxygen, has been raised from 28 lakh to 41 lakh vials a month and the manufacturers had lowered the cost from Rs 5,400 a vial to less than Rs 3,500 a vial by April 15.The government said 6.69 lakh vials of the injection had been sent to states in the last five days. Amid reports of the injection being black-marketed at over Rs 20,000 a vial, the minister said production was being ramped up.Maharashtra CM wants supplies airliftedUddhav appeals to PM to use choppers where needed||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tankers-with-oxygen-need-no-permit-govt-240047

The government in a statement today said, “The current production capacity of the Bharat Biotech-ICMR jab Covaxin will be doubled by May-June and then increased nearly six to seven-fold by July and August. The production will be raised from 1 crore vaccine doses in April this year to 7 crore vaccine doses a month by July-August. It is expected to reach nearly 10 crore doses per month by September 2021.” Three public sectors companies have also been asked to augment vaccine supplies for domestic use.Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation, Mumbai, a Maharashtra Government enterprise which had earlier sought 12 months to reach production capacity of 20 million doses of Covaxin a month, has now been told by the Centre to compress its timeline to six months.Indian Immunologicals Ltd, Hyderabad, and Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals Limited, Bulandshahr, will also be supported to prepare for producing 10 to 15 million doses of Covaxin a month by August. The active Covid-19 cases today crossed 15 lakh to settle at 15,69,743, which is 10.98 per cent of all cases. India saw more than 2 lakh daily cases for the second consecutive day today.Masks must till vax mitigates impact: ECDCNon-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing, should be stringently continued until vaccinations can “fully mitigate” the impact of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its known variants, says European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) Director Andrea Ammon.

17-04-2021||New Delhi||Delhi, UP, Maharashtra report highest-ever single-day Covid spike||As India recorded over two lakh new COVID-19 cases for the second straight day, the Centre on Friday unveiled plans to ramp up output of indigenous vaccine Covaxin ten times to reach 10 crore doses by September and accelerate the manufacture of antiviral drug remdesivir, and also called for increasing the production of medical oxygen.In the wake of reports of shortage of the medical grade oxygen for COVID-19 patients in different parts of the country in the last few days, Prime Minister Narendra Modi undertook a comprehensive review to ensure its adequate supply, and said steps should be taken to augment the production. He also asked officials to ensure seamless and free movement of tankers carrying this commodity throughout the country.At the same time, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan lamented that people have adopted a casual approach towards the pandemic which is very dangerous, adding COVID appropriate behaviour is the biggest social tool to break the chain of transmission. He made the remarks after visiting the AIIMS Trauma Centre in Delhi to assess the healthcare infrastructure in view of the spike in COVID-19 cases.According to an advisory prepared by an expert Dr. Neeraj Kaushik for Southeast Delhi Police, the second wave of coronavirus can last up to 100 days and such waves will keep coming till 70 percent of the population is vaccinated and herd community is achieved.Aimed at creating awareness among police personnel, the advisory said the new mutated virus has potential to skip immunity and even vaccine. “This is the reason for re-infection and cases among vaccinated people.”     India added a record 2,17,353 new coronavirus infections in a day taking the total tally to 1,42,91,917, while active cases surpassed the 15-lakh mark, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Friday. On Thursday, the ministry said 2,00,739 new cases were reported in a span of 24 hours.The death toll increased to 1,74,308 with 1,185 new fatalities, the highest since September 19 last, the data updated at 8 am showed.Registering a steady rise for the 37th day in a row, the active cases rose to 15,69,743, comprising 10.98 per cent of the total infections, while the national COVID recovery rate dropped to 87.80 per cent, the ministry said.On Friday, Maharashtra reported 63,729 new cases and was followed by Uttar Pradesh(27,426) and Delhi(19,486), according to official data. It was the highest daily spike in new infections for all the three states since the outbreak of the pandemic last year. West Bengal, where Assembly polls are underway, also recorded the highest ever daily jump of 6,910 cases.The Department of Biotechnology(DBT) said Covaxin’s production will be doubled by May-June and that it has roped in three public sector companies to increase the capacity.“The current production capacity of indigenously developed Covaxin will be doubled by May-June 2021 and then increased nearly 6-7 fold by July-August 2021 i.e. increasing the production from 1 crore vaccine doses in April, 2021 to 6-7 crore vaccine dose/month in July-August. It is expected to reach nearly 10 crore doses per month by September 2021,” the DBT said in a statement.As part of the augmentation plan, capacities of Bharat Biotech Limited as well as other public sector manufactures are being upgraded with required infrastructure and technology, it added.Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council for Medical Research(ICMR) have developed Covaxin, one of the two vaccines being used in the ongoing nationwide COVID-19 vaccination drive.Financial support of around Rs 65 crore is being provided as grant by the Centre to Bharat Biotech’s new Bangalore facility which is being repurposed to increase the capacity of vaccine production, the DBT said.The Centre will also provide financial assistance of Rs 65 crore to Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation Ltd, Mumbai – a public sector undertaking (PSU) under the Maharashtra government, the DBT said.Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Sandeep Rathod, Managing Director, Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical Corporation Ltd, said its target is to produce around 22.8 crore vaccine vials “but it will take one year for us to start production”.“However, the central government has asked them to expedite and complete the task urgently within six months. The facility will have a capacity of 20 million dozes per month, once functional,” the DBT said.Indian Immunologicals Limited (IIL), Hyderabad, a facility under National Dairy Development Board, and Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals Limited, Bulandshahr, a PSU department of biotechnology will also be supported to prepare a facility to provide 10-15 million doses per month by August-September, the DBT said.Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO Adar Poonawalla said the US needs to lift its embargo on raw material exports to help ramp up vaccine production.SII is currently manufacturing Covishield, developed by Astrazeneca and Oxford University. The vaccine is not only being used in India, but exported to a number of countries.Chemicals and Fertilisers Minister D V Sadananda Gowda took to Twitter to say that the government is taking all steps to accelerate the production of antiviral drug remdesivir, used in treatment of COVID-19, and ensure its availability in the country.The minister also mentioned that a total of 6.69 lakh vials of the drug have been made available to different states and union territories during the last five days.In another tweet, Gowda said: “Remdesivir placed under Export ban wef 11.04.2021 to increase supply in domestic market. Its supplies of approx 4 lakh vials meant for Export is being diverted by manufacturers to fulfil domestic requirement. EOU/SEZ units are also being enabled to supply for domestic market”.A Maharashtra minister also flagged that the state will face a shortage of 12,000 to 15,000 remdesivir injections.Maharashtra’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Minister Rajendra Shingane said, “Companies that produce Remdesivir injection have increased their production but it will take some time for the vials to hit the market. If we consider a 10-12 per cent shortage, Maharashtra will continue to face a shortage of 12,000 to 15,000 remdesivir vials for the next two to three days”.Prime Minister Modi took a comprehensive review to ensure adequate medical grade oxygen supply in the country, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said in a statement.The prime minister stressed that it is important to ensure synergy across ministries and state governments, it said.He took a detailed review of the current situation of oxygen supply and projected use in the coming 15 days across 12 high-burden states—Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.The Ministry of Home Affairs(MHA) also directed the states to ensure uninterrupted movement of medical oxygen carrying vehicles along their borders, and said they must not impose any curb on production and supply of the essential public health commodity anywhere.The Health Ministry, meanwhile,  said a total of 1,189 samples have so far tested positive for variants of concern of SARS COV-2 in India.These include 1,109 samples testing positive for the UK variants, 79 for the South Africa variant and one sample for the Brazil variant, the ministry said.Till April 15, 13,614 samples have been processed at the 10 designated INSACOG laboratories for whole genome sequencing (WGS), it added.A global mutation tracker also suggested the ‘double mutant’ coronavirus, first identified in Maharashtra, has a cumulative prevalence of 10 percent in India, a finding that some scientists in India said is based on insufficient data and needs more research.Genome sequencing with representative samples from all states seeing a COVID-19 surge is necessary before any conclusion can be drawn, experts said after a tracker by US-based Scripps Research suggested the B.1.617 lineage, also called a double mutant, has the highest cumulative prevalence of all mutant variants analysed in India.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-up-maharashtra-report-highest-ever-single-day-covid-spike-239975
17-04-2021||New Delhi||'Strong evidence' Covid predominantly spreads through air: Lancet||There is consistent, strong evidence to prove that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, behind the COVID-19 pandemic, is predominantly transmitted through the air, according to a new assessment published on Friday in The Lancet journal.The analysis by six experts from the UK, the US and Canada says public health measures that fail to treat the virus as predominantly airborne leave people unprotected and allow the virus to spread.Although some studies in the past have suggested that COVID-19 may spread through air, overall scientific literature on the subject has been inconclusive.In July last year, over 200 scientists from 32 nations wrote to the WHO, saying there is evidence that the coronavirus is airborne, and even smaller particles can infect people.“The evidence supporting airborne transmission is overwhelming, and evidence supporting large droplet transmission is almost non-existent,” said Jose-Luis Jimenez, from the University of Colorado Boulder in the US.“It is urgent that the World Health Organization and other public health agencies adapt their description of transmission to the scientific evidence so that the focus of mitigation is put on reducing airborne transmission,” Jimenez said.The team, led by researchers at the University of Oxford in the UK, reviewed published research and identified 10 lines of evidence to support the predominance of the airborne route.The researchers highlighted the super-spreader events such as last year’s Skagit Choir outbreak in the US, in which 53 people became infected from a single infected case.Studies have confirmed these events cannot be adequately explained by close contact or touching shared surfaces or objects, the researchers said in their assesment.They noted that transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 are much higher indoors than outdoors, and transmission is greatly reduced by indoor ventilation.The team cited previous studies estimating that silent—asymptomatic or presymptomatic—transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from people who are not coughing or sneezing accounts for at least 40 per cent of all transmission.This silent transmission is a key way COVID-19 has spread around the world, “supporting a predominantly airborne mode of transmission,” according to the assessment.The researchers also highlighted work demonstrating long-range transmission of the virus between people in adjacent rooms in hotels, who were never in each other’s presence.On the contrary, the team found little to no evidence that the virus spreads easily via large droplets, which fall quickly through the air and contaminate surfaces.“We were able to identify and interpret highly complex and specialist papers on the dynamics of fluid flows and the isolation of live virus,” said study lead author Trish Greenhalgh.“While some individual papers were assessed as weak, overall the evidence base for airborne transmission is extensive and robust,” Greenhalgh added.He noted that there should be no further delay in implementing measures around the world to protect against such transmission.The assessment has serious implications for public health measures designed to mitigate the pandemic, the researchers said.They said “droplet measures” such as handwashing and surface cleaning, while important, should be given less emphasis than airborne measures, which deal with inhalation of infectious particles suspended in the air.According to the researchers, if an infectious virus is primarily airborne, someone can potentially be infected when they inhale aerosols produced when an infected person exhales, speaks, shouts, sings, or sneezes.They noted that some airborne control measures include ventilation, air filtration, reducing crowding and the amount of time people spend indoors.Wearing masks whenever indoors, attention to mask quality and fit, and higher-grade PPE for healthcare and other staff when working in contact with potentially infectious people are some of the other control measures, according to the researchers.“It is quite surprising that anyone is still questioning whether airborne transmission is the predominant transmission pathway for this virus or not,” said study co-author Professor Kimberly Prather, from the University of California San Diego, US.“Only by including inhalation of aerosols at both close and long range can we explain the many indoor outbreaks that have occurred around the globe. Once we acknowledge this virus is airborne, we know how to fix it,” Prather said.The researchers added that there are many examples of places that have fared much better by acknowledging this virus is airborne from the start, adding the world needs to follow their lead as soon as possible.
