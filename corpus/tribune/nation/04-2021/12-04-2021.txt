During this yatra awareness about the ‘black’ agricultural laws will be spread and people will be encouraged to join the movement,” Malik said.According to Tikait, farmers protesting the contentious new farm laws are ready to talk if the Centre invites them. However, the dialogue should resume from where it had ended on January 22 and the demands remain unchanged, he said, adding that for talks to resume, the government should invite the SKM. “Talks with the government will resume from the same point where they ended on January 22. The demands are also the same---the three ‘black’ farm laws are repealed, a new law made to ensure MSP for crops,” Malik said, quoting Tikait.At a meeting called by Tikait of six divisions of BKU from western UP on Monday, office-bearers “vowed to continue the fight until the withdrawal of the three laws and legislation on the MSP”. In the meeting, Tikait said farming should not suffer and the movement should also go on. “If farming activities suffers the country will suffer a loss,” he said, urging everyone to maintain the pace of work and also the movement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tikait-heads-for-bengal-again-to-hold-for-a-kisan-panchayat-in-asansol-238187

12-04-2021||New Delhi||Nizamuddin Markaz mosque can be made operational during Ramzan, Centre tells HC||The Centre told the Delhi High Court on Monday that the Nizamuddin Markaz mosque can be made operational for devotees to offer prayers during the month of Ramzan which is expected to begin from April 14.The submission was made before Justice Mukta Gupta by the Central government during the hearing of a plea by the Waqf Board seeking opening of the Nizamuddin Markaz where the Tablighi Jamaat congregation was held amid the COVID-19 pandemic and was locked since March 31 last year.On March 24, the Centre had said that 50 persons chosen by the Waqf board can be allowed to pray at the mosque during the ‘shab-e-barat’ holiday.Advocate Rajat Nair, appearing for the Centre, told the court on Monday that offering of prayers at the mosque during Ramzan should be subject to the guidelines issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) with regard to social distancing and other precautions in the wake of rising COVID-19 cases in the national capital.Nair also told the court that the names of the office bearers and other staff who will be running, managing and dealing with the day-to-day operational issues of the mosque be given to the Station House Officer (SHO) concerned and these persons would be permitted to be present there throughout the day during the holy month.Senior advocate Ramesh Gupta and Nair also told the court that a joint inspection would be carried out on Monday itself by the SHO of police station Hazrat Nizamuddin and the office bearers of the mosque.They said the inspection would be carried out in the presence of advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, the lawyer for the Waqf board, and a member of the Board—Himal Akhtar.“The exercise of measuring the area of the mosque where the devotees can offer namaz five times in the day, will be carried out today itself and as per the guidelines issued by the DDMA, keeping the distances required to be maintained, blocks will be made at the place where the prayer mats can be put for the devotees to offer namaz,” they told the court.They also said that CCTV cameras would be installed on Tuesday to ensure safety and security of the premises and the persons coming there to offer prayers.Taking note of these submissions, the court listed the matter for further hearing on Tuesday.The board, in its plea, has contended that even after unlock-1 guidelines permitted religious places outside containment zones to be opened, the markaz—comprising the Masjid Bangley Wali, Madarsa Kashif-ul-uloom and attached hostel—continues to be locked up.It has further contended that even if the premises was part of any criminal investigation or trial, keeping it “under lock as an out of bound area” was a “primitive method” of enquiry process.An FIR had been registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act, Foreigners Act and various provisions of the penal code in connection with the Tablighi Jamaat event held at the markaz and the subsequent stay of foreigners there during the COVID-19 lockdown.

12-04-2021||Chandigarh||Disagreeing with High Court, AFT says no jurisdiction over some summary court martial matters||The Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) has ruled that certain punishments awarded by a summary court martial (SCM) do not come under the ambit of service matters and hence cannot be appealed against before the Tribunal.While “respectfully disagreeing” with an earlier judgment of the Allahabad High Court, the Tribunal’s Bench comprising Justice Rajendra Menon and Lt Gen PM Hariz observed that the AFT Act excludes all cases arising out of SCM except where the punishment is of dismissal or imprisonment for more than three months as being service matters upon which it can adjudicate.An Army jawan had moved the AFT against his trial by an SCM that had awarded him a severe reprimand and imposed a fine equal to seven days’ pay for having been found intoxicated while on duty.His counsel had placed reliance on an earlier judgment of the Allahabad High Court that had ruled that such matters came within the ambit of the AFT, and it has also been followed by some other Benches of the AFT.The High Court had said that Section 3 (o) of the AFT Act, which defines service matters, also included a clause “any other matter, whatsoever”.In case these words are not taken into account, it shall make the clause redundant, which is not permissible under interpretative jurisprudence, the High Court had observed.It was also ruled by the High Court that the punishment of severe reprimand, which affects the career of Army personnel, shall be service matter and shall be amenable before the AFT.Observing that the Allahabad High Court had taken note of the “inclusion clause” but had very conveniently ignored the “exclusion clause”, the Tribunal said that when the legislative intent and the scheme of the stature is to be interpreted and implemented, the entire definition clause has to be seen.The Tribunal said it was of the considered view that the Allahabad High Court, while analysing the definition of service matters had interpreted the legislative intent and the scope in a manner which amounts to doing harm to legislative intent by ignoring certain parts of the definition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/disagreeing-with-high-court-aft-says-no-jurisdiction-over-some-summary-court-martial-matters-238178

12-04-2021||Pune||Lockdown leads to loss of jobs, says Devendra Fadnavis||Stating that people lose their jobs when a lockdown is imposed, senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Monday alleged the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is not serious about providing any financial aid to the vulnerable sections.Taking a dig at the state government amid talks that an extended lockdown is imminent in Maharashtra in view of a steep rise in COVID-19 cases, Fadnavis said there is a “lockshahi” in the state now instead of ‘lokshahi’ (democracy).The Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly was addressing a rally for the upcoming bypoll to Pandharpur-Mangalvedha Assembly constituency in Solapur district.The BJP has fielded Samadhan Autade against Bhagirath Bhalke, son of late MLA Bharat Bhalke, of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) for the April 17 contest.“When this government came into power, it was called as Maha Vikas Aghadi but now it has become a ‘Maha Vasooli (extortion) Aghadi’. The way they have started the vasooli from police, farmers and the common man, it shows that all the three ruling parties (Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) have only one agenda and that is to collect money from wherever itis possible,” he alleged.Fadnavis was referring to the allegations of corruption raised by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh against then home minister Anil Deshmukh, an NCP stalwart.The former chief minister also said the highest number of COVID-19 cases and fatalities are being reported from Maharashtra.“In the last ten days, 50 to 55 per cent of the total deaths in the country were reported from Maharashtra.Similarly, 60 per cent of the total cases in the country were also reported from Maharashtra,” he said.Fadnavis said, “I can understand locking and unlocking (to contain the spread of coronavirus) is important but when a lockdown is imposed, people lose their jobs. Unfortunately, the state government is not at all conscious about providing financial help to the (vulnerable) people”.He said governments in Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka have helped the common man and farmers.“It is the responsibility of the state government to help the people in distress but this (MVA) government, instead of helping people, is recovering power bills from them like the ‘Jizya’ tax that used to be imposed in the Mughals era,” Fadnavis said.He said the state government has stopped disconnecting power connections of people (who have failed to clear their dues) due to this byelection.“But you will see that the government will resume snapping power connections after the bypoll is conducted on April 17,” he claimed.Fadnavis said West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, the communists and the Congress will receive a big jolt on May 2 when results of the assembly polls held in five states will be out.Speaking at another campaign rally, Fadanvis said, “People may think what difference a bypoll will make to change the state government. Leave it to me when to change this government. We will change that, but for now, this bypoll is important as the people of this constituency have got the opportunity to show the government its place”.

12-04-2021||New Delhi||Centre extends ceasefire pacts with 3 Naga insurgent groups by a year||The Centre on Monday extended the ceasefire agreements with three insurgent groups of Nagaland for one more year till April next year.In a statement, the Ministry of Home Affairs said the ceasefire agreements are in operation between the government of India and National Socialist Council of Nagaland/NK (NSCN/NK), National Socialist Council of Nagaland/Reformation (NSCN/R) and National Socialist Council of Nagaland/K-Khango (NSCN/K-Khango).“It was decided to extend the ceasefire agreements for a further period of one year with effect from April 28, 2021 to April 27, 2022 with NSCN/NK and NSCN/R and from April 18, 2021 to April 17, 2022 with NSCN/K-Khango,” the statement said.These agreements were signed on Monday.The three outfits are breakaway factions of dominant groups NSCN-IM and NSCN-K.The NSCN-IM had entered into a ceasefire agreement with the central government in 1997 and has since then been engaged in peace negotiations.The NSCN-IM had signed a Framework Agreement on August 3, 2015 in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to find a permanent solution to the Naga issue.The Framework Agreement came after over 80 rounds of negotiations spanning 18 years, with the first breakthrough made in 1997 when the ceasefire agreement was sealed after decades of insurgency in Nagaland which started soon after India’s independence in1947.However, the talks with the NSCN-IM is currently going nowhere as the group has been insisting for a separate Naga flag and constitution, a demand rejected by the central government.The NSCN-K had signed a ceasefire agreement with the Centre in 2001 but unilaterally abrogated it in 2015 when the then chairman of the group, S S Khaplang, was alive.In December last year, the NSCN-K, led by dreaded militant Niki Sumi, had announced a ceasefire and said that the outfit has contacted the central government for initiating peace dialogue.Sumi was also the prime accused in the killing of 18 Indian Army soldiers in Manipur in 2015 and the National Investigation Agency had announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh on his head.

12-04-2021||New Delhi||SC refuses to entertain plea seeking uniform retirement age for judges||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain a PIL seeking uniform retirement age for judges of High Courts and the top court.A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian asked the petitioner to approach the Union Government or the Law Commission of India with a representation.Petitioner Ashwini Upadhyay, an advocate and BJP leader, argued that the different age of retirements for judges of high courts and the apex court is irrational.The bench then said, “We are dismissing it. You can make a representation”.Upadhyay then sought permission to withdraw the petition which was allowed.The PIL stated that if there is uniformity in retirement age, the Judges of the High Court will discharge judicial work more independently and without any expectation to move to the Supreme Court.Also, to minimise the apprehension of subordination between the Supreme Court and High Courts, it is appropriate to equate the retirement age of High Court Judge”s with Supreme Court judges, it said.Contending that its irrational to have different retirement age for judges of constitutional courts, the plea filed by Upadhyay said increasing the retirement age and making it uniform i.e 65 years will not only strengthen the rule of law, but also secure the fundamental right of speedy justice, guaranteed under Article 21.At present, the retirement age for the Supreme Court judges is 65 years whereas for the High Court judges, it is 62 years.“Uniformity in the retirement age of Judges will create a pool of experienced judges in High Courts, which will be extremely useful for deciding the cases of extreme importance or which require deep and thorough knowledge for interpretation of the Constitution,” the plea filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey said.Uniformity in the retirement age is not only necessary to reduce pendency of cases but also essential to attract and retain the best legal talent in the bench, the plea said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-plea-seeking-uniform-retirement-age-for-judges-238143

12-04-2021||New Delhi||Russia’s Sputnik V gets expert panel nod, ball now in DCGI court||An expert panel of India’s central drug authority has recommended granting approval to Russian COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V for restricted emergency use with certain conditions, paving the way for a third vaccine to be available in the country, sources said on Monday.The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) on Monday deliberated upon the application of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories seeking emergency use authorisation for Sputnik V.“After detailed deliberation for grant of permission for restricted use in emergency situations subject to various regulatory provisions,” a source said.The recommendations have been sent to the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for final approval.If approved, it will be the third COVID-19 vaccine to be available in India after Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and Oxford-AstraZeneca’s Covishield, being manufactured by Serum Institute of India in Pune. According to sources, around 10 crore doses of the vaccine (Sputnik V) is likely to be imported for emergency use in the country in the next six months.The vaccine is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 in individuals aged 18 years and above and is to be administered intramuscularly in two doses of 0.5 ml each with an interval of 21 days.It has to be stored at -18 degrees Celsius.According to recommendations by the SEC, the firm has been asked to submit revised factsheets to CDSCO after incorporating the latest safety and efficacy data and other suggestions made during the meeting, another source said.Besides, the firm should submit the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity data from the ongoing clinical trials in India and Russia for review as and when available.The firm also has to submit safety data including the data on AEFI and AESI with due analysis every 15 days for the first two months and monthly thereafter till the completion of the ongoing clinical trial in the country.The SEC earlier had reviewed the application by Dr Reddy’s in two meetings earlier held on April 1 and February 24.The health ministry earlier had said three more COVID-19 vaccines by Zydus Cadila, Biological E and Gennova are also in the pipeline and are in advanced clinical trials in India.Global healthcare major Johnson and Johnson is in discussions with the Indian government to begin a clinical trial of its single-dose COVID-19 vaccine in the country, the company said on Friday.In light of the SEC meeting held on April 1, Dr Reddy’s on Monday presented the interim safety and immunogenicity data from phase 2/3 clinical trial including GMT titres for virus neutralising antibodies, comparative phase 3 immunogenicity data generated in Indian and Russian studies and unblinded data of serious adverse events and RT-PCR positive cases among others.In September last year, Dr Reddy’s partnered with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) to conduct clinical trials of Sputnik V and for its distribution rights in India.Sputnik V has demonstrated an efficacy rate of 91.6 per cent in the interim analysis of phase 3 clinical trial, which included data on 19,866 volunteers in Russia. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/russias-sputnik-v-gets-expert-panel-nod-ball-now-in-dcgi-court-238136
12-04-2021||New Delhi||Non-adherence to COVID-19 norms, virulent strains could be behind surge in infections: AIIMS chief||People not adhering to COVID-appropriate behaviour and the circulation of highly infectious strains of SARS-COV-2 could be the primary reasons behind the surge in coronavirus infections in India, AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria said on Monday.He also warned that if the situation is not reversed, then the galloping infection rate will eventually cause a huge strain on the country's healthcare system. He sought stricter enforcement of COVID-appropriate behaviour on the ground level by the administration and authorities."Around February, when cases started to decrease, people became lax towards following COVID-appropriate behaviour as they thought the virus had become ineffective."People are taking the disease lightly now. If you go out, you see that marketplaces, restaurants and shopping malls are crowded and full of people and these all are super-spreader events," Guleria said.Earlier, if one sick person was able to infect around 30 per cent of their contacts, this time those getting the disease are infecting a larger number of people, he said."So, the rate of spread of the infection is fast possibly due to the highly infectious and transmissible strains circulating," he added.Various strains of SARS-CoV-2, including the UK, South Africa and Brazil variants, are circulating in India and have been termed as highly transmissible by experts.Guleria said the entire humanity is going through a difficult time and "unless it is important, people should not venture out. Also, it has to be ensured that there is no gathering and stricter enforcement of COVID-appropriate behaviour has to be ensured"."We may lose the gains we have made so far if we do not pay heed now," and the situation may completely get out of control, he said."If the situation is not reversed, then the galloping infection rate will eventually cause a huge strain on the healthcare system also," he stressed.The AIIMS chief also urged people to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Though the vaccine will not protect a person from contracting the infection, it will prevent its progression to a severe form and thereby reduce mortality, Guleria said.But wearing a mask and following other protocols is equally important, he added.India on Monday recorded the biggest single-day jump of 1,68,912 fresh COVID-19 cases that took the infection tally to 1,35,27,717, according to Union health ministry data.Ten states -- Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan -- have shown a steep rise in daily cases, accounting for 83.02 per cent of the infections reported in a day.

The present circumstances are not conducive for holding exams. Your health is our priority," state School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad tweeted."Keeping in mind the schedule of entrance exams for professional courses, class 12th exams will be held by end of May, while 10th standard exams will be in June," she said in a series of tweets.The health situation was being closely monitored and fresh dates for the postponed exams would be announced soon, Gaikwad said.The decision is the outcome of consultations with various stakeholders, like students, teachers, parents, elected representatives from across parties, academicians and tech giants, the minister said."We'll also be writing to the CBSE, ICSE, IB, Cambridge boards, requesting them to reconsider their exams dates," she said.Thanking Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray for approving the decision, Gaikwad said during the consultations, various alternative assessment options were evaluated keeping the health, well-being and future of students in mind."Postponing exams seemed to be the most pragmatic solution," she added.On Sunday, Maharashtra recorded 63,294 new cases of coronavirus, its highest single-day rise since the pandemic broke out, which pushed the caseload to 34,07,245, as per official figures.

12-04-2021||Ranaghat (WB)||Those threatening more Cooch Behar-like killings should be banned politically: Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, in an apparent jibe at state BJP leaders, said on Monday that those threatening of more Cooch Behar-like killings should be banned politically.She wondered what kind of human beings are politicians who say that there will be more Sitalkuchi-like incidents and that the death toll should have been higher.Four people were killed in CISF firing after they "attempted to snatch the rifles of the central forces" while voting was underway in Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar district in the fourth phase on Saturday, sparking a political storm in the state."Some political leaders are threatening of more Sitalkuchi-like incidents, while others are saying that the death toll should have been higher. I am stunned and shocked to see such reactions. What are these leaders up to? They should be politically banned," Banerjee said, while addressing an election rally at Ranaghat in Nadia district.BJP leaders were seen referring to the Cooch Behar killings and threatening that more such incidents may happen if "naughty boys" take the law into their hands and that more than four people should have been killed in the firing.Banerjee alleged that the BJP is killing its own workers and leaders and damaging their vehicles "to bring a bad name to the TMC"."Before conspiring to kill four persons in CISF firing, the BJP, a party of murderers, killed a Rajbongshi brother," she said.Apart from the four people who were killed in CISF firing, another man was shot dead outside a polling booth by unidentified persons in the same Sitalkuchi assembly constituency area.Union Home Minister Amit Shah has alleged that Banerjee paid tributes only to the four persons killed in CISF firing because they were from the minority community.Accusing the BJP of communalising the murder of young voters on polling day, Banerjee said, "You cannot succeed in your nefarious game to divide the people of West Bengal. This is not Uttar Pradesh or Gujarat."Alleging that Shah had hatched the conspiracy of Cooch Behar killings with the full knowledge of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the feisty TMC leader said, "After returning to power, I will order a probe to unravel the sequence of events, who were involved, how it all started, whether any rumour was at play...everything."She urged people not to vote for a party that encourages "firing on voters standing in a queue".Claiming that her government has given land rights to people settled in refugee colonies in the state, the chief minister said, "The BJP has sent 14 lakh Bengalis in Assam to detention camps. The same fate may await you if they come to power in West Bengal."She asserted that though she is a Brahmin woman and a devout Hindu who knows mantras by heart, caste identity is not important to her."I consider myself inseparable from Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, Sikhs, SCs, STs, OBCs and all other communities. We don't exclude anyone in the name of caste, community or religion. Unlike the BJP, we consider everyone as humans," she said."One of the BJP MPs, contesting the assembly polls, has herself damaged the windscreen of her car to give a bad name to the TMC," she said, in an apparent reference to an incident in which the car of saffron party leader Locket Chatterjee was damaged during a TMC protest in Chunchura assembly seat.

12-04-2021||New Delhi||SC rejects plea against dismantling of decommissioned aircraft carrier 'Viraat'||The Supreme Court Monday dismissed a plea of a private firm seeking preservation of India's decommissioned aircraft carrier 'Viraat' and its conversion into a museum. A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian took note of the fact that the Ministry of Defence has refused to accept the representation of private firm Envitech Marine Consultants Pvt Ltd that the decommissioned aircraft carrier be preserved. "You cannot do this. The (Bombay) high court had allowed you to give representation to the government. You did it. The government (Ministry of Defence) dismissed it. You did not challenge it," the bench said.In the proceedings conducted through video conferencing, the bench refused to accept submissions of Rupali Sharma, representative of Envitech Marine, that this is a "national treasury" and needed to be saved. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan appeared for Shree Ram Group which had purchased the ship and said, "they had approached the Ministry of Defence. Ministry says no. The matter ends. The petition has to be disposed of." Earlier on April 5, the apex court had asked the petitioner firm to file its response on the report of status of dismantling of the warship.The centaur-class aircraft carrier, INS Viraat, was in service with the Indian Navy for 29 years before being decommissioned in March 2017.'Viraat' had reached the Alang ship breaking yard in Gujarat from Mumbai in September last year and the dismantling process was going on.Another private firm Shree Ram Group at Alang in Bhavnagar district of Gujarat has bought Viraat at an auction in July last year for Rs 38.54 crore and began the dismantling process in December last year.The bench, after perusing the report on the status of dismantling of 'Viraat', had asked the private firm Envitech Marine Consultants Pvt Ltd if 40 per cent of the warship has been dismantled after a valid purchase by another company, then why does it want to take it for making a museum.Rupali Sharma, representing  Envitech Marine, had said that she would like to inspect the ship to ascertain the status of dismantling and added that, “around the world these warships are preserved”.“We have already dismantled around 40 per cent of the ship and all important parts have been taken out,” Dhavan had said while referring to the report filed by Shree Ram Group that major fixtures like machinery, navigation devices, and furniture have all been taken out.   He had said, “The vessel is totally grounded and is a dead structure” and even the Centre has refused to give no objection certificate for making the warship a museum.The bench had then asked Sharma to go through the report filed by Shree Ram Group and file the response in one week.On February 10, the top court had ordered status quo on dismantling of 'Viraat' and sought responses from the Centre and Shree Ram Group on the plea of Envitech Marine, which has offered to pay Rs 100 crore for the ship, so that it can be converted into a museum.The Centre had in July 2019 informed Parliament that the decision to scrap Viraat was taken after due consultation with the Indian Navy.Viraat is the second aircraft carrier which is being dismantled in India. In 2014, Vikrant was dismantled in Mumbai. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-rejects-plea-against-dismantling-of-decommissioned-aircraft-carrier-viraat-238128
12-04-2021||Satya Prakash||SC refuses to entertain BJP leader's PIL for increasing HC judges' retirement age to 65||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 12The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain Delhi BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay's PIL seeking to increase the age of retirement of high court judges from 62 years to 65 years."You want judiciary to enhance its own (judges') age of retirement? "Why do you want judges to work till 65 years of age?" the CJI asked Upadhyay.The petitioner submitted that both the Supreme Court and High Court are constitutional courts and courts of record and the disparity in the age of retirement was irrational and arbitrary.While the Supreme Court judges retire at 65 the age of retirement for High Court judges is 62 years, he pointed out."How can you call it irrational?" the CJI asked.As the Bench made it clear that it won't hear the PIL, Upadhyay chose to withdraw it.The Bench didn't agree with the petitioner that due to early retirement age, finest lawyers didn't want to become judges.Later, Upadhyay said, "I will submit my representation to the Law Ministry and the Law Commission of India."As almost one third of the 1079 posts of judges in 25 high courts across India remain vacant, Upadhyay had moved in the Supreme Court, seeking to raise their age of retirement from 62 years to 65 years.His PIL demanded uniform retirement age for judges of High Courts and the Supreme Court.Uniformity in the retirement age is not only necessary to reduce pendency of cases but also essential to attract and retain the best legal talent in the bench, he had submitted.if there was uniformity in retirement age, the Judges of the High Court will discharge judicial work more independently and without any expectation to move to the Supreme Court, it submittedThe PIL contended that to minimise the apprehension of subordination between the Supreme Court and High Courts also, it was appropriate to equate the retirement age of High Court Judge's with Supreme Court judges.Terming it as “irrational” to have different retirement age for judges of constitutional courts, Upadhyay said increasing the retirement age and making it uniform i.e 65 years will not only strengthen the rule of law, but also secure the fundamental right of speedy justice, guaranteed under Article 21.Uniformity in the retirement age of Judges will create a pool of experienced judges in High Courts, which will be extremely useful for deciding the cases of extreme importance or which require deep and thorough knowledge for interpretation of the Constitution, the PIL submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-bjp-leaders-pil-for-increasing-hc-judges-retirement-age-to-65-238127

12-04-2021||Haridwar||Kumbh Mela: Lakhs take dip in Ganga on ‘shah snan’ amid rising coronavirus cases||Amid rising coronavirus cases nationwide, a sea of saffron-clad seers and ash-smeared Nagas converged at Har ki Pairi in Haridwar for a holy dip in the Ganga during the second ‘shah snan’ of the Kumbh Mela on Monday.Led by their ‘mahamandaleshwaras’, the sadhus from different akhadas took out “shobha yatras” through the main thoroughfare of the pilgrimage city to gather at Brahma Kund, Hari ki Pauri for the shah snan—or the royal bath—on Somvati Amavasya.Marching barefoot to their destination, the seers took a dip in the river as they were showered with flower petals from helicopters arranged by the Uttarakhand government.Masks were not worn by a large proportion and social distancing appeared impossible at an event in which, according to Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat, about 35 lakh people participated.As the mammoth exercise was on, Mela Inspector General Sanjay Gunjyal said 100 per cent compliance with COVID-19 norms was not possible with such a large crowd of seers converging on the ghats. But efforts were on to ensure that everyone adhered to them, he added.While Har ki Pauri, considered the holiest of the ghats was reserved for the akhadas from 7 am onwards, common people took the dip at the other ghats of the Ganga, revered by millions as a goddess.Seers from Niranjani Akhada led by their mahamandaleshwar Acharya Kailashanand Giri were the first at this ghat. Sadhus from Ananda Akhada also went to the river with them.They were followed by the Joona Akhada seers.Former King of Nepal Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah, on his maiden visit to Haridwar, was among the devotees who took a bath in the river.It was the second shahi snan during the ongoing Kumbh Mela, which has been limited to just one month due to rising cases of coronavirus.The last ‘royal bath’ was conducted on the occasion of Mahashivratri on March 11.  Har Ki Pauri resonated with the chants of Har Har Mahadev throughout the day as the akhadas descended on the ghat in batches.Sadhus from the Bada Akhada briefly sat on a dharna on the road, protesting that they were not being allowed to go up to the ghat during the time slot given to them.The “delay” took place because the previous batch of Bairagi seers had taken a little longer than scheduled for their ‘snan’.The akhada of transgenders led by mahamandaleshwar Lakshmi Narayan Tripathi took the dip along with the Joona Akhada seers. They came to Har ki Pauri dancing to drum beats.However, Acharya Lakshmi Narayan took ill and fainted soon after the ritual bath and was rushed to hospital in an ambulance.Maha Nirvani Akhada seers led by its mahamandaleshwar Vishokanand Maharaj arrived at the ghat at the end of a procession. Before taking a dip themselves, they bathed an idol of the Sun god kept in a palanquin.More than 20,000 police and paramilitary personnel kept an eye over the mela area spread over 600 hectares.At the end of the shahi snan, Chief Minister Rawat said the event was held on a grand scale, keeping its religiosity and fervour intact “despite the odds posed by the pandemic”.Mela IG Gunjyal said the snan was conducted in an uninterrupted manner with no untoward incident being reported from anywhere in the mela kshetra extending from Haridwar to Devprayag.“It was a huge exercise as security personnel deployed on the ghats had to keep the batches of seers and devotees thronging the ghats apart to prevent chaos,” the officer said.He said they had to ensure that each batch left the ghat in a safe manner, and in time to make room for the next group without disrupting the schedule.

Many of the protesters, driving tractors, reached the Red Fort and entered the monument, where a religious flag was also hoisted. Over 500 police personnel were injured in the violence.In a statement, the police said it is learnt that allegations and misinformation are being propagated on the social media regarding the detention of one Gurdeep Singh alias Mundi by a Delhi Police team in Punjab.Several cases were registered by Delhi Police in connection with the Republic Day violence, a large number of suspects have been examined and about 160 accused belonging to Delhi and several other states arrested. Sidhana is wanted in some of these cases and is deliberately evading arrest, the statement said.According to the police, on April 8, a Special Cell team that was moving in the vicinity of Patiala in search of Sidhana, questioned Singh. He was asked about the presence and movements of Sidhana and thereafter, he was relieved with a direction to appear and join investigation as and when required."The investigation is being conducted as per law and in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is relevant to note that no allegation of assault or mistreatment has been made by any of the 160 accused arrested by Delhi Police in these cases so far," the statement said."The allegations pertaining to illegal detention and physical assault are strongly denied as being false, baseless and an afterthought to put pressure on the investigating teams," it added.

12-04-2021||Bardhaman (WB)||Mamata ‘clean bowled’, her entire team asked to leave field: Modi||Drawing a cricket analogy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday the people of Bengal have hit so many fours and sixes in the first four phases of the Assembly polls that the BJP has already completed its century and the TMC is on course to being wiped out.He came down hard on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, accusing her of instigating people against central forces on election duty in the state.The Prime Minister also launched a blistering attack on Banerjee, saying she did not care to express regret after a "leader very close to her" called Scheduled Castes "beggars"."People of Bengal hit so many fours and sixes that the BJP has already completed a century (of seats) in the first four phases of Assembly polls. They have wiped out the TMC in half the match (aadha mein poora saaf)."People of Bengal have clean bowled Didi in Nandigram and asked her entire team to leave the field," he told an election rally in Bardhaman.Mocking TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee's ‘Ma, Mati, Manush’ slogan, the Prime Minister said, "Tormenting 'Ma', looting 'Mati' (motherland) and bloodshed of 'Manush' (people) is its reality."Alleging that Banerjee incited people against central forces, he referred to the killing of four people in the firing by CISF personnel in Cooch Behar on April 10."Your (Banerjee's) policies have snuffed out the lives of children of countless mothers," he said.Modi castigated Banerjee over a TMC leader and candidate's comments against the Scheduled Castes equating them with beggars."Didi calls herself a Royal Bengal Tiger. You tell me is it possible for someone to say such things without her permission? Such comments hurt the soul of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar. You have committed the biggest mistake, the biggest sin by insulting Dalits, Didi," Modi said.Accusing Benerjee of dividing people, Modi said “Jukto Koro-Seva Koro” (uniting people and serving them) is his motto."Didi knows the Congress could not return once ousted, Left could not return once removed from power, you too will never be able to bounce back," he said.

Crush The Curve.Back to Basics. #keralapolice #CovidVaccine (sic)," Kerala Police's tweet read, using the contemporary way of promoting the vaccines among the public.Meanwhile, Naveen got over 6.7 lakh likes for the video he posted on his Instagram page and Janaki posted the video on her Youtube channel. It was watched by nearly five lakh people.A post shared by Naveen K Razak (@naveen_k_razak)  "A usually dead phone of mine and a pretty not-so- frequently active social media user myself have been on the buzz for the past few days," Naveen wrote on his instagram page.Both Naveen and Janaki sought to ignore the comments made by the lawyer about their dance.As the social media started discussing their religion, fellow students of Janaki and Naveen posted another video with more students dancing to 'Rasputin'.They all appeared in a video wearing their scrubs and masks.Naveen and Janaki made an appearance in the video for a few seconds.

12-04-2021||Washington||Deepening of US-India partnership in military, security sphere 'destined to occur': Ash Carter||A deepening partnership between the US and India in the military and security sphere is "destined to occur" as there is too much in common between the two large democracies that share really good values, according to former American defence secretary Ash Carter.Speaking at a US Chamber of Commerce hosted session, Carter said the two countries shared more than just the English language."In fact, it is destined. I think it's in fact destined to occur because there's just too much in common between us… In interests, in functioning,” Carter, who was defence secretary from 2015 to 2017 under the Obama administration, said when asked if he felt going forward by deepening partnership with India that extends powerfully to the military and security sphere."I'll give you an example. The last conversation I had with (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi when I was in office. He and I were reflecting on something that wasn't germane to every particular that we were discussing. But I was remarking to him, how many Indian and Indian-American entrepreneurs there were in the tech world, in the United States. And I said, there's something kindred about mentalities there,” he said."It's not just the English language. It's more than that. I think two large democracies, which on their good days share really good values. I think they're destined,” Carter, currently Director of the Belfer Center for Science & International Affairs at Harvard Kennedy School, said.Carter, however, cautioned that the United States must be aware of the past, including India's policies of non-alignment and its historic military ties with Russia.“So, when you look back at the history of India, you find the non-aligned tradition, which goes deeply and says you've gotta be ready to take care of yourself. So don't get too dependent on your relations with any other country that's changing over the decades, but it's still there,” he said."Second is their links to Russia, which we had to think about as a military because a lot of Indian equipment is Russian and they can't just throw it all out and start all over. Can't afford to do that. And, so they're going to keep working with the Russians and that's part of their history also,” Carter said.Those two things and other things will mean that it will go steadily, but at its own pace, he said."I think it's destiny. And I think it's a huge thing for both of our countries. I always did everything I could to accelerate the pace, but I was also realistic because people are coming from where people are coming from,” he said."We do need to span that distance and we're not going to be able to operate if we're talking about China now up against China, the way we used to. We understand that. That's unrealistic. So, you do have to go longer distances. I'll give you two ways among many that you do that,” Carter said in response to a question on how can the US create a significant deterrent presence including intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR).One is by having longer-legged aircraft for ISR, that is intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, which is being made by General Atomics, in order to specifically expand that distance in recognition of the fact that many in the US have now belatedly, unfortunately, finally come to the view that the Chinese are not turning out the way America wanted back in the nineties and the US needs to protect itself, he said.“And the other way you do it is our bomber, the B-2 bomber, …, it's going to be part of this future. But the big thing is friends and allies in the region. That's the big way that we maintain America as a palpable power. That's why I was in favour of things like TPP. That's not going to happen,” Carter said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/deepening-of-us-india-partnership-in-military-security-sphere-destined-to-occur-ash-carter-238086

The demands are also the same -- all three 'black' farm laws should be repealed, a new law made to ensure MSP (minimum support price) for crops,” Tikait was quoted as saying in a statement issued by BKU media in-charge Dharmendra Malik.The BKU national spokesperson's remarks came in response to Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij urging Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar to resume talks with protesting farmers amid the coronavirus scare looming large.Maintaining that a surge in the coronavirus cases is being seen across the country and the situation is turning bad in Haryana too, Vij said he is worried about the farmers protesting on the state borders with Delhi.The protesters and the government last had a formal dialogue over the contentious issue on January 22 but the impasse continued.

12-04-2021||Shubhadeep Choudhury||TMC-BJP slugfest over Cooch Behar violence||Tribune News ServiceKolkata, April 11Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday launched a scathing attack against West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, accusing her of indulging in “appeasement politics” even in case of deaths.At Shantipur in West Bengal, Shah said the death of four persons in firing by the central forces in Sitalkuchi was tragic.“Unidentified people attacked a polling booth. They tried to snatch weapons from jawans. When the central forces fired shots in self-defence, four persons were killed,” he said.The minister said what made the matter worse was the way the incident was being politicised. “I have seen Mamata’s statement. In the same booth, Anand Burman was murdered in the morning. He was killed by goons to stop polling. But Mamata paid homage to only those killed in firing by the central forces. She ignored Anand Burman,” Shah said after holding a roadshow in Shantipur. Stating that Mamata mourned those killed in firing because they were Muslims, Shah alleged that a tragedy was also treated as fodder by Mamata for votes.“This shows how low she can stoop. We are saddened not only by Anand Burman’s death, but also the other four who died in firing. Mamata did not even mention him in any of her statements or paid him homage,” Shah said.“Was it because Anand Burman was from the Rajbangshi community and not fit for her vote bank?” Shah asked.The Home Minister said Mamata, while addressing an election rally at Sitalkuchi recently, advised people to gherao central forces, instigating them to attack them.The Home Minister urged her to condole the death of first-time voter Anand Burman also and apologise to the people for the death of four persons. Earlier, Mamata spoke to the family members of the victims. She assured them of all help and said she would try to meet them on April 14.BJP moves EC against TMC’s Sujata Mondal||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-bjp-slugfest-over-cooch-behar-violence-237997

Both sides should also adhere to the consensus reached in the previous talks, the state-run China Global Television Network (CGTN) on Sunday quoted the press release by a PLA spokesperson on the talks held at the Chushul border point on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-must-cherish-positive-trend-of-de-escalation-chinese-military-237966
12-04-2021||New Delhi||FDI in pension sector may be hiked to 74%||The government may hike foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in the pension sector to 74 per cent and a Bill in this regard is expected to come in the next Parliament session, according to sources.Last month, Parliament approved a Bill to increase FDI limit in the insurance sector from 49 per cent to 74 per cent. The Insurance Act, 1938, was last amended in 2015, which raised FDI limit to 49 per cent, resulting in foreign capital inflow of Rs 26,000 crore in the last five years.Amendment to Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) Act, 2013, seeking to raise FDI limit in the pension sector may come in the monsoon session or winter session depending on various approvals, sources said.Currently, the FDI in the pension fund is capped at 49 per cent. Besides, sources said, the amendment Bill may contain separation of NPS Trust from the PFRDA. The powers, functions and duties of the NPS Trust, which are currently laid down under the PFRDA (National Pension System Trust) Regulations 2015, may come under a charitable trust or the Companies Act, they said.The intent behind this is to keep NPS Trust separate from the pension regulator and managed competent board of 15 members. Out of this, the majority of members are likely to be from the government as they, including states, are the biggest contributor to the corpus. The PFRDA was established for promoting and ensuring the orderly growth of the pension sector with sufficient powers over pension funds, the central recordkeeping agency and other intermediaries. It also safeguards the interest of members.The National Pension System (NPS) was introduced by the government to replace the defined benefit pension system. The NPS was made mandatory for all new recruits to the Central Government service from January 1, 2004, (except the armed forces in the first stage) and has also been rolled out for all citizens with effect from May 1, 2009, on voluntary basis.The government had made a conscious move to shift from the defined benefit, pay-as-you-go pension scheme to defined contribution pension scheme, NPS, due to rising and unsustainable pension bill. The transition aimed at freeing the limited resources of the government for more productive and socio-economic sectoral development. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fdi-in-pension-sector-may-be-hiked-to-74-237965

The secretary quoted findings of the central teams stationed in 50 districts of Punjab, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh. PM Narendra Modi launched ‘Tika Utsav’, a vaccination drive between April 11 and 14, describing the event as the “beginning of the second major war against Covid”.“In this war we have to pay special attention to personal and social hygiene,” the PM said, pushing for micro-containment zones.As the daily Covid cases crossed a new peak of 1,52,879 cases today and active cases reached 11,08,987 mark, the PM appealed on Tika Utsav, “Our success will depend on our awareness regarding micro-containment zones, our ability to avoid unnecessary venturing out of home, our zeal to ensure that all eligible people are vaccinated and our respect for masks and other protocols.”The PM used the occasion (Tika Utsav will be marked from today, the birth anniversary of Jyotiba Phule, until April 14, the birth anniversary of Dr BR Ambedkar) to stress three messages for people – each one vaccinate one, each one treat one and each one save one.“Let us help the older people with vaccination; let us aid the lesser privileged with Covid treatment; let us wear masks and save ourselves and others,” said the PM.Even as the Utsav was launched, vaccine shortage continued to bog the inoculation drive with reports of 900 session sites closing down in Odisha due to the supplies running out.The government, meanwhile, said it was considering the financial aid request from the Serum Institute of India which has sought help of Rs 3,000 crore to expand production. Currently, the SII produces around 21 lakh vaccine doses daily out of India’s daily production capacity of 23.2 lakh doses. As the daily vaccine administration swells (35,19,987 doses were administered in the last 24 hours), the supply will get stressed further. Top government sources said funding mechanisms for augmenting vaccine stocks were being studied.Meanwhile SII chief executive officer Adar Poonaawala has said production is likely to be up by June.Ten states contributing 80.92 pc of the over 1.52 lakh daily cases today are Maharashtra (55,411), Chhattisgarh (14,098), UP (12,798), Delhi (7,897) Karnataka (6,955), Kerala (6,194), Tamil Nadu (5,989), Gujarat (5,011), Madhya Pradesh (4,986), Rajasthan (4,401).So far as 11,08,087 active cases go, these now make up 8.29 pc of the total 1,33,58,805 cases in India.Govt to consider SII grant requestThe Centre said it was considering the financial aid request from the Serum Institute of India, which has sought Rs3,000 cr to expand production.

In all above districts, more than 75 per cent of the infected are under home isolation, mandating strict monitoring by the state health authorities.The proportion of the positive persons isolated at home in the state are — Ludhiana 100 per cent, SAS Nagar 95, SBS Nagar 88.5, Jalandhar 82.3, Amritsar 78.6, Patiala 78, Hoshiarpur 77.82 and Rupnagar 77.3 per cent. Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan flagged the above gaps to Punjab Principal Secretary, Health, Hussan Lal in a letter on Saturday, urging enhanced contact tracing in Patiala and Ludhiana.“Contact tracing and surveillance efforts in SAS Nagar are being hampered due to shortage of manpower. Low rates of testing have been reported from Patiala. There is no RT-PCR testing laboratory in Rupnagar. This has to be addressed urgently,” Bhushan said.Citing the findings of the Central teams, Bhushan said there was no dedicated Covid hospital in SAS Nagar and Rupnagar and patients were being referred to Chandigarh and other districts.“The teams have reported lack of Covid care centre and dedicated Covid hospital in Rupnagar. Hospital bed occupancy rates in SAS Nagar, Jalandhar and Ludhiana are on the higher side and must be addressed in view of the surge. They have also reported issues with procurement of ventilators for proper case management in SBS Nagar and Rupnagar. Although ventilators are available, these are not being optimally utilised due to shortage of healthcare workforce, particularly doctors and nurses,” Bhushan said, advising Punjab to hire contractual workers. He said shortage of healthcare workforce had been reported from Patiala and SAS Nagar also.ICU bed occupancy Ventilator occupancy (%)SAS Nagar 30 Hoshiarpur 20 Jalandhar 27.4 Ludhiana 8 SBS Nagar 8 Patiala 6.64Amritsar 6.5||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-flags-gaps-in-punjab-health-infrastructure-237896

India has been insisting that a resolution of outstanding issues including in Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra is essential for overall ties between the two countries.

I would like to visit Sitalkuchi by April 14. The EC is trying to suppress facts by restricting entry in Cooch Behar. We have an incompetent home minister and an incompetent central government,” Banerjee said.Four persons died on Saturday when CISF personnel opened fire allegedly after coming under attack from locals, who “attempted to snatch their rifles”, the police had said.“The CISF doesn’t know how to handle situations. Since the first phase of elections, I had been saying that a section of the central forces are committing atrocities on people. I had flagged the issue in Nandigram, but none paid attention to my words,” she stated.The feisty TMC chief also spoke to the brother of one of the deceased over a video call, in the midst of the press meet, and promised all help to the bereaved family.The man, on his part, was heard saying that the jawans had opened fire on the voters.“He (one of the four killed in firing) was standing in a queue when the jawans opened fire. His wife is pregnant.They also have a three-year-old child. Our parents are shocked and devastated,” the man told the CM.Banerjee asked a local TMC leader, who made arrangements for the video chat from Sitalkuchi, to send her a copy of the FIR filed in connection with the incident.“I will be addressing election meetings today, but with a heavy heart. The episode keeps haunting me,” the CM said, adding that party workers will stage protests against the incident across the state.Taking to Twitter, Banerjee, in a jibe at the poll panel, also said that the “EC should rename MCC (Model Code of Conduct) as Modi Code of Conduct!”“BJP can use all its might but NOTHING in this world can stop me from being with my people & sharing their pain.They can restrict me from visiting my brothers & sisters in Cooch Behar for 3 days but I WILL be there on the 4th day!,” she posted on the microblogging site.

Our success will be decided by us not stepping outside homes when not needed. Our success will be decided by that those eligible for the vaccine get it. Our success will be decided by as to how much we adhere to wearing masks and following other protocols,” he said.“Anyone eligible for the vaccine should get the jab, and for this the society and administration have to make full efforts,” he added.Pitching for “zero vaccine waste”, he said it has to be ensured that not a single jab is wasted.“We have to move towards optimum utilisation of the country’s vaccination capacity.
