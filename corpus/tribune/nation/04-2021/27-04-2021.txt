27-04-2021||Pune||Maharashtra: Woman accused falls to death from Pune hospital||A 45-year-old woman, arrested in an abetment to suicide case, allegedly fell to her death from the Sassoon General Hospital building, where she was admitted after testing positive for COVID-19, here on Tuesday, police said.According to the police, the woman may have fallen while allegedly trying to escape from the window of a bathroom on the eighth floor of the state-run hospital.“The incident took place at around 4.30 pm. Prima facie probe indicates that the woman was trying to escape by removing glass pieces from the bathroom window and fell into the duct while coming down, dying on the spot,” said Chandrakant Sangle, assistant commissioner of police (Lashkar division).The deceased had latched the door of the bathroom from inside, the official said.Ruling out the possibility of a suicide, he said the duct area between the two wings of the hospital is hardly three to four feet and one cannot think of jumping from there.“It is clear that the woman had sneaked out of the bathroom window on the eighth floor, but it is difficult to say from which point she fell while coming down,” Sangle said.The deceased and her accomplice Nilesh Shelar were arrested by the Vishrambaug police for allegedly abetting the suicide of Milind alias Balwant Marathe.Marathe was injured after he shot himself with a gun on December 15, 2020 at his shop and succumbed to the bullet injury later.The jeweller’s wife had registered a case under section 306 (abetment to suicide) against the accused duo, alleging that they had been harassing her husband since 2018 by demanding the money they had invested in his company.The Pune police had also invoked the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against the duo.

27-04-2021||New Delhi||Medical oxygen in any country cannot be unlimited, augmenting measures being taken: Centre to SC||The Centre on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that medical oxygen in any country cannot be unlimited and with the active and constant supervision of the prime minister it is augmenting the oxygen supply on a war footing to provide relief to COVID-19 patients.The government said oxygen supplies available at any given time in the country are to be distributed to all the states, especially those which are critically burdened with high number of active COVID cases, in a balanced manner.The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said the sheer magnitude of this unprecedented surge in COVID-19 cases itself bring with it certain inbuilt limitations in terms of available resources which need to be professionally augmented and utilised.            Further, the Centre said to deal with shortage of medical oxygen, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is in the process of commissioning 162 PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption technology to generate oxygen at local level) plants across the country on a war footing.            In its 200-page affidavit, filed in the suo motu case on distribution of essential supplies and services during pandemic, the Centre said “any singular/isolated deviation in such plan for a particular state (either under a judicial order or otherwise) without keeping in mind the national availability and ever changing requirements of each state is bound to have a cascading effect on oxygen supply to other states”.The affidavit was taken on record by a Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, which posted the matter for further hearing on Friday.          “It is also pertinent to note that the medical oxygen in any country cannot be unlimited. While the government started all out efforts to augment oxygen resources and procure more and more oxygen from all available sources, these supplies available at any given time in the country are to be distributed to all the states, especially those which are critically burdened with high number of active COVID cases, in a balanced manner,” the government said.It said, “The Central government, with active and constant supervision and direct involvement of the prime minister and the home minister, is augmenting the oxygen supply on a war footing evolving and implementing innovative measures”.The affidavit filed by additional secretary, MHA, said ever since the onset of the current wave of pandemic, there is an unprecedented and rapid rise in the number of active COVID cases in several states across the country with an almost unabated surge in the growth rate of such cases.“It is submitted that the medical oxygen is a critical component in the treatment of COVID affected patients, especially in the second wave. The entire available capacity of oxygen in India was utilised for supply for industrial as well as medical purposes in the form of Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO),” it said.It said the “unexpected and exponential” surge in the number of active COVID cases across several states in the second wave has resulted in a scenario wherein there has been an increasing demand for medical oxygen, especially from the states with a high burden of active COVID cases.         “It is pertinent to note that while the demand in Maharashtra is expected to be beyond available production capacity of the state, states like Madhya Pradesh do not have any production capacity to meet their demand for medical oxygen. Besides, there is also a trend of increasing demand in other oxygen producing states themselves”, the Centre said.It said to give clarity and assurance to the states on oxygen supplied over the next few weeks of surge in cases, an exercise for mapping of sources of supplies to the medical oxygen demand of the critically affected states was undertaken by different departments and states were requested to provide these progressive projections forecast for requirement for medical oxygen as on April 20, April 25 and April 30, respectively.

27-04-2021||New Delhi||SC asks Centre to explain rationale behind different price slabs of COVID-19 vaccines||The Supreme Court Tuesday took note of different prices of COVID-19 vaccines for Centre, states and the private hospitals and asked the central government to explain to it the “rationale and basis” behind such a pricing policy.The top court, hearing a suo motu case related to ‘distribution of essential supplies and services during pandemic’, also asked the Centre as to how it was going to meet the sudden surge in demand of vaccines from May 1 when vaccination for all above 18 years of age would begin.“The Union of India shall clarify in its affidavit the basis and rationale adopted in regard to the pricing of vaccines,” said the bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud while fixing the suo motu case for hearing on Friday.“Different manufacturers are coming out with different prices. What is Centre doing about it,” said the bench, which also comprised justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat.In the proceedings conducted through video conferencing, senior advocate and SCBA (Supreme Court Bar Association) President Vikas Singh informed the bench that there has been different price slabs for vaccines to be procured by the Centre, states and the private hospitals.The bench referred to the powers of the Centre under the Drugs Control law to control the price of medicines and said the pandemic was “perhaps the right time to invoke such powers”.“This is a pandemic and a national crisis. If this is not the time to issue such powers, what is,” it asked.The pricing policy has allowed vaccine manufacturers to fix the price and under it, Serum Institute of India has announced that it will sell Covishield to states at Rs 400 per dose and to private hospitals at the rate of Rs 600 per dose.However, it has been selling the vaccine at Rs 150 per dose to the Centre, one of the lawyers said.Referring to expanding the age group of vaccination, the bench said, “if vaccination is open to above 18 we need to know how you are going to meet the increased surge in demand for vaccines”.The bench also asked the Centre to apprise the top court of the modalities on distribution of oxygen as well as the vaccines to states and the monitoring mechanism.The bench on April 22 took note of the pandemic situation due to sudden surge in COVID-19 cases as also in mortality and said it expected the Centre to come out with a “national plan” to deal with distribution of essential services and supplies, including oxygen and drugs.Observing that oxygen to patients infected with the virus is said to be an “essential part” of treatment, the top court had said it seemed that a certain amount of “panic” has been generated due to which people have approached several high courts seeking relief. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-centre-to-explain-rationale-behind-different-price-slabs-of-covid-19-vaccines-244984
27-04-2021||New Delhi||ICMR advises against NSAIDs, says some painkillers found to worsen COVID||Some painkillers like Ibuprofen are found to worsen COVID-19, known to be harmful to heart failure patients and may increase risk of kidney damage, the ICMR said as it advised against taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and recommended taking paracetamol, if needed, during the disease.Listing a series of frequently asked questions (FAQs) for patients with hypertension, diabetes and heart diseases, the ICMR said currently there is no evidence that BP medications—two group of drugs ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) -- increase the susceptibility or severity of COVID-19.Over reports of BP medications increasing the severity of the disease, the apex health research body said, “After the review of available information, the consensus of various scientific societies and expert group of cardiologists is that currently there is no evidence the two group of drugs—ACE inhibitors (eg. Ramipril, Enalapril and so on) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (eg. Losartan, Telmisartan and so on) increase the susceptibility or severity of COVID-19.”“These drugs are very effective for heart failure by supporting heart function and controlling high blood pressure. It maybe be harmful to stop these medications by yourself. This can worsen your heart condition,” the ICMR said.It said majority (80 per cent) of people diagnosed with COVID-19 will have mild symptoms of a respiratory infection (fever, sore throat, cough) and make full recovery.On whether patients with heart disease, diabetes or hypertension are at an increased risk to get the infection, the apex health research body said, “No, people with hypertension, diabetes or heart diseases are at no greater risk of getting the infection than anyone else.” Some people with diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases, including heart failure (weak heart), may develop more severe symptoms and complications, it said, adding that extra care is advised for these patients.On whether people with diabetes are more prone to COVID-19, the ICMR said that in general, people with uncontrolled diabetes are at an increased risk of all infections.It said that people with diabetes are not at a higher risk of acquiring the infection, but some individuals are prone to more severe disease and poorer outcomes once infected. Hence, the ICMR advised following a diet and exercise routine (to the extent possible), taking medications regularly and testing sugar levels frequently so as to keep diabetes under control.When diabetic patients become sick, they may require frequent monitoring of blood glucose and adjustment of drugs, including insulin, small frequent meals and adequate fluids, it said.The ICMR said one should make sure to take all medications prescribed regularly as before, even if mildly symptomatic.“Don’t stop any medication unless advised by your doctor. Continue with your blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease medications in case you are unable to visit your doctor. Medications to control cholesterol (statins) should be continued,” it stated.It is also important to control risk factor levels, the ICMR said, adding avoid smoking and alcohol, have BP and blood sugar levels under control and have some form of regular physical activity keeping in mind social distancing norms.Follow the diet and salt restriction as advised. If a person is non-vegetarian, she can continue to be so, it said. Increasing fibre and protein content of the diet and including more vegetables and fruits is advisable, the ICMR said.  It advised people to wear a medical mask in crowded areas and in poorly ventilated rooms, making it a routine part of being around other people.The mask should cover nose, mouth and chin, the ICMR said, and advised against touching the mask frequently and maintaining a physical distance of at least one metre even while wearing it.“Wear a mask if a visitor comes to your home who is not a member of your household. Clean your hands before and after using a mask, and before touching it while still in use. Change the mask if it is soiled or wet, and dispose it properly in a trash bin,” the document said.It also advised people to follow social distancing, avoiding contact with anyone who shows symptoms of COVID-19 -- anyone having a cold or cough or fever—avoiding non-essential travel and use of public transport, avoiding public places, crowds and large family get-togethers. “Keep in touch with friends and relatives using phone, Internet, and social media. Avoid routine visits to hospitals/labs,” the ICMR said.It also said avoid handshakes and touching face with hands. It said hands should be washed with soap and water frequently for at least 20-30 seconds and all parts of the hand must be systematically cleaned.Avoid touching possibly contaminated areas and objects like public toilet doors, door handles etc, the ICMR said. On getting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, it said one should call a doctor and seek advice on the phone, contact nearby laboratories and arrange for testing. While awaiting test results, one should stay at home and avoid close contact with family members, maintain hand hygiene, and correctly wear a medical mask.If one tests positive for COVID-19, they should isolate themselves at home as per the guidelines issued by Ministry of Health. If there is a worsening of symptoms, a doctor should be contacted for further advice, the ICMR added.

27-04-2021||New Delhi||India better prepared this year to beat COVID-19 compared to 2020: Harsh Vardhan||India is better prepared mentally and physically this year with more experience to beat the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to 2020, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Tuesday.He made this remark while inaugurating a series of blood donation camps at 13 locations in Chandigarh, Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh through a webinar in the presence of Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur, a Health Ministry statement said.The camps are being organised by the Competent Foundation with the help of various associations, NGOs and blood banks in wake of fulfilling the blood requisition due to COVID-19 pandemic, it said.Addressing the webinar, Vardhan appreciated the efforts of the foundation to organise blood donation camps with more strength and expansion for fulfilling the blood requirement due to the pandemic.    He exhorted people to at least donate blood once a year on their birthdays as it is a big help for humanity. He said that in his opinion, donating blood is even more pious than visiting revered holy places, the statement said.             Vardhan said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the largest vaccination drive in the world in January, which is now being accelerated further as the vaccination of young people is about to begin from May 1.He also said that in 2021, the country is better prepared mentally and physically with more experience to beat the pandemic as compared to last year, the statement stated.He appreciated the fact that this blood donation camp has been set up following all COVID protocols, guidelines and SOPs.         He said that the blood donation drive is being done before vaccination of youth which is commendable as after being vaccinated it is advisable to not donate blood for two months.President of Competent Foundation Sanjay Tandon said this year the foundation decided to organise blood donation camps beyond Chandigarh tricity in 13 different locations across the region with more strength in the wake of fulfilling the blood requirement during the COVID pandemic, the statement stated.He appealed that in the middle of coronavirus epidemic, blood donation has become more important because supply of blood has become extremely difficult.

27-04-2021||New Delhi||‘Govt has failed us’: Priyanka appeals to people be each other’s support to tide over COVID crisis||Alleging an abdication of leadership and governance by the Centre in the face of the COVID-19 second wave, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday urged people to show compassion and be each other’s strongest support to tide over the coronavirus crisis.In a Facebook post titled ‘We Shall Overcome’, Priyanka Gandhi said “by gathering up our strength amidst despair, by doing whatever we can to provide comfort to others, by refusing to tire and persisting with the will to carry on against all odds, we shall overcome”.Reaching out to people in an emotional post, the Congress general secretary said, “My heart is heavy as I write to you today. I know that many of you have lost your loved ones in the last few weeks, many have family members who are struggling for life, and many are grappling with the disease at home, anxious and afraid of what is to come.”Noting that there is no one who has not been affected by this “scourge”, she said that people across the country are “gasping for air, struggling to access medical care or simply to get the next dose of life saving medicine”.“The government has failed us all. Even those of us who oppose and fight them could not have foreseen a complete abdication of leadership and governance at a time as devastating as this. In our hearts, we too are still hoping that they will rise up and take steps that are imperative to save lives,” Priyanka Gandhi said.But even though those given the sacred task of governing this nation have “let the country down” at this time of great crisis, people must not lose hope, she said.Underlining that humanity has risen up to the challenge of adversity time and again, Priyanka Gandhi said India has seen great pain and suffering in the past as well, it has weathered cyclones and droughts, massive earthquakes, famines and devastating floods, and yet people’s spirit has not been broken.“Every time we have faced a calamity, ordinary people, people like you and me, have come forward. Humanity has never failed us,” she said.“Doctors, nurses and healthcare workers across our country are working endless hours under tremendous pressure, risking their own lives to save those who are suffering,” Priyanka Gandhi said.The business community is diverting resources towards helping hospitals gain access to oxygen and other supplies, and there are organisations and individuals in every village, district, town and city who are doing whatever they can to assist and comfort those who are in pain, she noted.“This basic goodness exists within each one of us. By reaching into it at times of great anguish our spirit as a nation can rise into its true grace and power,” the Congress leader said.Recognising the present time as a “turning point in our lives”, she said “we are being asked to push beyond all limits to find our own unlimited courage”.“We are being challenged to set aside feelings of helplessness and fear and stay brave. We are together as one in this fight, regardless of our religions, our castes, our class or any other distinctions. The virus does not recognise them,” Priyanka Gandhi said.“Let us show each other and the world the compassion and resilience that makes us Indian. We will be each other’s strongest support at this crossroads in our lives,” she said in her appeal to the people.The Congress-led Opposition has been criticising the government over its handling of the pandemic and the vaccination drive, while the government has rejected all such criticism by opposition parties.

The statements of the Congress leader are shameful and show insensitivity of his party, state BJP secretary Rajneesh Agrawal told PTI.Thakurs health issues were caused by “torture” under the Congress regime when she faced false charges, Agrawal said, apparently referring to the Malegaon blast case of 2008 in which she is an accused.Madhya Pradesh is reeling under a severe second wave of COVID-19, and Indore and Bhopal are among the worst- affected districts. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-leader-announces-reward-to-trace-missing-bjp-mp-244953
27-04-2021||New Delhi||'Indian strain' of coronavirus spreads faster, but little evidence of it being more lethal: Experts||The 'Indian strain' of the coronavirus carries higher transmissibility similar to the UK variant, but there is little evidence so far of it being more lethal than the original virus, experts have said.The B.1.617 variant of SARS-CoV2, also being called a 'double mutant' or the 'Indian strain', has been found prevalent largely in Maharashtra and Delhi that have been severely hit by a devastating second wave of the pandemic.In many cities in Maharashtra -- the worst-hit state in the country -- the B.1.617 variant was found in more than 50 per cent of samples on which genome sequencing was conducted, while the proportion of the UK variant was 28 per cent in the second week of March, Sujeet Singh, the Director of the National Centre for Disease Control, had said in a webinar on genome sequencing last week.The number of coronavirus cases has exploded in Delhi and Maharashtra over the last few weeks and crippled the healthcare sector. Several hospitals in Delhi have reported an acute shortage of medical oxygen and are scrambling to save the lives of patients.Anurag Agrawal, the Director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), told PTI, "As far as we know, neither the UK variant nor this one (B.1.617) is associated with increased severity of illness or death. The UK strain is proven to have higher transmissibility and B.1.617 may have increased transmissibility." "But this (that the B.1.617 variant has more transmissibility) has not been proven and there are several characterises to prove it and the studies have not been completed," he said.IGIB is one of the 10 laboratories spread across the country that are involved in genome sequencing of the virus.He, however, added that there is no comparison of which variant has increased transmissibility."But looking at Maharashtra's experience, it looks more transmissible, but it is yet to be proven. Looking at the general evidence, it (B.1.617) may be more transmissible," he said.When asked about the increased deaths in the state in comparison to the first wave last year, Agrawal said this has direct relation with how transmissible the variant is. The more the patients are infected, the more will be the toll, he said.The B.1.617 variant has three new spike protein mutations. Two mutations -- E484Q and L452R -- are in the area important for antibody-based neutralisation.The third mutation -- P681R -- allows the virus to enter cells a little better. These are defining characteristics of the variant.Soumitra Das, the Director of the National Centre for Biological Sciences, said there is no report on the lethality of B.1.617 yet.NCBS in Kalyani in West Bengal is one of the 10 organisations involved in the genome sequencing of the coronavirus.In a webinar on genome sequencing of the coronavirus last week, Das had said variants found in India are not really escaping our vaccinated sera, suggesting that the available vaccines are effective on them.In its initial result on the efficacy of the Covishield vaccine, the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, another premier institute that has been studying the virus, said the vaccine is effective against the B.1.617 strain. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-strain-of-coronavirus-spreads-faster-but-little-evidence-of-it-being-more-lethal-experts-244951

Out of them, three were later withdrawn and the hospital was now managing the transportation of COVID-19 patients in two ambulances."Sometimes, it takes time to trace the relatives of a dead patient. The bodies from the COVID-19 centre at Lokhandi Sawargaon village are also sent to our facility as they don't have a cold storage," the official said.He said they wrote to the district administration on March 17 to provide them three more ambulances."To avoid the chaos, we have also written to the Ambajogai Municipal Council to conduct the last rites of the victims between 8 am and 10 pm and the bodies will be sent to the crematoriums from the hospital ward itself," he said.Meanwhile, BJP MLC Suresh Dhas alleged that the hospital and the local civic body were passing the blame on each other.Talking to a TV channel, the legislator from Ashti in Beed said, "There is no control left and the government is not acting swiftly. The state administration has permitted ambulances to be provided from the MLA fund, but the technical sanction for it is given from Mumbai."Ambajogai Municipal Council's chief officer Ashok Sabale said it was the responsibility of the medical college to transport the bodies to the crematorium on Mandwa road (designated for the last rites of COVID-19 victims)."Our teams are there at the crematorium for conducting the last rites. A meeting was held on Monday over the issue during which the medical college dean said they do not have enough ambulances. If it is the case, didn't they have any review mechanism? Why didn't they act on it?" Sabale asked.Municipal council president Rajkishor alias Papa Modi also expressed concern over the incident and said the same day, eight more bodies were transported in another ambulance for cremation."We are going to provide one ambulance to the medical college and another two will be made available from the district administration," he said.The official said the local medical infrastructure is "stressed" as critical patients from nearby districts are also brought to Ambajogai.

Both times we left the tiffin at the help desk of the hospital, with the patient’s name and the ward number on it."Later, when the family called up the hospital helpline to check how Rajiv Mahajan was doing, the authorities said there was no patient in the Covid ward by that name. “This was horrifying as when we had arrived at the emergency the other day, a doctor had taken down details of my uncle. Everything was rushed because we, the attendants, were also coronavirus-positive. From that moment on, we kept making frantic calls to the hospital and each time we were told that no one by that name was there."At the same facility, we were leaving food for my uncle who was perhaps dead,” a shocked Sanya Mahajan said, wondering if many more Covid patients were similarly disappearing and later turning up dead.On April 25, the Mahajan family received a call from the police who asked them to come and collect the body.“We were told he had been dead since April 24 morning, just a day after we left him at the facility,” Deepak Mahajan, the elder brother of the deceased, says expressing helplessness.Down with severe Covid symptoms themselves, the Mahajan family was unable to collect the body and requested an acquaintance to help with the last rites.“We are all down with Covid and were unable to send off my uncle with dignity. His last rites had to be performed by an acquaintance, who collected the body from the police and cremated it on our behalf. The cops mentioned in the discharge slip that my uncle was indeed at the Lok Bandhu hospital,” Sanya says.What pains Sanya is that her father has spent years in social service helping street-dwellers with essentials and coming to the aid of anyone in need.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lucknow-family-left-food-at-hospital-for-covid-patient-didnt-know-he-was-already-dead-244906
27-04-2021||Washington||COVID-19: White House, Congress urged to deploy all resources to save lives in India||A Boston-based chamber has appealed  to the White House and Congress to leverage and deploy all available resources at their disposal to help save lives in India, warning that any delay in intervention from the US can make India's COVID-19 emergency a global health and economic crisis.India's unprecedented rise in COVID-19 cases, which has surpassed all global records, needs immediate help from the western countries. United States is the only country in the world which has the resources and assets to help India tide this crisis of unimaginable magnitude, USA India Chamber of Commerce (USAIC) which for more than a decade has been hosting the annual India US Pharma Summit in Boston."Failure to provide help in a timely manner on a war footing by the United States can result in loss of lives in India. USAIC appeals to the White House and the US congress to leverage and deploy all available resources at its disposal to help save lives in India,” said USAIC president Karun Rishi.“All lives are equal. It is about humanity. Precious lives being lost in India can be saved. Any delay in intervention from the US can make this a global crisis from the public health and economic point of view,” he said.Encouraged to see the movement of some assets from the US to India, Rishi said it needs to be scaled up 100 times to make an impact on the ground, be it oxygen concentrators, cryogenic tankers, vaccine raw materials or vaccines.“Many public health experts have recommended the US release surplus stockpile of AstraZeneca vaccines to India. USAIC is of the view that this should be done immediately in consultation with India. Multi-pronged attack on this crisis can help control the situation,” Rishi said, adding that the US industry has come together to support India in this crisis.BioPharma industry has been actively working with India to make vaccines available directly or through partners.USAIC applauded AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax for working to get their vaccines available in India. India with 1.3 billion people; one sixth of the world population will need more partnerships and vaccine technologies to overcome this pandemic.“One silver lining which has emerged is that this pandemic will speed up India's journey towards innovative research driven BioPharma industry. Global industry and academic partnerships will scale up. This will lead to innovative products for various therapeutics areas coming from India in the coming years. This will benefit patients worldwide,” Rishi said.Another organisation, Young India, on Monday released an advocacy paper for the US leadership to collaboratively execute with its Indian counterparts in response to the devastating wave of COVID-19 infections engulfing India.“One of our goals for publishing this time-sensitive document was to give US leadership at both the executive and legislative branches a snapshot of where things stood and what actions they could take,” said Rohit Tripathi of Young India.“The necessity for collaborative Indo-US action to prevent the bilateral relationship from experiencing deep harm and the serious need to fast track efforts to remove fair weather intellectual property bottlenecks are also emphasized,” he said.Young India has also shared this document with progressive diaspora organisations to help them shape their own advocacy with their contacts in these branches of government.In its policy paper, it urged the Biden administration to provide liquified oxygen stocks, oxygen concentrators, cryogenic tanks, refillable oxygen cylinders with 10 litres and 45 litres LMO capacity, and in situ oxygen manufacturing plants for hospitals.Seeking the release of a substantive portion of the AstraZeneca vaccine from American stockpile, the paper urged the United States to ease restrictions on exporting critical raw materials needed for manufacture of vaccines, imposed under the Defense Production Act (DPA). Products like bags and filters, cell culture media, single-use tubing assemblies and other such specialty raw materials needed for vaccines and COVID-19 therapeutics face a supply crunch, which can be alleviated by relaxing export restrictions under the DPA, it said.Noting that less than one per cent of the infections are currently being genome sequenced, it said providing aid to improve India's sequencing capabilities will help identify reasons behind the recent surge and guide a targeted response that will also be needed as the virulent strains from India spread globally.“This could either happen directly via CDC India or indirectly by knowledge transfer, expert consults, etc. The US could also consider establishing a US CDC field office in India that augments India's sequencing efforts and allows for broader epidemiological studies of infectious diseases such as TB, Malaria etc,” it said.

27-04-2021||Washington||US pharma firm Gilead to donate 4.5 lakh vials of remdesivir to India||American biopharmaceutical company Gilead has announced steps to expand the availability of remdesivir, a key therapeutic medicine used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, in India.Remdesivir is approved in India for restricted emergency use for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe disease."The recent surge of COVID-19 cases in India is having a devastating impact on communities and has created unprecedented pressure on health systems,” Johanna Mercier, chief commercial officer of Gilead Sciences said on Monday.The company announced that it was providing its voluntary licensing partners technical assistance, support for addition of new local manufacturing facilities and donation of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to rapidly scale up the production of remdesivir.In addition to providing support to its licences to expand their local manufacturing capacity, Gilead will also donate at least 450,000 vials of Veklury (remdesivir) to help address the immediate needs of Indian patients, the company said. “We are committed to doing our part to help tackle this crisis. Our immediate focus is to help address the needs of patients in India who may benefit from remdesivir as quickly as we can by working together with the government, health authorities and our voluntary licensees,” Mercier said.All seven of Gilead's licences based in India have significantly accelerated production of remdesivir by scaling up their batch sizes, adding new manufacturing facilities and/or onboarding local contract manufacturers across the country, it said.While these efforts are expected to increase the availability of remdesivir in the coming weeks, Gilead said it will also donate at least 4,50,000 vials of Veklury to the government of India to help ease the immediate need for treatment.Gilead's voluntary licensing programme for remdesivir, established in May 2020, has already enabled access to the drug for more than 2.3 million people in more than 60 low and middle-income countries.The programme, which builds on Gilead's pioneering voluntary licensing model for its HIV and viral hepatitis medicines, provides long-term licences to nine manufacturers, seven of which are based in India, to enable access to remdesivir in 127 countries.

27-04-2021||Washington||US lawmakers aggressively campaign for sending essential medical supplies to India||Cutting across ideological lines, influential American lawmakers have come out in support of India, urging the Biden Administration to urgently provide all possible help to the country in its fight against COVID-19.Describing India as one of the closest allies and foremost strategic partners, Congressman Adam Schiff, Chair of House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said when the COVID-19 pandemic pushed American hospitals to the brink of collapse, India came to America's immediate aid and supported it through this crisis."Now, as America continues on a cautiously steady path to recovery, India is facing the worst COVID-19 surge anywhere in the world, with hundreds of thousands of daily new cases, and thousands dying while waiting for access to life-saving care,” Schiff said.“This is a humanitarian crisis and an international emergency, and I'm grateful that the Biden Administration has elected to supply the raw materials, therapeutics, test kits, ventilators, and protective gear that India needs to get this unprecedented surge under control,” he said.“To beat COVID-19 at home, we must curb its spread abroad before it mutates and causes yet another painful surge on our shores. Helping India - as well as our allies and neighbours across the globe - is a moral imperative, and this kind of international cooperation is critical to ending this crisis,” Schiff said.Senator Dick Durbin said the announcement of US donations of key medical supplies to countries in need like India is the right decision for everyone involved. “This is a global pandemic — we all need to work together to overcome this virus,” he said.Senator Scott Peters said that the United States Senate stands with the people of India as they face a devastating COVID-19 surge.“My heart breaks over the tragedy unfolding in India, including the thousands of lives lost per day to the COVID-19 virus,” Indian-American Congressman Ami Bera said, adding that over the past several days, he has spoken with US Administration officials regarding the outbreak in India and the steps the US is taking to provide assistance.“I applaud the Biden Administration for its decision to send urgently needed resources to help the Indian people, including raw materials necessary for vaccine development, personal protective equipment (PPE), rapid diagnostic testing, and oxygen-related supplies,” he said.

During the call, Biden is understood to have offered all help that India needs in this hour of crisis."The president pledged America's steadfast ongoing support for the people of India, who have been impacted by the recent surge in the COVID-19 cases," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference.At India's request, the United States is exploring options to provide oxygen and related supplies. The Department of Defence and USAID are pursuing options to provide oxygen generation systems."We may be in a position to reroute shipments plan further countries with lower immediate needs given the urgency of the conditions in India, and we'll have more details, hopefully, on the possibility soon," she said.The Department of Defence, she said, is also exploring providing field oxygen generation systems, which the United States has used in its field medical hospitals.Each unit can provide oxygen for up to 50 to 100 beds. The administration is also exploring options to provide oxygen concentrators and ventilators and are in technical discussions with India to ensure the equipment that the US supplies can connect to Indian devices, the official added."The United States has already provided 200 ventilators to India last year and trained medical professionals on their use, so this is of course in addition to that and other assistance we have provided," Psaki said."Another one of the major needs is PPE, and we have identified US commercial suppliers as well. We have identified US commercial suppliers of remdesivir that are immediately available to help relieve the suffering of COVID-19 patients in India," she said.India has submitted a list of seven essential items that it needs on an urgent basis. These are oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders with 10 litre and 45 litre capacity, oxygen generators, oxygen generation plants, remdesivir, faviprivir, and tocilizumab.Psaki said the US has identified rapid diagnostic testing supplies, personal protective equipment, and additional ventilators available to be transferred to India immediately.The US is in close touch with India officials at all levels about the raw material needs that they have, she added.

We are focused on doing our very best to help in any way that we possibly can. As the prime minister said, we were very confident, our spirits were up after successfully tackling the first wave, but this storm has shaken the nation. It is up to us to help in any way possible," Renjen said in response to a question.Observing that the first issue is around oxygen and its concentrators, Renjen said they have commitments to get 20,000 oxygen concentrators to India in the next few weeks.The first 1,000 will arrive in the middle of this week, he said, adding that by May 5, they expect another 11,000 oxygen concentrators to reach the country."Our goal is to get 25,000, and maybe even a number higher than that," he added.The second issue is to look at oxygen cylinders with 10-litre and 45-litre capacity and to get other supplies like monitoring kits, Renjen said."I am very pleased with the fact that these companies have come together. We're working with the USISPF, as well as the USIBC … and with the Business Roundtable to coordinate this effort to help India in any way that that is required,” he said.Welcoming the call between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden and the decision of the US to urgently send supplies to India, the Deloitte CEO reiterated that the two countries are natural allies."I'm very heartened by the fact that the US government is going to step up and do its part," he said.

The increase can be largely attributed to India’s ongoing conflict with Pakistan and renewed border tension with China.“We can say with some certainty that the pandemic did not have a significant impact on global military spending in 2020,” the report said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-among-top-3-military-spenders-244733

Terming the logic as “unscientific”, sources said this was the second time China had done so.Biden dials PM ModiThe stoppage of flights by China due to the alleged risk of Covid will hit small-scale businessmen sourcing medical equipment for sale in India.“We will have to work on this and find viable ways around this ban,” said sources while confirming talks for a substantial package on commercial terms. Japan also promised to extend assistance following a phone call between PM Narendra Modi and his counterpart Yoshihide Suga. PM Modi will hold a virtual summit with the EU on May 8 to discuss Covid support and cooperation.The government is also negotiating for large tranches of medical assistance from Russia, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Singapore. Some supplies have started landing such as oxygen concentrators from the US, cryogenic oxygen containers from Singapore and oxygen transport tanks from Germany.With Biden taking the lead, Vice-President Kamala Harris, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy tweeted their solidarity with India and highlighted the decision to rush raw material for Indian manufacture of vaccines, besides ventilators, therapeutics and oxygen concentrators. A day earlier, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken too had tweeted in solidarity with India while NSA Jake Sullivan spoke to Ajit Doval.The full-court charm offensive was intended to take the edge of intense criticism in India and elsewhere over the US disrupting the supply chains. This attitude was in contrast to the joint pledge by the Quad countries to “address financing and logistical demands for production, procurement, and delivery” of vaccines.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/citing-risk-china-suspends-cargo-flights-to-india-244716

The Railways is transporting oxygen to high-surge states on a war footing,” Piyush Goyal, Additional Secretary, Home Ministry, said.The Ministry of Health, meanwhile, issued revised guidelines on oxygen, mandating hospitals to adjust the flow of oxygen to the lowest permissible level to target a saturation of 92 per cent to 94 per cent for hospitalised Covid patients and to encourage patients to lie in prone (on the stomach) position to enhance lung capacity. They also mandate hospitals to form oxygen monitoring teams for each shift at each hospital. “The team should visit all areas where oxygen therapy is instituted, inspect gas pipelines, wall mounted gas outlets as well as gas cylinders to detect and promptly address leakages, if any. At the facility level, an Oxygen Audit Committee must be formed to supervise inventory planning,” the guidelines say.Ganga Ram still in beg, borrow modeGanga Ram Hospital on Monday evening received 64 out of 104 oxygen cylinders it had sent for refill three days back, saying it continued to be in the beg and borrow mode receiving medical oxygen in tanks intermittently through the day on an hour-to-hour basis.3 sectors exempted from oxygen banA day after banning the use of liquid oxygen for non-medical purposes, the government on Monday allowed three sectors — ampules and vials, pharmaceutical and defence forces — to use the commodity. Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla had on Sunday imposed a ban on the use of liquid oxygen for non-medical purposes. TNSFive AMU teachers die in a week Five Aligarh Muslim University teachers have died in the past week after brief illnesses, some of them showing “Covid-like symptoms”. During the same period, five retired faculty members have also died. Two of the teachers died in the past 24 hours, with their family members saying they displayed Covid-like symptoms.It couldn’t be confirmed whether the teachers had conducted a Covid test.

27-04-2021||BL Vohra||What happened at Jaipur Golden Hospital||I have some connection with Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi in which 20 critical patients died on the intervening night of April 23-24 due to non-supply of oxygen by the government on time, sending shock waves across the country.On 24th early morning, I got a call asking me if I could help in getting oxygen as the hospital supply would last only till 9 am. I immediately called the Union Health Secretary, who assured me help and asked me to get in touch with the Health Secretary of Delhi Government, to whom he said he would speak right away.It took me more than half an hour to get in touch with the latter as his number was constantly busy. Meanwhile, I had spoken to the Delhi CP and a very high functionary of the Delhi Government. Finally, when I could speak to the Health Secretary of Delhi, he was very nice, offered prompt help and asked me to speak to another senior officer who was coordinating the supplies.It took me another half an hour to speak to the senior officer, who promised help. Each one of them was nice and sympathetic and offered prompt help. I could sense that they all were overworked, on the phone all the time during day and night, and may be hadn’t slept also for quite a few days.I was also given a helpline number from another source, but the person on the line was of no help. I was on the phone for almost five hours, along with many others connected with the hospital trying their sources, but finally all gave up demoralised, as nothing was happening.Since time was running out and lives were at stake, I sent a tweet to the PM and some media houses, which started flashing the crisis in the hospital and in other hospitals struggling to get oxygen. Finally, a representative of Inox company, which supplies oxygen to hospitals, spoke to the medical superintendent of our hospital, explaining the difficulties but also assured that he would soon divert a tanker which was in that area. That “soon” took almost five hours and finally after quite a few hours only 1,000 litres of oxygen came which was hardly sufficient for a few hours. And that situation still continues.There is a see-saw kind of battle, the oxygen sent to hospitals is hardly sufficient for a few hours. Hospitals keep on begging, again the supply is there for a few hours and patients and their kin remain on the edge, crying and praying. The Centre and the Delhi government are in the meanwhile blaming each other for the mess.(The writer is a former IPS officer)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-happened-at-jaipur-golden-hospital-244688
27-04-2021||New Delhi||Mask up even at home to halt  spread: Government||The Centre today said the risk of runaway spread of Covid infection was real unless people began practising Covid-appropriate behaviour now and states resorted to tough local lockdown measures to curb steep surge.After India logged 3,52,991 daily cases in a new world record for the fifth day, the Health Ministry said most states had crossed previous infection peaks by several times. The Centre had last night advised lockdown in cities and districts reporting over 10 per cent positivity for a week and more than 60 per cent occupancy of oxygen or ICU beds.The advisory suggested at least 14-day strict containment in such areas. Karnataka today announced a two-week lockdown from Tuesday and Punjab also announced restrictions – night curfew on weekdays and weekend curfew.The Ministry of Health has sought people’s participation in the Covid fight. It warned, “People must wear masks, maintain physical distancing and hand hygiene. Failure to do so may entail grave consequences. Without social distancing one person can infect 406 persons in a month; with 50 per cent reduction in exposure, 15 persons will be infected; and with 75 per cent reduction in exposure, 2.5 persons will be infected.”The focus is on states with more than 1 lakh active cases eac h— Maharashtra (7,00,207), UP (2,97,616), Karnataka (2,62,181), Kerala (2,19,221), Rajasthan (1,36,702), Chhattisgarh (1,23,835), Gujarat (1,15,006), TN (1,05,180).The country saw 2,812 deaths in a day. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mask-up-even-at-home-to-halt-spread-government-244677

The Bench made the stinging observation on a PIL by Karur AIADMK candidate and Transport Minister MR Vijayabaskar for the April 6 Assembly poll, seeking a direction to the authorities to ensure fair counting of votes on May 2 observing the Covid-19 protocol. When the EC counsel told the judges that all necessary steps were underway, the Bench shot back saying by allowing the political parties to take out rallies and meetings, it (the EC) paved the way for the resurgence of the second wave of the deadly virus.Don’t panic, enough oxygen stock: MHAIrked over the submission of the EC counsel that all precautionary measures would be taken at the counting centres, the Chief Justice replied the EC must be “singularly” held responsible for the second wave of the pandemic in the country.The Bench said the EC officials might be booked under murder charges.The judges also orally warned that they would not hesitate to stop the counting of votes on May 2.“Public health is of paramount importance and it is distressing that constitutional authorities have to be reminded in such regard. It is only when a citizen survives that he will be able to enjoy the rights that a democratic republic guarantees,” the judges said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/election-commission-singularly-to-blame-for-2nd-covid-surge-says-madras-high-court-244674
27-04-2021||New Delhi||US determined to support India in Covid fight, ensure supply of vaccine raw materials: Biden to PM Modi||US President Joe Biden on Monday conveyed solidarity with India in its fight against COVID-19 and asserted that his country was determined to support its efforts by quickly deploying resources such as therapeutics, ventilators and identifying sources of raw materials to be made available for the manufacture of Covishield vaccine, according to a statement here.Biden expressed the support of the US to India in a telephonic conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during which the two leaders discussed the pandemic situation in their countries, including India’s ongoing efforts to contain a second wave of COVID-19 through expedited vaccination efforts, and ensuring supply of critical medicines, therapeutics and medical equipment.Modi also informed Biden about India’s initiative at the World Trade Organization (WTO) for a relaxation in the norms of the Agreement on TRIPS to ensure quick and affordable access to vaccines and medicines for developing countries, the statement said.“Had a fruitful conversation with @POTUS @JoeBiden today. We discussed the evolving COVID situation in both countries in detail. I thanked President Biden for the support being provided by the United States to India.“My discussion with @POTUS @JoeBiden also underscored the importance of smooth and efficient supply chains of vaccine raw materials and medicines. India-US healthcare partnership can address the global challenge of COVID-19,” Modi tweeted.According to the statement, Modi conveyed his heartfelt appreciation for the offer of assistance and support from the US.He mentioned India’s commitment to contain the COVID-19 pandemic globally through ‘Vaccine Maitri’, and its participation in COVAX and the Quad Vaccine Initiatives.Modi underscored the need to ensure smooth and open supply chains of raw materials and inputs required for manufacture of vaccines, medicines, and therapeutics related to COVID-19.Both leaders underlined the potential of the India-US partnership in vaccine development and supply to address the COVID-19 pandemic, and directed their respective officials to maintain close coordination and cooperation in their efforts in this domain, the statement said.The two leaders agreed to remain in regular touch.The US president and his Vice President Kamala Harris had earlier assured India and its people of providing all assistance, including urgently sending necessary medical life-saving supplies and equipment, to help the country combat the deadly coronavirus crisis.“Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need,” Biden had said in a tweet.The coronavirus situation remained grim in India with the daily COVID-19 infection tally and death toll touching new peaks in the past few days.India recorded 3,52,991 cases, the highest so far, taking the infection tally to 1,73,13,163 while active cases have crossed the 28-lakh mark, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Monday.The death toll increased to 1,95,123 with a record 2,812 new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am on Monday showed.

27-04-2021||New Delhi||Govt asks Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech to lower price of COVID-19 vaccines||The central government on Monday asked the Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech to lower the prices of their COVID-19 vaccines amid criticism from various states who objected to profiteering during such a major crisis.The issue of vaccine pricing was discussed at a meeting chaired by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba.Now the two companies are expected to come up with revised pricing for their vaccines.The Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech has fixed the price of its COVID-19 vaccine, Covaxin, at Rs 600 per dose for state governments and at Rs 1,200 per dose for private hospitals.The Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest vaccine maker in terms of volume, has announced a price of Rs 400 per dose for its COVID-19 vaccine, 'Covishield', for state governments and Rs 600 per dose for private hospitals.Both vaccines are available to the central government at a rate of Rs 150 per dose.Many states have objected to different prices of the vaccines, with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal saying this is not time for profiteering.India has announced the expansion of its COVID-19 vaccination drive by allowing its large 18-plus population to get inoculated from May 1. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-asks-serum-institute-bharat-biotech-to-lower-price-of-covid-19-vaccines-244512
27-04-2021||New Delhi||Mask up even inside your homes: Govt tells citizens amid staggering surge in second Covid wave||As a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic rips through the country, the government on Monday said it is time people start wearing masks inside their homes as well, and refrain from inviting guests.Addressing a press conference here, NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr V K Paul said if there is a COVID-positive person inside the house, he or she must wear the mask so as to prevent other family members from getting infected.“Rather, I’ll say that the time has come that we start wearing masks even otherwise inside our homes. We used to talk about wearing it outside homes, but the way the infection has spread, it will be better if we wear mask inside our homes if we are sitting with someone,” he said.“But, definitely, if there is a COVID-19 positive person, that person must wear the mask and others inside the house also must wear a mask and the positive person should be kept in a different room,” Paul underlined.He added that people should also avoid stepping out of their home unnecessarily and not invite guests at home.He also suggested if the house lacks such facilities for isolation, then people may go to isolation centres, known as corona care centres.Getting admitted to a hospital is not the only option, Paul said. “Hospital beds are used for the needy people.” Highlighting the importance of vaccination, Paul said, “We cannot let the pace of COVID-19 vaccination decline or slacken in the face of the emerging situation. In fact, it should be escalated and with that intent the government of India brought a revised (vaccination) policy. We believe and are confident that will bring in more acceleration,” he said.AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria, who also addressed the press conference, sought greater community participation to ensure optimal utilisation of hospital facilities.“We see now there is unnecessary panic among people which is causing more harm than good. Those who test positive even if their oxygen saturation levels are normal and have mild symptoms, they also want to get admitted.“It is causing a lot of rush outside hospitals and suffering to genuine patients as they do not get proper treatment. Also, hoarding of drugs at homes is causing unnecessary shortage of essential drugs in markets and also leads to misuse of drugs,” he said.Underlining the importance of oxygen in the treatment strategy for COVID-19 patients, Dr Guleria said its misuse must be avoided.There should be judicious use of oxygen therapy, he said, adding, hospital authorities should make sure there is no leakage of oxygen at their facilities, and also advised proning to increase oxygen levels in the body.On the increasing demands for Remdesivir, Dr Guleria said benefits of this drug in treating COVID-19 patients are not well established. The drug has not shown mortality benefits, it is wrong to think of it as a magic bullet, he said.It is only useful in moderate to severe cases on the 5th to 7th day, he said, adding there is no benefit in early phases, and taking it on first and second day may even cause side-effects.In this disease, 85 per cent people will have mild illness and they will get well with symptomatic treatment like fever medication or steam just like normal common cold, he said.With 3,52,991 people testing positive for coronavirus infection in a day, the highest so far, India’s total tally of COVID-19 cases has climbed to 1,73,13,163 while active cases have crossed the 28-lakh mark, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Monday.

27-04-2021||New Delhi||India has enough oxygen stock, trying to resolve transportation issue: Home Ministry||India has enough stock of medical oxygen, but the issue is its transportation from the producing states to high-demand areas which the government is trying to address, the Home Ministry said Monday.Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs Piyush Goyal also said the turnaround time of oxygen-carrying tankers was reduced to 1-2 hours from 4-5 days by taking the help of the Indian Air Force transport aircraft which have been ferrying empty tankers.“We have enough stock of oxygen. The issue is transportation which we are trying to resolve by active involvement of all stake holders,” Goyal told a press conference here.Amidst increasing demand for oxygen in the country due to the surging coronavirus cases, he said, “There is absolutely no need to panic for oxygen as we are trying to resolve the issue of oxygen transportation from the producing states to high demand areas.”He also said the Central government is monitoring the movement of oxygen-carrying tankers on real-time basis through GPS and making them available to hospitals at the shortest possible time.Since Friday, the home ministry has been coordinating efforts to deploy empty oxygen tankers and containers in various filling stations across the country to speed up the distribution of the much-needed medical oxygen in treating COVID-19 patients.The coronavirus situation continues to be grim in India with 3,52,991 people testing positive and a record 2,812 deaths reported on Monday.The Central government is trying to source oxygen from different parts of the country and making it available in worst hit states by running special trains.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-has-enough-oxygen-stock-trying-to-resolve-transportation-issue-home-ministry-244493
27-04-2021||New Delhi||IIT scientists revise prediction, say active Covid cases likely to peak at 38-48 lakh in mid-May||Active cases in the ongoing second COVID-19 wave in India may peak at 38-48 lakh between May 14-18 and daily new infections could hit a high of 4.4 lakh from May 4-8, according to a mathematical model by IIT scientists who have revised their projections upwards.India on Monday saw a single-day rise of 3,52,991 (3.52 lakh) COVID-19 infections and 2,812 fatalities with 28,13,658 (28.13 lakh) active cases.The scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur and Hyderabad applied the Susceptible, Undetected, Tested (positive), and Removed Approach’ (SUTRA) model to predict that active cases would go up further by over 10 lakh by mid-May.The latest projection tweaks the time frame as well as the numbers.Last week, the researchers predicted the pandemic may peak between May 11-15 with 33-35 lakh total active cases and decline steeply by the end of May.Earlier this month, their modelling approach projected that active infections in the country would peak by April 15, which didn’t come true.“This time, I have also computed minimum and maximum for predicted values and posted it. I am reasonably confident that the actual values will be within the min and max values mentioned,” Maninder Agrawal, professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT-Kanpur, told PTI.On Sunday, Agrawal shared the new peak values for active and new COVID cases in a Twitter thread.“Peak timing: May 14-18 for active infections and May 4-8 for new infections. Peak value: 38-48 lakhs for active infections and 3.4 to 4.4 lakhs for new infections,” he said.He also noted that it was not clear what the final values would be.“I have now computed a range of values for peak value and timing and the final numbers should be within this range,” Agrawal said in another tweet.Explaining the changing projections of the model over time, Agrawal said, “The primary reason is that there is a continuous slow drift in parameter values of current phase for India. This makes the guess of the right values difficult. That is causing a slow change in predictions.”The scientists in the as yet unpublished study said there are several novel features in the SUTRA model.Whereas previous papers divided the patient population into asymptomatic and Infected, the new model also accounts for the fact that some fraction of asymptomatic patients could also be detected due to contact tracing and other such protocols.The IIT Kanpur professor noted that the SUTRA model uses three main parameters to predict the course of the pandemic.The first is called beta, or contact rate, which measures how many people an infected person infects per day. It is related to the R-nought value, which is the number of people an infected person spreads the virus to over the course of their infection, Agrawal explained.The other two parameters are ‘reach’, which is a measure of the exposure level of the population to the pandemic, and ‘epsilon’ which is the ratio of detected and undetected cases.Independent calculations by Gautam Menon and his team at Ashoka University in Haryana had predicted that the peak of the ongoing wave of infections could be between mid-April and mid-May.Menon also cautioned that such projections of COVID-19 cases should really be trusted only in the short term.Any excessively precise prediction, of a peak within just a five-day window would ignore the many uncertainties associated with the inputs to any such calculation, Menon, who was not involved in the modelling, had told PTI earlier.

It may affect observance of the protocols, the petitioner alleged.When the counsel for the EC told the judges that all necessary steps were underway, the bench retorted that by allowing the political parties to take out rallies and meetings, it had paved the way for the resurgence of the second wave of Covid-19.The judges also orally warned that they would not hesitate to stop the counting of votes on May 2.
