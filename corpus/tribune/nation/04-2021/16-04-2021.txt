There is laxity even in enforcing the limited restrictions announced by some of the state governments from time to time,” Kumar wrote.Apart from banning such events forthwith, the situation demands an immediate halt to the export of vaccines in view of the number of cases continuing to rise in the country and many citizens being denied the urgent use of the vaccines, he said.As the protector of fundamental rights, the country expected the top court to exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction in these troubled times and vindicate its role as the custodian of the constitutional conscience, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-ex-law-minister-ashwani-kumar-demands-ban-on-political-religious-gatherings-239969

16-04-2021||New Delhi||Rs 13.71 crores and Rs 735 crores transferred directly into accounts of farmers in Punjab and Haryana for wheat procurement||The government agencies have procured 18,24,310 tonnes (18.24 lakh tonnes) of wheat from Punjab and 36,30,790 tonnes (36.30 lakh tonnes) from Haryana in the ongoing Rabi Marketing Season till April 15.  From the country on the whole, 81,63,669 tonnes (81.64 lakh tonnes) has been procured at an MSP of Rs 1,975 per quintal, against an estimated target of 427.36 lakh tonnes this year. From Chandigarh, 5650 tonnes have been procured, according to the FCI data.   This is the first time the farmers from Punjab and Haryana are receiving direct online MSP payment of their produce.The Centre has been pursuing with the two state governments for ensuring direct online payment into farmers’ accounts since 2015-16. However, they had been “routinely approaching the Centre for granting exemption and seeking time”.Just ahead of procurement, Punjab had sought yet another exemption, which was rejected by the Centre.Till date Rs 13.71 crores and Rs 735 crores has been transferred into the accounts of farmers in Punjab and Haryana, respectively. Normally there is a lag of 2-3 days in transfer of money, officials said, adding that procurement in Punjab started on April 10, and picked up in last two days (after Baisakhi), while in Haryana it has been going on since April 1.With Punjab and Haryana on board, the entire country is now covered under Direct Benefit Transfer of MSP under the theme of “One Nation, One MSP, One DBT”, Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said. Till date Rs 13.71 crores and Rs 735 crores has been transferred into the accounts of farmers in Punjab and Haryana, respectively. Normally there is a lag of 2-3 days in transfer of money, officials said.Dismissing observations of procurement “going slow” in Punjab, Pandey said procurement and transferring of the MSP amount is going smoothly in the state.“We are now transferring in Punjab the MSP amount directly to farmers’ accounts which has been possible with the cooperation of the state government and ‘arthiyas’, who are a very important stakeholder. They will get their respective commission due under the APMC Act and rules into their accounts.“There is no stakeholder interest clash or encroachment in Punjab. ‘Arhtiyas’ will receive their commission separately through the e-mode of payment. Earlier, the MSP was going to farmers via ‘arhtiya’ and now it is being directly transferred to farmers online,” he said, in response to reports about ‘arthiyas’ demanding “signed blank cheques from farmers to facilitate procurement”. Pandey said the Centre is hoping to procure 427 LMT this season, the highest ever in the country. This includes 130 LMT from Punjab and 80 LMT from Haryana, states where farmers have been at the forefront of the agitation against the three agriculture laws.The leader of the group (of 11 states and two UTs, Chandigarh and J&K) will be Madhya Pradesh from where 135 LMT is expected to be procured. So far, the highest procurement has been reported from Haryana, he said, thanking the government and the ‘arthiyas’ of the state.As per the data available with the FCI, the government agencies have procured 23.08 lakh tonnes of wheat from the farmers in Madhya Pradesh and 1.99 lakh tonnes in Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile, to ramp up storage infrastructure in India and increase storage capacity by 100 LMT, the government is launching a storage modernisation plan.“By 2024-25, we will store our stocks in modern silos and phase out conventional godowns,” Pandey said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rs-13-71-crores-and-rs-735-crores-transferred-directly-into-accounts-of-farmers-in-punjab-and-haryana-for-wheat-procurement-239966

It is expected to reach nearly 10 crore doses per month by September 2021,” the DBT said. The Centre will provide financial assistance of Rs 65 crore to Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation Ltd, Mumbai – a public sector undertaking (PSU) under the Maharashtra government, the DBT said.“Financial support as grant from GoI (government of India) to the tune of approximately Rs 65 crore will be provided for this facility to be made ready for manufacturing. The Haffkine Biopharmaceuticals Ltd had asked for around 12 months to complete this task,” it said.Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Sandeep Rathod, Managing Director, Haffkine Bio-Pharmaceutical Corporation Ltd, said its target is to produce around 22.8 crore vaccine vials “but it will take one year for us to start production”.“However, the central government has asked them to expedite and complete the task urgently within six months. The facility will have a capacity of 20 million dozes per month, once functional,” the DBT said.Indian Immunologicals Limited (IIL), Hyderabad, a facility under National Dairy Development Board, and Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals Limited, Bulandshahr, a PSU department of biotechnology will also be supported to prepare there a facility to provide 10-15 million doses per month by August-September, the DBT said.

Is this expected from a chief minister? She is trying to instil a sense of fear just for minority votes,” he said.Four persons were killed as central forces opened fire allegedly after coming under attack from locals, who “attempted to snatch their rifles”, near a booth in Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar district during the fourth phase of polling.According to BJP sources, the saffron party has decided to move the Election Commission over the audio clip.In the purported audio clip, Banerjee is heard instructing Ray to keep his cool till the polling is over.“Don’t panic. You should make arrangements for conducting a rally with the bodies the next day. And also consult a lawyer and file a police complaint so that neither the SP nor IC can escape,” she is heard saying.The TMC’s Sitalkuchi candidate termed the audio clip as “bogus”.“Such a conversation never took place. This audio clip is totally bogus. The BJP is just trying to confuse the people before the fifth phase of polling,” he said.Earlier, Banerjee has described the firing as genocide by central forces and termed it as a conspiracy by Union Home Minister Amit Shah.Out of the eight-phase assembly elections in the state, four phases have been completed and the remaining four are scheduled to be held between April 17 and 29.

The farmers later repaired their huts and placed the clothes and other things in open to dry.“We have suffered a heavy loss due to the storm accompanied with rains in the evening. Temporary abodes of many of the farmers were damaged and all things kept in the camp got wet but it will not affect our spirit and enthusiasm in any manner. We will not move from here without getting three farm laws repealed come what may,” said Anoop Chanaut, a farmer leader.He maintained they were fully prepared to brave every sort of weather.“We faced bone-chilling winter by sitting in the tractor-trailers at Tikri during initial days and now have made all arrangements to beat summer heat and to bear the rainy season by staying at huts hence no one is worried about the weather,” Chanaut added.Pragat Singh, a BKU (Rajewal) leader, said some of the huts had been repaired by the farmers by helping each other while the remaining would be set up again in the morning as the electricity supply was not proper this time.“A delegation of farmers today called on Bahadurgarh SDM Hitendra Sharma to complain about unavailability of basic amenities like cleanliness, adequate supply of potable water and electricity at the protest site at Tikri. The SDM has assured us of resolving the issue within one or two days,” said Singh, adding that the Bahadurgarh authorities had failed to ensure lifting of garbage from the protest site resulting in sewerage blockade and unhygienic conditions there.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/high-velocity-wind-rain-uproot-farmers-huts-at-tikri-239960

Afghan people have seen more than four decades of war and unrest and deserve long-lasting peace and development,” the spokesperson said.Bagchi was responding to media queries on the US announcement.“India is of the view that an Afghan peace process should be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled. Any political settlement must be inclusive and should preserve the socio-economic and political gains of the past 19 years,” he said.“India supports a united, democratic and sovereign Afghanistan. We are deeply concerned about the increase in violence and targeted killings in Afghanistan. India has called for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire,” Bagchi added.The MEA spokesperson said India has participated in the Doha conference, the Geneva conference and the Heart of Asia conference in Dushanbe on the Afghan peace process.“India remains engaged with the Afghan stakeholders and also our regional and international partners regarding next steps,” he said.In a major announcement, President Joe Biden on Wednesday said US troops will be withdrawn from Afghanistan beginning May 1 and the process will be completed by September 11.There have been renewed global efforts to bring lasting peace to Afghanistan. Russia recently organised a conference in Moscow where all major stakeholders were invited to brainstorm over ways to move forward in the peace process.India has been a major stakeholder in the peace and stability of Afghanistan.

However, we could not continue the same drive as the vaccine stocks have completely run out,” he said.The state was poised to make the dream of vaccinating all vulnerable people a reality in the next three weeks if sufficient stocks of vaccine were made available, Jagan said.The state government set a target of vaccinating 24 lakh people during the four-day ‘Tika Utsav’ (April 11 to 14).“We have drawn out an action plan to cover six lakh people (four lakh in rural and two lakh in urban areas) per day during the Tika Utsav,” the chief minister had informed the prime minister in his letter on April 9.However, the target could not be accomplished as both the Covaxin and Covishield stocks went dry by the first day of the four-day nation-wide event.The 6.4 lakh doses sent by the Centre on April 12 and 13 enabled the state accomplish a total of 7.15 lakh vaccinations during the Tika Utsav.The state has so far received a total of 46 lakh doses, a top official said.The Medical and Health Department said in a release on Friday that 28,677 people were inoculated (first and second doses) in the state on April 15 and, with that, the entire COVID-19 vaccine stocks have been exhausted.Sources in the department said they were expecting to receive another five lakh doses of the vaccine at the State Vaccine Store in Gannavaram by Sunday.From there the stocks would be proportionately dispatched to the 13 districts.

The Centre had “in principle accepted” the need for creating additional courts to deal with such cases.The Bench – which also included Justice LN Rao, Justice BR Gavai, Justice AS Bopanna and Justice S Ravindra Bhat – said there was no inherent power of trial courts to review or recall the issue of summons.However, it said, “This does not affect the power of the Trial Court under Section 322 of the Code to revisit the order of issue of process in case it is brought to the court’s notice that it lacks jurisdiction to try the complaint.”To conclusively deal with this aspect, amendment to the Act empowering the trial courts to reconsider/recall summons in respect of complaints under Section 138 shall be considered by the committee constituted by it on March 10 this year under the chairmanship of a former Bombay High Court judge RC Chauhan.It asked the high courts to issue practice directions to magistrates to record reasons before converting trials of complaints under Section 138 from summary trial to summons trial.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-directions-for-speedy-disposal-of-cheque-bounce-cases-asks-centre-to-amend-act-239946

They have also suggested a system where medicines can be purchased online or from the market as has been permitted in cases of lifestyle and chronic diseases requiring long treatment.Following the outbreak of COVID-19, an online platform and app, ‘sehatopd.in’ had been developed last year for the convenience of ECHS beneficiaries so that they could avail medical advice from their homes. It was launched as a pilot project in July 2020 and has since been upgraded and expanded.All medical officers registered with ECHS for the online platform gave been directed to be available have been directed to be available providing online consultation on a daily basis. The platform is available from 9 am to 5 pm from Monday to Saturday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-echs-curtails-physical-visits-to-clinics-switches-to-online-mode-239944

16-04-2021||New Delhi||Ensure free movement of medical oxygen carrying vehicles along inter-state borders: MHA||The Centre on Friday directed the states to ensure uninterrupted movement of medical oxygen carrying vehicles along their borders, and said they must not impose any curb on production and supply of the essential public health commodity anywhere.Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla’s communication to chief secretaries of all states and Union territories came in the wake of reports of shortage of the medical oxygen for COVID-19 patients in different parts of the country in the last few days.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday also undertook a comprehensive review to ensure adequate medical grade oxygen supply in the country and called for ramping up its production.In the communication to the chief secretaries of states/UTs, the Union home secretary said there is no restriction on inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods as announced in the guidelines on March 23.He said in the last few days, a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases has been observed in the country along with high positivity rate, and in order to break the chain of transmission and curb the spread of the infection, various states and UTs have imposed additional restrictions on certain activities, curfews, among others.Bhalla said availability of adequate and uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen is an important pre-requisite for managing moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 and with increasing cases, the medical oxygen supplies will need to keep pace with the requirements of the states.The home secretary emphasised that medical oxygen is an essential public health commodity and any impediment in its supply in the country may critically impact the management of patients suffering from COVID-19 disease in other parts of the country.“Therefore, you are requested to ensure that no such restriction is imposed on the movement of medical oxygen between the states and UTs, and transport authorities shall be instructed to accordingly allow free inter-state movement of oxygen carrying vehicles,” the letter said.Bhalla told the states that no curb shall be imposed on oxygen manufacturers and suppliers to limit the oxygen supplies only to the hospitals of the state in which they are located and there shall be free movement of oxygen carrying vehicles into the cities, without any restriction of timings, while also enabling inter-city supply without restriction.Keeping in view the requisition of medical oxygen and to ensure its smooth supplies to agencies concerned, Empowered Group-Il, which is mandated for coordinating medical logistics including oxygen, has prepared a supply plan that is required to be followed by all states/UTs and agencies concerned, he said.

16-04-2021||London||UK govt clears fugitive Nirav Modi's extradition to India||UK Home Secretary Priti Patel has signed off on the order to extradite Nirav Modi, wanted in India on fraud and money-laundering charges related to the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, senior Indian diplomatic sources in the UK said on Friday.Modi, 50, who remains behind bars at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London, has 14 days to apply for permission to appeal against the Home Secretary’s order in the High Court in London.Back on February 25, the Westminster Magistrates’ Court had concluded that the diamond merchant has a case to answer before the Indian courts, leaving the sign off on the order with the Cabinet minister.He had allegedly perpetrated the fraud in the Punjab National Bank in collusion with his uncle Mehul Choksi.After a two-year long legal battle, District Judge Samuel Goozee had ruled that Modi only has a case to answer in the Indian courts but that there is no evidence to suggest he would not receive a fair trial in India.He also dismissed the human rights concerns that Modi’s medical needs would not be addressed as per several Indian government assurances.“I am satisfied that there is evidence upon which NDM [Nirav Deepak Modi] could be convicted in relation [to] the conspiracy to defraud the PNB. A prima facie case is established,” the judge noted.A prima facie case to have been established on all counts of charges brought by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) money laundering, intimidation of witnesses and disappearance of evidence, he had said.Under the UK Extradition Act 2003, the judge sent his findings to the Secretary of State for Home Affairs. It is the UK Cabinet minister who is authorised to order an extradition under the India-UK Extradition Treaty and has two months within which to make that decision.The CBI had registered the case on January 31, 2018 against Modi, Choksi and others including then officials of Punjab National Bank on a complaint from the Bank on the allegations that the accused had hatched a criminal conspiracy amongst themselves to defraud the public sector Bank by fraudulently issuing Letters of Undertaking.Letters of Undertaking are a guarantee that a bank gives to banks abroad where its client approaches for credit.The figure swelled to Rs 13,000 crore when similar frauds by companies of his uncle Mehul Choksi, an alleged co-conspirator, came to light, officials said.Investigation showed that the accused officials of the Punjab National Bank, in conspiracy with said owners of the firms and others, had fraudulently issued a large number of LoUs to overseas banks for obtaining Buyer’s credit in favour of said three firms without any sanctioned limit or cash margin and without making entries in the core system of the bank.The first charge sheet was filed on May 14, 2018 against 25 accused including Modi. The second charge sheet was filed on December 20, 2019 against 30 accused people including the 25 chargesheeted earlier in respect of 150 outstanding fraudulent LoUs which had resulted in wrongful loss of nearly Rs 6,805 crore to PNB.It was also alleged that Modi in conspiracy with other accused had siphoned off the funds obtained as buyer’s credit through dummy companies established by him in Dubai and Hong Kong which were shown as exporter of Pearls to three Nirav Modi firms and importer of Pearl studded jewellery from his firms.Modi had escaped from India on January 1, 2018 before registration of case in CBI. A non bailable arrest warrant was issued by the trial court against him followed by a red corner notice in June 2018 by Interpol.He was arrested by the UK Police in London in March 2019 and his repeated applications for bail, were rejected by the Westminster Magistrates’ Court and High Court, London.After second charge sheet was filed, additional evidences were submitted to the Court in London for the total fraud amount of Rs. 6,805 crore (approx.). In addition, second extradition request for the offences of intimidating the witnesses and destruction of evidence was also submitted to the UK government.In extradition requests, CBI submitted voluminous oral and documentary evidence to substantiate the charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, criminal breach of trust, criminal misconduct by public servants, destruction of evidence and criminal intimidation of evidence.India is a designated Part 2 country by virtue of the Extradition Act 2003, which means it is the minister who has the authority to order a requested person’s extradition after considering a number of further issues.Under the provisions of the act, the Secretary of State had to consider the possible imposition of the death penalty, in which case extradition cannot be ordered; the rule of specialty, which prohibits a person being dealt with in the requesting state for matters other than those referenced in the extradition request; and whether or not the person was in the UK following extradition from another state, in which case that states permission must be obtained before extraditing to a third state.If these factors do not prevent extradition, the minister had two months within which to sign off on Judge Goozee’s February 25 order. The Home Secretary’s order rarely goes against the court’s conclusions, as she has to consider only these very narrow bars to extradition which did not apply in Nirav’s case.However, as witnessed in the extradition case of former Kingfisher Airlines chief Vijay Mallya – who remains on bail in the UK while a “confidential” matter, believed to relate to an asylum request, is resolved – there is still some way to go before Nirav can be formally moved from Wandsworth Prison in London to Barrack 12 Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai and face trial in India.The judge had informed Nirav Modi of his right to seek an appeal in the High Court and has up to 14 days to make that application after the Home Secretary makes her decision known. Any appeal, if granted, will be heard at the Administrative Division of the High Court in London.It is also possible to appeal to the UK Supreme Court but this is only possible if the High Court certifies that the appeal involves a point of law of general public importance, and either the High Court or the Supreme Court gives leave for the appeal to be made.Nirav’s legal team did not immediately confirm if he intends to appeal against order and he will remain behind bars at Wandsworth Prison on judicial remand until the next stage in the legal process.

Why should the BJP bring people from worst-affected states to set up podiums and pandals for rallies," she said.The Trinamool Congress boss said local labourers and decorators can be engaged for the purpose after necessary COVID-19 tests.Referring to her injury, the chief minister said the BJP wanted to stop her from canvassing by "targeting her leg", but she has managed to come out triumphant."They had targeted my leg, but I proved them wrong with the blessings of people. The injury has healed 75 per cent," she said.Banerjee, who suffered injuries on her leg during campaigning in Nandigram on March 10, has since been seen seated on a wheelchair in rallies and roadshows.She said the COVID-19 surge in West Bengal could have been under check had Modi ensured vaccination for every citizen of the state."The virus had become weak in the last five-six months. But, the PM did not take steps to vaccinate every citizen. He did not even respond to my suggestion for free vaccination for people of the state for political reasons."On our part, we have already started free inoculation at some camps in Kolkata and other areas," Banerjee said West Bengal on Thursday recorded the highest single- day spike of 6,769 coronavirus cases and at least 22 more fatalities.Urging all eligible voters to exercise their franchise on Saturday, the fifth phase of assembly elections, she alleged, "If you don't, citing some excuses, the BJP will try to delete your name from the voter list." The TMC chief also slammed the BJP-led government at the Centre for the hike in LPG cyclinder prices."If they have their way, BJP will take it to Rs 5,000 per cyclinder... Tell them we don't want cash for votes, we want cooking gas for free," she said, accusing the saffron party of distributing money among people for votes.Speaking about the temple town Nabadwip, Banerjee said her government has spent Rs 300 crore for the heritage spot."There are two heritage towns in the state - Nabadwip and Cooch Behar. What we have done for these places, no other government had done so during their tenure," she asserted.Banerjee added that a world heritage centre was also coming up in Mayapur."Nabadwip and Cooch Behar will be a pilgrimage hub when the planned projects are completed, attracting lakhs of tourists and providing more employment opportunities," the CM said.

However, he has agreed to continue as Special PP in CBI cases in coal scam.On April 5, it had appointed two judicial officers—Arun Bhardwaj and Sanjay Bansal—as special judges to conduct trials in coal scam cases pending since 2014 in place of special judge Bharat Parashar who was holding trials in 41 cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coal-scam-former-asg-maninder-singh-advocate-rajesh-batra-appointed-special-public-prosecutors-239934

But Didi says they will not get citizenship, why? Because her vote back would not like it," he told an election rally in Tehatta in Nadia district.Taking a swipe at Rahul Gandhi who addressed his first two election rallies on Wednesday after keeping off the campaign in the state where his party is contesting in alliance with the Left while fighting against it in Kerala, Shah branded him a "tourist politician"."A tourist politician arrived in Bengal after almost the entire poll got over and questioned our DNA. BJP's DNA is development, nationalism and Atmanirbhar Bharat," he said.Flaying "dynasty politics" in the TMC, Shah said while the BJP wants to implement the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme for farmers in Bengal, "Didi only wants Bhaipo (nephew) Samman Nidhi".Top BJP leaders have been accusing Banerjee's nephew and Diamond Harbour MP Abhishek Banerjee of wielding "unwarranted influence" over the government machinery and running "extortion syndicates"."After people's mandate on May 2 (counting day), nobody will be left to take cut money, the government of syndicates will be no more there, the government that works for Bhaipo will be gone," he asserted.The home minister assailed the TMC government for "failing to check infiltrators who take away the jobs of our youths and food of our poor"."Let alone illegal immigrants, not even a bird from across the border will be allowed to enter Bengal. Not the TMC, neither the Left nor the Congress....only BJP can stop infiltration," he asserted.He claimed the demography of Nadia district, which shares a border with Bangladesh, had got altered because of infiltration.

The railways have all these details on the e-ticketing website and passengers are provided information on whether they have to undergo tests or carry a COVID-negative certificate on arrival," he said.Sharma also said the railways is doing a thermal screening of the passengers and has also notified the fine amounts for not following COVID protocols.He ruled out running Shramik Special trains and said trains will be run wherever there is demand and requirement.Sharma also said the price of platform tickets has been increased at several stations to discourage crowding."We have 4,000 isolation coaches for COVID-19 at different locations across the country. We have received a demand from Nandurbar in Maharashtra for over 100 coaches and 20 isolation coaches have been provided," he said when asked about the converted coaches that can act as COVID care centres.Sharma said the railways is keeping a close watch on all stations in Mumbai, Gujarat, Karnataka and wherever the demand is high, the zonal general managers have been authorised to operate more trains."I assure you that there is no dearth of services, the situation is quite normal, particularly in Mumbai, Surat and Bengaluru," he said.The Indian Railways is currently running 1,490 mail and express trains and 5,397 suburban train services on an average per day. "We are also running 28 clone trains of highly-patronised trains and 947 passenger trains," Sharma said, adding that 70 per cent of the train services have been restored."To clear the extra rush across the country, the railways is operating 140 additional trains," he said.Sharma said the 140 special trains will make 483 trips in April and May.Citing the figures of the additional trains operating in several states, he said the Central Railway is operating 85 such services which will complete 284 trips, the Western Railway is operating 28 trains for 152 trips, the Northern Railway is operating 15 special trains for 19 trips, the East Central Railway is operating two special trains for four trips, the North Eastern Railway is operating nine trains for 14 trips and the North Central Railway is operating one train for 10 trips.Sharma also said trains for high-demand destinations such as Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur, Lucknow, Varanasi, Manduadih, Prayagraj, Bihar's Patna, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Barauni, Jharkhand's Bokaro, Ranchi, Assam's Guwahati and West Bengal's Kolkata are also being operated.The Railway Board chairman said the national transporter has operated 42 trains between Delhi and Mumbai from April 12 to 16. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-state-has-asked-to-stop-train-services-railway-board-chairman-239907
16-04-2021||London||UK finds 77 cases of Covid variant first found in India||UK health authorities have identified 77 cases of the highly infectious B.1.617 variant of coronavirus which causes COVID-19, first found in India, and has designated it a Variant Under Investigation (VUI).Public Health England (PHE), which releases weekly updates on the number of confirmed new cases of Variants of Concern (VOC) and VUI in the UK, reported on Thursday that the variant first detected in India includes a number of mutations."A new variant has been designated a Variant Under Investigation (VUI) by PHE. The variant, first detected in India, includes a number of mutations including E484Q, L452R, and P681R,” the PHE weekly report said.“PHE has identified 77 cases of this variant in the UK and all appropriate public health interventions will be undertaken, including enhanced contact tracing. This variant has been designated VUI-21APR-01. PHE and international partners continue to monitor the situation closely,” it said.The B.1.617 strain's mutations are feared to make the variant spread faster and partially evade immunity. The variant is believed to be largely responsible for India's current second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with infection rates and hospitalisations on the rise once again. It also led to UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson deciding to shorten the length of his India visit later this month, with the bulk of the events now expected to be limited to a day-long packed schedule on April 26.“We have been in close contact with the Indian government about the Prime Minister's upcoming visit in light of the COVID-19 situation in India. As a result of these discussions the Prime Minister has made the decision to reduce the length of the visit, due to take place at the end of this month, to a shorter programme in New Delhi,” the UK PM's spokesperson at 10 Downing Street said. India at present is not on the "red list" of countries, which involves more stringent hotel-based quarantine requirements for travellers commuting between India and the UK. If further concerns emerge around the Indian B.1.617 variant in the UK, it could be categorised from a Variant Under Investigation to a Variant of Concern. The latest addition brings the total number of variants detected in the UK to 56, including the so-called Kent variant and South African strains which is top of the UK's concerns. The PHE said that the dominant variant in the country continues to be VOC-20DEC-01 B.1.1.7, or the Kent variant, which is being monitored closely.“The best way to stop the spread of the virus is to remember: hands, face, space and follow the restrictions in place,” the PHE said.Earlier this week, people living in four boroughs in south London were urged to get tested as part of a surge testing drive after cases of the South African variant were found in Wandsworth, Lambeth, Barnet and Southwark.It comes as all parts of the United Kingdom began easing lockdown restrictions gradually this week, with non-essential retail shops, hairdressers and outdoor-serving restaurants among the businesses allowed to operate once again after months of lockdown. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-finds-77-cases-of-covid-variant-first-found-in-india-239906

16-04-2021||New Delhi||Monsoon to be normal this year, says IMD||The Southwest monsoon, which brings nearly 75 per cent of rainfall to the country, is expected to be normal this year, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Friday.The Long Period Average (LPA) will be 98 per cent with an error margin of plus and minus 5 per cent, said M Rajeevan, secretary of the Ministry of Earth Sciences.Rainfall in Odisha, Jharkhand, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Assam and Meghalaya is likely to be below normal, but normal or above normal in the rest of the country, he said while releasing the first Long Range Forecast for the four-month rainfall period from June to September.“The monsoon will be 98 per cent of the LPA, which is normal rainfall. It is a really good news for the country and will help India have a good agriculture output,” Rajeevan said at a virtual press conference.The LPA, the average of the season’s rainfall across the country from 1961-2010, is 88 cm.The news augurs well for economy, battered due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Southwest monsoon is one of the primary drivers of the country’s economy, which is largely based on agriculture and its allied activities. Large parts of the country rely on the four-month rainfall season for agriculture and also for filling reservoirs.This is the first time the IMD has made a specific forecast on spatial distribution.Rajeevan said the IMD will also issue month-wise forecasts during the next four months and also for the homogenous regions of the country—IMD’s four divisions—the Northwest India, East and Northeast India, Central India and South Peninsula.     The country has recorded above normal rainfall for the last two rainfall seasons.The La Nina and El Nino factors major influences on the Indian monsoon. The former is associated with the cooling of the Pacific waters and brings good rainfall while the latter is linked to the heating of Pacific waters and could lead to deficient precipitation.“There are less chances of formation of an El Nino,” Rajeevan said.He said in the recent years, the year after La Nina has usually seen a normal rainfall season.The Indian Dipole is another major influence on the outcome of the monsoon. A negative IOD is associated with the heating of the Indian Ocean waters and a positive IOD is linked to the cooling of Indian Ocean waters.The latest global model forecast indicates that neutral ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) conditions are likely to continue over the equatorial Pacific and negative IOD conditions are likely to develop over the Indian Ocean during the ensuing monsoon season, IMD Director General M Mohapatra said.“La-Nina is favoured through March-May with 80 per cent chances of a transition to ENSO-neutral in April-June 2021 and continuing through the fall of 2021,” Rajeevan said, implying these conditions are favourable for a good rainfall season.     Earlier this week, Skymet Weather, a private weather forecasting agency, had also predicted a normal monsoon. However, it had pegged the precipitation during the four-month season at 103 per cent of the LPA, which is on the higher side.Precipitation in the range of 96-104 per cent is considered to be in the ‘normal category’.The Skymet had said the north India plains, along with a few parts of the northeast region, are likely to be at a risk of being rain deficient through the season. Also, interior parts of Karnataka face the scare of scanty rains in the core monsoon months of July and August.On a monthly scale, June is likely to receive rainfall of 106 per cent of LPA, while July is expected to record 97 per cent of LPA. August and September are expected to receive 99 per cent and 116 per cent of the LPA, the Skymet said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/monsoon-to-be-normal-this-year-says-imd-239888

And now this is the first hosting of a leader here in Washington, DC,” said the official.

16-04-2021||New Delhi||Rajnath to IAF : Include new technology in readiness plan||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has asked the Indian Air Force (IAF) to include all dimensions of war-like advanced technologies, asymmetric capabilities and info-dominance as part of readiness for the future.All praise for timely response at LACHe was addressing the IAF Commanders’ Conference, where he advised the Commanders to draw up long-term plans and strategies for capability enhancement to counter future threats. The focus of the conference is to look at new technologies that can define future wars. A series of discussions include strategies and policies related to capabilities that would give the IAF a significant edge over its adversaries.The conference assumes significance as the IAF is working towards having threat-assessment-based artificial intelligence (AI) and using the upcoming technology to train pilots to assess their activities while flying planes. The IAF is working towards a system of automated threat analyses based on the AI. This improves situational awareness for monitoring threats.The IAF is already backing a programme for “manned-unmanned teaming”, which means an unmanned fighter jet will be part of a patrol of fighter jets in future war scenarios. A prototype of design was unveiled at the Aero-India in Bengaluru in February. The US and the UK are other countries that have plans for such unmanned fighter jets. He referred to changing international geopolitics. The minister spoke about the perceptible shift of focus from Trans-Atlantic to Trans-Pacific. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajnath-to-iaf-include-new-technology-in-readiness-plan-239728

One has to be given security of tenure. They cannot be made vulnerable like this,” Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said. The Bench, which also included Justice SK Kaul and Justice Surya Kant, reserved its verdict on a PIL by Lok Prahari seeking appointment of ad hoc/additional judges in 25 high courts.“For every person appointed, there will be 200 more saying why not me. In this environment, if one or two judges turn out to be slow, we can’t question the ad hoc judges’ system,” said Justice Kaul.The Bench didn’t agree with the reservations expressed by the Centre. In view of the huge pendency in high courts, the Chief Justice of an HC might prefer to appoint ad hoc judges to target a specific vacancy, although all vacancies were filled, the CJI said. It would enable the Chief Justice concerned to hear other important matters, he added. “If ad hoc judges are appointed, Constitution Benches can be formed,” he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cji-shockingly-false-plaints-against-judges-239735

His meetings with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and National Reconciliation body chief Abdullah Abdullah on Thursday sent out a strong signal that Washington intended preserving the gains of the past 20 years made by it and India-backed regimes.A costly affairTaliban warnedIt’s important for the Taliban to recognise that it will never be legitimate and it will never be durable if it rejects the political process and tries to take the country by force. — Antony Blinken, US Secretary of StateAnti-India OPsWhen the Taliban controlled Afghanistan in the late 1990s, they welcomed militants and terrorists of all stripes. Many, including the LeT and JeM, were trained for operations in India. — Lisa Curtis, Dy Assistant to President (2017-2021)The withdrawal will mean a complete end to US dependence on Pakistan for the supply and replenishment routes from Karachi to Kabul, leaving it with a freer hand to deal with the situation in Afghanistan. In a nationally televised speech on Wednesday, Biden flagged the role of Russia, China, India, Turkey and “especially’’ Pakistan in ensuring a peaceful future for Afghanistan after the last of the 2,500-odd US troops, along with about 7,000 NATO soldiers, leave the country on September 11.Gen Bipin Rawat, CDSHope disruptors won’t step inOur concern is that the vacuum that is going to be created in Afghanistan should not create space for disruptors to step in.Blinken’s meetings were a pointer that the US was in concurrence with India’s viewpoint about not abandoning the hard-won gains of the past 20 years. Blinken told Ghani that his visit intended to “demonstrate the ongoing commitment of the US to Afghanistan.” He discussed the importance of preserving the gains of the past 20 years, especially in building a strong civil society and protecting the rights of women, said US State Department spokesperson Ned Price. India has made a strong contribution in these areas with its community and institutional building projects.Blinken addressed another Indian concern about Afghanistan reverting to being a safe haven for terrorists. He and Ghani discussed “our shared commitment to ensure al-Qaida never regains a foothold in Afghanistan,” said Price. Against the backdrop of Taliban killing Afghan journalists, rights activists, doctors and clerics after the peace talks began, Blinken discussed with Abdullah the importance of a comprehensive ceasefire.At a conference in Dushanbe on March 30, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had said, “Violence and bloodshed are daily realities and the conflict itself has shown little sign of abatement, whatever may be the promises.”“What we need is a genuine ‘double peace’, that is peace within Afghanistan and peace around Afghanistan. It requires harmonising the interests of all, both within and around that country,” he had said at the conference hosted by Tajikistan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-intends-to-protect-india-backed-afghanistan-gains-239712

The production processes, agriculture collection, mechanisation of farm sector have all improved during these years. Climate change has also happened…you would have noticed that the temperatures are rising.“After months of deliberations with the scientific and technical institutions and stake holders, the standards were revisited while balancing the interest of both the sides.

What will happen in future will be on the basis of notifications issued then,” he added.  FCI sources said procurement for the ongoing season is being done according to existing norms. “The recommendations are in proposal stage,” they said. Notably the proposal includes reduced limit of moisture content in wheat from present 14 per cent to 12 per cent.Meanwhile, Pandey said with Punjab and Haryana on board, the entire country is now covered under the Direct Benefit Transfer of MSP for grain procurement under the theme of “One Nation, One MSP, One DBT”.Dismissing observations of procurement “going slow”, including in Punjab, Pandey said procurement and transferring of the MSP amount is also going smoothly in Punjab. “We are now transferring in Punjab the MSP amount directly to farmers accounts which has been possible with the cooperation of the state government and ‘arhtiyas’, who are a very important stakeholder. They will get their respective commission due under the APMC Act and rules into their accounts. The farmers will get MSP of their amounts directly in their accounts.“There is no stakeholder interest clash or encroachment in Punjab. ‘Arhtiyas’ are receiving their commission separately through the e-mode of payment. Earlier, the MSP was going to farmers via 'arhtiya' and now it is being directly transferred to farmers online,” he said, in response to reports about ‘arthiyas’ demanding “signed blank cheques from farmers to facilitate procurement”.  “We hope to touch 427 LMT this season, the highest ever in the country. This type of procurement has never happened in the country. Procurement operations in Punjab started from April 10. From Baisakhi the activity will heighten,” he said.  So far the highest procurement has been reported from Haryana, he said, thanking the government and the ‘arhtiyas’ of the state.Meanwhile, to ramp up storage infrastructure in India and increase storage capacity by 100 LMT, the government is launching a storage modernisation plan. “By 2024-25, we will store our stocks in modern silos and phase out conventional godowns,” Pandey said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/proposal-for-changing-grain-procurement-specifications-formulated-after-due-consultations-centre-239498

16-04-2021||Dubai||UAE played role in bringing down tension between India and Pakistan: Emirati diplomat||The United Arab Emirates played a role in bringing down the tension between India and Pakistan and getting their bilateral ties back to a “healthy functional relationship”, Emirati ambassador to the US Yousef al-Otaiba has said.“They might not sort of become best friends but at least we want to get it to a level where it’s functional, where it’s operational, where they are speaking to each other,” al-Otaiba said during a virtual discussion with Stanford University’s Hoover Institution on Wednesday.India and Pakistan in a surprise announcement said on February 25 that they have agreed to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir and other sectors. Al-Otaiba himself brought up the issue while responding to a question, acknowledging his country’s role in “bringing Kashmir escalation down” between the two neighbours.“We try to be helpful where we have influence with two different countries. So, India and Pakistan was the most recent one…,” he said.“We don’t think they are going to become the most favoured nation to each other, but I think it’s important for them to have a healthy functional relationship,” he added.In New Delhi, asked about media reports that backchannel talks between India and Pakistan were going on for more than a year, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi did not give a direct reply.“If you talk about channels of communication on this issue, let me just recall that our respective high commissions exist and are functioning. So that is a very effective channel of communication,” Bagchi said on April 9.India has told Pakistan that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Islamabad in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility.On the same day, Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman stopped short of categorically denying its involvement in some kind of backchannel talks with India.Foreign Office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry at the weekly press briefing on April 9 was asked by several journalists about reported backchannel talks with India.Instead of rejecting it outrightly he said: “States have their ways and means to communicate which remain available even during wars. Therefore, whether any talks are taking place between India and Pakistan is not important.”     He added that the real issue was what should be discussed between the two countries and how the dialogue could be made meaningful and result-oriented dialogue.Ties between India and Pakistan nose-dived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in the neighbouring country.Subsequent attacks, including one on Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship.The relationship dipped further after India’s war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.The relations deteriorated after India announced withdrawing special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcation of the state into two union territories in August, 2019.Last month, Pakistan’s powerful Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa said that it was time for India and Pakistan to “bury the past and move forward” as he asserted that the peace between the two neighbours would help to “unlock” the potential of South and Central Asia.The powerful army, which has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 70 plus years of existence, has hitherto wielded considerable power in the matters of security and foreign policy.Gen Bajwa’s remarks came a day after Prime Minister Imran Khan made a similar statement.

His post mortem was conducted at Rampur district hospital in Uttar Pradesh.However, both the Delhi and Uttar Pradesh Police had told the court that Navreet Singh did not suffer any gunshot wounds.During the hearing, advocates Vrinda Grover and Soutik Banerjee, representing Hardeep Singh, said the family needs time to seek experts’ evaluation of the material provided to them by the police which included post mortem report and video and X-ray report of the deceased.The high court had earlier directed the Delhi health secretary to constitute a board of medical and forensic experts and also a radiologist to examine the X-Ray report of Navreet Singh.It had also asked the doctors of Maulana Azad Medical College here to prepare the X-Ray report from the original X-Ray plate which has been received by Delhi Police from the Uttar Pradesh police.Delhi Police had earlier said that according to the post-mortem report the young farmer died due to a head injury as a result of the accident and all his injuries were possible in a road accident.The petition has sought a court-monitored SIT probe into the death of the young farmer.Delhi Police has relied upon the footage collected from CCTV cameras located at the site—Deen Dayal Upadhyay marg—where the young farmer died and said that he was driving the tractor at high speed and the vehicle overturned after hitting the barricades.It had said that the footage also shows that the police personnel were running away for safety from the speeding tractor and that none of them fired upon the vehicle or the driver.  Delhi Police had also said that CCTV footage further indicated that the protestors did not take the injured Navreet Singh to any nearby hospital and instead they attacked the ambulances that reached the site after hearing about the accident.It had said that the protestors kept his body on the road for five hours and then spread rumours that he was killed in police firing.The petitioner’s counsel had earlier contended that the way Delhi Police has conducted itself in the matter “does not inspire a shred of confidence”.She had argued that this indicated that the victim lost control of the tractor and it overturned as he was shot by the police personnel.According to the police, the man had died as his tractor overturned at ITO where many farmers participating in the tractor parade had reached from the Ghazipur border after taking a detour of the pre-agreed route for the march.The police had claimed that the man was driving the tractor and he came under the vehicle as it overturned.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at the Delhi border points—Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur—for over four months, demanding the repeal of new farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price(MSP) for their crops.The protesting farmers clashed with the police in the national capital on January 26 during a tractor parade to highlight their demands.

16-04-2021||Naveen S Garewal ||Six of a family hacked to death by neighbour in Andhra village||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, April 15In a tragic incident six members of a family, including two children, were hacked to death using a sickle and a knife by a neighbour in early hours of Thursday in Juttada village in the outskirts of Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. The accused has been identified as Appalaraju, who lived in the same neighbourhood and had nurtured a grudge against the family of the victims since 2018. Besides one man, the dead include three women, a two-year-old boy and a six-month-old baby girl. He has since been arrested.V Sripad Rao, Assistant Commissioner of Police (West), Visakhapatnam said the police was trying to ascertain the involvement of someone more than Appalaraju as one man could not have killed four adults and one child without any struggle and resistance.   “The victims were lying in a pool of blood and were discovered around 6 am on Thursday. The murder appears to have taken place two hours earlier. They were all lying in a pool of blood. Appalaraju is a neighbour of the deceased and an ongoing property dispute between their families has come to light.”The dispute between the families dates back to 2018 and originated from a relationship between Vijay, the head of the victim’s family and the daughter of the accused. A case was pending against Vijay. The victims are Vijay’s wife, children, father and aunts, police have revealed. Rao said, “Since the altercation in 2018, the two families have not been on talking terms. The issue further deteriorated and led to this incident,” he added.  Locals said that an altercation had taken place between the two families the previous night that led to the murder. Sources also said that it was not a property dispute but an alleged extramarital affair between Vijay and the daughter of the accused that led to the murder.  The deceased have been identified as Bommidi Rammana (63), Bommidi Usharani (35), Allu Ramadevi (53), Nakella Aruna (57), Bommidi Uday (6), Bommidi Urvisha (6 months).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/six-of-a-family-hacked-to-death-by-neighbour-in-andhra-village-239464
16-04-2021||New Delhi||Indian regulator to decide on foreign vaccine makers’ applications in 3 days||Amid a COVID spike and daily cases setting a new grim peak on Thursday, the Indian drug regulator said that it would process the applications from the makers of the already approved COVID vaccine. The process would take place within three working days of submission of fast track job procurement and fast track process.    Detailing the regulatory pathway that would enable foreign-made vaccines to enter the Indian markets, the Central Drug Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) said: "The CDSCO would process applications for Restricted Use in Emergency Situation and the Drug Controller General of India would consider, and make a decision within three working days from the date of submission of a complete application by the applicant. The application can be made by the foreign manufacturer through its Indian subsidiary or through its authorized agent in India (in case it does not have an Indian subsidiary).”The pathway was published after the government agreed to waive off domestic clinical trial requirements before the grant of emergency use approval to vaccines made abroad and got cleared by credible regulators like, the USFDA, the European Medicines Agency, the UK and Japan regulators and the vaccines included in the WHO emergency use list. The WHO list has three Chinese made jabs, including Sinovac.The government has mandated, that the foreign applicants start bridging studies after the approval for restricted emergency use of their vaccines in India, and use the jab first on 100 people whose safety profile would be reviewed before the final rollout of the jab in the national COVID inoculation drive.The CDSCO has prepared detailed guidelines specifying regulatory pathway for approval of foreign approved Covid vaccines based on NEGVAC recommendations and disseminated them widely.Under the guidelines, the applications for grant of approval for Restricted Use in the Emergency may be submitted to CDSCO.DCGI will issue permission for Restricted Use in the Emergency with the following conditions — Vaccine shall be used as per the guidelines prescribed under National Covid-19 Vaccination Programme; the first 100 beneficiaries of such vaccines shall be assessed for 7 days for safety outcomes before it is rolled out for further Vaccination programme; the applicant shall initiate conduct of post-approval bridging clinical trials within 30 days of such approval; applications for Restricted Use in the Emergency for such vaccines may be accompanied by bridging trial protocol, application for an import registration certificate and application for an import license.The CDSCO said that it would process applications for Registration Certificate (registration of overseas manufacturing site and product for Covid vaccine) and Import License, within three working days from the date of approval of Restricted Use in Emergency Situation.“As per the existing protocol of CDSCO for batch release of vaccines, each batch of the vaccine will be released by Central Drugs Laboratory(CDL), Kasauli before it can be used as per the guidelines prescribed under the National Covid-19 vaccination programme. The applicant will use the Covid vaccine, after receipt of CDL approval, initially only on 100 beneficiaries and submit the safety data to CDSCO after which the CDSCO will review the safety data submitted by the applicant, and once found satisfactory, will authorise the applicant to use the vaccine. The CDSCO will approve the protocol for the bridging trial in consultation with the Subject Expert Committee (SEC) within seven days of the receipt of the proposal,” the guidelines said.The regulator also said the applicant will conduct the bridging trial within the timelines specified in the approved protocol, and submit data generated in the bridging trial to CDSCO.After the receipt of the bridging trial results, the DCGI will review the permission granted for Restricted Use in an Emergency.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-regulator-to-decide-on-foreign-vaccine-makers-applications-in-3-days-239439
16-04-2021||New Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal announces weekend curfew in Delhi||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday announced sweeping restrictions, including a weekend curfew and the closure of malls, gymnasiums, spas and auditoriums, in a bid to break the chain of the COVID-19 infection in the national capital.He also said there is no shortage of hospital beds in Delhi and over 5,000 are still available for COVID patients.There will be no in-house dining in restaurants and cinema halls will be allowed to operate with only 30 per cent capacity, the chief minister said at an online press conference a day after the city recorded the biggest single-day jump of 17,282 COVID-19 cases.Kejriwal said the essential services and weddings will not be affected by the weekend curfew and passes will be provided to those attending weddings.Those going to hospitals, railway stations and airports will also be issued curfew passes, he added.Kejriwal said the reason behind the weekend curfew was that on these days, people often indulged in recreation and other such activities that could be "curtailed" and "curbed" without much inconvenience to them."Therefore, the weekend curfew is being imposed to break the chain (of COVID-19) and prevent contact among people."But we will not allow any inconvenience to those involved in essential services like going to hospitals, railway stations or airports and also weddings. We will issue passes for their movement quickly and without harassment," he said.The government has already imposed a night curfew in the city from 10 pm to 5 am till April 30 in a bid to check the spread of the coronavirus.Kejriwal also said there is no shortage of hospital beds in Delhi and over 5,000 are still available for COVID patients.Efforts to increase the number of beds on a large scale will be made, he said and appealed to people not to "insist" on beds in particular hospitals.Restaurants will be allowed to do home delivery, Kejriwal announced, adding that only one weekly market in a zone will be allowed to open per day and steps will be taken to control the crowds in those.The government scaled down the occupancy of restaurants and cinema halls to 50 per cent of their seating capacity last week in view of the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Kejriwal said the number of cases is rising every day in Delhi and the restrictions were needed to check the spread of the virus.Also read: The government will also ensure a strict enforcement of COVID-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks, he said, noting that many people are still not following it.The chief minister said he expects the support of people in implementing the restrictions, adding that the government will tide over the fourth wave of COVID-19 with the help of the citizens as it did earlier.Delhi recorded the biggest single-day jump in its COVID-19 tally on Wednesday with 17,282 new cases, while 104 more people died due to the disease.Amid a massive surge in cases, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in the national capital issued an order on Wednesday to ramp up the number of beds reserved for COVID patients at its hospitals and attach banquet halls and hotels to these facilities.The move will add 3,269 beds in the COVID facilities in Delhi.With a sharp rise in the number of deaths due to the latest surge in COVID-19 cases, crematoriums and burial grounds in the city are struggling to manage their resources.According to the official figures on confirmed and suspected cases, the virus has killed 513 people in Delhi in the first 14 days of April, while it claimed 117 lives in March and 57 in February.This substantial rise in the fatality rate has led to a rush of bodies at the city's crematoriums and burial grounds. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arvind-kejriwal-announces-weekend-curfew-in-delhi-239429
