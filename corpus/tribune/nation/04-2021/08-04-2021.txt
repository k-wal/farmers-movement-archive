They are an effective channel of communications. I have nothing more to share.”Reports from Pakistan a fortnight had claimed that UAE had brokered the February 25 ceasefire. The latest reports appear to contradict the claim.Asked about Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov visiting Islamabad directly after his meeting with EAM S Jaishankar in Delhi, Bagchi said, “It is not for us to respond to that. India’s time-tested ties with Russia stand on own merit and our not influenced by other countries.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-sidesteps-reports-of-back-channel-talks-with-pak-236436
08-04-2021||New Delhi||Woman held for driving car that ran over senior citizen couple in Delhi’s Dwarka||A 28-year-old woman was arrested on Thursday for being behind the wheels of a car that allegedly mowed down an elderly couple in Dwarka four days ago, police said.The accused has been identified as Nupur Choudhary, they said.Earlier, her elder sister was arrested in connection with the incident who claimed that she was driving the car when the accident happened.Shanti Swaroop Arora (79) and his wife Anjula Arora (62) were run over by the car on Sunday evening, following which police arrested Deepakshi Choudhary (30), the elder sister of Nupur. She was apprehended on charges of rash driving and causing death by negligence.Shanti was a retired government official, while Anjula was a homemaker.However, police on Wednesday said the victims’ family had raised suspicion over who was actually driving the car.Police had said, “Deepakshi Choudhary accompanied the injured to Manipal hospital. She stated that she was driving the vehicle and committed the accident. She also produced her documents to the investigating officer. However, victim’s family raised doubts that her sister was driving the vehicle.”During investigation, it was found that Nupur, who works as a probationary officer in a public sector bank in Uttam Nagar, was driving the car at the time of the incident, a senior police officer said, adding that she has a learner’s licence.“Both Nupur and Deepakshi have been arrested. Nupur has been arrested for committing the accident and Deepakshi for misleading the police,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said.According to police, Deepakshi was trying to be protective in an attempt to prevent Nupur from getting booked in the case. Another possible reason could be that Deepakshi wanted to save Nupur as she is a government employee and a criminal case registered against her might have an impact on her job.However, there would be further clarity in due course of time.The incident occurred at Sector 11 on Sunday evening and CCTV footage of it went viral on social media.In the video, a Baleno car hits the couple and runs over them. A woman comes out of the car, goes to the rear side of the vehicle and later calls somebody after taking her mobile phone from the car.Police said they are checking the CCTV footage of the area and investigating the matter to ascertain the exact sequence of the incident. Further investigation in the case is in progress, police said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/woman-held-for-driving-car-that-ran-over-senior-citizen-couple-in-delhis-dwarka-236434
08-04-2021||New Delhi||WHO rejects SII’s proposal seeking extension of Covishield’s shelf life from 6 to 9 months||The WHO has rejected Serum Institute of India’s proposal seeking extension of the shelf life of Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, Covishield, from six to nine months, citing insufficient data, sources said.The WHO has also sought a meeting with Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to discuss the matter, they said.The move comes even as India’s drug regulator has extended Covishield’s shelf life from six to nine months from its manufacturing date.In a recent communique to Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), the WHO has also asked the firm to formulate the doses with enough titer.                  Shelf life is the length of time for which an item remains fit for use.The DCGI in a letter to SII in February said it has no objection in respect of ‘extension of shelf life of Covishield vaccine’ in multi-dose glass vial (10 dose-5ml) from six months to nine months.“You are permitted to apply the shelf life of nine months to unlabelled vials available on hand, subject to the condition that the details of such stock, batch-wise, shall be submitted to this office and Central Drugs Laboratory, Kasauli,” DCGI Dr V G Somani had said in the letter.The DCGI’s decision will help health authorities in reducing vaccine wastage.According to an update by the UK drug regulator dated February 22, the shelf-life of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is six months.Meanwhile, concerns have been raised about the vaccine as the European Union’s health agency concluded a “possible link” between the vaccine and rare blood clots but stressed that the benefits of the vaccine to protect against COVID-19 continue to outweigh the risks.The UK’s medicines regulator on Wednesday said that under-30s in the country will be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine due to “evolving evidence” linking it to rare blood clots.                 Developed by Oxford University and Swedish-British pharma major AstraZeneca, Covishield is being manufactured by SII.

08-04-2021||New Delhi||Delhi: 4 arrested, juvenile apprehended as man killed for objecting to wife's illicit relationship||A juvenile was apprehended while four people, including a woman, were arrested for allegedly killing her 35-year-old husband for objecting to her "illicit relationship" with another man, police said on Thursday. The accused woman along with her male friend named Mukesh Walia, a native of Haryana's Bhiwani, planned around six months ago to kill her husband Wasi Ahmad to get rid of him and claim an insurance amount so that the duo could live together along with her three children, they said.  As per their alleged plan, Mukesh roped in Sachin (19), Vikas (20) and a juvenile, and they hatched a conspiracy at a hotel in Mahipalpur area to kill Ahmad. Their first two attempts on Ahmad's life failed, but they allegedly managed to kill him on the night of April 3 in outer Delhi's Samaypur Badli area, police said. The victim worked with Mukesh, Sachin and Vikas as masseur in Mahipalpur area, they said. Detailing how they executed their alleged plan, police said that on April 3 the woman brought her husband to Swaroop Nagar with another lady in an auto-rickshaw on the pretext of providing massage service to a client.They were being followed by Mukesh and his three associates in a cab and they reached the designated place before the auto and waited for them, according to police."When Wasi Ahmad reached there, he joined the four accused, while his wife and another lady waited in the auto itself. All the four accused including the juvenile took the victim towards a vacant area on the pretext of a client waiting there. As they entered the bushy area, Sachin, Vikas and the juvenile overpowered him with towels, and pushed the victim to the ground," a senior police officer said. Later, Mukesh hit the victim on the head with stones and smashed his face until he died, he said. A day after the killing, his body was recovered by the police from the Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar area in outer Delhi's Samaypur Badli, police said. On April 6, when the probe team was inspecting the crime scene, they found the accused woman roaming in the area with her 15-year-old son in a suspicious manner, police said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer North) Rajiv Ranjan Singh said that during initial questioning, the woman tried to mislead the police, but  she disclosed later that she had come to the spot along with her son and Mukesh Walia, who left the place after seeing police personnel there. "Accused Mukesh was nabbed from Munirka and during interrogation, he disclosed that he and the victim's wife entered into an illicit relationship when the victim was admitted in a drug rehabilitation centre in Uttar Pradesh. "In his absence, he started living with the deceased's wife along with her three children at her house in Munirka. When he returned from the rehabilitation centre around three months ago, he started objecting to their affair and used to often beat his wife," the officer said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-4-arrested-juvenile-apprehended-as-man-killed-for-objecting-to-wifes-illicit-relationship-236428
08-04-2021||New Delhi||Hindu man buried as Muslim in Saudi: Centre plans for legal proceedings to bring back mortal remains||The Centre on Thursday told the Delhi High Court that it plans to get a power of attorney from the family of a Hindu man, who was buried in Saudi Arabia as per Muslim rites, to initiate legal proceedings there for bringing his remains back to India.The submission on behalf of the Ministry of External Affairs was made before Justice Prathiba M Singh who on April 5 had asked the government to explore alternate legal remedies available with it in the foreign land to exhume and repatriate the remains.The court had also said that the government cannot wait endlessly to bring back the remains in view of lack of updates from the Saudi government.On Thursday, the MEA, represented by central government standing counsel Ripudaman Singh Bhardwaj told the court that further correspondence was ongoing with the Saudi Arabian government and meetings were also scheduled with its Foreign Ministry to expedite the repatriation of the remains.Taking note of the submissions, the court said that if nothing happens by the next date of hearing on April 15, it intends to appoint an amicus curiae to assist it in the matter.The court was hearing a case in which the mortal remains of the Hindu man were wrongly buried in Saudi Arabia as per Muslim rites due to incorrect translation of his religion on the death certificate purportedly by Indian Consulate officials in Jeddah.The deceased's wife, who had been running from pillar to post to get the mortal remains, approached the high court in March seeking direction to the MEA to take steps to urgently exhume the remains and repatriate them to India in a time-bound manner.The high court had earlier asked the MEA to coordinate with the Deputy Chief of Missions of Saudi Embassy here to facilitate the exhumation and repatriation of the remains.It had also requested the Deputy Chief of Mission to obtain some timeline within which the process of exhumation and repatriation of the body would be completed.The widow, Anju Sharma, in her plea filed through advocate Subhash Chandran has said that on getting the news of her husband's death, the family had requested the authorities to repatriate the mortal remains.    Sanjeev Kumar, 51, died on January 24 in Saudi Arabia, where he was working, due to cardiac arrest and his mortal remains were kept at a hospital there."Shockingly, on February 18, the petitioner was informed that the body of her husband has been buried in Saudi Arabia while the family members of the deceased were waiting for the mortal remains in India."The officials in Indian Consulate explained that it was due to a mistake committed by the official translator of the Indian Consulate, Jeddah, who wrongly mentioned his religion as 'Muslim' in the death certificate. They also shared a letter of an apology tendered by the official translating agency of Indian Consulate in Jeddah with the petitioner herein," said the petition, filed through advocate Yogamaya M G.The plea also said that neither the woman, nor any of the family members gave consent to bury Kumar's body in Saudi Arabia.Thereafter, the woman requested the officials of Indian Consulate in Jeddah to ask the local authorities there to exhume the mortal remains of her husband so that they can be transported to India for performing last rites as per the faith of the family."Unfortunately, even after seven weeks of the death of the husband of petitioner, the authorities have failed to do necessary formalities to repatriate the mortal remains of Sanjeev Kumar to India for performing last rites," the plea has said.It also sought direction to the Centre to take appropriate departmental actions against officials concerned of the Indian Consulate at Jeddah for their willful negligence and also direct the authorities to obtain a corrected death certificate of the deceased and supply the document to his wife. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hindu-man-buried-as-muslim-in-saudi-centre-plans-for-legal-proceedings-to-bring-back-mortal-remains-236426

08-04-2021||---||NIA files charge sheet against 3 accused in Khalistan Liberation Force narco-terror case||New Delhi, April 8The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday said it has filed a supplementary charge-sheet in a Mohali special court against three accused in Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) narco-terror case.Those who have been named in the charge sheet include Rajender Singh, alias Ganja of Amritsar, Parminder Pal Singh, alias Bobby and Jasmeet Singh Hakimzada, originally resident of New Delhi but currently located in Dubai, said the NIA is an official statement.All the three accused persons have been charged under various sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act – UAPA, it added.In the statement the NIA said the investigation revealed that accused Rajender Singh was instrumental in selling the smuggled heroin in India, while Parminder Pal Singh had played an important role in channelising the proceeds through hawala from India to Dubai.It also said that Jasmeet Singh Hakimzada, a Dubai-based international drugs smuggler and money launderer, used to further transfer the funds to entities based in Pakistan, who used the money to support the activities of banned terrorist organisation KLF.“Hakimzada along with Harmeet Singh, a Pakistan-based self-styled chief of KLF have been instrumental in running a Narco-terror network to strengthen the terrorist activities of the banned outfit. The investigation also established that a network of narco-traffickers, terrorists and hawala operatives based in Punjab, Delhi and Dubai was operating at the behest of Harmeet Singh and Hakimzada and was indulging in subversive activities against India,” the NIA said in the charge sheet.The case arose out of a Punjab Police FIR relating to seizure of 500 gm of heroin and proceeds of drugs about Rs 1,20,000 on May 31, 2020 from accused Jajbir Singh Samra and two other accused persons. Later, NIA took over the case and earlier after completion of investigation, the agency had filed a charge sheet against 10 accused persons in the case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-files-charge-sheet-against-3-accused-in-khalistan-liberation-force-narco-terror-case-236410

08-04-2021||New Delhi||Fight against COVID not Centre vs State issue, we should not politicise it: Jain||The fight against coronavirus is not a Centre versus state issue, and it should not be politicised, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain Thursday, a day after the Union government flagged below-par inoculation of eligible beneficiaries here and in some other states.The Centre had Wednesday written to Delhi, Maharashtra and Punjab rejecting as baseless allegations of shortage of the injection by Maharashtra and some other non-BJP ruled states. Interacting with reporters here, Jain said the vaccination drive is going well in the city. "I would say our common fight is against the coronavirus pandemic, and it is not a state vs Centre thing. So, we should not politicise the issue, and fight it together," he added.Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had Wednesday alleged some states were trying to cover their "failures" by demanding vaccination for all without first inoculating enough of the eligible beneficiaries. On a query on the vaccination drive in Delhi, Jain said Thursday, "The vaccination drive is going well in Delhi, we have received some vials yesterday. The vaccination stock is available for 4-5 days with us. We will be receiving it continuously as per our demand."As India registered a record single-day spike of over 1.26 lakh COVID-19 cases, Jain said, "Yesterday, India reported over 1,25,000 cases, as opposed to the earlier peaks in which the highest count was lodged at 99,000. This means that this peak is more infectious, and the number of cases is higher than the previous ones." He said the Kejriwal government has also appealed to the Centre to allow it to set up vaccination camps in communities for a mass inoculation drive.India registered a record single-day spike of 1,26,789 new COVID-19 cases, pushing its infection tally to 1,29,28,574, while the number of active cases too went upwards to breach the nine lakh-mark again, Union Health Ministry data updated on Thursday showed.The death toll due to the disease in the country increased to 1,66,862, with 685 new fatalities being reported in a day, according to the data updated in the morning.Registering a steady increase for the 29th day in row, the count of active cases has gone up to 9,10,319, which is 7.04 per cent of the total infections, while the country's recovery rate has dropped to 91.67 per cent, it stated.Delhi reported 5,506 positive cases on Wednesday and the positivity rate was above 6 per cent, and 90,000 covid tests were conducted, he added.The number of fatalities reported was 20 on Wednesday, and the case fatality ratio stood at 0.4 per cent. When the last peak was reported in Delhi in November, the case fatality rate was 2-3 per cent, the minister said."This time, the coronavirus is spreading exponentially but the severity of the virus is less, and so are the fatalities. Also, younger population is getting more infected," Jain added."The positivity rate in Delhi is a little above 6 per cent, while in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, it has been around 25 per cent and 18 per cent respectively. In many other states, the positivity rate is above 10 per cent," Jain told reporters.Jain said that the Kejriwal government has made two more requests to the Centre: vaccination should be allowed for everyone, at least adults; and to allow setting up of vaccination camps in community areas, unlike the existing model of jabs being given at  healthcare facilities only.On a question on the number of healthcare workers being inoculated here, he said that suggestions are being made about "lower number" in that category of beneficiaries, but, the "number is low at Centre-run facilities, and higher at Delhi government hospitals".Meanwhile, authorities in North West District on Wednesday issued an order, asking to do "RT-PCR/RAT tests on all persons visiting the dispensaries for their ailments or vaccination with immediate effect". — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fight-against-covid-not-centre-vs-state-issue-we-should-not-politicise-it-jain-236408

08-04-2021||New Delhi||India denies it midwifed vaccine supplies on Taiwan’s request||After China was displeased with the media commentary around the exchange of condolences earlier this week between India and Taiwan, Taipei claimed there was another instance of close bonding between the two countries.However, New Delhi has contradicted the claim by Taiwan’s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu that India shipped one lakh doses on its request and will again send a similar quantity to Paraguay.“I would like to confirm that no third party was involved,’’ said Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.According to Wu, China was pressurising the Latin American country to accept urgently-required vaccine doses only if it ended diplomatic recognition of Taiwan.But Bagchi said India is opening an embassy in Paraguay and during a conversation between the foreign ministers, the demand for vaccines was raised. Accordingly, India sent one lakh doses of vaccines to Paraguay, he added.Taiwan’s foreign minister had said, “In the last few weeks, we have been speaking to like-minded countries, and India fortunately has been able to provide some vaccines to Paraguay,” Wu disclosed.The government in Paraguay had needed urgent help as there had been street protests over its handling of the health crisis. India had sent the one lakh doses on March 26 as “gift’’.“The most important trend is the Indian government who is willing to help, and the US who has decided they want to help, and I think this is going to relieve a lot of pressure for a lot of countries,’’ he said.The nub of the problem is that under a grand bargain between the US and China in the 70s, it was agreed not to recognise Taiwan, a breakaway island-republic, as a country under what is known as the ‘One China’ principle.But in order to keep leverage, the US ensured that some countries, most of them tiny island nations, continue recognising Taiwan as the real China. Beijing, on the other hand, entices these nations to give up its recognition of Taiwan in exchange for material benefits.In a celebrated case in 2007, China successfully swung a Caribbean nation away from Taiwan by building a cricket stadium.A couple of days back, India had condoled the victims of a train crash. This was followed by Taiwan expressing its condolences on the loss of life and injuries in the Chhattisgarh Maoist ambush. But the Chinese embassy here took umbrage to an editorial, which “seriously violated One-China principle and provoked China’s bottom line disregarding long-standing position of the Indian government.”“China firmly opposes any country having diplomatic ties and making any form of official contact and exchanges with Taiwan. China’s red line on the Taiwan question cannot be challenged. On issues of right and wrong, there is no room for compromise,” said the spokesperson.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-denies-it-midwifed-vaccine-supplies-on-taiwans-request-236403

It is her (petitioner) life What is this argument that she has many boyfriends? Argue on law point,” Justice Pitale said.The court added that the complainant mother should be happy that the petitioner, against whom she has levelled allegations of domestic violence, is going far away.The bench has reserved its judgment on the petition and said it would pronounce its verdict on April 19.

The observations by the court came on a man's plea seeking setting aside of a May 2020 order upholding the revocation of his passport.The Centre contended that once a passport is revoked it cannot be restored and the petitioner would have to apply afresh for a new one.While the man claimed he was given no prior notice nor an opportunity to plead his case, Centre said he was given a chance to place his stand before the Indian Mission in Houstan, Texas in the USA.The court directed the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to file an affidavit stating whether the man was given prior notice and an opportunity to be heard by the Indian Mission, before his passport was revoked.The court said if no affidavit is filed before the next date of hearing on April 23, then a senior official from the Passport Seva Programme (PSP) Division of MEA shall join the proceedings before it. "Revoking a passport is a strong measure. You cannot do it like this," it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/matrimonial-row-cant-be-reason-to-revoke-passport-hc-tells-centre-236397

08-04-2021||New Delhi||India did well in transition to digital learning: Oxford report||The transition to online learning during the coronavirus-induced lockdown in India was done rather well, though unequal access to digital learning devices as well as lack of internet connectivity were major issues, according to the findings of a new report from Oxford University Press (OUP).The pandemic has paved the way for a hybrid model in education, combining digital and traditional methods of teaching and learning, but governments need to act so that progress from the past year is not lost, according to the report “Education: The Journey Towards a Digital Revolution”.It captured insights from experts across seven markets - India, the UK, Brazil, South Africa, Pakistan, Spain, and Turkey - as well as from hundreds of teachers globally, and extensive secondary research.With the pandemic affecting more than 1.7 billion students worldwide over the past 12 months, the report analysed how teachers, students, and parents adapted to new ways of delivering education, and will continue to utilise digital learning tools and resources to shape educational practice in the future.“In India, compared to other countries, respondents felt that the transition to online learning was done rather well, scoring 3.3/5. However, a major issue identified by respondents was unequal access to digital learning devices, as well as a lack of internet connectivity and little familiarity around the tools required to facilitate online learning,” the report said.“The majority of respondents in India (71 per cent) also felt that shifting to online has been detrimental to wellbeing. The priority for the government is to provide more funding, as well as addressing connectivity issues, particularly in rural areas,” it said.The top three issues identified as having a negative impact on digital learning were: socio-economic barriers, lack of professional development opportunities for teachers, and disruption or uncertainty in day-to-day life caused by the pandemic.When asked what steps the government should take to support digital learning, the respondents sought support for improving connectivity, increased funding for technology and more professional development opportunities for teachers.Speaking about the research, OUP CEO Nigel Portwood said the pandemic has, unsurprisingly, prompted a rapid increase in the adoption of digital learning.“As we start to reimagine what education may look like in the future, it is imperative that the governments learn from those who have been on the frontline, delivering and receiving learning. We have a huge opportunity to learn from all our experience to develop education systems that will work for both local and global society,” he said.

Of them, more than 1.72 lakh people were given a second dose of the vaccines.Health Minister Rajesh Tope had on Wednesday said that many inoculation centres in Maharashtra are being shut due to the shortage of coronavirus vaccine. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbais-covid-19-vaccination-to-halt-due-to-lack-of-vaccines-mayor-236379

The focus of the talk would be disengagement on other friction points. After Pangong disengagement, both the countries have planned to carry out disengagement on other friction points like Gogra, Hot Springs and Depsang."Important that before the onset of summer, de-escalation is discussed. Both sides need retreat to original positions for things to ease," said a senior Indian Army officer.On February 20, Indian and Chinese militaries held 10th round of military dialogue to de-escalate tension at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Indian military delegates were led by Lieutenant General PGK Menon, Commander of 14 Corps based in Leh.They had met to discuss disengagement at friction areas like Hot Springs, Gogra and 900 square km Depsang plains."The initial attempt will be to resolve Gogra and Hot Springs.

08-04-2021||Vijay Mohan||CSIR gadget developed to treat Covid patients has spin-off for defence forces in high-altitude areas||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, April 8An oxygen enrichment unit (OEU) developed indigenously by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to treat Covid patients has a spin-off for the defence forces in high-altitude areas as it can be used at heights where such equipment normally does not function.Commercially available OEUs generally work till an altitude of 8,000 feet above sea level. With an optional plug-in module, CSIR's unit can work up to an altitude of 14,000 feet, thereby making it handy for use during contingencies in high-altitude battlefield areas where rarefied air and extreme climate can cause medical emergencies.OEU is a device which concentrates oxygen from the surrounding air by selectively removing nitrogen to supply oxygen-enriched air. The concentrated oxygen is delivered to patients with respiratory problems through a mask or a nasal cannula.Designed by CSIR’s Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CMERI), the device may be used in remote places, homes or hospitals for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), chronic hypoxemia and pulmonary edema. It can also be used as an adjunct treatment for severe sleep apnoea in conjunction with a continuous positive airway pressure unit.According to Prof Harish Hirani, director, CMERI, the unit may be very useful for homes and hospitals as well as defence forces, particularly in high-altitude terrain and remote localities, besides being more effective and crucial for treating Covid patients. He said this unit might reduce the demand for oxygen cylinders and ventilators and due to the rise in air pollution its demand is expected to grow rapidly as it is useful in maintaining proper oxygen levels for an optimum healthy environment.The unit works on the principle of “pressure swing adsorption” to remove nitrogen from the air under certain pressure using a compressor and valves, thereby increasing the oxygen concentration.CSIR’s unit is capable of delivering up to 30 litre per minute (LPM) of oxygen-enriched air, which is absent in the other commercially available units. It is claimed to give an outflow of 93 per cent oxygen concentration level as compared to 27-35 per cent by other units. The machine can also regulate air flow with accuracy 0.5 LPM, which will help in high-flow oxygen therapy, a better method in treatment and management of Covid patients.After testing, validation and benchmarking, the technology for manufacturing the OEU has been transferred by CMERI to a private firm for commercial production and a unit costs about Rs 35,000.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/csir-gadget-developed-to-treat-covid-patients-has-spin-off-for-defence-forces-in-high-altitude-areas-236348

08-04-2021||Washington||Democracies around world, including US and India, facing challenges: Indian-American Congressman||Democracies around the world, including the US and India, are facing challenges, Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi has said.                             “Today, one cannot escape the feeling that America’s democratic institutions are facing unprecedented threats,” he said on Wednesday commemorating the ‘International Day of Conscience’, which was on April 5. He was referring to the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.“In response to the January 6th insurrection, Americans must rededicate ourselves to upholding the core principle of any secular democracy: that individuals of all races, religions and backgrounds can express their views freely and live in peace, with their rights and safety guaranteed,” Krishnamoorthi said.The recent wave of violent attacks on Asian-Americans, culminating in the mass shooting in Atlanta on March 16, underscores the urgency of defending the rights and security of all, he said.“Democracies around the world are facing similar challenges, including my birth country of India - the world’s largest secular democracy. Just as in the United States, Indian people of all religious and cultural backgrounds—Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, and others, including members of all castes—must be able to flourish and live safely with the freedom to fulfill their full potential,” said the Indian-American Congressman.The issues that divide the Indian people and its institutions also threaten to hinder needed progress on common challenges, such as vaccinating the global population against the COVID-19 pandemic, confronting the threat of Chinese military aggression, and repairing the economy and allowing it to reach new heights, he asserted.“India is an essential ally of the US on critical challenges such as security issues and climate change. It is crucial that both of our democracies remain strong by remaining true to our shared highest principles, such as treating all people with dignity, fairness and respect,” Krishnamoorthi said.“In addition, in countries ranging from France to Germany, the UK, and other Western democracies, concerns are developing about the erosion of democratic norms and the ability of ethnic, religious, and cultural minorities to prosper. In both France and Germany, for example, recently collected data suggest there was a significant rise in hate crimes and violence against religious minorities in the last year,” he added.Krishnamoorthi said that the horrific events in Washington, DC and Atlanta have served as striking reminders that American democracy can never be taken for granted.“They also serve as important lessons for our fellow democracies around the globe that the rights and security of all people must always be protected and upheld. I hope this week as we celebrate the International Day of Conscience, we all reflect on how we can do more to promote the culture of peace with love and conscience,” he said.

Earlier, I provided them with the facilities of bathing, toilets, besides offering them milk and food on many occasions. Recently, they approached me to take the land on rent for cultivation to meet the shortage of vegetables. But I gave them land free of cost on humanitarian grounds as they are fighting the battle for the entire farming community,” said Nar Singh Rao.Rao, who owns four acres of agricultural land, said the farmers could use the land till their agitation ended. “We are prepared for a long haul. Since we have no other work here except participating in the protest, we decided to grow vegetables such as bottle gourd, pumpkin and peppermint etc to meet the daily demand. The residents of Haryana have been extending every kind of help for the last four months, but the supply of vegetables has gone down for the last couple of days,” said Shamsher Singh of Amritsar. He said they had ploughed the field and asked kin back home to bring vegetable seeds.

08-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra Covid situation 'grim', Centre has assured help: Pawar||NCP president Sharad Pawar on Thursday said the Centre has assured to help Maharashtra where the COVID-19 situation is currently "grim".In a live address on Facebook, Pawar, whose party shares power in Maharashtra with the Shiv Sena and Congress, said he spoke to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday and the latter assured to support Maharashtra and other states to tackle the situation.Pawar said the rapid spread of the viral infection and the rising number of active cases was a cause for concern, and the state government had no option but to impose curbs as the gravity of the situation cannot be ignored."The situation in Maharashtra is grim. I appeal to all stakeholders to cooperate by realising the seriousness of the situation. To protect the lives of citizens, some stringent measures are required," the NCP chief said."The Centre is also helping. I spoke to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan yesterday regarding the situation in Maharashtra," the NCP chief said.Pawar said Vardhan assured that the Centre will stand by the Maharashtra government and all other states to tackle the situation.On Wednesday, Vardhan lashed out at Maharashtra and some other states, accusing them of trying to cover their "failures" in containing the pandemic by making "deplorable" attempts through "irresponsible" statements to distract attention and spreading panic among people.Pawar said health workers in Maharashtra were doing their best to control the spread of the viral infection.He said the state government has taken some steps, like imposing strict curbs to break the virus chain, on the advice of experts.The 80-year-old leader's comments came in the wake of protests from traders and small businessmen against restrictions imposed by the state government.As per the state government's 'Break the Chain' order, all shops under the non-essential category will remain closed till April 30.The opposition BJP in Maharashtra has criticised the curbs after initially supporting the government's efforts.

08-04-2021||New Delhi||Students of classes 10, 12 want board exams cancelled because of Covid||Amid a surge in COVID-19 cases, over one lakh students of classes 10 and 12 have signed petitions urging the government to either cancel board exams scheduled to be held in May or conduct them in online mode.The hashtag "cancelboardexams2021" has been trending on Twitter for the past two days.However, both the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) have said that adequate safety arrangements are being made for students and all COVID-19 guidelines will be followed during the exams."The situation in India is getting worse day by day. When there were only a few cases in the country, they cancelled the remaining board exams and now when the cases are at a peak they are planning to open schools. We urge the education minister to look into this matter and cancel all examinations to be held this year as students are already under a lot of stress," a petition on Change.org said.Divya Garg, a class 10 student, on Twitter urged the government to postpone the exams for at least a month and then take a further review based on the number of cases."The students have already faced a lot of problems till now in this pandemic. Classes were held online so the exams should also be held online or students should be promoted via internal assessment marks," another user tweeted.Usually, practical exams are conducted in January and written exams begin in February and conclude in March. However, the exams were delayed and are scheduled to be held in May-June in view of the pandemic."Adequate arrangements are being made to ensure the students are safe and all COVID protocols are followed. The number of exam centres has been increased by 40-50 per cent to ensure social distancing. The staff at exam centres is being sensitised to ensure all guidelines are followed," a senior CBSE official said.The board had last week announced that if any student fails to appear for ongoing practical exams after the student or any family member testing positive, the schools will conduct re-tests for them at an appropriate time.The official, however, did not comment on whether the same relaxation will be given to students in theory exams as well.Similarly, Gerry Arathoon, the chief executive and secretary at CISCE, said the schedule for exams "will remain the same".Schools across the country were closed in March last year to contain the spread of COVID-19 ahead of a nationwide lockdown.Several states started reopening the schools partially from October last year, but physical classes are again being suspended in view of the exponential rise in coronavirus cases.Last year, the board exams had to be postponed mid-way in March. They were later cancelled and the results were announced on the basis of an alternative assessment scheme.Both the CBSE and CISCE had decided not to come up with a merit list last year.India registered a record single-day spike of 1,26,789 new COVID-19 cases, pushing its infection tally to 1,29,28,574, while the number of active cases too went upwards to breach the nine lakh mark again, the Union Health Ministry's data updated on Thursday showed.

He swore in the name of Sena supremo Balasaheb Thackeray and asserted that he has not done anything wrong.Talking to reporters here on Thursday, Raut said there is a new trend of getting letters written from the accused locked up in jail."Never before has the country seen dirty politics being played out in such a manner, like indulging in character assassination using investigation agencies and IT cells of political parties, and letters from accused locked up in jail," the Rajya Sabha member said.Raut said attempts to weaken and destabilise the MVA government "will not be successful"."I know Anil Parab. He is a staunch Shiv Sainik and will never swear wrongly in the name of Balasaheb Thackeray," Raut said.The Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress share power in Maharashtra.

08-04-2021||New Delhi||Plea for compulsory masking during poll campaign: Delhi HC seeks stand of Centre, EC||The Delhi High Court on Thursday sought response of the Centre and the Election Commission on a plea seeking to ensure that masks are worn mandatorily by everyone involved in poll campaigns during the ongoing elections in various states and union territories.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh issued notice to the Centre and the EC and sought their response to the application by Vikram Singh, the former DGP of Uttar Pradesh and also the chairman of think-tank Centre for Accountability and Systemic Change (CASC).The court listed the application for further hearing on April 30 along with Singh's main petition seeking to debar campaigners and candidates from campaigning in the Assembly elections for repeatedly violating the mandatory guidelines issued by the poll panel in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.Advocate Virag Gupta, appearing for Singh, told the bench that the poll body should "create awareness through digital, print and electronic media for compulsory masking and social distancing during assembly elections"."When all the authorities are unanimous on mandatory masking, it defies logic as to why the rule should not be enforced in election campaigns," Gupta argued.The Central government's standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia accepted notice on behalf of the Centre.Singh, in his application filed through advocate Gaurav Pathak, has sought a direction to the Centre to ensure strict compliance of its March 23 order, mandating imposition of appropriate fines, on persons not wearing face masks in public and workplaces, in states and UTs where elections are being held.The Assembly elections in Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Puducherry are being held in various phases. The polls started on March 27 and will conclude on April 29.Singh has contended that despite the orders and guidelines of the Centre and EC, "election campaigning is going on in full swing, without any regard to the Covid regulations".He has claimed that there is an "indirect discrimination" against the general public as fines are collected from them for violating Covid norms, but no action is taken against politicians.

08-04-2021||Washington||During COVID-19 pandemic, India's debt to GDP ratio increased from 74 pc to 90 pc: IMF||India's debt to GDP ratio increased from 74 per cent to 90 per cent during the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Monetary Fund has said, noting that it expects this to drop down to 80 per cent as a result of the country's economic recovery.Paolo Mauro, Deputy Director, IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department told reporters at a news conference here on Wednesday, "In the case of India, the debt ratio at the end of 2019, prior to the pandemic, was 74 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and at the end of 2020, it is almost 90 per cent of GDP. So, that's a very large increase, but it is something that other emerging markets and advanced economies have experienced as well.""And, for the case of India going forward, in our baseline forecast, we expect that the debt ratio will gradually come down as the economy recovers. In our baseline forecast under the assumption of healthy economic growth in the medium term, we see debt returning to about 80 per cent over time," Mauro said.Responding to a question, he said that the immediate priorities are to continue supporting people and firms, and, in particular, to focus on supporting the most vulnerable.At the same time, it is important to reassure the general public and investors that the public finance is under control and the way to do so is through a credible medium term fiscal framework. "This year, India has already announced its budget. It continues to be accommodative. It continues to support health, and it continues to support people. Over the next years, it is quite likely that the deficit will be reduced in part as the economy recovers," he said.More generally in emerging markets, the priority, given to the very large increases in inequality, given the large increases in public debt, is to mobilise revenues in the medium term, Mauro added.Vitor Gaspar, Director of IMF's Fiscal Affairs Department, said that  given widening deficits and contraction in economic activity, debt worldwide increased sharply to 97 per cent of GDP in 2020. It will increase slower to 99 per cent in 2021 before stabilising below but close to 100 per cent of GDP, he added.In 2020, fiscal policy also contributed to mitigate falling economic activity and employment. It avoided falls on the scale of the great depression.Gaspar said that that countries with better access to financing, countries with stronger buffers, countries with stronger fundamentals have been able to give more fiscal support during 2020. They can sustain that fiscal support for longer, and they have more options in terms of policymaking. It is very clear when we focus on the group of emerging markets specifically, he said."So, speaking about emerging markets as a group, when looking at the current situation, ignore the need for fiscal policies to be tailored to fit to the country's circumstances, which is a very important point to make. Clearly there are risks. "On occasion we have a turmoil or even turbulence in markets. When it is necessary to act to restore confidence of markets and our membership, the IMF stands ready to act and has a financial capacity of about USD 1 trillion," Gaspar said.

08-04-2021||Washington||Faster global growth driven primarily by US, China and India: World Bank president||There is now a faster global growth driven primarily by the US, China and India, World Bank president David Malpass has said even as he expressed concern over growing inequality due to the COVID-19 pandemic.He said here is also the concern of inequality in terms of vaccinations and median income that's not going up very fast for some countries."But there's also the concern that there's inequality. Inequality in terms of vaccinations, in terms of median income that's not going up very fast for some of the countries and may even be going down. There's the interest rate differential, where poor countries face much higher interest rates and they haven't gone down the way global interest rates have done," he said."There's the good news that there is faster global growth driven primarily by the US, China, and India, having strong rebounds," Malpass told reporters at the start of the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.The annual spring meeting, which is being held virtually, focuses on vaccines, climate change, debt and recovery.Malpass said there is an inequality in terms of the bankruptcy process, which is not available to sovereign countries, so the poorer countries do not have a way out of these very heavy debt burdens."There's also inequality in terms of access to credit with a lot of the stimulus going to the upper end, and people that don't have pristine credit ratings, for example, or small businesses, new entrants, women that would like to start a business, having great difficulty getting credit," he said.According to Malpass, the World Bank and the IMF are working closely together to have successful implementation of the G20's Common Framework to deal with unsustainable debt situations.There was a call for the private sector to provide comparable treatment with regard to debt, he said.

08-04-2021||Vibha Sharma||Ahead of Karnataka bypolls, signs of trouble in state BJP||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 6Amid the high-voltage political activity across the country, including Maharashtra, Karnataka too appears to be undergoing a political churning ahead of crucial bypolls scheduled for April 17.While the ruling BJP is facing a tough challenge in the Belagavi Lok Sabha and the Basavakalyan and Maski Assembly segments, Chief Minister BS Yeddiyurappa seems to have been left to fend for himself amid string of charges against him. Sources, in fact, say his fate depends upon the result of the three constituencies.“The BJP is facing trouble from within rather than the opposition Congress,” say sources.Persistent attacks by colleagues and disgruntlement among MLAs following a series of controversies have taken their toll on the CM. The party is facing “serious issues” in all the three seats, including Belagavi. The decision to field Mangala Angadi, wife of late Union Minister Suresh Angadi (from Belagavi) has created a rift among party cadres. Dissenters are saying the decision is “against the BJP’s declared stance against dynasty politics”, they say.Trouble has been brewing in the Karnataka BJP for several months now. However, despite controversies, the central leadership has not made any move to make amends, making many believe that perhaps it is waiting for the “right time” to take any decision related to Yeddiyurappa, a strongman in his own right.The incumbent CM has been battling criticism from senior BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, who has been relentlessly questioning his style of functioning and his son’s “alleged interference in government affairs”. However, apart from a general show-cause notice, he has not faced any disciplinary action. There was a sex CD case allegedly involving Ramesh Jarkiholi following which he quit the Cabinet.“The internal party strife may hurt the BJP in bypolls, but the central leadership is waiting for the right time to make changes,” says party leaders.Recently, another minister, KS Eshwarappa, wrote to the Governor, accusing Yediyurappa of lapses and running the state in an authoritarian way. This have only added to the problems of the CM.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-karnataka-bypolls-signs-of-trouble-in-state-bjp-236103

She also wanted the court to ensure a free and fair trial."The petitioner is left with no remedy but to approach this Hon'ble Court as there is grave and immediate threat to her husband's life in the State of UP which was also noted by this Hon'ble Court in the judgment dated 26.03.2021," she stated in her plea.The petitioner is "in complete fear that now any time an untoward incident can happen to her husband but for protective directions passed by this Hon'ble Court", Afsan submitted.Quoting somee sources, she stated that "some shooter in the guise of a lawyer along with the lawyer will carry out the murder/ruthless killing of her husband during the course of his appearance before the Special Judge (MP/MLA), UP and these plans are being made at the behest of some higher rank officers at the behest of the Government of Uttar Pradesh".A BSP MLA from Mau Sadar in Banda district of UP, he was lodged in a jail in UP as an undertrial when the Punjab Police obtained a production warrant against him on a complaint of extortion and criminal intimidation took him to Punjab.Allowing the Uttar Pradesh Government’s petition seeking transfer of the alleged gangster, a Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan had on March 26 directed that Ansari’s custody should be handed over Uttar Pradesh authorities in two weeks.It had dismissed Ansari’s plea to transfer the cases pending against him in UP to Delhi, the top court had said that he should be lodged in Banda Jail, where the Jail Superintendent would extend him necessary medical facilities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-to-hear-mukhtar-ansari-wifes-plea-tomorrow-236116

08-04-2021||---||Centre allows vaccination at workplace from April 11||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 7To boost the ongoing inoculation drive that continues to battle hesitancy and wastage issues, the government is all set to launch workplace Covid vaccinations from April 11.The decision has been taken as the national daily cases touched a new and alarming peak of 1,15,736 — the highest since the first case was reported on January 30, 2020, — and active infections that require medical intervention rose to 8,43,473.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan communicated the decision to the additional chief secretaries and principal secretaries of health in all states today, saying: “To increase access of vaccine to people aged 45 years and above, Covid-19 vaccination sessions may be organised at workplaces (both government and private), which have 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries by tagging these workplaces with an existing Covid vaccination centre.”The government’s rationale behind the decision is that a substantial proportion of people aged 45-59 years and in some cases up to 65 years are in the organised sector and involved in formal occupations in government and private offices, manufacturing and service sector.The vaccination of those above 45 years started on April 1 but the pace of coverage remains low. Though 30 crore priority group people were identified for inoculation in the first two phases of the drive (January 16-March 31), only 8,70,77,474 (29 per cent) doses have been administered as of Wednesday morning.The workplace will designate a nodal officer to coordinate with the district health authorities.How it will work||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-allows-vaccination-at-workplace-from-april-11-236077
08-04-2021||Shubhadeep Choudhury||Didi asks women supporters to gherao CRPF personnel||Tribune News ServiceKolkata, April 7West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday urged women activists of her party to “gherao” CRPF personnel deployed in the state on election duty. She alleged they were acting as BJP workers and targeting women in particular to prevent them from voting.Addressing a rally at Cooch Behar, she said some officers of the state police also had “switched sides” after the elections got under way in West Bengal. She cited the instance of Arambagh, where TMC candidate Sujata Mondal was chased by BJP supporters with lathis on Tuesday, and said, “I saw one in Arambagh yesterday… I saw the role of the officer-in-charge there.”On central forces, Mamata said if the CRPF prevented people from voting, some women must gherao (surround and block) them while other must use the opportunity to vote. “I respect the CRPF. They are real soldiers. But I do not respect the BJP’s CRPF. They are beating women and harassing people,” she alleged, casting aspersions on the paramilitary force that recently lost 22 men in an ambush by Naxals in Chhattisgarh. The CM accused the BJP of taking recourse to terror tactics in the third phase of voting. She said it was difficult to describe the torture endured by the TMC on Tuesday.“Trinamool candidate Sujata Mandal was beaten up with a bamboo stick. They killed our booth president in Goghat. Our candidate Nazmul was thrashed in Khanakul and the central forces stood guard in villages to prevent women from voting,” Mamata said.“I ask mothers and sisters — if anyone stops of you from voting, don’t obey. Have the courage to say no,” she added.‘Treat remark as seditious’Kolkata: The BJP took strong exception to Mamata’s remarks and urged the Election Commission to bar her from campaigning. In a letter to the West Bengal Chief Electoral Officer, the BJP said given the present situation, Mamata’s remark on the CRPF should be treated as “seditious and anti-national”. “The TMC must be derecognised as a political party,” demanded the BJP letter signed by Rajya Sabha MP Ashwini Vishnaw, industrialist-turned-BJP leader Shishir Bajoria and BJP Mahila Morcha general secretary Amrita Banerjee. The BJP also alleged that taking cues from Mamata’s speech, TMC supporters on Wednesday vandalised the vehicle of Dipak Kumar Roy, BJP candidate from the Sitai constituency. pti||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/didi-asks-women-supporters-to-gherao-crpf-personnel-236082
08-04-2021||Ajay Banerjee||LAC meet to set tone for summer strategy||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 7Almost 11 months into the ongoing tension in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), military commanders of India and China are again set for a meeting, which could very well set the tone for the upcoming summer.The commanders are slated to meet on April 9 and a continuation of the ongoing deadlock could raise tensions during summer. The talks will be held at the designated meeting point along the LAC in eastern Ladakh. Sources said there could be a “positive outcome”, but also warned against any estimation of a quick-fix solution.Starting February 10, troops of either side had pulled back from along the banks of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial lake. The present position of troops is not face-to-face, but they are within the striking range from where rapid redeployment is possible. After the disengagement, the process stalled.The next two steps — de-escalation and de-induction, which means pulling back troops and war equipment to the pre-April 2020 home bases — have not yet begun. These two steps will be expectedly discussed at the meeting. Also, matters of disengagement at Depsang, Gogra or Hot Springs are slated to come up in the upcoming talks, which will be the 11th round of military commander-level talks since June 2020.The commanders of the two sides had last met on February 20 after completing the first phase of the pullback from the LAC. Snowmelt has commenced in eastern Ladakh and within the next three-four weeks, the frozen rivers will spring to life. All gaps in the mountains will be accessible to tanks, artillery and rocket carrying vehicles.The Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on India-China border affairs which met on March 12 decided to conduct the next round of military commander talks. The WMCC decided to reach a mutually acceptable solution. The need to go to the WMCC arose as the military commanders could not arrive at a timeline of the phased de-escalation and de-induction.Depsang, Gogra on table tomorrow||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-meet-to-set-tone-for-summer-strategy-236084

08-04-2021||---||Next war cannot be fought on past experience: Gen Rawat||New Delhi, April 7  In a significant move, the Chief of Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat wants the forces to completely shed the ‘colonial era syndrome’. Speaking at the Vivekananda International Foundation, General Rawat sought to highlight how a changed global environment demands a change in outlook and policies.General Rawat was speaking on the theme ‘shaping the armed forces to meet likely current and future challenges’.“We cannot fight the next war premised on the experiences and structures of the past wars,” said the CDS. The key stone to the way forward is jointness, integration, and modernisation in line with the changing security environment and utmost optimisation of resources.A series of initiatives are being undertaken that will change the way Indian Armed forces fight and the way capability is developed. Greater emphasis would now be on advancing jointness and integration across the board to shape congruent perception for the three armed forces to jointly operate efficiently and effectively.The central theme is ‘to be future ready’ by balancing preparedness for today’s requirements with what we need to do differently to meet tomorrow’s challenges.India faces multiple and varied security threats and challenges across the full spectrum of conflict -- from proxy war to hybrid to non-contact, conventional and collusive wars under a nuclear overhang, said General Rawat.India not having a formally published document on ‘National Security Strategy’ does not mean absence of strategic thought or guidance or lack of an institutionalised process on management of National Security.General Rawat said there is an emergent need to develop a vision for the region, however, one must be careful to not ‘bite more than we can chew’.The region, he said, has witnessed military conflicts, civil wars, liberation movements, military dictatorships and challenges of insurgencies, religious fundamentalism, terrorism and poverty. Our neighbourhood continues to remain full of contradictions, disparities and paradoxes, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/next-war-cannot-be-fought-on-past-experience-gen-rawat-235952

It shows that the Muslim vote bank is slipping out of her hands. Had we said the same thing that all Hindus should unite, everybody would have criticised us. The EC would have sent us notices. We would have been censured,” the Prime Minister had said while addressing an election rally in Bengal on Tuesday.The BJP had on Monday approached the EC seeking action against Banerjee, alleging she had violated the Representation of the People’s Act by asking Muslims to come together and vote for her party in the state Assembly polls.During an election rally in Hooghly on April 3, the TMC leader had urged Muslim voters to vote en bloc for her party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ec-issues-notice-to-mamata-over-communal-remarks-235946

Maharashtra has vaccinated only 25 pc of the elderly, Delhi 30 pc and Punjab just 13 pc where four states and UTs have vaccinated more than 50 pc.“Doesn’t it seem evident these states are trying to divert attention from their poor vaccination efforts by continuously shifting goal-posts? Politicisation of public health is a damning indictment of some political leaders who should know better,” said Vardhan specifically taking on Maharashtra saying, “It is shocking how Maharashtra is putting its people in danger by letting people escape institutional quarantine mandate for personal vasuli,” Vardhan said.The minister’s statement followed appeals from CMs of the respective states to expand vaccinations.The government further said there was no vaccine shortage in Maharashtra and the repeated narrative was “an attempt to divert attention from Maharashtra government’s failures to control the pandemic”.Maharashtra contributed the most – 55,469 cases to the daily basket of 1.15 lakh cases today.Vardhan said the state’s inability to act responsibly was beyond comprehension and a greater folly was to spread panic among people by claiming vaccine shortages that do not exist.Vardhan also slammed Congress ruled Chhattisgarh for spreading “misinformation and panic on vaccination.”“Chhattisgarh has seen disproportionately higher number of deaths in three weeks. Their testing remains heavily dependent on rapid antigen tests which is unwise. The state even refused to use Covaxin despite the Indian Drug Controller approving the vaccine and must be the only government worldwide to incite vaccine hesitancy,” Vardhan said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-slams-punjab-maharashtra-delhi-on-covid-vaccine-expansion-calls-asks-if-theyve-covered-all-current-beneficiaries-235942

08-04-2021||Banda (UP)||Gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari brought back to UP's Banda jail from Punjab||After spending over two years in a Punjab prison, gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari was brought back to Banda jail early on Wednesday morning.He was ferried in an ambulance guarded by a strong posse of gun-toting security personnel throughout his 900-km journey from Ropar to this Uttar Pradesh town in the Bundelkhand region.Acting on a Supreme Court order, Uttar Pradesh Police took custody of the 57-year-old BSP MLA at Ropar jail on Tuesday to bring him back to Banda prison. It took around two hours to complete the formalities before he was handed over to UP Police after a medical check-up.Once the convoy entered the state on Tuesday evening, the fleet of security vehicles of Uttar Pradesh Police, which included an ambulance equipped with all life-saving equipment to meet any exigency en route to Banda, a journey that takes around 14 hours from Ropar, and an anti-riot police vehicle 'Vajra' whizzed past the newly-laid expressways.Before the convoy entered Banda jail at 4.30 am, it slowed down near Kanpur Dehat as stray animals blocked the road along a patch of thick forest. Apart from the ambulance, three police vehicles also entered the Banda jail premises.At 1.30 am, the police convoy in which Mukhtar Ansari was moving, was stopped for sometime in Satti police station area.As anxious reporters ran to the policemen and sought the reasons for the sudden stoppage from them, no response was given, and the policemen at the spot tried to evade the questions posed by reporters.Later, SO of Satti police station Kapil Dubey told PTI, "Mukhtar used toilet in the Satti police station premises to answer nature's call. He stayed inside the police station for almost five minutes."  Before this, around 1.10 am, the convoy came to a halt on the road between Bhognipur and Ghatampur due to stray animals. Initially, the speed of the vehicles was reduced, then the vehicles were stopped, and local police removed the stray animals, following which the convoy resumed its journey.While heavy security arrangements were made by Punjab Police outside Ropar jail, the Banda prison area looked like a cantonment zone with policemen keeping a hawk-eyed vigil all around.The police convoy entered Uttar Pradesh through the Eastern Peripheral Expressway in Baghpat around 6 pm, Allahabad zone Additional Director General of Police Prem Prakash told PTI.The Uttar Pradesh team had reached Ropar police lines at 4.30 am on Tuesday and left for the jail around noon for the transfer.The convoy left the jail premises at 2:08 pm taking a side gate, dodging mediapersons waiting outside the main gate. As the convoy took the Ambala road, some media vehicles gave a chase but soon gave up.The five-time MLA will cool his heels in barrack number 15 of the Banda district jail, where he was lodged in the past before being shifted to Punjab. Additional police force has been deployed at the jail at the request of prison authorities.He will be guarded by three security personnel round-the-clock inside the barrack."Security personnel have been posted inside as well as outside the jail premises," Banda jailor Pramod Tiwari said."In barrack number 15, where Ansari will be kept, arrangements for light, drinking water and cleanliness have been made," he said.Tiwari said access to the barrack had now been denied to other jail inmates.The main prison complex gate, which generally remains open, will now be kept closed. Only those jail staff reporting for duty would be allowed in after proper screening, he added.High towers have been put up outside the jail and extra police pickets have also been set up to keep a watch on every visitor.Meanwhile, principal of Government Medical College, Banda, Dr Mukesh Kumar Yadav, said a panel of four doctors had been constituted on the apex court's directions to monitor Ansari's health.Ansari was lodged in Ropar jail in January 2019 in connection with an extortion case.The legislator from Mau in eastern Uttar Pradesh faces 52 cases in the state and elsewhere, and 15 of them are in the trial stage.Also read: Mukhtar Ansari denied food, water during Punjab-UP transfer, alleges brother; govt says no health issuesThe BJP-run Uttar Pradesh government had accused the Congress government in Punjab of shielding Ansari for several months by not letting the state take custody.Punjab's home department had asked the Uttar Pradesh government to take Ansari's custody by April 8, following the March 26 Supreme Court order that had set a two-week deadline.The apex court had noted that Ansari was allegedly involved in cases of murder, attempt to murder, cheating and conspiracy, apart from offences under the Gangsters Act.It said his custody was being denied to Uttar Pradesh Police on trivial grounds under the guise of medical issues. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gangster-turned-politician-mukhtar-ansari-brought-back-to-ups-banda-jail-from-punjab-235824
