Three months’ salary has been paid in his savings bank account,” said the memorandum undersigned by college principal Rakesh Kumar Gupta.Gupta could not be reached for a comment even after several attempts.Saibaba, an assistant professor of English, was suspended after his arrest by the Maharashtra Police in 2014. His wife and daughters were receiving half of his salary since the arrest.Terming the latest development a “witch hunt”, Saibaba’s wife alleged that it was a “violation of employee’s rights” and she would take the matter to court.“Our appeal against his conviction is still pending in the Bombay High Court, how can they take such a decision? SAR Geelani (who was convicted in the Parliament attack case) is the best example. He was acquitted of all charges, he was never terminated. So why Saibaba’s service being terminated? This is a violation of employee’s rights,” she argued.Vasantha added that they have been receiving half his salary since the suspension. But now, with the termination, the family, which includes herself and their college-going daughter, will face financial difficulty, she said.“We don’t have any other option but to approach our lawyers, we will definitely challenge this decision in the court,” she said.DU Professor Nandita Narayan of the Committee for Defence and Release of GN Saibaba alleged that taking “precipitative action like termination” was highly condemnable while the legal process was on.“The Staff Association of RLA College and DUTA had warned the authorities against taking any such step. Moreover, the University had itself written to the College in 2019, citing legal opinion that show cause notice should be issued again.”“To our utter shock, the University short-circuited its own process and terminated his services without even waiting for his reply,” she said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ram-lal-anand-college-terminates-jailed-professor-gn-saibabas-service-wife-to-move-court-234200

03-04-2021||New Delhi||Health Minister Vardhan approves National Policy for Rare Diseases, 2021||Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan approved the ‘National Policy for Rare Diseases 2021’ which aims to lower the high cost of treatment for rare diseases, with increased focus on indigenous research and local production of medicines, an official statement said on Saturday.A provision for financial support up to Rs 20 lakh under the Umbrella Scheme of Rastriya Arogya Nidhi is proposed for the treatment of those rare diseases that require a one-time treatment (diseases listed under Group 1 in the rare disease policy).“Beneficiaries for such financial assistance will not be limited to BPL families, but the benefit will be extended to about 40 per cent of the population who are eligible under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana,” the health ministry said in the statement.The financial support for the treatment of rare diseases is proposed under the Umbrella Scheme of Rastriya Arogya Nidhi (RAN) and not under the Ayushman Bharat PMJAY, it stated.Besides, the policy also envisages a crowd funding mechanism in which corporates and individuals will be encouraged to extend financial support through a robust IT platform for the treatment of rare diseases.Funds so collected will be utilised by Centres of Excellence (CoEs) for treatment of all three categories of rare diseases as first charge and then the balance financial resources could also be used for research, the statement said.“Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan approved the ‘National Policy for Rare Diseases 2021’ on March 30,” the ministry said.“The Rare Diseases Policy aims to lower the high cost of treatment for rare diseases with increased focus on indigenous research with the help of a national consortium to be set up with the Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare as convenor,” it said.The policy also talks about the creation of national hospital based registry of rare diseases so that adequate data is available for definition of such diseases and for research and development related to rare diseases within the country, it said.It also focuses on early screening and prevention through primary and secondary health care infrastructure such as Health and Wellness Centres and District Early Intervention Centres (DEICs) and through counselling for high-risk patients, the ministry said.Screening will also be supported by Nidan Kendras set up by the Department of Biotechnology.The policy aims to strengthen tertiary health care facilities for prevention and treatment of rare diseases through designating eight health facilities as ‘Centres of Excellence’ and these will also be provided one-time financial support of up to Rs 5 crore for upgradation of diagnostics facilities, it said.The Draft policy for Rare Diseases was put in public domain on January 13, 2020, on which comments/views were invited from stakeholders, general public, organisations and states and Union territories. All the comments received were examined in depth by an expert committee constituted by the health ministry.The field of rare diseases is very complex and heterogeneous, and the prevention, treatment and management of rare diseases has multiple challenges.There are also fundamental challenges in the research and development for the majority of rare diseases as relatively little is known about the pathophysiology or the natural history of these diseases, particularly in the Indian context, the statement said.Rare diseases are also difficult to research upon as the patients pool is very small and it often results in inadequate clinical experience. Availability and accessibility to medicines are also important to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with rare disease. Despite progress in recent years, there is a need to augment effective and safe treatment for rare diseases.The cost of treatment of rare diseases is prohibitively expensive. Various high courts and the Supreme Court have also expressed concern about lack of a national policy for rare diseases, the statement added.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/health-minister-vardhan-approves-national-policy-for-rare-diseases-2021-234194

03-04-2021||Raidighi (WB)||BJP engineering communal strife in West Bengal to win Assembly polls: Mamata||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday accused the BJP of engineering communal strife in the state to win the Assembly elections.The TMC chief, while addressing an election rally in Raidighi in South 24 Parganas district, also called upon Muslims not to “fall in the trap of a BJP-aided party from Hyderabad and its Bengal ally that are out to polarise votes.”  Her jibe was apparently aimed at Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM and Abbas Siddiqui’s ISF. Both Owaisi and Siddiqui had earlier denied the TMC’s insinuations. The ISF is fighting the elections in alliance with the CPI(M) and the Congress.The TMC supremo also urged Hindus to be on the guard against the BJP’s attempts to “instigate communal clashes” and called upon them to chase away outsiders sent to foment trouble in their respective localities.Affirming her Hindu identity, in an apparent attempt to counter the minority appeasement charge against her, Banerjee said, “I am a devout Hindu who recites Chandi mantra every day before leaving home. But I believe in our tradition of giving respect to every religion.”Taking a dig at BJP leaders having lunch at houses of Dalits, she said, “I am a Brahmin woman. But my all-time associate is a Scheduled Caste woman who takes care of all my needs. She also cooks food for me.”“I need not advertise this as those bringing five-star hotel lunch to eat at the courtyard of a Dalit home are anti- Dalit, anti-backward caste and anti-minority in nature,” she said.The TMC chief claimed that if elected to power in West Bengal, the BJP will implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), forcing “many citizens to leave”.“They will divide West Bengal and its people. Remember how they deleted the names of 14 lakh Bengalis and 2 lakh Biharis in the updated NRC in Assam,” she said.Banerjee alleged that central forces are terrorising people at every home 48 hours before polling, asking them to vote for the BJP.“Don’t be intimidated. Mothers and sisters challenge them. We have no problems if the forces act impartially to ensure free and fair elections but if they act on behalf of a particular political party, we will protest,” she said.  The chief minister, who is contesting her former lieutenant and BJP candidate Suvendu Adhikari in Nandigram, alleged that there were attempts by “outsiders” to rig the elections in the constituency in Purba Medinipur district.“There were attempts by outsiders to rig the elections in Nandigram by visiting every house before polling. Still, I will win handsomely from the seat. One local goon was accompanied by outsider goons in Nandigram. This is their pattern,” she said.Taking a dig at TMC turncoats, she said sitting Raidighi MLA and actor Debasree Roy joined the BJP after not getting a party ticket from the seat.“We don’t involve such opportunists in our party,” she said.Noting that the TMC is fighting the elections on the development plank, she said, “There has been infrastructural development in Sunderbans. The state government has taken an initiative to provide egg meal at Rs 5 and women involved in SHGs in the region are involved in it.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-engineering-communal-strife-in-west-bengal-to-win-assembly-polls-mamata-234192
03-04-2021||Guwahati||Assam Assembly polls: Congress holds protest over EVM row||Following a controversy over a   polling team in Assam carrying an EVM in the vehicle belonging to the wife of a BJP candidate, the Congress on Saturday held a protest against the incident and alleged that the ruling party in the state is indulging in electoral manipulation.Amid slogan-shouting by the party workers, Assam Pradesh Congress Committee president Ripun Bora urged the Election Commission to take strict action against the BJP leaders who carry out illegal activities that hamper the polling process.The protest rally was not allowed to move forward on the busy arterial G S Road and stopped at the gate of the state Congress headquarters ‘Rajiv Bhawan’.Bora submitted a memorandum to Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime and Law and Order) Debaraj Upadhaya to send it to the Office of Chief Electoral Officer of the state.Violence had broken out in Karimganj district of Assam on Thursday night after a crowd spotted the BJP candidate’s vehicle being used to transport a polled EVM to the strong room, forcing the police to fire in the air to bring the situation under control.The incident snowballed into a huge controversy on Friday morning with the opposition Congress and AIUDF alleging that the EVM was being “stolen”, prompting the Election Commission to suspended four poll officials and order a repoll at the booth as a video of the fiasco went viral on social media.According to a district official, the vehicle of the polling party of the 149-Indira MV School in the Ratabari constituency broke down on its way to the strong room in Karimganj town, and they took a lift on a private car.Incidentally, the car was registered under the name of the wife of the sitting BJP MLA from Patharkandi Krishnendu Paul who is seeking re-election from the same seat this time, the official had said.Ratabari is currently represented by BJP MLA Bijoy Malakar, who is contesting the election as well.“Krishnendu Paul was found carrying an EVM in his car.“This was done in violation of the Election Code of Conduct and the laws laid down under the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951,” Bora said, citing his party’s memorandum.He also alleged that people found several EVMs in a vehicle not requisitioned for election purpose near Hatipura polling station in Diphu town.“Several voting machines were also seized in Jamunamukh constituency when being carried by government officials without security personnel. An EVM was missing from a polling booth in Kalaigaon segment,” the Congress claimed in its representation to the CEO.Congress Campaign Committee chairman Pradyut Bordoloi said, “We urged the EC to uphold the sanctity of political representation in a democracy and take action against the glaring misuse of power by the ruling regime in Assam.”        “The party and the people are convinced that the BJP is rattled, that is why it is resorting to treachery to win the elections,” he alleged.Meanwhile, the Election Commission reduced the 48-hour campaign ban imposed on Assam minister and BJP leader Himanta Biswa Sarma to 24 hours after he tendered an “unconditional apology” and assured the poll panel that he will abide by the provisions of the model code.The BJP leader now can start campaigning from Saturday evening.He was on Friday initially barred from campaigning- related activities till April 4 for allegedly making threatening remarks against Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) chief Hagrama Mohilary.The Congress had approached the EC demanding action against Sarma for his remark that Mohilary would be sent to jail through central probe agency NIA if he does “extremism” with rebel leader M Batha.The BPF is an ally of the Congress in Assam. It was previously with the BJP.Canvassing for the third and final phase of Assam assembly elections comes to an end on the evening of April 4.The final phase of polling will be held on April 6.The Assam Congress chief also urged the poll panel to take action against state minister Pijush Hazarika who allegedly threatened two journalists for reporting about a controversial campaign speech by his wife.The minister is contesting from the Jagiroad constituency where polling took place in the second phase on Thursday.

03-04-2021||Aligarh (UP)||Attack on my convoy pre-planned by BJP workers: Rakesh Tikait||Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait claimed on Saturday that the attack on his convoy of vehicles in Rajasthan's Alwar was "pre-planned by BJP workers" and said it should serve as a reminder to the farmers protesting against three new agriculture laws of the Centre about the travails and challenges they are going to face in the days to come.Addressing a "kisan mahapanchayat" at Bhaimalkheda village in this Uttar Pradesh district, Tikait said such attacks "are, in fact, strengthening our resolve to further intensify our struggle, which is a battle for our existence".Talking to reporters after the "mahapanchayat", he said, "We are mentally prepared for more such incidents." Stones were allegedly pelted at the convoy of Tikait, an influential farmer leader, in Rajasthan's Alwar district on Friday, damaging the rear windshield of his car. Police had detained a student leader, who the BKU claimed belonged to the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and accused the saffron party of being behind the attack.Addressing the "mahapanchayat" here, Tikait issued a call to the protesting farmers to be mentally prepared to continue with their agitation at least till the end of the year, when they would taste victory.He urged them to be mobile phone savvy so that they can be active on social media.Tikait, who held a "mahapanchayat" in Aligarh for the first time after the farmers' agitation was launched in November last year, alleged that corporates had fully entrenched themselves in the present ruling dispensation, including the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).He said how else can one explain the construction of huge grain depots and godowns in several parts of the country "even before the controversial farm laws came to existence".The BKU leader said this itself provides conclusive evidence of the government's intentions.He warned the farmers that even more draconian measures are on the anvil as far as the farm laws are concerned, including stringent regulations regarding crop seeds.Tikait alleged that under the proposed measures, farmers would be liable to be bound by pernicious terms and conditions, which would place them at the mercy of the seed-selling firms.He said the three laws would make it impossible for the farmers to enjoy the right to use the seeds of their choice and frustrate them to such an extent that they would be compelled to sell their land to corporates. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/attack-on-my-convoy-pre-planned-by-bjp-workers-rakesh-tikait-234179

03-04-2021||Mumbai||Rs 26.50 lakh withdrawn from Vaze’s joint account after arrest: NIA||The National Investigation Agency has found that an amount of Rs 26.50 lakh was withdrawn from the joint bank account of Sachin Vaze and his aide on March 18, five days after the Mumbai police officer was arrested for his alleged role in planting an explosives-laden SUV outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home on February 25, the court was told on Saturday.Without naming Vaze’s accomplice, the NIA said certain “incriminating material” was also taken out by someone from the joint locker of Vaze and his aide, who is a suspect in the case, from a bank located in Versova area in Mumbai.The special court extended the custody of Vaze till April 7 after the investigating agency told the court that it had recovered “incriminating material” including laptops, DVRs (Digital Video Recorders), a CPU etc, in a damaged condition, during the probe and they need to be examined.The NIA is also probing the murder of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, the purported owner of the Scorpio SUV which was found parked near Ambani’s south Mumbai residence ‘Antilia’.The NIA told the court that Vaze was seen moving near the “scene of the crime” on March 4, a day before Hiran’s body was found (in the creek in Mumbra in Thane district).The NIA told the court that a Mercedes car was seized on April 2.The agency had also recovered a diaryfrom a club in south Mumbai mentioning that a huge amount had been paid to Vaze.The agency told the court it had found the passport of an unknown person at Vaze’s house and needs his further custody to identify that person.Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh told the court Vaze held a joint bank account and a joint locker with his accomplice.The bank account had Rs 26.50 lakh on the day of Vaze’s arrest on March 13.However, the cash was found to bewithdrawn on March 18, Singh told the court, adding that some “incriminating material” was also found to be taken out from the bank locker.Seeking Vaze’s custody for another six days, Singh said the NIA needs to trace the incriminatingmaterial that went missing from the bank locker and also wants to find out who was using the Mercedes car seized on April 2 and under whose instructions.Some incriminating material was also seized during the search conducted at the house of former policeman and co- accused Vinayak Shinde, Singh said, adding the NIA will confront Vaze with the recovered evidence.The NIA also needs to examine the CCTV footage data it had seized during the investigation and needs to confront Vaze and other accused with it.Opposing the NIA’s plea, Vaze’s lawyer Abad Ponda said the NIA can seek remand of the accused under the provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention (UAPA) Act after the lapse of 15 days.However, the NIA has not mentioned a single ground seeking the extension of Vaze’s custody under the UAPA in its remand application, he said.Ponda rejected the NIA’s contention that Vaze held a joint account in the bank in Versova.He demanded that the NIA show the bank account opening form with the name and signature of the accused,which the agency rejected.Referring to the recovery of electronic devices from the Mithi river in Mumbai by the NIA, Ponda said as it is a huge river, anyone can dump anything into it.He said the NIA had planted these devices into the river, which it later showed as being recovered during the investigation.He said Vaze had nothing to do with these materials recovered by the NIA.“The recovery is based on their skill and volition and completely foisted upon me (Vaze),” Ponda added.Meanwhile, Vaze told the court that he was suffering from some cardiac issues and had suffered a stroke on Sunday.Vazehad demanded his examination by a cardiologist.Vaze’s lawyer submitted in court that the police officer has a blockage in his heart that can be treated only by angiography and angioplasty.However, the NIA said they had run diagnostics and found that Vaze’s heart was functioning normally.“We did ECG and blood test, 2D Echo..His heart is working normally. Doctors had advised him a bypass (surgery) in 2019, but he didn’t do it then,” the NIA said, adding Vaze was being provided the required treatment and that his health was being monitored.The court then directed the NIA to submit a detailed report on the next day on whether Vaze needs a specific treatment. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rs-26-50-lakh-withdrawn-from-vazes-joint-account-after-arrest-nia-234173
03-04-2021||Satya Prakash||1994 ISRO spy scandal: Justice DK Jain Committee submits report on allegations against Kerala police officers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 3Almost two-and-a-half year after the Supreme Court asked it to look into the lapses on part of Kerala Police officers in wrongfully arresting scientist S Nambo Narayanan in the 1994 ISRO spy scandal, the Justice DK Jain Committee has submitted its report to the Supreme Court.The three-man Committee which also included DK Prasad and VS Senthil -- representing the Centre and the Kerala Government, respectively -- submitted its report in a sealed cover recently, sources said. The Supreme Court had on September 14, 2018, ordered the Kerala Government to pay a compensation of Rs 50 Lakh to the former ISRO scientist whose life got ruined after he was falsely implicated in the ISRO spy scandal.It had set up a three-member panel led by Justice (retd) DK Jain “to find out ways and means to take appropriate steps against the erring (Kerala Police) officials.”The top court is likely to take up the report later this month for passing necessary orders.“The entire prosecution initiated by the state police was malicious and it has caused tremendous harassment and immeasurable anguish to the appellant, said the Bench which had reserved its verdict on July 10 on his petition seeking action against former Kerala DGP Siby Mathews and other police officers who allegedly falsely implicated him in the case.“The liberty and dignity of the appellant which are basic to his human rights were jeopardized as he was taken into custody and, eventually, despite all the glory of the past, he was compelled to face cynical abhorrence” the top court had said granting him compensation for “the suffering, anxiety and the treatment” meted out to him that withered away his fundamental right to life and liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.Narayanan (79) had challenged a Kerala High Court verdict that said no action was needed against former DGP Mathews and two retired Superintendents of Police, K K Joshua and S Vijayan for his illegal arrest.The Kerala Police had arrested Mariam Rasheeda -- a Maldivian woman on October 20, 1994, for overstaying in India after the expiry of her visa. It turned into a sex-spy scandal allegedly involving two senior ISRO scientists, some businessmen and others. They were accused of passing on ISRO's cryogenic programme secrets to the women who in turn supplied the same to Russia and Pakistan’s ISI.In 1996, the CBI probe cleared all the accused. It concluded that the entire scandal was fabricated by Kerala Police officers who had investigated the case. All the accused were discharged in May 1996. Along with the closure report, the CBI had also sent a confidential report indicting the state police officials.But following a change of guard in Kerala, the state government withdrew the consent given to the CBI to probe the case and asked the state police to re-investigate it.However, the Supreme Court in April 1998 quashed the state government’s decision and all the accused were freed. Rasheeda too was released in 2001. The Kerala High Court had in September 2012 ordered the state government to pay Rs 10 lakh as interim relief to Narayanan.Acting on his petition, the Kerala High Court had in October 2014 ordered action against the state police officials based on the CBI’s confidential report. But a Division Bench of the High Court reversed the order in March 2015.It’s this Division Bench verdict that Narayanan had challenged in the top court.The Supreme Court had said, “... there can be no scintilla of doubt that the appellant, a successful scientist having national reputation, has been compelled to undergo immense humiliation. The lackadaisical attitude of the State police to arrest anyone and put him in police custody has made the appellant to suffer the ignominy.“The dignity of a person gets shocked when psycho-pathological treatment is meted out to him. A human being cries for justice when he feels that the insensible act has crucified his self-respect. That warrants grant of compensation under the public law remedy, it had said. “The system I designed is being used in Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan and PSLV that launched 104 satellites in one go. But I am still fighting to get justice,” Narayanan had told The Tribune during the hearing. The court had also given him liberty to file a civil suit against the state government to claim additional compensation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1994-isro-spy-scandal-justice-dk-jain-committee-submits-report-on-allegations-against-kerala-police-officers-234169

03-04-2021||Sonarpur (WB)||Mamata calling BJP leaders outsiders insult to Netaji: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday slammed West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for branding BJP leaders as “outsiders” (Bohirgato) and said it is an insult to the inclusive ideology of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and principles of Indian Constitution.Asserting that Bengal’s “Bhumiputra” (son of the soil) will take over as the chief Minister after the BJP is voted to power on May 2, Modi said no Indian is an “outsider” in the state.“When the British tried to divide us, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose said—India is one, and the hopes and aspirations of every Indian are the same. Today, there is a lot of pain when instead of propagating the ideology of Netaji, TMC and Mamata Didi are talking about Bohirgato,” he told an election rally at Sonarpur in South 24 Parganas district.Didi is talking about outsiders. We are all children of Mother India. No Indian is an outsider here. When BJP forms the government after May 2, a son of the soil will become the chief minister, he said.Calling TMC a “Taka Maar Company” (an enterprise that loots money), the prime minister asked Banerjee to control her “goons”.“You keep your TMC goons under check. Explain to them—Modi is here! Their bullying will no longer be tolerated. Bengal doesn’t want violence and terror. Bengal wants education for its daughters and protection, respect and justice for its mothers,” he asserted.Referring to some TMC leaders’ claim that Banerjee might contest elections from his Lok Sabha seat Varanasi in 2024, Modi mocked the TMC boss, saying this proves that Didi has accepted her defeat.“Didi is now looking for a place for herself outside Bengal. The people of Varanasi and Uttar Pradesh are as large-hearted as the people of Bengal. They won’t call her an outsider,” he said sarcastically.Claiming that Banerjee decided to contest Nandigram on impulse “tao mein”, Modi said, sensing defeat at the prestigious seat, the TMC decided that Banerjee should enter the fray from another seat as well.“But some sensible people then told Didi it will be her second big mistake,” he quipped. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-calling-bjp-leaders-outsiders-insult-to-netaji-modi-234166

It was recorded by some TMC party workers. We want her to get back to normal life soon, we also pray for that... but she must stop putting up this drama by moving around in a wheelchair."If she was exercising her leg by shaking it then I suggest that she start walking as that will help her recuperate faster."Taking a jibe at the chief minister, Rahul Sinha, a senior leader of the saffron party, said the TMC supremo's bandage will not buy her votes."The more she is losing confidence the bigger her bandage gets. People are not buying this... She must have forgotten which leg is injured, and shook the wrong foot. She has already lost the elections, the bandage won't be able to save her from imminent defeat," Sinha said.Taking strong exception to the remarks made by BJP leaders, state minister Shashi Panja said the saffron camp, by raising suspicion over Banerjee's injuries, has not just insulted her but all the women of Bengal."We condemn the manner the BJP is insulting our beloved CM. They are not just insulting our CM, but also the other women of the state. We urge them to show proper respect to the women of this state," Panja said.Echoing her, former BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, who joined the TMC recently, said if anybody was churning out lies, it was the BJP and not the TMC."Are they (BJP leaders) trying to say that a whole lot of people involved (in treating her) including eminent doctors are lying? It's only the BJP which is capable of speaking such lies. I've no doubt in my mind that they are the ones behind this (propaganda)," Sinha, who had served as the finance minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet, stated.TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh also hit out at the BJP and said that the people of Bengal will give the BJP a befitting reply for its "dirty politics"."If they (BJP leaders) are spending so much time staring at Didi's feet, they might as well fall on her feet.We condemn such politics that targets a woman who is holding campaigns sitting on a wheelchair, after being attacked. This shows that the BJP has lost its plot," Ghosh said.Banerjee sustained injuries on her left leg, waist, shoulder and neck as she fell down after allegedly being pushed by miscreants in Nandigram on March 10. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamata-seen-shaking-injured-leg-in-video-sparks-war-of-words-between-tmc-and-bjp-234161
03-04-2021||---||Contempt plea against Justice Katju: Advocate seeks Solicitor General Tushar Mehta’s consent||New Delhi, April 3Days after Attorney General KK Venugopal recused himself from dealing with a plea for grant of sanction to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against former Supreme Court judge Justice Markandey Katju, a Delhi-based advocate on Saturday approached Solicitor General Tushar Mehta for it.Advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava wanted to initiate criminal contempt proceedings against the former SC judge for his alleged remarks against the top court in his deposition before a UK court in Nirav Modi extradition case.Section 15 (3) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 empowers either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General to grant consent for initiating criminal contempt proceedings, if deemed fit.Srivastava has written to Mehta after Venugopal refused to deal with the issue.“I have to point out that I have known Justice Katju for the last about 16 years and we have been interacting with each other ever since. In this background it is not appropriate that I deal with the matter,” Venugopal had written to Srivastava on March 30.Srivastava had on March 1 sought the AG’s consent for initiation of criminal contempt proceedings against Justice Katju, citing the UK court’s verdict of February 25 while rejecting the plea of fugitive economic offender Nirav Modi against his extradition to India.The UK court has recorded the alleged “contemptuous” remarks made by Justice Katju by way of evidence in favour of Nirav Modi, Srivastava had pointed out.Now, he has repeated all these points in his request to the Solicitor General.Nirav Modi is wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank scam case.On February 25, the Westminster Magistrates” Court in London had accepted the contention of the Indian government to extradite Nirav Modi saying that the evidence against him “is prima facie sufficient to order his extradition to India to face the charges”.It had rejected Nirav Modi’s submissions regarding human rights violations, fair trial and prison conditions and decided to send his case to the Secretary of the State, UK for a final decision.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/contempt-plea-against-justice-katju-advocate-seeks-solicitor-general-tushar-mehtas-consent-234159

03-04-2021||Haripal||Mamata's 'obstructionist mindset' deprived Bengal of jobs, industries: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday alleged the "obstructionist mindset" of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and her TMC deprived West Bengal of industries and jobs.He claimed the TMC supremo hurt people's self-respect by claiming they are attending BJP rallies after taking money.The prime minister also mocked Banerjee for her frequent criticism of the Electronic Voting Machines and the Election Commission."She keeps criticising EVM, the EC....If players keep criticising umpires, you should know their "Khela Sesh" (game's over)," he told an election rally here in Hooghly district.Referring to the Singur movement of 2006-08 that forced Tata Motors to move out its proposed small car Nano's production unit from there, Modi said the TMC used the place for political purpose and then left the people to fend for themselves."Didi and her party's obstructionist mindset blocked several industrial, infrastructure and connectivity projects.I have never seen a party which takes pride in stopping industries and development."We all know what happened in neighbouring Singur.They used it for furthering their politics and then left the people in limbo. Today, it has no industries and farmers are in distress," he said.Seeking to punch a hole in the TMC's poll plank of Bengali pride, Modi claimed Banerjee hurt people's self- respect by claiming they attend BJP rallies after taking money."Didi has got jittery after sensing defeat. That's why she is criticising everybody and everything, from EC to EVMs.She is abusing me. But while abusing me, she has hurt the self-respect of the people of Bengal by saying they are taking money to attend our rallies."Do people of Bengal take money to attend rallies, Didi? Who are you insulting while abusing me? You are insulting the people of the state," he said.Modi said he sensed the outcome of Bengal elections the day polling was held in Nandigram."Didi you betrayed people, you accept defeat," Modi said apparently referring to Banerjee's angry outbursts against central security forces and Union Home Minister Amit Shah while polling was on in Nandigram.Banerjee is locked in a keen tussle in Nandigram with her one-time loyalist Suvendu Adhikari who has joined the BJP.Modi also claimed that Banerjee, in order to satisfy her ego, blocked implementation of various central schemes.Exuding confidence about forming the next government in Bengal, the prime minister said he will attend the oath- taking ceremony of the BJP government and request it to implement the PM Kisan Nidhi scheme as early as possible. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mamatas-obstructionist-mindset-deprived-bengal-of-jobs-industries-modi-234154

It was a 5 day trip & I taught her to ride a camel! This was the 1970s–un dino, pehli nazar mein pyaar ho jata tha! That’s exactly what happened–for both of us, it was love at first sight. Throughout the trip, we couldn't take our eyes off each other. Before leaving for Australia, she said, ‘I love you;’ I went red! Nobody had ever said those words to me. I was so shy; I couldn't utter a word in response!But she understood & we stayed in touch–Marina would write to me every week. Soon, she invited me to Australia–I was over the moon! Without informing my family, I took a loan of Rs.30,000, bought a ticket, arranged for a visa & flew to be with her. Those 3 months were magical–she taught me English, I taught her to do the ghoomar. But then she said, ‘Let’s get married & settle in Australia!’–things got complicated.I wasn't ready to leave my motherland & she wasn’t willing to move to India. I told her–‘This can’t work long term,’ & we parted ways. It wasn’t easy–she cried the day I left, but I had to let her go.Then, life moved on. A few years later, owing to family pressure, I had to get married. I took up a job as the gatekeeper of Kuldhara, an abandoned ghost town to fend for my family. But I’d often think about Marina–‘Would she have gotten married?’, ‘Will I ever see her again?’ but I never had the courage to write to her.A post shared by Humans of Bombay (@officialhumansofbombay)  As time passed, memories faded; I got busy with family responsibilities. And then 2 years ago, my wife passed away. All my sons were married & had moved out. And here I was, an 82 year old man, gatekeeping India’s haunted village.And just when I thought life couldn't surprise me anymore, it did! A month ago, Marina wrote to me; she asked, ‘How are you my friend?’ After 50 years, she found me! Since then, she calls me everyday; we have so much to catch up on!She told me she’d never gotten married & that she’s coming to India soon. Ramji ki kasam, I feel like I’m 21 again! I don’t know what the future holds, but knowing that my first love is back in my life & talks to me everyday is a feeling I can’t explain.” #StoriesFromTheThar"||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/82-year-old-rajasthan-man-feels-21-again-as-he-finds-australian-lover-after-50-years-read-heartfelt-story-234139
03-04-2021||Kolkata||Nandigram witnessed highest polling percentage in recent years: EC||With over one-fourth of the booths registering a polling percentage above 90, West Bengal's Nandigram has seen the highest turnout in recent years.Election Commission data on Saturday shows that Nandigram registered a polling percentage of 88.01, marginally better than the last three elections in the state.  A booth wise detailed summary released by the Commission showed that though East Midnapore district recorded a polling percentage of 87.4 but Nandigram had a voter turnout of 88.01 per cent, which is a shade better than the district average. Not only the district average but the democratic euphoria of the people has overshadowed its performance in the last few elections. In the Lok Sabha polls in 2014 and 2019 Nandigram recorded a polling percentage of 85.7 and 85 respectively and in the last Assembly polls it had a polling percentage of 86.9. Only in the 2011 Assembly polls when Mamata Banerjee swept to power riding on the land reforms movement, Nandigram with 88.3 per cent fared better than this election."There is no doubt that the high-voltage election duel between Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Suvendu Adhikari mobilised the voters to polling booths but there are other factors that also should be taken into consideration.  There are around 25,7,000 voters in Nandigram of which 22,7,000 voters have turned out to exercise their franchise. According to the data available, of these voters, 54,000 are Muslim voters and the rest 1,73,000 are Hindu voters. This itself shows that 83 per cent of Muslim voters have cast their franchise where more than 92 per cent Hindu voters have exercised their democratic right. In a place like Nandigram, where the voters have been polarised this will definitely become a deciding factor," psephologist Biswanath Chakraborty told IANS.A factual analysis will also support the theory. If we go according to the election commission data, 89 of the 355 booths of Nandigram registered a polling percentage above 90 and interestingly enough, most of these booths are located in Hindu-dominated areas. EC data shows that Veturia Kohinoor SSK in Nandigram Block 1 recorded the highest turnout of 96.4 per cent followed by Julpai Gopalkrishna Ambika Golap Smriti Vidyamandir, Barunisnan Primary School, Bar Nakchirachar primary school that recorded a polling percentage of 94. In addition to this, there are at least 15 more polling centres that recorded a polling percentage of above 93.Interestingly enough, Birulia Paschim Primary School where CM Banerjee had an accident during her election campaign, recorded a polling percentage slightly more than 90. Alternatively, the Boyal Mukhtar Primary School, where the Chief Minister spent two hours on the day of the election and also had a heated exchange of words with the central forces, had a polling percentage of 88.So far as the districts are concerned, Bankura had a polling percentage of 86.9 followed by South 24 Parganas and West Midnapore that had a polling percentage of 86.7 and 83.8 respectively. So far as the constituencies are concerned, Katulpur AC in Bankura had the highest polling percentage of 90, followed by Indus (89.3 per cent) in Bankura; Chandipur (89.2 per cent) and Nandakumar (89.2 per cent) in East Midnapore and Pingla (89 per cent) in West Midnapore. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nandigram-witnessed-highest-polling-percentage-in-recent-years-ec-234138
03-04-2021||Tamulpur||Modi urges Assam militants to join mainstream||Buoyed by peace agreements with underground outfits in the Northeast, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday made a fervent appeal to militants in Assam who have not surrendered yet to return to the mainstream as they are needed to create an 'Atmanirbhar Assam'.Addressing an election rally here in Bodoland Territorial Region's (BTR) Baksa district, the prime minister said people of the state had rejected violence for development, peace, unity and stability.Accusing the Congress of encouraging violence, Modi said, "It is our responsibility to ensure the rehabilitation of those who have returned to the mainstream after years of struggle."I also appeal to those who are yet to surrender to return for the future of the state and for their own future, too, as they are needed to create an 'Atmanirbhar Assam'," he said.Referring to the huge crowd of women present at the rally, the prime minister said during his last visit to Kokrajhar in BTR on Thursday, he was surprised to see women in large numbers and asked a political analyst about the reason, and was told "mothers are now sure their children will not pick up weapons and go away to the jungle again"."I assure every mother and sister of the BTR that the dreams of your children will be fulfilled and they do not have to pick up weapons and go to the jungles or fall victim to bullets," he said.Every child is special to their mother but their tears do not stop once the child picks up a gun and goes to the jungle, he said, adding the NDA is committed to ensuring that this does not happen again.The NDA is committed to moving ahead on the path of development through "peace and goodwill" and it is this that has led to the signing of the historic Bodo Accord, he said.The NDA government, he asserted, formulates policies that are non-discriminatory and for all sections of society."It's unfortunate that those who divided society and threw crumbs of development at particular sections for their vote-bank politics are said to be practising secularism while we, who ensure that development reaches all, are termed communal," Modi said, attacking the Congress over long years of violence in the state."The NDA government has strived to holistically empower every section of society with our mantra 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas'. This game of secularism and communalism has hurt the nation a lot," he said.During the last five years, the "double engine" NDA governments at the Centre and in the state have resulted in "double benefit" for Assam, the prime minister said.

03-04-2021||Islamabad||No trade with India under current circumstances: Imran Khan||Prime Minister Imran Khan has decided that Pakistan cannot go ahead with any trade with India under the current circumstances after holding consultations with key members of his Cabinet on importing cotton and sugar from the neighbouring country, a media report said on Saturday.The prime minister after consultations on Friday instructed the Ministry of Commerce and his economic team to immediately take steps to facilitate the relevant sectors, value-added, apparel and sugar, by finding alternative cheap sources of import of the needed commodities, the Dawn newspaper quoted sources as saying.Various proposals have been presented to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) which considers these suggestions from an economic and commercial point of view. After consideration by the ECC, its decisions are presented to the Cabinet for ratification and final approval, the report said.In the present case, a proposal was presented to the ECC to allow the import of cotton, cotton yarn and sugar from India keeping in view domestic requirements, it said.With regard to the ECC decision to allow import of sugar, cotton and cotton yarn from India, Khan held consultations with key members of his Cabinet on Friday and decided that Pakistan could not go ahead with any trade with India under the current circumstances, it said.The ECC had decided on commercial grounds to recommend these imports for the Cabinet's consideration.While the decision was not on the formal agenda of the Cabinet meeting, the issue was brought up by Cabinet members and the prime minister instructed that the ECC's decision be deferred and immediately reviewed, the report said.The Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Khan on Thursday rejected the proposal of the high-powered committee to import cotton from India, with Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi asserting that there can be no normalisation of ties until New Delhi reverses its decision in 2019 to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.Pakistan's U-turn on Thursday came a day after the ECC, under newly-appointed Finance Minister Hammad Azhar, recommended importing cotton and sugar from India, lifting a nearly two-year-long ban on its import from the neighbouring country amidst tensions over the Kashmir issue.India has said that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence. India has said the onus is on Pakistan to create an environment free of terror and hostility.India has also told Pakistan that “talks and terror” cannot go together and has asked Islamabad to take demonstrable steps against terror groups responsible for launching various attacks on India.The ECC's decision had raised hopes of a partial revival of Pakistan-India bilateral trade relations, which were suspended after the August 5, 2019 decision of New Delhi to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.In May 2020, Pakistan lifted the ban on the import of medicines and raw material of essential drugs from India amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.India's move to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 angered Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties and expelled the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad. Pakistan also snapped all air and land links with India and suspended trade and railway services.

According to the new syllabus released by the CBSE, the chapters and topics that were slashed in the last academic year have been restored in the official curriculum for the upcoming academaic session, 2021-22.“The board already announced last year that the rationalisation exercise was a one-time initiative as teaching and learning through online mediums or alternative methods was fairly new then,” a CBSE official said.Schools across the country were closed in March last year, ahead of a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The teaching and learning activities majorly moved online during the lockdown. While a few states allowed a partial reopening of the schools in October, several states are again resorting to online classes in the new academic session amid a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases. In its syllabus-rationalisation exercise, the board had dropped the chapters on democracy and diversity, demonetisation, nationalism, secularism, India’s relations with its neighbours and growth of local governments in the country, among others.The choice of the chapters dropped from the syllabus drew a backlash from Opposition political parties and a section of academicians, who claimed that the move was “ideologically driven”, while several school principals welcomed it as a relief to students. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-syllabus-cut-for-cbse-classes-ix-xii-234040

In Kerala, the PM attacked the Left government for its action against Ayyappa devotees during Sabarimala protests, saying they tried to “destabilise” sacred places and that devotees were not criminals. The Ayyappa devotees, who should have been welcomed with flowers, were lathi-charged, Modi said bringing up the Sabarimala women entry issue at an election rally at Konni in Pathnamthitta district, near the famous Lord Ayyappa shrine.

The Ropar police claimed no rules were broken in allowing the use of a private ambulance. It feigned ignorance about the fake documents.SSP Akhil Chaudhary said Ansari had obtained orders from a court in UP in 2017-18 for use of a private ambulance for court attendance, for which expenses were to be borne by him. “Punjab Prisons (Attendance in Court) Rules, too, allow for a separate conveyance, provided the prisoner pays for it,” he added.An escort team under the supervision of a DSP-rank officer was deputed for producing Ansari at the court.The Supreme Court had recently directed the Punjab Government to hand over Ansari’s custody to the UP Police, saying it was being denied on trivial grounds under the guise of medical issues. Following the directions, Ansari’s counsel had moved an application seeking examination by a medical board for “acute ailments and medical distress”. It was rejected by the Mohali court.Barabanki SP Yamuna Prasad said the ambulance was registered in the name of a hospital and a voter I-card and PAN card were procured for the fake documentation. A case has been registered against hospital caretaker Dr Alka Rai, who called it a conspiracy to malign her and that she did not have a hospital at the given address. She said she was preparing to lodge a complaint against Ansari.The Punjab Police had earlier too courted controversy over Ansari. As his custody was denied to the UP Police multiple times, last month the Opposition had raised the issue in the Assembly, accusing the state government of shielding him by keeping him in a Punjab jail. The Ropar police had also named Ansari in a six-year-old case of murder of a labourer citing allegations levelled by the sister of the deceased. She, however, denied having recorded such a statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/papers-of-ambulance-carrying-mukhtar-ansari-fake-233967

India feels they will hurt the masses more than the military junta. Despite a bloody crackdown that has killed hundreds of civilians in Myanmar, India has avoided mentioning the word sanctions in its statements. Its position has been strengthened by the stand taken by Vietnam, which has taken over the Presidency of UNSC for the month of April.Vietnam’s UN Permanent Representative Dang Dinh Quy said if the UNSC was to impose sanctions, Vietnam will comply “as long as it does not exert a negative impact on the lives of people and the humanitarian situation of the country concerned”. Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla made similar observations a fortnight back. “Don’t adopt tactics that seem reasonable if you are far away. Global sanctions will impact food security which will lead to inflation in Myanmar,” he had said. With two veto wielding UNSC members — Russia and China — also ranged against sanctioning Myanmar, India will be able to preserve its interests that include a port being built by the Adani Group, a first-ever link to the North-East from the Bay of Bengal via Myanmar territory and transfers of military equipment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-unsc-myanmar-meet-india-aligns-with-eurasian-states-233786

Sangstha officials said local police had confirmed that the girl was brought back from the international checkgate at Moreh in Manipur.Myanmarese immigration officials are learnt to have cited Covid protocols for not accepting the child.Assam authorities, however, said they themselves halted the deportation after being unable to make contact with the officials concerned in Myanmar. Subir Roy was quick to temper his excitement at the return of the child, conscious of the fact that the deportation may happen anytime later considering India is not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention 1951 or its 1967 Protocol.India also does not recognise the UN principle of non-refoulement, which urges nations not to expel refugees to places where they could face persecution. “We are happy that the child is returning where she belongs, but sad that this might be only a temporary phase,” Subir said, speaking of the minor’s experiences at the home. The child, who spoke only Burmese when she came to the Sangstha, now speaks fluent Hindi and Assamese. The officials said they had been engaged with stakeholders to repatriate the child to Bangladesh where her parents live in a refugee camp at Cox Bazaar.“Things were moving in the right direction until we received the deportation orders on March 30. We can hopefully unite the child with her parents in Bangladesh now,” said Subir Roy.Refugee camp in Bangladesh||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/for-now-minor-escapes-deportation-to-myanmar-233787

The Centre asked states to use laws to enforce Covid-appropriate behaviour, plan to ramp up ICU beds, oxygen and isolation facilities and ensure 100 per cent vaccination of those eligible.Gauba said India had reported a very high 5.5 per cent growth rate in daily Covid deaths in March.“The country reported 97,000 daily new Covid cases at the peak of the pandemic in September 2020. We have now already reached 81,000 daily new cases,” he said.The 11 states of serious concern are Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Haryana.Maharashtra, Punjab and Chandigarh were termed as states of particular worry as national Covid load reached 1,23,03,131 and daily deaths soared to 469 today—the highest since December 6.The Cabinet Secretary said the 11 states had contributed 90 per cent Covid cases and 90.5 per cent deaths, as on March 31, in the past 14 days.“These states have either crossed or are about to cross their earlier reported peaks,” he said. The Cabinet Secretary advised states to set up containment zones (district-level lockdowns) to break the chain of transmission; raise testing to ensure positivity falls below 5 per cent; ensure RT-PCR tests are 70 per cent of all tests; reduce waiting time of test results; subject rapid antigen negative cases to RT-PCR tests; ensure prompt institutional isolation of those infected; those in home isolation be monitored daily; besides tracing 30 close contacts of every Covid patient.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2nd-covid-wave-more-infectious-233965

The EC also suspended the presiding officer of the booth and three other officials.“Although the seals of the EVM were found intact, it has nevertheless been decided to conduct a repoll at booth number 149 (Indira MV School) of LAC-1 Ratabari (SC) as an added precaution,” said the poll panel, which also sought a report from its special observer.According to details made public by the EC, the polling party of booth number 149 of Ratabari constituency was accompanied by a police constable and a home guard. After completion of polling at 6 pm on Thursday, the party left in a vehicle provided by election authorities and was escorted by an armed security party.Their vehicle developed a snag and instead of waiting for the sector in-charge to arrange another vehicle, they used a private vehicle hoping to reach the material receipt centre faster as they were in custody of polled EVMs.The Congress today petitioned the EC with former Law Minister Ashwani Kumar leading the delegation. Party general secretary Priyanka Vadra said the EC needed to start acting decisively on reports of private vehicles transporting EVMs and a “serious re-evaluation of the use of EVMs needed to be carried out by all national parties”.After Congress leader Rahul Gandhi took jibes at the EC saying “EC’s car has broken down, BJP’s intentions are suspect and the state of democracy has worsened”, party media head Randeep Surjewala alleged EVM fraud. “EVM fraud is for everyone to see. EVMs were found in the car of BJP MLA candidate Krishnedru Paul after the second phase of polling in Assam. If the ECI doesn’t wake up even now and remains mute or complicit, it is fatal for democracy,” said Surjewala.Union Minister Jitendra Singh, however, accused the Congress of questioning the EVMs only when faced with “imminent defeat.” “Why don’t they question EVMs in states where they win?” he asked.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assam-row-over-evm-in-bjp-nominees-car-233912

This has been suitably conveyed to the UN-OHCR,” said Bagchi.The MEA will be try to discourage the UN-OHCHR from issuing an “Allegation Letter” to New Delhi, as is being lobbied by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, ‘General Counsel’ to SFJ.SFJ has claimed that it has also donated $10,000 to the UN-OHCHR to support its work in the area of human rights.Other sources said this was yet another caper to gather publicity by the largely-on-paper organisation by targeting big political leaders in India. In October last year, they recalled, a US court dismissed a $100-million lawsuit filed by SFJ against PM Modi and Shah.In December, no one turned up in response to the SFJ’s call to gherao the Indian High Commission in London.On Republic Day this year, SFJ caused only a brief commotion in front of the Indian Embassy in Rome on Republic Day.The SFJ’s “Referendum 2020’’ had a hard landing after it failed to get any traction in the expatriate community while the Indian authorities turned the screws by charge sheeting several pro-Khalistani supporters including Pannun, Avtar Singh Pannun, Harpreet Singh and Kulwant Singh Mothada.India has also issued a Mutual Legal Assistance Request to the US for investigations in “Referendum 2020”.SFJ was outlawed under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in July last year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-counter-sikhs-for-justice-complaint-before-un-body-233668
03-04-2021||---||Ladakh standoff: India urges compliance with Jaishankar-Wang consensus||New Delhi, April 2The lack of progress for over a month in disengagement has led India to remind China about the consensus between their Foreign Ministers on February 25 for quickly resolving the remaining issues along the LAC in Eastern Ladakh.The MEA’s comments on the LAC closely follow India’s critical but guarded observations on a WHO-convened global study about the origin of Covid-19 in which Western countries want to corner China.China replied to India’s comments today with a reasoned repudiation of points raised by India. South Block is also evaluating Chinese investment proposals worth $ 2 billion that have been on hold since April last year.“As the External Affairs Minister had pointed out to [the] Chinese Foreign Minister, a prolongation of the situation is in neither side’s interest,’’ said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi at the weekly media briefing.The February 25 talks between the Foreign Ministers, which took place five days after Indian and Chinese troops disengages along the banks of Pangong Tso, had also touched upon setting up of a hotline. Instead, there had been no response even to Indian overtures for a meeting of the WMCC to take forward the agreement reflected in separate statements after the talks between S Jaishankar and Wang Yi.Bagchi reiterated Jaishankar’s formulation of further progress in bilateral ties being linked to disengagement in the remaining areas at the earliest. This would enable both sides to take the next step of de-escalation and de-induction, which means the return of troops and war equipment to pre-April 2020 locations.Jaishankar had also said that prolonging friction along the border does not serve either country.“The disengagement in Pangong Lake area was a significant step forward and it has provided a good basis for resolution of other remaining issues along the LAC in Western Sector,’’ underlined the MEA spokesperson.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ladakh-standoff-india-urges-compliance-with-jaishankar-wang-consensus-233663

03-04-2021||Barabanki/Chandigarh||Papers of ambulance in which BSP MLA Mukhtar Ansari went to Mohali court 'fake'; Punjab Police clarify||The UP Police have lodged an FIR, saying fake documents were used to register the ambulance, which recently ferried gangster-turned politician Mukhtar Ansari from a Punjab jail to a court in that state.The ambulance had the registration number of UP’s Barabanki and was used to ferry Ansari from Punjab’s Rupnagar jail to a Mohali court on March 31.Amid a row over the issue, a Punjab Police official clarified that an inmate can be transported in a private ambulance on medical grounds and the cost of conveyance has to be borne by the prisoner.The BSP MLA from Mau, who is wanted in Uttar Pradesh for various cases, was produced before the Mohali court in connection with an alleged 2019 extortion case.Ansari was taken to the court in a wheelchair. He was sent back to the Rupnagar jail, where he is lodged since January 2019.“After an initial probe, the name and address given for the registration of the ambulance were found to be false. An FIR in this regard has been registered by an additional road transport officer against Dr Alka Rai, whose name was given for the registration of the ambulance,” a senior police official said in Barabanki.An FIR was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 420 (forgery), 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly using documents as genuine), 467 (forgery of valuable security) and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating).Superintendent of Police Yamuna Prasad said acting on media reports that Ansari was produced in a court in Punjab on an ambulance with the registration number of Barabanki, police teams probed the matter and found that documents such as PAN, electoral photo ID card and others were fake.The address on which these documents were made was also found to be wrong, he said.However, the Punjab Police official said if an inmate has any medical condition, then he can be taken in a private ambulance, subject to due diligence by the security in-charge. The cost of conveyance has to be borne by the prisoner, he said.According to the Punjab Prisoners (Attendance in Court) Rules, 1969, police can allow a private vehicle on the request of a prisoner, the official added.It was also clarified that ambulance in which Ansari was taken to the court on March 31 was not a bullet-proof vehicle. Meanwhile in UP’s Mau, Dr Alka Rai, the manager of Shyam Sanjivini Hospital there, said that she had nothing to do with the ambulance and termed it as a conspiracy of Mukhtar Ansari and her rivals. Dr Rai, who visited the Mau Kotwali police station on Friday, gave a complaint to police in this regard and appealed to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for justice.The Supreme Court had recently directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of Ansari to the Uttar Pradesh Police, saying it was being denied on trivial grounds under the guise of medical issues.The apex court had also said that a convict or an undertrial prisoner, who disobeys the law of the land, cannot oppose his transfer from one prison to another and the courts are not to be a helpless bystander when the rule of law is being challenged with impunity.The court had said the custody of Ansari, a BSP MLA from the Mau constituency, be handed over to Uttar Pradesh within two weeks so as to lodge him in Banda district jail in Uttar Pradesh.The apex court had also noted that Ansari was allegedly involved in various cases of attempt to murder, murder, cheating and conspiracy apart from offences under the Gangsters Act, lodged in Uttar Pradesh and out of them, 10 cases are at the trial stage.Mukhtar Ansari’s wife has written to President Ram Nath Kovind, expressing fears that he might be killed in a fake encounter while being transferred from Punjab to Uttar Pradesh following a Supreme Court direction.His brother, BSP MP from Ghazipur, Afzal Ansari told PTI, “To divert attention from the life threat to Mukhtar, BJP government is making wheelchair and ambulance as an issue.”  “If the BJP is making Mukhtar Ansari (2022) election agenda, we and our supporters will also make vindictive action of the government against their family an issue,” he said.Asserting that Mukhtar Ansari has been ill for the past two years, his brother said that if there is any shortcoming in the documents of the ambulance, a fine could be imposed.Meanwhile, a Mohali court has rejected a plea of Mukhtar Ansari who sought directions to jail authorities to constitute a medical board for examining him.The court of Judicial Magistrate 1st Class (JMIC) Amit Bakshi said the Supreme Court has already considered Ansari’s plea regarding his medical condition.“There is nothing on record which can suggest that after the apex court order on March 26 there have been any fresh medical issues with the accused,” the Mohali court judge said.
