The low allotment has been attributed to the pandemic and the consequent restrictions and shutdowns imposed to mitigate its spread.Under the scheme, the institutes availing the new vacancies are required to bear all the expenditure incurred on training, uniforms, equipment, transport, refreshments, NCC staff and the hiring of instructors.The scheme commenced in 2020-21 as a pilot project. A private or quasi-government college on the waiting list having at least 500 students on its rolls could be allotted one company strength of about 150 cadets without any cost to the exchequer.According to a government release in March, 8,902 educational institutes in the country, including 5,862 schools and 3,040 colleges, are currently on the wait list to introduce NCC. Already, NCC is available in 17,644 institutes.In 2018, a performance audit, once in 2-3 years for schools and 3-4 years in colleges was introduced by the government. NCC is being withdrawn from non performing institutions and vacancies so freed are being allotted to institutes on the wait list.NCC is largest uniformed youth organisation in the world with enrolled strength of 13.48 lakh cadets, out of which 33.72 per cent are girls. The Army Wing comprises for 84 per cent of the strength, with the balance being with the Navy and Air wings.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-plays-dampener-with-nccs-self-financed-scheme-to-increase-cadet-strength-234604

04-04-2021||New Delhi||Re-investigate case related to purported phone conversation of Shanti Bhushan, Mulayam, Amar Singh: Court||A city court has directed the Delhi police to probe afresh a 2011 case related to an audio CD allegedly containing a telephone conversation of former law minister Shanti Bhushan, Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav and the then SP leader Amar Singh.The court passed the direction on January 28, while dismissing a police plea to close the case, registered on April 15, 2011 following a complaint by Bhushan that the CD appeared to have been “fabricated to malign me” and that its contents were “defamatory”.“IO (Investigating Officer) is directed to investigate the contents of the CD in question and file a report,” Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Dr Pankaj Sharma said, while directing the IO to file the report by March 25.However, the IO failed to file the report, and the court, on March 25, said, “Let the IO be summoned for filing the report in terms of previous order for July 15, 2021.”The news regarding the CD was reported in media earlier that month.In the purported phone conversation involving Bhushan, Yadav and Singh, who passed away last year, Bhushan allegedly referred to his lawyer-son Prashant Bhushan who can “manage… very well” and to a then Supreme Court judge.The police had in April 2014 filed an “untrace report”.It said Shanti Bhushan “suspected that ‘Amar Singh could be behind the fabrication and circulation of the audio CD to malign his reputation” and that its circulation among the media “was intended as an attempt to force him to leave the joint drafting committee for the Jan Lokpal Bill, since Kapil Sibal and P Chidambaram, then Union Ministers, were against his participation as co-chairman of the drafting committee”.However, he “could not put forward any worthwhile evidence in support of his allegations against Chidambaram, Sibal and Singh except oral allegations.”The police report added that “it is not correct to proceed against anyone only on the basis of presumptions and without any substantial and corroborative evidence. Hence this case is being filed as untraced for want of any sufficient evidence.”          In its report, the police also rejected a claim made by Prashant Bhushan, citing a Central Forensic Science Laboratory-Delhi report that that the contents of the CD had not been copied from the Amar Singh tapes that did the rounds following alleged tapping of his phone in 2005-06.Bhushans, who were at that time non-government representatives in a panel constituted to draft the Lokpal Bill following a fast by social activist Anna Hazare, denied that the phone conversation ever took place and called it a “conspiracy” to weaken Anna Hazare’s movement.

Similarly, leveraging technology to enable transcriptions of court proceedings can enable courts to realise their full potential to become courts of record”.The document said the third phase has various key goals, which include ensuring the installation of relevant hardware, creation of digital infrastructure (digital case registry, repository of case laws, Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) and other services.          Among other services, the panel has suggested for the creation of a digital case-management system, open digital hearing and providing technology-enabled transcriptions to lawyers and litigants.It said enabling seamless and inclusive digital hearings will be key to minimise the travel costs of litigants and lawyers, thereby increasing access to justice and reducing environmental costs.“Different forms of digital-enabled hearings must be explored for diverse use cases. Certain proceedings may require to continue with in-person hearings, while others may explore possibilities of asynchronous hearings, purely digital hearings, audio-only linkages where necessitated or even virtual courts,” it said.The panel said, “Digital hearings should also be supported by efforts to make the hearings public and the process transparent. This can be achieved either through live-streaming of hearings or where that is not possible, by making records of the proceedings freely accessible to ensure that courts retain the ‘open courts’ principle”.It further suggested that digital transcriptions of court proceedings are key to building trust and transparency in the system and it will provide a precise record of what was said in court and help lawyers and litigants plan their trial plans or appeals, understand the decision, use the transcription as evidence or share it with the litigants, who were not present.“Phase III will prioritise providing lawyers and litigants with technologically-enabled transcriptions of court proceedings from audio or a spoken format into a typed digital format immediately with the order,” it said.The panel said COVID-19 has amplified the need to strengthen digital capabilities and provided the stepping stone to an unprecedented opportunity for change.“But such a change cannot be achieved without adopting a radically different approach from that adopted in phases I and II, while building on its foundations,” it said.The e-Courts project was launched in 2005 to digitise the judicial administration process across approximately 19,000 courts in the country.The first and second phases of the project were launched with an overall budget of around Rs 639 crore and Rs 1,670 crore respectively, enabling the creation of infrastructure, systems and services for judges, lawyers and litigants. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scs-e-committee-releases-draft-proposal-for-phase-iii-of-e-courts-project-seeks-feedback-234592

Punjab contributed 16.7 pc of all COVID deaths in India in the last fortnight.The Prime Minister on Sunday reviewed the COVID-19 situation and vaccination exercise in the country amid an “alarming rate of growth” in infections and deaths, with 10 states contributing to more than 91 per cent of them.Modi said the five-fold strategy of testing, tracing, treatment, COVID-appropriate behaviour and vaccination if implemented with utmost seriousness and commitment would be effective in curbing the pandemic’s spread, according to an official statement.The reasons for the sharp rise in cases could be mainly attributed to the severe decline in compliance of COVID-appropriate behaviour, especially in the use of masks and social distancing, pandemic fatigue and lack of effective implementation of containment measures at the field level, it said.“A detailed presentation was made which highlighted that there is an alarming rate of growth of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country with 10 states contributing to more than 91 per cent of cases and deaths due to COVID,” it said.It was noted in the meeting that vaccine manufacturers are ramping up their production capacity and are also in discussion with other domestic and offshore companies to augment the same.Noting that the situation in Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh is of serious concern, a presentation in the meeting highlighted that the western state has contributed 57 per cent of the total cases and 47 per cent of deaths in the country in the last 14 days.In Maharashtra, the total number of new cases per day has touched 47,913 which is more than double its earlier peak.Punjab has contributed 4.5 per cent of the total cases in the country in the same period but has accounted for 16.3 per cent of the total deaths, a matter of serious concern, the statement said.Similarly, though Chhattisgarh has contributed 4.3 per cent of the total cases nationwide in the last 14 days, its contribution in total deaths has exceeded seven per cent during the same period.The 10 high burden states and UTs are contributing 91.4 per cent of the total cases and 90.9 per cent of the total deaths in the country. Modi directed that central teams consisting of public health specialists and clinicians be sent to Maharashtra in view of its high caseload and deaths, and to Punjab and Chhattisgarh as well because of the disproportionate number of deaths there, the statement said.For sustainable COVID-19 management, awareness of the community and its involvement is paramount, Modi said, adding that and there is a need to continue ‘Jan Bhagidari’ and ‘Jan Andolan’.A special campaign for COVID-appropriate behaviour with emphasis on 100 percent mask usage, personal hygiene and sanitation at public places, workplaces and health facilities will be organised between April 6-14, the statement said.In the meeting, a brief presentation on the performance of the COVID-19 inoculation drive was also made, and the details of the coverage of vaccination in various groups, performance with respect to other countries and analysis of states’ performance were deliberated.It was suggested that a daily analysis of performance should be shared with states and UTs as feedback for corrective actions, the statement said.Research and development of vaccines were also discussed along with the production capacity of existing manufacturers and the capacity of vaccines that are under trial.“It was highlighted that all efforts are underway to secure adequate quantities of vaccines to meet the rising domestic requirements as well as to meet the genuine needs of other countries in the spirit of ‘Vasudhaiv Kutumbkam’,” it said.The principal secretary to the prime minister, cabinet secretary, home secretary, chairperson (Empowered group on Vaccine Administration) and health secretary besides other senior officials attended the meeting.

04-04-2021||Naveen S Garewal ||TDP announces boycott of local body elections||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, April 4Andhra Pradesh’s main opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has decided not to contest the Zilla and Mandal Parishad elections alleging that the polls would not be conducted in a free and fair manner. The announcement of the party comes within days of the Andhra State Election Commission (SEC) issuing a notification for holding rural local bodies. Former Chief Minister and TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu expressed doubts over the conduct of the polls in a free and fair manner. The TDP was completely wiped out in the recently held Panchayat Polls in the state. “I don’t think these polls will be held freely and fairly. Therefore, the party has decided not to participate in these polls,” Naidu said. Andhra Pradesh held polls in some constituencies while in others they are still due. Out of 9,696 Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) 2,371 seats were won uncontested, ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) winning 2,271. The election will now be held for the remaining 7,322 seats. Of the 652 Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC), 126 were won uncontested, all by the ruling YSRCP, and the election will now be conducted for 526 seats. The former chief minister objected to the manner in which the poll notification was issued. Former Chief Secretary Neelam Sawhney, who took over as the State Election Commissioner (SEC) issued the notification within hours of taking over the new assignment, Naidu said. Naidu accused the SEC of being reduced to a mere rubber stamp in the Parishad polls and sought a fresh notification of local body elections on account of the Tirupati Lok Sabha bye-poll. As per the notification issued earlier this week, Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) and Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) would be held on April 8, and results would be declared on April 10. The polls, originally scheduled to be held in 2020, were put on hold by then SEC Ramesh Kumar, citing the COVID-19 pandemic. The other political parties in Andhra, namely the BJP and Jana Sena also boycotted Friday’s all-party meet convened by the SEC. The new SEC convened a meeting with Chief Secretary Aditya Nath Das and followed it up with all District Collectors and police officials on poll preparedness.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tdp-announces-boycott-of-local-body-elections-234586

Both of them are in the NIA custody at present.The NIA had Thursday also recovered documents pertaining to SIM cards procured through Gor for his personal use. Gor is alleged to have procured the SIM cards from Ahmedabad in Gujarat and these were handed over to Vaze through Shinde, the officials said.One of these SIM cards was used by Vaze to give a call to Hiran, which turned out to be the last call before the businessman was killed.The body of Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV used in the security scare incident, was found in a creek in the Mumbra town of the neighbouring Thane district on March 5.Hiran was allegedly killed by Vaze after reports started surfacing that the case may be handed over to the central agency for probe. Initial investigations suggested that Hiran was called to a place where he was made unconscious with the help of some drugs before being smothered to death.His vehicle was found outside Ambani’s house in Mumbai on February 25 with gelatin sticks and a threat note.The NIA has said in the court that Vaze had taken the car from Hiran before allegedly planting the explosives and parking it outside Ambani’s house on February 25.Vaze was arrested on March 15 by the NIA and is at present in the custody of the agency till April 7.The Maharashtra ATS, which was initially probing the Hiran murder case, had arrested Gor and Shinde. This case was also taken over by the NIA and the duo are in the custody of the agency till April 10.

04-04-2021||Guwahati||Only 7.8% women candidates in Assam electoral battle||Only 7.8 per cent women candidates are among the total 946 contestants in fray for the 126-member Assam Assembly elections, leading to discontent among female activists and writers.According to the state's Chief Electoral Officer Nitin Khade, of the total 946 candidates, 74 are women, while, out of the overall 2,33,74,087 voters, 1,15,50,403 are females.He said out of the 33,530 polling stations set up for the three phases (March 27, April 1, and April 6) of the polls across the state, 1,351 are all managed by women.The third and the final phase of polling will be held in 40 seats on April 6.Despite the women being 49.41 per cent of the total numbers of voters, only 74 female (7.8 per cent) candidates, including 23 Independent, are in the fray. In the 2016 Assam Assembly elections, 91 women candidates were in the fray, with eight of them being elected.In 2011, 85 women had tried their electoral fate and 14, the highest so far in the House, were successful.The opposition Congress, which has formed a 10-party 'Mahajot' (Grand Alliance) to take on the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led alliance, has put up nine women candidates in these polls.Its electoral partners, the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Bodoland Peoples' Front (BPF), have fielded one women candidate each.In the 2016 polls, the Congress had fielded 16 women candidates.The principal opposition party this time has fielded a total of 95 candidates allotting the remaining seats to its allies.The ruling BJP has nominated seven women candidates, one more than that during the 2016 polls, while its alliance partner Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) like that of previous elections has put up two female nominees.The BJP, which has fielded total 93 candidates, is contesting the elections in alliance with the United People's Party Liberal (UPPL) and the Gana Suraksha Party (GSP), besides its old ally AGP.The Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), a newly formed party, has fielded seven women candidates while the other new party Raijor Dal has given ticket to one.The AJP and Raijor Dal nominees are contesting as Independent candidates.Besides, several female activists and women rights bodies, renowned Assam-based writers Tapati Baruah Kashyap and Ratna Bharali Talukdar have expressed strong resentment over the number of candidates.Kashyap, a renowned Guwahati-based award-winning writer and an advocate of women's rights, said women have the capability to govern the society but they are not properly represented in politics and governance."Because ours is a patriarchal society, men continue to dominate in every sphere of the society and government. This can be termed as neglect of women and the failure to recognise their ability. There are numerous instances where women have performed better than men in many areas, including education," she told IANS.Kashyap, who has written 12 books and won several prestigious awards, said because of the prevailing male-dominated mindset, even policies on women were prepared by men."In order to change this situation, women should come forward in large numbers to transform the mindset of our male-dominated culture."  Meanwhile, Talukdar, a famed writer and executive editor of online magazine Nezine, said that women have always been in the forefront in Assam, be it the identity movements or political mobilisations including election rallies."Ironically, the women continue to be deprived of getting proportionate representations in the state Assembly. Women have demonstrated their efficiency and expertise in governance in panchayats bodies where 50 per cent seats are reserved for them. They have also demonstrated their efficiency as ministers and legislators," Talukdar told IANS.She said that a minimum of 33 per cent seats of the state Assemblies must be reserved for women."Patriarchal mindset of leaders of political parties is posing hurdles in women getting adequate representation in the state Assembly." --- IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/only-7-8-women-candidates-in-assam-electoral-battle-234570
04-04-2021||Barabanki (UP)||UP Police forms SIT to probe fake papers of ambulance that ferried Mukhtar Ansari to court||A special investigation team (SIT) has been set up by the Uttar Pradesh Police to further probe into the issue of fake documents of the ambulance which was used to ferry gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari from a Punjab jail to a Mohali court recently.Barabanki Superintendent of Police Yamuna Prasad on Sunday said the SIT has been constituted under the additional superintendent of police (north).“Some members of the SIT, under the SHO of Haidargarh, have been sent to Punjab. Others have been sent to Mau (in Uttar Pradesh). They will deliberate on various points and will also speak to Dr Alka Rai, whose name was given for the registration of the ambulance.“The SIT will also try to look for the ambulance and its driver. Efforts will also be made to ascertain as to under whose orders the ambulance ferried Ansari from the jail,” the superintendent of police said.Amid a row over this issue, a Punjab police official has clarified that an inmate can be transported in a private ambulance on medical grounds and the cost of conveyance has to be borne by the prisoner.On April 2, a case was registered in Barabanki after the documents of the ambulance bearing UP registration number were found to be fake.Ansari, the BSP MLA from Mau, who is wanted in Uttar Pradesh for various cases, was on March 31 produced before the Mohali court in connection with an alleged 2019 extortion matter.Amid tight security arrangements, Ansari was taken to court in a wheelchair. He was sent back to Punjab’s Rupnagar jail, where he is lodged since January 2019, in an ambulance after the appearance.“After an initial probe, the name and address given for the registration of the ambulance were found to be false. An FIR in this regard has been registered by an additional road transport officer against Dr Alka Rai, whose name was given for the registration of the ambulance,” a senior police official said in Barabanki.An FIR was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 420 (forgery), 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly using documents as genuine), 467 (forgery of valuable security) and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating).SP Yamuna Prasad had said that acting on media reports that Ansari was produced in a court in Punjab on an ambulance with the registration number of Barabanki, police teams probed the matter and found that documents such as PAN, electoral photo id card and others were fake.The address on which these documents were made was also found to be wrong, he said.However, the Punjab police official had said that if an inmate has any medical condition, then he can be taken in a private ambulance subject to due diligence by the security in-charge. The cost of conveyance has to be borne by the prisoner, he had said.According to the Punjab Prisoners (Attendance in Court) Rules, 1969, the police team can allow a private vehicle on the request of a prisoner, the official added. It was also clarified that ambulance in which Ansari was taken to the court on March 31, was not a bullet-proof vehicle.The Supreme Court had recently directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of Ansari to the Uttar Pradesh Police, saying it was being denied on trivial grounds under the guise of medical issues.The apex court had also said that a convict or an undertrial prisoner, who disobeys the law of the land, cannot oppose his transfer from one prison to another and the courts are not to be helpless bystanders when the rule of law is being challenged with impunity.The court had said the custody of Ansari, a BSP MLA from the Mau constituency, be handed over to Uttar Pradesh within two weeks so as to lodge him in Banda district jail in Uttar Pradesh. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-police-forms-sit-to-probe-fake-papers-of-ambulance-that-ferried-mukhtar-ansari-to-court-234569
04-04-2021||New Delhi||Higher fee for over 4-hour parking, proper use of underground spaces among Delhi Traffic Police's plan to decongest Connaught Place||To decongest traffic at Connaught Place and ensure there's no unauthorised parking, the Delhi Traffic Police has submitted a proposal to civic authorities to upgrade the "underutilised" underground parking near Palika Bazaar, officials said on Sunday.According to the officials, traffic congestion at Connaught Place, especially during weekends, is primarily due to shortage of parking space and less room on footpaths for people to walk because of encroachment by hawkers."We want to improvise the parking system and make it more efficient. We want to get the underground parking as well as the multi-level parking properly utilised," a senior traffic police official said."At present, the underground parking area in Palika Bazaar is being used only 40 per cent and even the multi-level parking system at Baba Kharak Singh Marg is being utilised for only about 20-30 per cent while the surface parking is being fully used," the official said.He said the traffic police has suggested the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) to fix slightly higher parking charges for vehicles which are parked for more than four hours in Connaught Place.The Delhi Traffic Police said it has conducted a series of meetings with officials of the New Delhi Traders Association (NDTA) and the NDMC over the past two months regarding a proposal to upgrade the parking facility at Connaught Place.Additional Commissioner of Police (Traffic – Southern Range) S D Mishra said the proposal has been made to set up an enhanced parking facility at Connaught Place and create space for pedestrians."We want to create a deterrent and send this message across that unauthorised parking on the road will not be tolerated,” he said.The plan to make Connaught Place a vehicle-free zone, to decongest the heritage shopping arcade continued to be delayed for years and remained only on paper due to stiff resistance from traders, inadequate parking facilities and lack of a foolproof traffic management plan that were cited as reasons for the non-implementation of the plan.According to the latest proposal, the underground parking facility near Palika Bazaar needs to be upgraded as it is in a very "bad shape". Also, the safety aspect needs to be addressed as there is no suitable lighting.During the meetings, NDTA General Secretary Vikram Badhwar had pointed out that one of the main reasons for the underutilisation of underground parking adjacent to Palika Bazaar was the "pathetic condition" of the parking space."There is a safety issue involved as there is no proper lighting, especially on the lower floors, making the parking space dark. The vagabonds defecate and urinate there. The staircases also needed immediate repair. There was no lift for the elderly or the disabled person,” he had said.Responding to this, the traffic officials said women, differently-abled persons and the elderly who own shops in Connaught Place can park their cars at surface-level parking, but the NDTA should try to convince others to start using the underground parking."We have emphasised on the need to encourage the shopkeepers, owners of commercial establishments and their employees to park their vehicles at the underground parking adjacent to Palika Bazaar rather than using above-ground parking. This way it would reduce the pressure on the surface-level parking in Connaught place and also ensure that adequate parking space is available for the customers coming to Connaught Place,” the senior traffic official said.The traffic police has also suggested the NDMC to have fixed rates for underground and surface-level parking."Any shopper who comes to Connaught Place stays for say two-four hours. So, we have suggested the NDMC to fix parking charges higher than the usual rates for those parking beyond four hours,” the traffic official said.Citing encroachment by hawkers, the traffic officials said certain roads meant for movement of vehicles in Connaught Place have been completely taken over by hawkers, leaving no space for pedestrians.They said the matter has been highlighted during the meetings and the NDMC is supposed to take appropriate action. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/higher-fee-for-over-4-hour-parking-proper-use-of-underground-spaces-among-delhi-traffic-polices-plan-to-decongest-connaught-place-234565

04-04-2021||Guwahati||Softening of Himanta's punishment raises 'big question' on ECI's neutrality: CPI(M)||Coming down heavily on Election Commission's relaxation on campaign ban of BJP minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury on Sunday said there is a "big question" on the neutrality of the poll panel and it should clear the air on the issue.Addressing a press conference here, the veteran communist leader claimed the Congress-led Grand Alliance, of which CPI (M) is a constituent, is coming to power in Assam with a huge majority and a common minimum programme will be finalised after the formation of the government."There is a big question on Election Commission of India's neutrality. We want the ECI to remove this question. It is not only the poll panel's duty but a responsibility to the Constitution of India," Yechury told reporters.He asserted that Sarma should have been disqualified for making the threatening statements against Bodoland People's Front chief Hagrama Mohilary, but instead 48-hour ban on him from campaigning was reduced to 24 hours on Saturday.The ECI reduced the ban duration of Sarma after he tendered an "unconditional apology" and assured the poll panel that he would abide by the provisions of the model code.The Congress had approached the ECI demanding action against Sarma for his remark that Mohilary would be sent to jail through central probe agency NIA if he indulges in "extremism" with rebel leader M Batha.Yechury also slammed another BJP minister Pijush Hazarika, who allegedly threatened two journalists of dire consequences on the day of the second phase of polling on April 1 for reporting controversial campaign speech of his wife, and wondered why the ECI is not taking any action."There was a decision during all-party meeting with the ECI that media should not be under pressure. During the course of the election, media must be protected from undue pressure and it should be allowed to work naturally," he added.Like Model Code of Conduct, which is not a law but an understanding between the parties and ECI, this agreement of safety of media should also be strictly enforced, he said.Hazarika is contesting from the Jagiroad constituency. In an audio clip telecast by Assamese news channel Pratidin Time, he was heard talking to the channel's journalist Nazrul Islam and threatened him and another scribe Tulsi Manta for dragging them out of their homes, break their legs and make them "vanish".Police registered two FIRs filed by the two concerned journalists and merged them into one.The BJP minister has been issued a notice to appear before the police and his call recordings have been sent to the forensic lab after seizing his mobile phone.Talking about the poll prospects in Assam, Yechury said: "There is huge response to the 'Mahajot'. We are seeing tremendous enthusiasm and spontaneity on the ground. It is now sure that Mahajot is forming the next government here." When asked about the Common Minimum Programme (CMP) of the 10-party opposition grouping, the CPI(M) leader said it will be finalised once the Grand Alliance is voted to power.The CPI(M) which has no legislator in Assam at present is contesting on two seats, which will go to vote in the final phase on April 6.Yechury also attacked the BJP for doing "communal politics" and appealed to the people to vote against the ruling front in the remaining 40 seats of the third phase on Tuesday."The BJP's communal politics will affect Assam for coming several decades. It needs to be defeated at any cost. If we cannot defeat such politics, then the balance and harmony of Assam will be distorted forever," he warned.Claiming that most of the 19 lakh people excluded from the National Register of Citizens in Assam are Hindus, Yechury questioned why the BJP is silent on them if the party is concerned for the community."They (BJP) just want to create a binary. I do not think the people of Assam will fall for this trap of the Hindu-Muslim binary. I fully believe that BJP is going to face a big surprise in this election," he said.The Congress, which was in power for 15 years in Assam since 2001, has formed a Grand Alliance with AIUDF, BPF, CPI (M), CPI, CPI(ML), Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM), RJD, Adivasi National Party (ANP) and Jimochayan (Deori) Peoples Party (JPP) to fight the Assembly election against the BJP-led NDA.The grouping has "guaranteed" that if it is voted to power, then a law will be brought in to nullify the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, five lakh government jobs will be given, 200 units of electricity will be free for all, housewives will get Rs 2,000 per month and minimum wages of tea garden workers will be raised to Rs 365.

The good performing states have actually saturated and achieved 70 or 80 per cent vaccination of priority groups then they can expect to report lesser cases in coming times," he told PTI.Panda added that the indirect benefit of the increased number of vaccinations is the reduced transmission of the infection. India is racing against time to contain a second wave of the coronavirus which continues to batter the country. The country recorded 93,249 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, the highest single-day rise since September, which took the total COVID-19 cases to 1,24,85,509, according to the health ministry data.

04-04-2021||New Delhi||Going the extra mile: Pvt schools paying for COVID-19 vaccination of their 'Corona Warriors'||Calling their teachers 'Corona Warriors' who kept the momentum of classes going despite the pandemic forcing school closures, several private schools are helping them get inoculated by booking slots at government vaccination centres, paying for their shots at private facilities and some even bearing their travel expenses for visiting the centres.While the schools say the drive right now is for staff above the age of 45 years, in accordance with the government guidelines, they will cover their remaining staff too once the lower age bracket is eligible."In consideration to the sheer dedication and dexterity with which our teachers have supported us throughout the difficult year of 2020, the school considers them no less than frontline workers. In order to assure them complete safety and extend them support in terms of healthcare, the school has been conducting the vaccination drive in the first 10 days of April for the staff members who stand eligible according to the government guidelines," said Rajat Goel, Director, MRG School, Rohini.Alka Kapur, Principal, Modern Public School, Shalimar Bagh, said, "Besides doctors and professional frontline workers, the teaching fraternity is most vulnerable to the risk of contracting the virus. Their duty requires them to come into contact with people of all ages at their workplace"."With the ongoing board practicals and examinations, they also have to come into contact with the students. Hence, they must have a shield of vaccination to safeguard themselves from the dreaded disease. This is why we have booked the vaccination slots for our 40 eligible staff members at the dispensary near to our campus," she added.Orchids-The International School, a chain of over 40 schools across the country, has announced to provide complete financial assistance to its 4,000 staff members for receiving the vaccination.According to Kavita Chatterjee, Member of Management Committee (Principals), the school management will sponsor the entire cost, including travelling to the location and close to 4,000 teaching and non-teaching staff members will be provided with 100 per cent financial assistance for getting the vaccination."While we are following all protocols mentioned by the government such as temperature checks and sanitisation, we believe vaccination is the best safety measure against COVID-19. We have always put the safety of the staff members, students and their families at the heart of every decision, and hence recommend the vaccination strongly. Of course, prior consent will be taken from each staff member to ensure that they have 100 per cent control over the decision," she said.Sangeeta Hajela, Principal, DPS Indirapuram, said, "We are all aware that COVID-19 has entered its second wave in India. At such a difficult time, ensuring the safety of our staff is of utmost importance. Therefore, the management is in process of discussion to conduct a vaccination drive for the teaching and non-teaching staff in a structured manner in just few days"."Currently, we have initiated the process of taking feedback from our staff on how comfortable they are in getting vaccinated, post approval we will begin arranging the rest of the framework for vaccination drive," she said.The efforts for vaccination of school teachers come amid a surge in coronavirus cases which has prompted a few states to postpone reopening of schools in a new academic session.According to Seema Kaur, Principal, Pacific World School, "Amid a global pandemic disrupting everyone's lifestyle and giving them a health scare, the best aid that as a school we could extend is hosting a vaccination drive for our senior staff members. We are planning to do the same, but since the vaccines are not readily available we will have to figure out a proper methodology to carry it effectively"."Our staff has shown immense dedication during lockdown, and it becomes our duty to provide them with a safety net during these unprecedented difficult times. With COVID cases rising, the best manner to make them feel secured is by organizing a vaccination drive. We are currently figuring out the entire process to host this vaccination drive for our staff aged 45 years and above. If everything goes well, we will soon be able to conduct the drive," said Pallavi Upadhyaya, Principal, DPS RNE Ghaziabad.India on Sunday recorded 93,249 new coronavirus infections, the highest single-day rise so far this year, which took the total COVID-19 cases to 1,24,85,509, according to Union health ministry data.This is the biggest daily rise in cases since September 19, when 93,337 fresh infections were recorded.While schools were closed in all states from last April to September, a few states started with partial reopening from October onwards. However, some of them have again started closing schools briefly in view of the surge in cases. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/going-the-extra-mile-pvt-schools-paying-for-covid-19-vaccination-of-their-corona-warriors-234536

Compound interest support scheme for loan moratorium cost the government Rs 5,500 crore during 2020-21 and the scheme covered all borrowers including the prompt one who did not avail moratorium.According to banking sources, initially 60 per cent of borrowers availed moratorium and gradually the percentage came down to 40 per cent and even less as collection improved with ease in lockdown. In case of corporate, this was as low as 25 per cent as far as public sector banks were concerned.They further said, banks would provide compound interest waiver for the period a borrower had availed moratorium. For example, if a borrower availed moratorium of three months, the waiver would be for that period.The RBI on March 27 last year announced a loan moratorium on payment of instalments of term loans falling due between March 1 and May 31, 2020, due to the pandemic, later the same was extended to August 31.The apex court order this time is only limited to those who availed moratorium so the liability of the public sector bank should be less than Rs 2,000 crore as per rough calculations, sources added.Besides, they said, the order does not specify a timeframe for the settlement of compound interest unlike last time so banks can devise a mechanism of adjusting or settling it in staggered manner.Meanwhile, Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) has written to the government to compensate lenders for interest on interest waiver.The government would take a call depending on various considerations.The Supreme Court last month directed that no compound or penal interest shall be charged from borrowers for the six-month loan moratorium period, which was announced last year amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and the amount already charged shall be refunded, credited or adjusted.The apex court refused to interfere with the Centre and Reserve Bank of India (RBI’s) decision to not extend the loan moratorium beyond August 31 last year, saying it is a policy decision.Rejecting pleas for a complete waiver on interest the court opined that such a move would have consequences on the economy. The bench also said that interest waiver would affect depositors. Along with this, the court also rejected pleas for further relief in the matter.

04-04-2021||New Delhi||69 years of Rajya Sabha: Why Bengal is key to House majority||Sixty-nine years since the Rajya Sabha was constituted on April 3, 1952, debate rages on the role of the Upper House. This discussion became more pronounced after late Arun Jaitley, then leader of the House, asked in 2015 if it was proper for the wisdom of a directly elected House to be repeatedly questioned by the indirectly elected House.The remarks were rooted in Opposition moves to block legislations in the Rajya Sabha where it commanded a greater majority than the government.What Pranab said about upper houseA look at Rajya Sabha history shows that until 1969, its composition was similar to the Lok Sabha’s, with the Congress enjoying the majority in both Houses. This changed after the 1969 Congress split and the 1971 General Election win of former PM Indira Gandhi-led faction, which was reduced to 90 MPs in a 245-member Rajya Sabha.Late President Pranab Mukherjee, a five-time Rajya Sabha member himself, dwelt on this predicament of governments in his memoirs where, commenting on the 1971 era, he said, “The Upper House started asserting itself against the government and rejected many important laws and constitutional amendments despite the fact that these were supported in the Lok Sabha. The Constitution Amendment Bill of 1970 which sought to abolish privy purses failed to get two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha by a fraction of votes.”Going by the Constituent Assembly debates, Mukherjee said it was clear that the makers of the Constitution did not anticipate that the Upper House would become an impediment to lawmaking.The late President and Congress veteran noted in his analysis of the complexity that the constitution of Rajya Sabha was such that six states with the highest population and their ruling parties determined the majority in the Upper House. This remains the case to date.These states and Rajya Sabha seats allotted to them (stated in the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution) are—West Bengal (16), undivided Uttar Pradesh (34); undivided Bihar (22), undivided Bombay (27), undivided Madras (17) and undivided Andhra Pradesh (18).“It is impossible to have two-thirds majority or even a simple majority unless the ruling party wins all of these six large state Assemblies or all others through a process of simultaneous elections, which are possible only through a Constitutional amendment,” Mukjerjee’s says of the Rajya Sabha.This explains the incumbent BJP’s push for the one nation, one election plan and its feverish campaign pitch in the TMC-ruled West Bengal, currently witnessing Assembly elections. This also explains BJP’s persistent attempts to get power in Maharashtra since the ruling party is already in government in UP, Uttrakhand and Bihar, other states that determine an unassailable Rajya Sabha majority.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/69-years-of-rajya-sabha-why-bengal-is-key-to-house-majority-234272

The Federal Cabinet, chaired by Khan, has turned it down because there has been no change in the political situation – India’s abrogation of Article 370 and change in status ofJ&K that compelled Islamabad to cut off all trade with India in August 2019.Several explanations are being given in Pakistan for reversing a proposal that would have generated economic activity on both sides of the Wagah border. Moeed Yusuf, Pakistan’s designated NSA, said Imran Khan wore two hats. As the minister in charge of commerce, he approved trade with India but as the PM, he opposed the proposal, explained Yusuf.The PM has now instructed officials to find alternatives, other than Indian, for cheap sources of import of the needed commodities. Indian sugar was 15 to 20 per cent below global prices and Indian cotton and yarn would have bridged the supply shortfall for Pakistani textile mills. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-pm-says-no-to-trade-with-india-234283

Both Owaisi and Siddiqui had earlier denied the TMC’s insinuations.The ISF is fighting the elections in alliance with the CPI(M) and the Congress. The TMC supremo also urged Hindus to be on the guard against the BJP’s attempts to “instigate communal clashes” and called upon them to chase away outsiders sent to foment trouble in their respective localities. Affirming her Hindu identity, in an apparent attempt to counter the minority appeasement charge against her, Banerjee said, “I am a devout Hindu who recites Chandi mantra every day before leaving home. But I believe in our tradition of giving respect to every religion.” Taking a dig at BJP leaders having lunch at houses of Dalits, she said, “I am a Brahmin woman.

He said people there would not call Mamata an “outsider” or a “tourist” (words frequently used by the TMC against BJP leaders canvassing in West Bengal).Campaign ban on Himanta CUT TO 24 hrsThe Election Commission on Saturday reduced the 48-hour campaign ban imposed on Assam minister and BJP leader Himanta Biswa Sarma to 24 hours after he tendered an “unconditional apology” and assured the poll panel that he would abide by the provisions of the model code. The EC said after considering his “unconditional apology and assurance/undertaking”, it decided to modify its April 2 order. TNSThe PM said the fact that Mamata wanted to contest from Varanasi showed that she had already accepted defeat in Bengal. He said the TMC propaganda against “outsiders” was an insult to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, who was born in Orissa and educated in Bengal. Earlier addressing a meeting at Tarakeshwar, Modi said Mamata’s frequent outbursts against the Election Commission and Central forces deployed in Bengal for the smooth conduct of elections were similar to a cricketer blaming the umpire for his poor form. He alleged the TMC’s “obstructionist mindset” deprived West Bengal of industries and jobs. “She keeps criticising EVMs, the EC....If players keep criticising umpires, you should know their “Khela Sesh” (game’s over),”he said.
