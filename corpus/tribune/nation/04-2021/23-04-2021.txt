23-04-2021||New Delhi||CJI Bobde wanted Shah Rukh Khan to mediate Ayodhya dispute||Outgoing Chief Justice of India SA Bobde wanted Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan to join the team of mediators appointed by the Supreme Court to find an amicable solution to the Ram Janmbhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute at Ayodhya, Supreme Court Bar Association President Vikas Singh revealed on Friday.“He asked me if Shah Rukh Khan can be a part of the committee…I spoke with SRK and he was happy to be in the mediation panel but unfortunately, mediation did not work,” Singh said during a virtual function organised by the SCBA to bid adieu to Justice Bobde.Singh said Justice Bobde’s willingness to resolve the communally sensitive issue through mediation was noteworthy.The Supreme Court had appointed Justice (Retd) FMI Kalifulla, spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravishankar and senior lawyer and mediation expert Sriram Panchu to find a mediated solution to the Ayodhya dispute. But the issue had to be adjudicated upon as the mediation failed.The Supreme Court on November 9, 2019 paved the way for construction of a Ram Temple at Ayodhya as a five-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi unanimously decreed the decades-old title dispute in favour of Ram Lalla.It also ordered allotment of alternate land measuring five acre to Muslims for the construction of a mosque and associated activities within the city of Ayodhya.In a 1045-page historic verdict, the top court reversed the Allahabad High Court’s September 30, 2010 verdict equally dividing the disputed 2.77-acre land between Ram Lalla, Nirmohi Akhara and Muslims, terming it “legally unsustainable”.Justice Bobde was on the five-judge Constitution Bench which delivered the historic verdict on Ayodhya dispute. Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice S Abdul Nazeer were the other three judges on the Bench.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cji-bobde-wanted-shah-rukh-khan-to-mediate-ayodhya-dispute-243143
23-04-2021||New Delhi||Russia, Europe to dispatch oxygen as China offers to help||As the number of COVID-19 patients remained high, Russia, UK, France and Germany among other countries have offered to gift oxygen generating equipment to India.Germany will be the first to send nearly two dozen oxygen generation plants and France and the UK have also said they are prepared to follow suit.  The Russian offer for oxygen as well as remdesivir injections came on Friday when India notched the world’s highest daily tally of COVID-19 cases for the second consecutive day.Russia has offered to provide medical-grade oxygen and anti-viral drug remdesivir. India, grappling with a record shortage of both products, can begin receiving shipments in a fortnight.Moscow has also offered four lakh remdesivir injections every week.  The injections have a going rate of Rs 30,000-40,000 in the black market.India has already waived the import duty on remdesivir.Russia is also dispatching emergency doses of Sputnik-V vaccine due to a slowdown in production in India after the US put curbs on export of raw material for the vaccines.Sources said till its India-made vaccine hits the market in sufficient numbers, India is exploring the possibility of “full and fill” Sputnik vaccines.On the continuing US ban on export of raw materials that goes into the manufacturing of vaccines in India, the sources said, “we have raised at high levels and they have been receptive”.In Beijing, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said China was ready to offer assistance according to India’s needs.  Hoping that India will defeat the virus at an early date, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian expressed Beijing’s sincere sympathies to India over the deteriorating situation in the country recently.“China is ready to provide support and help according to India’s need, and is in communication with the Indian side on this,” said Zhao when asked at the media briefing on Friday about the kind of help that China can offer and also whether China is having communications with India on providing help.“The Chinese government and people firmly support the Indian government and people in fighting the coronavirus,” added Zhao.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/russia-europe-to-dispatch-oxygen-as-china-offers-to-help-243138
23-04-2021||New Delhi||Access to justice now depends on access to technology: CJI Bobde||Outgoing Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, credited with ensuring Supreme Court’s quick transition to technology during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, referred to new kind of “equality and inequality” in virtual hearings, saying now “access to justice depends on access to technology”.In his farewell address at the virtual function organised by Supreme Court Bar Association, the 47th CJI said the performance of India’s top court was “among the best” in the world during the COVID-19 pandemic as it was not closed even for a day due to the deadly virus.  He said the pandemic required the Supreme Court to learn new things about communications, and it was decided that the video conferencing was the way forward.“We have got used to it and it is here to stay in certain cases. I have flagged certain intractable problems of virtual hearing and one of them is the new kind of equality, inequality which is created.“I don’t wish to dwell much on it, except to say that equality, inequality that already existed has been augmented by the fact that VCs have become technology dependent and your access to justice depends on your access to technology,” he said.Addressing the young lawyers, who are disheartened by the evident events of the pandemic, Justice Bobde said, “Don’t lose hope. Carry on. Things will change.” He pointed out that the circumstances are such that we can acquire all the devices and technologies necessary.         Talking about the importance of the artificial intelligence (AI), Justice Bobde said: “If we won’t become familiar with the AI, we will find ourselves at a great disadvantage. It is with that spirit that AI has been resorted to.“This is a warning I would like to issue in adoption of artificial intelligence as I think its futile to ignore it,” he said, adding that “if we don’t adopt it, we will be at great disadvantage”.          Speaking on the occasion, Attorney General KK Venugopal batted for the fixed tenure of CJIs for three to four years, saying by the time people get to know the head of the judiciary, he “disappears”.“I had said that it is a very sad day that even before we spent enough time with a CJI there is a new CJI. That is why I have been suggesting that CJI should be there for 3 to 4 years,” he said.“Father of Justice DY Chandrachud (also a judge in the Supreme Court currently) served for seven years as CJI,” he said, adding that increasing the tenure for the CJI is in the hands of the collegium”.Senior advocate and SCBA President Vikas Singh also spoke at the occasion.Earlier during the day, Justice Bobde said that he was leaving the Supreme Court with happiness, goodwill and very fond memories and the satisfaction of having done his best.Justice Bobde, who decided several key cases during his tenure, including the historic Ayodhya verdict, was administered oath as the 47th CJI in November 2019 and is retiring today.

23-04-2021||Beijing||China says in communication with India to provide help to combat COVID-19 surge||China on Friday said it firmly supports the Indian government and the people in their fight against the coronavirus pandemic and is in communication with New Delhi on its offer to provide support and help to deal with the surge in COVID-19 cases in the country.Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here that China expresses sincere sympathies to India over the deteriorating coronavirus situation in the country recently.“The Chinese government and people firmly support the Indian government and people in fighting the coronavirus,” he said.“China is ready to provide support and help according to India’s need, and is in communication with the Indian side on this. We believe that the Indian people will defeat the virus at an early date,” Zhao said in response to a question from the official Chinese media if Beijing is having communications with New Delhi on providing help to India fight the pandemic.On Thursday also China offered to provide the necessary support and assistance to India to deal with the sharp increase in the COVID-19 cases in the country.The first COVID-19 case was reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019 and since then the deadly disease has become a pandemic that has affected more than 14,47,71,300 people and claimed over 30,72,600 lives worldwide.According to Johns Hopkins coronavirus tracker, the US alone has reported 3,18,62,987 cases and 5,69,404 deaths from the deadly virus.The US has alleged that the COVID-19 may have emanated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) which is a P-4 bio lab, a charge strongly denied by China.A team of WHO experts, which probed the origin of the coronavirus, concluded last month that “all hypotheses” included the allegation that COVID-19 could have emanated from a bio lab “remained open”.India is currently facing a massive surge in coronavirus infections. India on Friday added a record over 3.32 lakh new coronavirus cases in a single day taking the country’s tally to 1,62,63,695, while active cases crossed the 24-lakh mark.

23-04-2021||New Delhi||Area under summer crops increased by 21.5%from last year||For the second successive year, the area under summer crops is showing an increasing trend in the country. The summer sowing in the country, as on date (April 23), is 21.5 per cent higher than it was last year during the corresponding period, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare.  While the total summer crop area has increased to 73.76 lakh hectares from 60.67 lakh hectares a year ago in the corresponding period, a noteworthy increase has been in area of pulses, it said. As on April 23, the area under pulses increased to 12.75 lakh ha from 6.45 lakh ha, an increase of nearly 100 per cent. The increase in area has been reported from Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Karnataka. Area under oil seeds also increased to 10.45 lakh ha from 9.03 lakh ha, an increase of around 16 per cent over last year, the ministry said, adding that growth has been reported from West Bengal, Karnataka, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. The rice coverage increased to 39.10 lakh ha from 33.82 lakh ha, an increase of around 16 per cent. Rabi rice has been reported from West Bengal, Telangana, Karnataka, Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Bihar, it added.Summer crops not only provide extra income but also create employment opportunities. Another major gain is the improvement in soil health, particularly through the pulses crop, say officials.Growing summer/Zaid crops based on the availability of soil moisture and other climatic conditions is an old practice in India, particularly for meeting the additional domestic requirement of food grains and feeding livestock. Farmers also cultivate summer paddy crops in some states for their domestic use based on water availability. To develop a road map, the Zaid National conference was held in January 2021 in which discussion with states was held on the challenges, prospects and strategies, they add.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/area-under-summer-crops-increased-by-21-5from-last-year-243130

These plants shall have a capacity to generate 1,000 litres of oxygen per minute,” the statement stated.Vardhan noted that the country is passing through the second COVID-19 wave. Most of the states and Union territories (UTs) are reporting a very high number of daily cases and the daily mortality has also increased, he said.The Union government has been leading the fight against COVID-19 through a ‘whole of government’ and ‘whole of society’ approach. The hospital infrastructure has been substantially ramped up through various proactive decisions taken by the government in collaboration with the states/UTs.In view of the unprecedented surge in the number of daily cases, the requirement of oxygen-supported and ICU beds in addition to adequate oxygen supply along with medicines and trained manpower has increased manifold, the statement quoted Vardhan as saying.The health minister also reviewed in detail beds availability, including oxygen supported and ICU-ventilator beds.Meanwhile, the central government hospitals talked about the immediate steps taken for augmenting the beds availability to cater to the immediate needs of COVID-19 patients.“The Union minister directed all the hospitals to urgently start work on the augmentation plans through fabricated hospitals, repurposing non-COVID beds (such that the healthcare services are not unduly and adversely impacted), conversion of buildings/blocks and wards in the existing premises into dedicated COVID facilities,” the statement said.It was also informed that Safdarjung Hospital was augmenting the bed availability with 172 more COVID beds (total being 391). With this, the Super Specialty Block at the hospital will be fully converted to a specialty block for only coronavirus patients. Also, 46 beds (including 32 ICU beds) are being added with the help of the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR).Dr RML Hospital stated that it is converting non-COVID buildings for dedicated COVID treatment facilities. This step shall provide 200 additional beds for the COVID affected.In LHMC, 240 more beds are being created by CSIR which shall become operationalised soon, the statement said.Shekhar Mande, secretary, DSIR & Director General, CSIR assured that all support is being provided to strengthen and expedite the ongoing efforts, it said.AIIMS director Randeep Guleria outlined the expansion plans for adding more beds in other wards/blocks such as the Burns and Plastic Surgery Centre, NCI Jhajjar, Dr R P Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences and the geriatric wards. The total capacity shall be enhanced to more than 1,000 beds for only COVID-19 patients, according to the statement.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan underlined the measures taken by the government to resolve and streamline logistic issues related to transport of oxygen supply from manufacturing sources to hospitals.He also talked about the 24X7 Control Room of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) that is working to resolve all transportation-related issues of Delhi for smooth supply of oxygen.

23-04-2021|| Hyderabad||Telangana airlifts oxygen trucks from Odisha||A day after indulging in a blame game for not allotting enough oxygen to Telangana, state Health Minister Eatala Rajender and Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar got into action and got the help of the army aircraft to airlift and quickly transport oxygen from Odisha. The move, first of its kind, will soon make enough oxygen available for all hospitals. Andhra Pradesh has already announced that it has adequate supplies of oxygen. Industries Minister Mekapati Goutham has said that the state had enough oxygen for its own use and clarified that it would only be sent to other states once the requirement of the state is met. The state produces 510 metric tonnes of oxygen in 40 plants across the state.Since early Friday, Eatala Rajender and Somesh Kumar personally oversaw the loading of empty oxygen trucks into an army cargo aircraft at old Begumpet airport. The cargo aircraft have flown to Odisha, where the oxygen truck will be filled at Tata Steel Plant in Kalinganagar and brought back to Hyderabad by the cargo aircraft. The move has been widely hailed. On Thursday, the state had accused the Centre of allotting oxygen to Telangana from plants that were over 1,500 kilometres away. Besides, Telangana has also questioned the different price tags for the vaccine being given to the states. Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao’s son K T Rama Rao, who is also State IT Minister and working President of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) party tweeted:  “My compliments to both Health Minister, Eatala Rajender and Chief Secretary, Somesh Kumar who are supervising oxygen tankers airlifting from Hyderabad to Odisha to bring back oxygen faster to Telangana. This will save three days and many valuable lives. First time India”. Meanwhile, while the state is being accused of grossly under-performing the COVID-19 testing, the Apollo Hospital has started the first drive-through Covid testing centre in Hyderabad. Located at Apollo Diagnostics at Meridian School, Madhapur individuals can now drive through in their four-wheelers, register and allow the healthcare workers to collect their samples for Covid RT-PCR tests, while sitting in their cars. It is being done on the same patter as is being done in the United States. With the rising number of COVID-19 cases, the Telangana Working Journalists Federation (TWJF) has reported ten deaths of journalists working with media houses in Telangana in the past week from complications of Coronavirus. Three journalists from Andhra Pradesh have also died after testing positive for the coronavirus in this same period. TWJF President M Somaiah said 150 journalists in Telangana have tested positive in the past three weeks of April 2021.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-airlifts-oxygen-trucks-from-odisha-243125
23-04-2021||New Delhi||Modi asks oxygen manufacturers to scale up production to meet demand||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday called for utilising the industry’s full potential to meet the demand of medical oxygen in the coming days, saying there is a need to increase the availability of oxygen cylinders as well as to upgrade the logistical facilities for its transportation.In a virtual meeting with leading oxygen manufacturers across the country, Modi urged the industry to utilise tankers meant to transport other gases for oxygen supply, saying the time now is not only to deal with the challenges but also to provide solutions in a very short time.Modi stressed the need to maintain good coordination between the government and the oxygen producers, according to a statement.A rapid rise in the COVID-19 cases has driven a massive demand for medical oxygen by states and hospitals. In the last few days, hospitals have sent out SOS for its supply.In his remarks, the prime minister appreciated the oxygen producers for increasing their production in the last few weeks and acknowledged several steps taken to increase the production of liquid oxygen.He also thanked the industry for diverting industrial oxygen to meet medical requirements in the country.Keeping in mind the requirements of states pertaining to oxygen, the government is working on effectively using the Railways and the Air Force so that the tankers reach the production centre as soon as possible.“PM Modi remarked that the government, the states, the industry and the transporters, and all the hospitals need to come together and work in unison. The better the synergy and coordination, the easier it will be able to deal with this challenge,” the statement said.Modi offered his government’s full support to them and hoped the country would be successful in combating the crisis soon.Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries, Soma Mandal of SAIL, Sajjan Jindal of JSW, Narendran of Tata Steel, Naveen Jindal of JSPL, Dilip Oommen of AMNS, M Bannerjee of LINDE, Sidharth Jain of Inox, Noriyo Shibuya of Air Water Jamshedpur, Rajesh Kumar Saraf of National Oxygen Ltd. and Saket Tiku, President of All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers’ Association, were present during the meeting, the statement said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-asks-oxygen-manufacturers-to-scale-up-production-to-meet-demand-243122
23-04-2021||---||No response from Centre to demand for uniform vaccine rate: Tope||Mumbai, April 23Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said on Friday that there has been no firm response from the Centre to the demand for uniform pricing of coronavirus vaccines.He also said that the Serum Institute of India has informed that it can provide Covishield vaccine to the state only after May 24 as the Centre has booked all production until then.Tope was speaking to reporters after participating in a virtual meeting held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the states worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic.“All the major states have demanded ‘one nation-one rate’ for vaccine, but received no firm response from the Centre,” he said.“We have examples of Israel or the UK where vaccination was carried out at a large scale. If the rates are reduced, we could buy more vaccines,” Tope said.“If the demand is not met, the state will take responsibility of people under the poverty line only while others as well as corporates will have to take the vaccine on their own,” said the health minister.Opposition parties have questioned why the SII’s Covishield vaccine was procured by the Centre at Rs 150 per dose but the states will have to shell out Rs 400 apiece.The Centre has asked the states to vaccinate those in the 18-44 age group, and Maharashtra has around five crore people in this category so it would need more than 10 crore doses, Tope further said.“The state finance department will have to study the burden of vaccine cost and take decision,” he added.He also said that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray spoke with Adar Poonawalla of the Serum Institute which is producing Covishield about its availability.Poonawalla informed that production till May 24 has been already booked by the Centre for its vaccination drive covering those above 45 years of age.“He can supply vaccine only after May 24. We will also talk to Bharat Biotech (makers of Covaxin),” the minister said.Maharashtra has 4,000 vaccination centres and enough trained manpower, but “the only problem is with the actual supply of vaccine, which is limited”, he said.The state can inoculate eight lakh people on a daily basis but at present only three lakh people are getting the jab, Tope said.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-response-from-centre-to-demand-for-uniform-vaccine-rate-tope-243121

COVID vaccine makers must reserve 50 per cent stock of their supply for the Centre and were free to divide the rest between states and private hospitals at a pre-decided price.Days after this announcement, the Serum Institute of India announced its new prices: Rs 400 a dose to the state and Rs 600 a dose for private hospitals. The central government will continue to get the vaccine at Rs 150 a dose, which it would use to for its own vaccine programme—at the moment, it gives free vaccines to health care workers, the elderly and people over 45.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-promises-free-covid-vaccine-in-bengal-243118

23-04-2021||Jabalpur||5 COVID-19 patients die due to lack of oxygen at hospital in MP||Five coronavirus patients undergoing treatment in the ICU of a private hospital in Madhya Pradesh's Jabalpur city died allegedly after the stock of medical oxygen at the facility got over, a police official said on Friday.The incident took place during the intervening night of Thursday and Friday at Galaxy Hospital, City Superintendent of Police (Kotwali area) Dipak Mishra said."Five COVID-19 patients died in the ICU of the hospital after the stock of the medical oxygen got over according to the family members of the deceased," he said.The police personnel, who were patrolling the area reached the hospital at night on receiving a message about the outcry of family members outside the facility."They complained that their loved ones died due to the lack of oxygen supply as the stock got exhausted," the CSP said.The hospital was waiting for the supply of 10 oxygen cylinders late at night on Thursday, but the vehicle transporting them broke down. Later, a police team was rushed to the private agency to collect the cylinders, he said."A vehicle was arranged and 10 medical oxygen cylinders were brought to the hospital," he said.The family members have urged the police to conduct an inquiry into the matter."We are waiting for a written complaint to start the probe," Mishra added.Commenting on the incident, BJP MLA (Patan) and former health minister Ajay Vishnoi said, "Poor management of the private hospital over the oxygen supply led to the incident." The hospital should have made arrangement for the supply of medical oxygen in advance considering the requirement, he said."As of now there is no shortage of medical oxygen in Jabalpur district," Vishnoi added.Despite repeated attempts, nobody from the hospital was available for comment.

23-04-2021||New Delhi||SC intervention in COVID-19 management uncalled for: Congress||The Congress on Friday termed as "wrong" and "uncalled for" the suo motu intervention made by the Supreme Court in the management of COVID-19 in the country, alleging it amounts to over-centralisation of judicial powers.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said high courts were efficiently upholding the citizens' right to life and holding the government accountable in a more nuanced way on a case-to-case basis and they should have been allowed to carry on their work."The Supreme Court's intervention on April 22, 2021, is totally uncalled for. Unfortunately, it is wrong, wrong and wrong. It is wrong because it is not suo motu ameliorative but a reaction to palliative high court orders," he said."It is wrong because decentralisation not over-centralisation — judicial, administrative and societal — is the need of the hour," he told reporters at a virtual press conference.Singhvi said it is wrong because the SC has not done and could not have done what diverse HCs have done, especially what the Delhi High Court did at 9 pm to give some relief to the oxygen-starved common man of Delhi.He asked why the high courts are being allegedly prevented from discharging their duties.However, the Supreme Court on Friday observed that it did not stop high courts from hearing cases related to COVID-19 management in the country.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, who is demitting office as the CJI Friday itself, rapped some senior advocates for making statements without reading its order passed on Thursday.The Supreme Court also allowed senior advocate Harish Salve to withdraw as amicus curiae for the suo motu case related to the distribution of essential supplies and services, including oxygen and drugs, during the COVID-19 pandemic.Singhvi said it is wrong because the SC should not at the 11th hour, with one day's notice, and on the very last day of the incumbent CJI's term of office, have "virtually paralysed" the ongoing action in the country giving a healing touch to local problems at the local level.Taking note of the grim situation created by the massive surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths, the Supreme Court had on Thursday said it expects the Centre to come out with a national plan to deal with proper distribution of oxygen and essential drugs for the patients."It is wrong because the SC is ill-equipped to deal with such local issues, local logistics and should not supplant that local touch on the erroneous and fallacious touchstone of uniformity."It is wrong because such orders have a demoralising, chilling, paralysing and negative effect on the excellent work being done by other non-governmental institutions of governance, including high courts," he said.The Congress leader said the intervention is wrong because it may have the unintended effect of legitimation of the "utter failure" of the central government on all fronts in its anti-COVID policies and actions.He alleged that it is wrong because the SC, has been unable or unwilling to take hard, concrete steps for a solution and significant mitigation of COVID related hardships over the last 15 months has in fact intervened at the peak of the crisis in a manner that may well retard and impede effective ongoing solution-oriented measures.He also alleged that the SC has decided to appoint a Non-resident Indian as an amicus curiae while appearing and arguing in a case to reopen a plant that was shut down for green violations."It is unfortunate and concerning to see the crucial office of the Attorney General being undermined. Why was he, as the number one constitutionally designated officer of the court, not even called upon," he said.Singhvi also asked why the government failed to bring proper infrastructure for COVID management despite wasting almost one and a half year.He also asked why the government is allegedly under reporting cases of infections and deaths and why have the number of tests gone down in places like Delhi, which is hardly conducting 1 lakh tests per day.

He was absolutely fit and fine. Amit had no underlining medical condition. It's an absolutely shocking news," the actor's manager Maharshi Desai told PTI.Mistry is survived by his mother.The actor was a prominent face in the Gujarati theatre circuit.His work in Hindi films like ‘Kya Kehna’, ‘Ek Chalis Ki Last Local’, especially his collaborations with filmmaker Raj-DK, including ‘99’, ‘Shor In The City’ and ‘A Gentleman’ got him wider attention.Mistry also earned acclaim in last year's hit series ‘Bandish Bandits’ playing musician Devendra Rathod.His TV credits include popular show ‘Yeh Duniya Hai Rangeen’.Mistry's sudden death shocked his colleagues and industry people."Brother Amit, can't believe this that someone so full of life is no more. Keep spreading love the way you used to wherever you are," actor Rajesh Tailang, his co-star in ‘Bandish Bandits’, tweeted.Singer-actor Swanand Kirkire tweeted, "Amit Mistry? No...this is unbelievable. He was an amazing actor and a real happy soul."Actor Tisca Chopra also expressed shock.

23-04-2021||Washington||US defends restrictions on export of Covid vaccine raw materials amid India's request to lift ban||Defending US' restrictions on the export of key raw materials for the manufacture of COVID-19 vaccine that threatens to slow India's vaccination drive, a senior State Department official has said the Biden administration's first obligation is to take care of the requirements of the American people.When asked when the Biden administration would decide on India's request to lift a ban on the export of vaccine raw materials, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said: "...the United States first and foremost is engaged in an ambitious and effective and, so far, successful effort to vaccinate the American people.""That campaign is well under way, and we're doing that for a couple of reasons. Number one, we have a special responsibility to the American people. Number two, the American people, this country has been hit harder than any other country around the world – more than 5,50,000 deaths, tens of millions of infections in this country alone," he said on Thursday.It is not only in the US interest to see Americans vaccinated; but it is in the interests of the rest of the world to see Americans vaccinated, he said."The point the Secretary (of State Antony Blinken) has made repeatedly is that as long as the virus is spreading anywhere, it is a threat to people everywhere. So as long as the virus is spreading uncontrolled in this country, it can mutate and it can travel beyond our borders. That, in turn, poses a threat well beyond the United States," Price said in responses to questions.As for the rest of the world, "We will, of course, always do as much as we can, consistent with our first obligation," he said.India is currently facing a horrible surge in coronavirus infections. The country on Friday added a record 3.32 lakh new coronavirus cases in a single day taking the country's tally to 1,62,63,695, while active cases crossed the 24-lakh mark.The Biden administration recently conveyed to New Delhi that it understands India's pharmaceutical requirements and promised to give the matter due consideration.It observed that the current difficulty in the export of critical raw materials needed to manufacture COVID-19 vaccines is mainly due to an Act that forces American companies to prioritise domestic consumption.

23-04-2021||Satya Prakash||SC allows Harish Salve to withdraw as amicus, raps some senior lawyers for imputing motives to it||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 23A day after being appointed as amicus curiae by the Supreme Court to assist it in the suo motu case on Covid management, senior advocate Harish Salve on Friday recused himself following allegations of conflict of interest."It's the most sensitive case this court will look into. I don't want this case to be decided under a shadow that I knew the CJI from school and college days...and allegations that there is a conflict of interest," Salve told a three-judge Bench led by CJI SA Bobde, referring to critical comments made by some lawyers on his appointment as amicus curiae.The Bench - which also included Justice L Nageswara Rao and Justice Ravindra Bhat - had on Thursday said it would only hear Salve and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta in the case."I did not know our Bar is divided among industries we appear for. Please allow me to recuse with all humility. I appeared for Vedanta since I was informed 10 minutes before mentioning...I don't want any side show. The language of the narrative now is very different," Salve submitted.The CJI accepted Salve's recusal request even as he said there was nothing clandestine about their relationship."We understand you are pained by those statements. We will honour your sentiments. We will allow your request," the Bench said.Giving time to the Centre to file its reply with regard to a national plan to deal with the health crisis created by Covid pandemic, the Bench posted the matter for Tuesday.The Centre, states and union territories are also to spell out their respective stand on supply of oxygen and essential drugs, method and manner of vaccination and lockdown.Pulling up some lawyers for making remarks without reading its order, the Bench clarified that it didn't transfer cases to itself from high courts."We are also pained at reading what some senior lawyers have to say...You have imputed motives to us without reading our order. We never said a word and did not stop high courts, we had asked Centre to go to high courts and report to them," the top court told senior counsel Dushyant Dave.Alleging that a "maligning competition" was going on in the media, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said this was the last thing the country wanted during the pandemic."Someday somebody from judiciary has to take cognizance of this trend of electronic media. I saw on digital media people literally abusing. This needs to be looked into," Mehta said.Referring to Justice Bobde’s retirement on Friday, he said the CJI deserved a "loving farewell".Describing the situation arising out of a sudden surge in COVID cases and mortality as “grim”, the Supreme Court had on Thursday issued notices to the Centre, states, union territories and others on issues relating to pandemic management, particularly supply of oxygen and essential drugs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-allows-harish-salve-to-withdraw-as-amicus-raps-some-senior-lawyers-for-imputing-motives-to-it-243076
23-04-2021||Mumbai||Hospital staff asleep when fire broke out, there was nobody to help, say kin||Relatives of some of the victims, who died in a fire at a hospital in Maharashtra's Palghar district early on Friday, alleged that the staffers of the facility were asleep when the blaze broke out and there was nobody to help the patients come out of the ICU.They also alleged that the hospital did not fulfil the basic fire safety requirements.Thirteen Covid patients died in the fire at the ICU ward located on the second floor of the four-storey Vijay Vallabh Hospital at Virar in the early hours of Friday.After the incident, angry and distraught family members of the patients gathered outside the hospital."All this is hospital administration's mistake. Its staff members were asleep when the fire broke out. There was not a single employee inside the ICU to help the patients come out," a relative of one of the deceased alleged.The hospital does not have basic fire safety equipment, like sufficient number of fire extinguishers, a family member of another patient said."Then why did they start the hospital at all?" he asked.A woman, who is a doctor by profession, lost her mother in the blaze.Talking to reporters, she said the fire could have put off with the help of a fire extinguisher, but nothing was done."I lost my mother, who was recovering from the ailment. She could have been saved if the fire safety norms were followed," she said."I had personally brought my mother to the hospital in an ambulance for better treatment. Now where should I find my mother," she said sobbing.She said that when she went upstairs after the incident, she saw some blackened bodies lying there.Another victim's relative sought strong action against the hospital. "Whoever is guilty should be punished," the relative said.Outside the hospital, relatives of the victims were seen crying over the loss of their loved ones.Heavy police force was deployed there following the incident.Police and the civic staff helped the families in shifting some patients, who required oxygen and ventilators, to another hospital.

23-04-2021||Mumbai||Lok Sabha Speaker should look into news of my death: Sumitra Mahajan||A popular misquote attributed to Mark Twain states: The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated.On Friday, it was the turn of former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan (78) to announce that she is very much alive.Her 'clarification' came after Congress leader Shashi Tharoor and some media outlets Thursday night announced the demise of Mahajan. Tharoor and others deleted the tweets after BJP leaders pointed out that she was hale and hearty."What should I do? These people carried the news without any confirmation. They should have at least confirmed with the district administration in Indore," Mahajan is heard saying in an audio clip."The Central government and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla should take note of this," the BJP veteran says in the clip."This became all-India news. I started getting calls from my relatives in Mumbai. My brother's daughter responded to Tharoor's tweet asking who gave him this fake news.Mahajan also wondered why some Mumbai news channels, in particular, flashed the fake news of her demise.After deleting the tweet, Tharoor had said he was relieved that Mahajan is doing fine and said he banked on "a reliable source" in putting out his tweet.The former Lok Sabha speaker's son Mandar put out a video clip Thursday night, saying his mother is perfectly fine and asked people not to believe the false news about her.Mahajan was the Lok Sabha Speaker from 2014 to 2019.She earlier represented the Indore Lok Sabha constituency in Parliament for eight terms.

23-04-2021||April 23||NASA-SpaceX set to launch next 4-member crew to International Space Station||NASA and commercial rocket company SpaceX were due to launch a new four-astronaut team to the International Space Station early on Friday in what would be the first crew propelled into orbit by a rocket booster recycled from a previous spaceflight.The company's Crew Dragon capsule, the Endeavour, was set for liftoff atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 5:49 a.m. Eastern time (0949 GMT) from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.The nearly 24-hour ride to the space station, which orbits some 250 miles (400 km) above Earth, had been set to begin on Thursday but was delayed for a day by unfavorable weather forecasts along the rocket's flight path.For the rescheduled launch window on Friday, meteorologists predicted a 90% chance of favorable weather at the launch site, with improving conditions along the flight path.The mission marks the second "operational" space station team to be launched by NASA aboard a Dragon Crew capsule since the United States resumed flying astronauts into space from U.S.soil last year, following a nine-year hiatus at the end of the U.S. space shuttle program in 2011.It is also the third crewed flight launched to into orbit under NASA's fledgling public-private partnership with SpaceX, the rocket company founded and owned by billionaire high-tech entrepreneur Elon Musk. The first was an out-and-back test mission carrying just two astronauts into orbit last May.Friday's four-member Crew 2 team consists of two NASA astronauts - mission commander Shane Kimbrough, 53, and pilot Megan McArthur, 49, - along with Japanese astronaut Akihiko Hoshide, 52, and fellow mission specialist Thomas Pesquet, 43, a French engineer of the European Space Agency."There's nothing like it when you look out the window and see a spaceship getting prepared and realize that you're going to be riding on it in a few days," McArthur said at a news briefing just after arriving at Kennedy Space Center last week.LONG-DURATION MISSIONThey are expected to spend about six months aboard the orbiting research platform conducting science experiments and maintenance before returning to Earth in the fall.The four members of Crew 1, sent to the space station in November, are slated to fly home on April 28.The Crew 2 mission also is special in that its Falcon 9 launch vehicle will fly using the same first-stage booster that lofted Crew 1 into orbit, marking the first time a flight-proven booster will be re-used in a crewed launch.Reusable booster vehicles, designed to fly themselves back to Earth and land safely once they separate from the rest of the rocket minutes after launch, are at the heart of a re-usable rocket strategy that SpaceX helped pioneer to make spaceflight more economical.SpaceX has to date logged more than 45 successful Falcon 9 booster return landings, and the company has refurbished and re-used most of them, some for multiple flights, according to National Geographic. But all of those flights, until Friday's mission, carried cargo only, rather than humans into space.Crew 2's pilot, McArthur, will make a bit of history herself as the first female pilot of the Crew Dragon and the second person from her family to ride aboard a capsule. She is married to NASA astronaut Bob Behnken, who flew the SpaceX demonstration flight with fellow astronaut Doug Hurley last year. The same Crew Dragon was used for that flight as well.Arriving at the space station if all goes according to plan on Saturday, McArthur and her three crewmates will be welcomed by the four Crew 1 astronauts - three from NASA and one from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency JAXA. Two Russian cosmonauts and a U.S. astronaut who shared a Soyuz flight to the space station also are aboard. Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nasa-spacex-set-to-launch-next-4-member-crew-to-international-space-station-243067

23-04-2021||New Delhi||Govt issues revised clinical guidance for management of Covid patients||The Union health ministry on Thursday issued a revised 'Clinical Guidance for Management of Adult COVID-19 Patients' recommending the EUA/off-label use of Tocilizumab drug in case of severe diseases, preferably within 24 to 48 hours of the onset of the disease or ICU admission.The guidelines issued by AIIMS, ICMR-COVID-19 National Task Force and the Joint Monitoring Group (DGHS) under the ministry stated that Tocilizumab (a drug that modifies the immune system or its functioning) may be considered in patients with significantly raised inflammatory markers and not improving despite use of steroids with there being no active bacterial/fungal/tubercular infection.They also recommended off-label use of convalescent plasma only in the early moderate disease, preferably within seven days of symptom onset, stating that "no use after seven days" and only on availability of high titre donor plasma.Under emergency use authorization (EUA), Remdesivir may be considered for only those patients with moderate to severe diseases (requiring supplemental oxygen) within 10 days of onset of symptoms.It is not recommended for those with severe renal impairment or hepatic dysfunction, the guidelines stated."Not to be used in patients who are not on oxygen support or in home settings," the ministry underlined.The guidance note comes in the wake of increasing demand for Tocilizumab, Remdesivir and plasma, as the COVID-19 cases continue to surge. The note specifies how and in what stages and doses should the drugs be used.According to the guidance note, upper respiratory tract symptoms (or fever) without shortness of breath or hypoxia has been categorised as ‘mild disease' and people have been advised home isolation and care.The guidelines advise physical distancing, indoor mask use, strict hand hygiene. symptomatic management (hydration, anti-pyretics, antitussive, multivitamins), staying in contact with treating physician, monitoring temperature and oxygen saturation (by applying a SpO2 probe to fingers) for such patients.They should seek immediate medical attention if they develop difficulty in breathing, high grade fever/severe cough, particularly if lasting for five days.A low threshold to be kept for those with any of the high-risk features such as 60 years of age, having cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic lung/kidney/liver disease or cerebrovascular disease or obesity, the note stated.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-issues-revised-clinical-guidance-for-management-of-covid-patients-243065
23-04-2021||Toronto||Canada bans passenger flights from India, Pakistan for 30 days due to surge in Covid cases||The Canadian government has banned all passenger flights from India and Pakistan for 30 days due to the unprecedented spike in COVID-19 cases in the region, the longest country-specific travel ban imposed by Canada.The flight ban took effect from Thursday midnight, Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said on Thursday.A number of countries like the UK, Australia and Singapore have banned travel to and from India due to surge in coronavirus infections.Over 3.14 lakh new coronavirus cases were registered in India on Thursday, the highest-ever single-day count in any country. While the death toll increased to 1,84,657 with a record 2,104 new fatalities. The national recovery rate fell below 85 per cent.Transport Minister Alghabra said the government imposed a 30-day ban, the longest travel ban Canada has put on any individual country, on passengers flights from India and Pakistan, based on advice from federal health officials in order to buy time to assess more data, and to provide “certainty” for Canadians considering travelling to the region, the Toronto Star reported.However, the cargo flights are not banned and Ottawa is still hoping that India, which has suspended vaccine exports, will send the bulk of 1.5 million AstraZeneca doses Canada had purchased through the Serum Institute of India.Those doses—about 1 million—are now in limbo, at least until June due to export controls in India, officials admitted on Thursday.The moves come after the Liberal government came under fire from the Conservative opposition, the premiers of Canada's two largest provinces, and even their own MPs to tighten border restrictions as COVID-19 variants continue to spread in Canada.The government said it had taken advice from chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam, who just a day before had said “country-specific targeted measures can only go so far,” and “no border measures are completely 100 per cent effective.” Tam said “layers of protection” are needed, especially given most cases here arise from community transmission, not travellers.In recent weeks, 50 per cent of travellers arriving in Canada who tested positive for COVID-19 came from India, even though those flights were only 20 per cent of all international arrivals. And an alarming number of positive cases also showed up in travellers from Pakistan.

The US has more than enough vaccines for every American, but we are denying countries like India desperately needed support,” Markey said.India is reporting the world’s highest ever single-day COVID case rise. Earth Day is about the health of the planet and everyone and everything on it. The U.S. has more than enough vaccine for every American, but we are denying countries like India desperately needed support. https://t.co/OnwwZCSTNN  Congressman Gregory Meeks, Chairman of House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he was concerned about the situation in India.“Sending my thoughts and support to our friends in India fighting this terrible second wave of the COVID19 pandemic,” he said Congresswoman Haley Stevens said that her thoughts are with the people of India during this devastating COVID-19 surge.“I am praying for the families experiencing unbelievable suffering right now and am urging coordination among the international community to help where possible to stop this horrific outbreak,” Stevens said.Indian American Congressman Ro Khanna, while sharing a tweet from eminent public health expert Ashish K Jha, said, “India is in the throes of a horrendous COVID surge. Horrendous. They are struggling to get more people vaccinated.” “We are sitting on 35-40 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine Americans will never use. Can we please give or lend them to India? Like may be now? It'll help. A lot,” Jha had said.A lethal, fast-paced second wave of the coronavirus pandemic has brought India's health care systems to the verge of collapse and is putting millions of lives and livelihoods at risk, wrote Ramanan Laxminarayan, an economist and epidemiologist, in The New York Times.According to The Wall Street Journal, hospitals in New Delhi and other hard-hit cities have been turning away patients and running low on oxygen, beds and other medical supplies.Several Indian-American groups have started raising funds to urgently airlift medical supplies including oxygen to help India in its fight against coronavirus.“This is truly a humanitarian crisis of apocalyptic proportions which needs immediate response,” wrote Indian-American Mike Sikand, chairman Oceanport Democratic Committee in New Jersey to Senator Robert Menendez, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.“Therefore, I urge you to take whatever steps you can take in your capacity as the Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee to help India in its hour of need. One such step could be sending emergency respiratory supplies to India. Which could use oxygen equipment, ventilators, etc,” he said.“Another step that you could take is to help increase hospital bed capacity in India by providing equipment and financial assistance to set up makeshift hospitals or even sending USS Mercy to help India deal with this crisis,” Sikand said in the letter to Menendez.

The guiding philosophy of back to basics must be an important pillar of strategy in the post-Covid era — Narendra Modi, Prime ministerPointing out that humanity’s ongoing battle against Covid is a timely reminder that the grave threat of climate change has not disappeared, PM Modi said, “The world needs to take large-scale action with global scope in order to avert another human catastrophe.”The PM was the second national leader invited by Biden to speak on the opening day of the two-day virtual climate summit after Chinese President Xi Jinping.Biden had delivered the inaugural address which was then addressed by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was the next leader to speak after PM Modi.The PM along with Biden also announced the joint launch of the India-US climate and clean energy agenda partnership. The issue was discussed between PM Modi and US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry here earlier this month.“Officials of the two countries will pursue ways in which they can deepen their partnership on climate and clean energy in this critical decade,” read a State Department readout of Kerry’s India visit.Pointing out that India has encouraged several global initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and Coalition for Disaster Resilience, PM Modi said the world needed to “go back to basics” in order to save the environment.India’s per capita carbon footprint is 60 per cent lower than the global average because the lifestyle of its people is still rooted in sustainable traditional practices. “I want to emphasise the importance of lifestyle change. The guiding philosophy of back-to-basics must be an important pillar of strategy for the post-Covid era,” he observed.Earlier, Biden outlined an aggressive target which, he said, “will set America on a path of a net-zero emissions economy by no later than 2050”. The White House’s goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent is nearly double the target set by the Obama administration in 2015.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-calls-for-concrete-action-on-climate-change-242911

Indeed, it's too late and there is no way one can resurrect the well-known duo (Sabri Brothers) as the eldest of the two Farid Sabri breathed his last in Jaipur on Wednesday.Suffering from kidney-related ailments, Farid Sabri had been ailing for a while and finally succumbed to pneumonia. Along with his brother Amin Sabri and father Saeed Sabri, he represented and carried forward the unique musical tradition of qawwali, which he rightly felt was a direct communion with the Almighty.As Farid said in an interview, “Qawwal means one who sings Sufiyana Kalaam.” The singer, who sang for a number of films like Pardes (1997) and Yeh Dil Aashiqana (2002), believed that the way qawwali was picturised in cinema might lend it a new colour and form yet nothing could take away its spiritual essence.Hailing from a family singers going back many generations, he believed as much in staying true to one’s roots as keeping the audience taste in mind.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farid-sabri-a-gem-in-galaxy-of-qawwali-242923

23-04-2021||London||Commonwealth report finds racism against Indian WWI martyrs, UK Defence Secy offers apology||Entrenched prejudices, preconceptions and pervasive racism of contemporary imperial attitudes meant that nearly 50,000 Indian soldiers who died fighting for the British Empire during the World War I were not commemorated the same way as other martyrs, finds a new review released.The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), which commemorates the 1.7 million Commonwealth servicemen and women who died during the two World Wars, had created a Special Committee in late-2019 to investigate potential gaps in the commemoration of those who died during and after the World War I.In its review released on Thursday, it found that an estimated 45,000-54,000 casualties, predominantly Indian, East African, West African, Egyptian and Somali personnel, were commemorated unequally.A further 116,000 casualties, potentially as many as 350,000, were not commemorated by name or possibly not commemorated at all.“Underpinning all these decisions… were the entrenched prejudices, preconceptions and pervasive racism of contemporary imperial attitudes,” notes the ‘Review of Historical Inequalities in Commemoration’.UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace made a formal apology on behalf of the government in the House of Commons in relation to the findings.“There can be no doubt prejudice played a part in some of the Commission’s decisions,” the minister told the members of parliament.“On behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the government both of the time and today, I want to apologise for the failures to live up to their founding principles all those years ago and express deep regret that it has taken so long to rectify the situation. Whilst we can’t change the past, we can make amends and take action,” he said.“We are sorry for what happened and will act to right the wrongs of the past,” said Claire Horton, Director General of the CWGC.“Our response today is simple: the events of a century ago were wrong then and are wrong now,” she said, adding that the Commission would now work on actioning the recommendations of the review.During the World War I (1914-18), India, which at that time included Pakistan and Bangladesh under British colonial rule, sent the largest share of Commonwealth soldiers to the war effort at over 1.4 million.Shrabani Basu, historian-author of ‘For King and Another Country: Indian Soldiers on the Western Front, 1914-18’ and one of the committee members behind the review, said the most shocking fact that came to light during the research was that nearly 50,000 Indian soldiers had not been commemorated in Mesopotamia, Palestine and Egypt and the “sheer callousness” with which an Indian Army general had advised the then Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC), later changed to CWGC, saying that Hindu and Muslim soldiers placed “no importance” on their names being recorded on graves and therefore they could just be mentioned in memorial tablets.“From my research, I knew that this was not true at all. They wanted to be remembered,” said Basu.“A Sikh soldier specifically tells his officer that he would understand if he couldn’t be cremated and had to be buried, but he would like his name recorded on a headstone. Another Dogra soldier says that if he is to be buried, his shoes should not be put in his grave. They were particular about how they were treated after their death,” she said.Among the several recommendations set out by the review, Basu highlights an urgent need to find the missing names of the dead and commemorate them.Also, work must be undertaken with local communities in the relevant Commonwealth countries, such as India, to find not only the soldiers but also thousands of others who lost their lives in the war effort including cooks, cleaners and labourers, Basu said.Memorials and museums in their memory, in the individual countries where they came from or in the regions where they fought and died, should also be among some of the actions.The CWGC said that in accepting fully the findings and shortcomings identified in the report – and apologising unreservedly for them – the commission has committed itself to positive, proactive and inclusive action.“This report will enable us to continue and, ultimately, complete our work to commemorate and recognise all those who lost their lives in this catastrophic conflict,” said CWGC Vice-Chairman Lt. Gen. Sir Bill Rollo.“Where names can be found they will be. Where they cannot, the Commission, working directly with the communities affected, will seek alternative means by which their memory can be properly preserved. We will also widen the search to cover both World Wars,” he said.Highlighting the complex situation on the ground, during and after the First World War, the report makes clear that there were several contributing factors.These ranged from the legacy of poorly marked wartime burials and the treatment of some groups by the military authorities, to the actions and demands of colonial administrations and the impact of contemporary imperial attitudes on the then IWGC’s decision-making.“Though there were clearly unique challenges and difficulties faced on some of the battlefields outside of Europe, there is also evidence that many casualties in these regions were denied named commemoration where it was possible, and some were deliberately treated differently,” said Wolfson College Oxford President Sir Tim Hitchens, chair of the Special Committee and CWGC Commissioner.“The implementation of our recommendations would start to put right the wrongs of the past,” he said.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/commonwealth-report-finds-racism-against-indian-wwi-martyrs-uk-defence-secy-offers-apology-242697

23-04-2021||New Delhi||Second coronavirus lineage found in India with immune escape mutation: Scientists||A new lineage of the SARS-CoV-2 virus linked with high infectivity and immune escape mutation has been identified in India, but there is no evidence yet that it is driving the Covid surge either in the country or in West Bengal where it was located first, say scientists.The new lineage called B.1.618 is distinct from the B.1.617, also known as the ‘double mutant’ virus that contains two mutations, E484Q and L245R, and is believed to be behind the powerful second COVID-19 wave sweeping through India.“There is no need for alarm. Standard public health measures are needed,” said Anurag Agrawal, director of the CSIR-Institute of Genomic and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) in New Delhi. He described B.1.618 as a “lineage of interest” and said it is being investigated.B.1.618 is a new lineage of SARS-CoV-2 predominantly found in India and characterised by a distinct set of genetic variants including E484K, a major immune escape variant, Vinod Scaria, a researcher at CSIR-IGIB, explained in a lengthy Twitter thread earlier this week.E484K has been found in variants first identified in South Africa and Brazil, which scientists say is of particular concern as it helps the virus slip past the body’s immune defenses. B.1.168 also carries the D614G mutation in the spike protein and has earlier been linked to increased infectivity.The spike protein enables the virus to infect human cells.The lineage was first isolated in India on October 25, 2020 and most recently on March 29, according to variant tracker ‘outbreak.info’ run by US-based Scripps Research.'More research needed'Sounding a note of caution while also trying to quell panic as India on Thursday reported 3.14 lakh new infections, scientists here stressed on the need for more research and the dogged continuance of Covid appropriate behaviour.“The new lineage is a combination of mutations that impart the properties of immune escape as well as more infectivity at individual mutation levels,” virologist Upasana Ray, from Kolkata’s CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, told PTI.“This lineage is a combination of multiple mutations—deletions of amino acid tyrosine and histidine at positions 145 and 146 of the spike protein, mutation E484K that has been reported earlier to be contributing towards escape from immune response and D614G which was linked to increased infectivity,” she explained.However, the role of the deletion mutations is not well understood as of now, Ray said, adding that the collective role of all these mutations together is not well characterised.The initial sequences in the B.1.618 lineage were found in West Bengal. However, members of this lineage are also found in other parts of the world but do not have the full complement of variants as found in India.“The proportions of B.1.618 have been growing significantly in the recent months in the state of West Bengal, India. And along with B.1.617 forms a major lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in the state of West Bengal,” Scaria said in the Twitter thread.“There are many unknowns for this lineage at this moment including its capability to cause reinfections as well as vaccine breakthrough infections. Additional experimental data is also required to assess the efficacy of vaccines against this variant,” he said.At the moment, Scaria stressed, there is no conclusive evidence that the lineage is behind the epidemic in West Bengal. More focused epidemiological investigations will address these questions, he said.“Although many samples from West Bengal belongs to the lineage B.1.618, to connect this lineage with the rise in the cases of infections in West Bengal, more detailed sampling and investigation is required,” Ray added.West Bengal on Wednesday registered its highest single-day spike of 10,784 new COVID-19 cases, which took the tally in the state to 6,88,956, the health department said. The death toll also rose to 10,710 after 58 fresh fatalities were reported.Samiran Panda, head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said mutations are known to happen while viruses proliferate in number. Some of these mutants offer survival advantage to the virus while others don’t.“What is important to understand from the public health perspective is that the new mutants, as well as the old circulating strains, get transmitted by the same route of transmission,” Panda told PTI.“Therefore, time tested proven prevention strategies should be strictly adhered to such as correct and consistent use of face mask, maintaining hand hygiene, maintaining physical distancing, and avoidance of mass gatherings should be adhered to,” he added.According to Panda, the transmission of these mutants will also be interrupted efficiently if these prevention measures are followed appropriately by 80 per cent or more of the people in the community.Making a distinction between lineages, strains, and variants, Agrawal said, “Technically there is only one strain here—nCOV19 or SARS CoV-2. Lineage is in context of ancestry from the original. Variant is a broad way of saying the same thing.” Ray noted that a virus mutates continuously. Technically, when that happens, the changed form, with respect to the parent form, is called a mutant.“Based on the number and characteristics of the mutations, terms like lineages, variants and strains are used. We use the term strain when a variant displays distinct physical properties or behaves differently than the parent form,” Ray said.A strain can also be described as a variant that became dominant in the population, she added.Agarwal had earlier told PTI that in India, different areas have different variants that are dominant.For example, he said, in Punjab and surrounding areas, the B.1.1.7 UK variant is common. In Maharashtra and Gujarat, the B.1.167 variant is dominant.Similarly, in southern India, the N440K mutation is more dominant, although it does not have a variant name yet.“All variants are starting to be seen across India also. The most common strains are the normal ones. Only in few states, variants are dominant and that too different in different parts,” Agrawal said.

People will die. We have no oxygen. We are now asking doctors to discharge those who can be discharged. We have two hours supply left. We feel helpless. As doctors we have to save lives and today we can’t even give oxygen,” Sangar said, with majority hospitals in the capital saying although they’ve received some supplies those would not last beyond tonight.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a high level meeting to review the oxygen supply across the country and discuss ways and means to boost its availability.The officials briefed him on the efforts undertaken in the last few weeks to improve the supply of oxygen.PM Modi spoke about the need to work rapidly on multiple aspects: increasing production of oxygen, increasing the speed of distribution and using innovative ways to provide oxygen support to health facilities.The PM was informed that an elaborate exercise is being done in coordination with the states to identify their demand for oxygen and ensure adequate supply accordingly.PM was also briefed on how oxygen supply to states is steadily increasing.Against the present demand from 20 states of 6,785 MT a day of Liquid Medical Oxygen, Government of India has from April 21, allocated 6,822 MT a day to these states.It was noted that in the last few days, availability of Liquid Medical Oxygen has been increased by about 3,300 MT a day with contributions from private and public steel plants, industries, oxygen manufacturers as well as through prohibition of supply of oxygen for non-essential industries.Officers informed the PM that they are working together with the states to operationalize the sanctioned PSA oxygen plants as soon as possible.The PM directed the officials to ensure that oxygen supply to various states happen in a smooth, unhindered manner.He spoke about the need to fix responsibility with the local administration in cases of obstruction.He also asked ministries to explore various innovative ways to increase production and supply of oxygen.Various measures are being undertaken to rapidly increase the availability of cyrogenic tankers through conversion of nitrogen and argon tankers, import and airlifting of tankers as well as manufacturing them.PM stressed on the need to ensure faster transportation of oxygen to the states. It was discussed that Railways is being used for rapid and non-stop long distance transport of tankers.First rake has reached from Mumbai to Vizag to transport 105 MT of LMO. Similarly, empty oxygen tankers are also being air-lifted to oxygen suppliers to reduce one way journey time in oxygen supply.Representatives from the medical community also spoke about the need for judicious use of oxygen and how an audit in some states has decreased oxygen demand without affecting the condition of patients.PM also stressed that the states should come down heavily on hoarding.The meeting was attended by Cabinet Secretary, Principal Secretary to PM, Home Secretary, Health Secretary and Officials from Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Minstry of Road Transport, Pharmaceuticals, NITI Aayog.The officials said the challenge was of supply of oxygen for which Home Ministry today issued orders for unhindered movement.Meantime, hospitals continued to gasp for supplies.Oxygen storage at Gangaram Hospital as of 10 am on April 22 was enough to last a say.Gangaram chairman DS Rana said Indian Oxygen IOL at 6 am today supplied 2,000 cubic metres and INOX supplied 4,800 cubic metres.“Earlier in storage tanks 2,000 cubic metres is there. The present storage of 8,800 cubic metres will last till tomorrow 10 am,” Rana said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/patients-will-die-deplorable-condition-delhi-hospitals-losing-hope-on-oxygen-pm-holds-meet-242684
23-04-2021||New Delhi||Registration for COVID vaccination on CoWIN for those above 18 to begin from April 28||Registration for vaccination against COVID-19 for all those aged above 18 will begin on the CoWIN platform and Aarogya Setu app from April 28, officials said on Thursday.          The inoculation process and documents to be submitted to get the jab remains the same.The Central government had announced that the vaccination for those above 18 years will begin across the country from May 1 as part of the third phase of the inoculation drive.Certain modifications, including the age criteria and a few other features, have been done and the CoWIN platform is ready to meet the rising demand as is expected once the vaccination for all is opened up, an official said.     From May 1, the present system of private COVID-19 vaccination centres receiving doses from the government and charging up to Rs 250 per dose will cease to exist and private hospitals will procure directly from vaccine manufacturers.According to the Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy, COVID-19 vaccination will continue to be free for eligible population groups comprising healthcare workers, frontline workers and people above 45 years of age in government vaccination centres, which receive doses from the Government of India.Vaccine manufacturers would make an advance declaration of the price for 50 per cent supply that would be available to state governments in the open market before May 1.       Based on this price, states, private hospitals, industrial establishments may procure vaccine doses from manufacturers.       Private hospitals would have to procure their supplies of COVID-19 vaccine exclusively from the 50 per cent supply earmarked for other than the Government of India channel.“While the Centre has liberalised the vaccination policy, it does not mean that vaccines will be sold in pharmacists or chemist shops in the open market,” Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan had clarified on Wednesday.The price charged for vaccination by private hospitals would be monitored, he said.“The present dispensation where private COVID vaccination centres receive doses from the government and can charge up to Rs 250 per dose will cease to exist,” the Union Health Ministry said.Vaccine manufacturers would supply 50 per cent of their monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) released doses to the Government of India and would be free to supply the remaining 50 per cent doses to state governments and in the open market.  For Government of India vaccination centres, the eligible population would be the same, which exists today, that is healthcare workers (HCWs), frontline workers (FLWs) and population above 45 years of age.               For other than the Government of India channel, the eligibility would be all adult citizens of the country, the document said.Vaccination against COVID-19 will continue to be free for eligible population groups in all those government COVID vaccination centres which receive vaccine doses from the Central government.         All vaccination (through Government of India vaccination centres and other than the Government of India channel) will be part of the National Vaccination Programme, will follow all existing guidelines, will be captured on the CoWIN platform along with the stocks and price per vaccination applicable in all vaccination centres, will comply with Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) management and reporting, digital vaccination certificate and all other prescribed norms.   The division of vaccine supply, which would mean 50 per cent to the Government of India and 50 per cent to other than the Government of India channel would be applicable uniformly across for all vaccines manufactured in the country. However, the fully ready to use imported vaccine would be allowed to be utilised entirely in the other than Government of India channel, it said. The Centre from its share will allocate vaccines to states and Union Territories based on the criteria of performance (speed of administration, average consumption), extent of infections (number of active COVID-19 cases), the document stated.Second dose of all existing priority groups i.e. HCWs, FLWs and people aged above 45, wherever it has become due, would be given priority, for which a specific and focused strategy would be communicated to all stakeholders.               This policy would come into effect from May 1 and would be reviewed from time-to-time. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/registration-for-covid-vaccination-on-cowin-for-those-above-18-to-begin-from-april-28-242678

23-04-2021||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court takes suo motu notice of Covid situation, issues notice to Centre||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 22The Supreme Court on Thursday took suo motu cognisance of issues relating to Covid management and issued notice to the Centre on issues such as supply of oxygen and essential drugs, method of vaccination and judicial power to impose lockdowns.A Bench led by CJI SA Bobde said it intended to transfer to itself some of the issues pending in various high courts.Noting that high courts of Delhi, Bombay, Sikkim, Madhya Pradesh, Calcutta and Allahabad were dealing with issues related to Covid, the top court asked the Centre to present a national plan to face the health crisis."They are exercising jurisdiction in best interest. But it is creating confusion and diversion of resources," it said, adding "We are almost in a national emergency."Appointing senior advocate Harish Salve as amicus curiae to assist it, the Bench posted the matter for Friday.The top court said it broadly wanted to take up four issues - supply of oxygen, supply of essential drugs, method and manner of vaccination and the power to declare lockdown."We want the power to clear lockdown to be with states and it should not be a judicial decision," the CJI said while issuing notice to the Centre.The development comes a day after the Delhi High Court pulled up the Centre and Delhi Government over lack of adequate supply of oxygen to hospitals in the national capital.While asking the government to ensure supply of oxygen to hospitals "forthwith", the high court had posted the matter for Thursday."Do we respond to high courts now or we respond here?" Solicitor General Tushar Mehta sought to know from the Bench."We will issue notice to the Centre and then we will issue notice to high courts...eventually we will bring some issues here," the CJI said.Mehta said, "In the meanwhile, we will inform the high courts that you (SC) have taken suo motu cognisance."The Bench told Mehta that it didn't intend to supersede any order of high courts for now.In a related development, the Centre and Vedanta moved the top court seeking permission to reopen the company's Tamil Nadu plant - shut down since 2018 over alleged violation of environmental norms - only for the purpose of producing and supplying of medical oxygen to Covid patients.On behalf of Vedanta, Salve sought permission to reopen the company's Tuticorin plant, saying it could produce 1,000 tonnes of oxygen there every day and it was ready to supply all 1,000 tonnes free of cost.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-takes-suo-motu-notice-of-covid-situation-issues-notice-to-centre-242636
