For now things will continue as it is."The state government had last week imposed night and weekend curfew amid intense speculation that it may go for lockdown like restrictions in Bengaluru and few other places, with former Chief Minister and JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy too demanding for it.State Congress President D K Shivakumar had subsequently said it seemed that the government, which had planned to impose lockdown last week, changed it, after Prime Minister Nardendra Modi's address to the nation, during which he requested states to use it as a last resort. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ktaka-cabinet-likely-to-decide-on-lockdown-like-curbs-on-all-days-of-the-week-on-monday-244068

25-04-2021||Baharampur (WB)||People interested in ‘COVID ki baat’, and not ‘Mann ki baat’, says Mamata||Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday claimed that people are no longer interested in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Maan ki baat’ programme, and they wanted to hear ‘COVID ki baat’(COVID- related talks) instead as the pandemic has left lakhs gasping for breath, amid shortage of vaccines and oxygen cylinders.Modi, during his monthly radio broadcast ‘Mann ki baat’ earlier in the day, said that the COVID-19 “storm” has shaken the country, and urged people to get vaccinated.Banerjee, during a meeting with party workers at an auditorium in Murshidabad district, claimed that Modi and Union Minister Amit Shah were busy “planning ways to capture Bengal, when they should have been taking appropriate measures” to combat the second wave of the pandemic.“Who is interested in your ‘Mann Ki Baat’, people now want to hear ‘COVID ki baat’. If there is one infected person in a crowd of 1,000, he can contaminate the rest. Two lakh CAPF personnel came from states like UP, Delhi and Rajasthan and many of them might have been carriers of the virus without their knowledge as no RT PCR tests was conducted by the EC.”“Around one lakh BJP cadres from other states, including ministers from saffron party-ruled states, came to Bengal for campaigning and to rig votes. They put up in hotels and guest houses, and must have contributed to the spike in COVID-19 cases in Bengal,” she claimed.Cautioning voters against possible visit of central forces accompanied by BJP men at their residences for “intimidation”, Banerjee said, “Please ask them to maintain distance as you don’t know if anyone of them is carrying the virus. Mothers and sisters, tell them we are not allowing outsiders inside the house”.Iterating her charge that some EC special observers have planned to take TMC leaders into “preventive custody” ahead of the elections, Banerjee said, “That would be illegal detention. None should go to police stations on getting such calls and sit tight till the voting exercise gets over. No one can take your right to exercise franchise”.The CM claimed on Saturday that she has come to know from WhatsApp chats between EC observers and top officials, including police superintendents and district magistrates, that intructions have been given for detainment of TMC workers ahead of the voting exercise.Continuing her tirade against the poll panel, she said, “Police superintendents and district magistrates have been changed arbitrarily at the last minute to help the BJP. “We will move the Supreme Court to ensure polls in future are conducted in a more democratic manner. I have already spoken to several senior lawyers.”         Banerjee, during her addresss, asked those present at the venue to leave the doors of the auditorium ajar for better air circulation, and said that she was “forced” to organise such meetings in enclosed spaces as EC diktats left her with no other option. “We had asked the poll panel to club the last few phases, but it did not pay heed. I know the BJP has made specific plans to rig the election in every phase. In the sixth phase, BJP-sheltered goons from other areas accompanied central forces to residences of our workers in Naihati, Bhatpara, Jagaddal in North 24 Parganas. In the next phase, they are trying to terrorise our people in Paschim Bardhaman”.       Wondering “why the police fall silent when EC takes charge during polls,” she asked all officers to perform their job without any biasness.Claiming that “cash flow from BJP camps to buy votes was comparable to water flowing from fire brigade hose pipe”, the TMC boss iterated that the saffron party-led central government should have instead borne the cost of the COVID-19 vaccines being provided to people.The CM further said that her government has set up 100 COVID-19 treatment units in state-aided and private hospitals across Bengal over the past one week. “If you (BJP leaders) have such great love for Bengal, why are you not sending us more vaccines? Why is that truckloads of vaccines are being transported to Gujarat? I have nothing against Gujarat, but what about other states? You are discriminating against Bengal and giving lectures at election meetings,” she said.She said Bengal, with a population of around 10 crore, has received three lakh vials so far, which could cater to just about 1.5 lakh people, as each of them need two doses. “We have, however, managed to vaccinate one crore people and have sought another one crore (from the Centre). We will provide vaccines for free from May 5 to anyone who is 18 years of age or above,” Banerjee added. ---  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/people-interested-in-covid-ki-baat-and-not-mann-ki-baat-says-mamata-244054
25-04-2021||New Delhi||Modi govt allowing vaccine makers to make profit of Rs 1.11 lakh crore: Congress||Terming the new anti-COVID vaccine policy “discriminatory and insensitive”, the Congress on Sunday accused the government of allowing vaccine makers to profiteer to the tune of Rs 1.11 lakh crore.Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged that the government has abdicated its responsibility of providing free vaccines to the poor and the youth of the country.“How can such brazen vaccine profiteering be permitted? Why is the Modi government complicit in this profiteering in the times of pandemic? Prime Minister Narendra Modi must answer,” he told reporters at a virtual press conference.He said vaccine development and mass immunisation are neither events nor PR exercises, but are important milestones in the service of people and inoculation being an important public service can never be a business opportunity for profiteering at the cost of people.The Congress leader claimed that the Modi government has introduced “the most discriminatory and insensitive vaccination policy” in the entire world.“The Modi government is guilty of permitting brazen profiteering of vaccination. The Modi government is also guilty of abdicating its responsibility and abandoning the young of India between the age group of 18 and 45 years,” he alleged.Covishield manufactured by the Serum Institute of India will be given at Rs 400 per dose to states and Rs 600 per dose to private hospitals, while Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin will cost Rs 600 per dose for the states and Rs 1,200 per dose for private hospitals.Going by the prices offered by the vaccine makers, Surjewala claimed that the SII and Bharat Biotech would make Rs 35,350 crore and Rs 75,750 crore profit, respectively.He came to the conclusion after assuming that 50 per cent of 101 crore people between 18 and 45 years are served by SII and Bharat Biotech, and estimating that half of them would buy their own vaccines and another half would be served by states.“The population below 45 years of age is 101 crore. To vaccinate them, we need 202 crore doses and the cost of these will have to be borne by the states or the individuals themselves,” he said.“Based on this and assuming that states will provide 50 percent vaccination and individuals will bear 50 per cent of vaccination cost, the profit of the two vaccine manufacturers—Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech—will be Rs 1,11,100 crore,” he said.

I request my Congress colleagues to leave all political work—just provide all help and ease the pain of our countrymen,” he added.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said “hiding data” and not sharing the total number of infections and deaths is doing a disservice to the nation.He said the data, howsoever serious it may be, makes us aware and alert, and urged for a “course correction”.“The Modi government has bungled up. If Modi government has abandoned its people and abdicated its duty, please do course correction and let us work together,” he told reporters. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/deaths-being-under-reported-alleges-rahul-gandhi-244052

This would have saved states’ budget from getting disturbed,” he said.Meanwhile, Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma said that starting vaccination from May 1 for those above 18 will depend on the availability of shots.He said when state government officials spoke to the Serum Institute of India, which manufactures Covishield, they were told that vaccine is not available.The Centre had last week announced to vaccinate youths above 18 years of age starting May 1.

Vaccination in India has been opened for all above 18 years of age from May 1.“A lot of patients messaging me asking if it’s safe/effective to take the vaccine during their period.

We have asked the state government to keep their trucks ready,” Sharma said.Officials said the Delhi government in its letter to the Railways has asked it to load liquid medical oxygen from nine locations.“These have been examined and the feasibility analysed after which the state government was informed that oxygen can be transported from seven out of these nine locations. The other two sites were not feasible due to technical reasons.“They were also requested to arrange tankers and place indent at stations. The Assistant Divisional Railway Manager, Delhi is being nominated as nodal officer for the purpose,” an official said.Delhi reported a staggering 348 deaths due to COVID-19 as hospitals in the national capital continued to grapple with a severe shortage of medical oxygen. As many as 24,331 fresh cases were reported in the last 24 hours.Asked if the Railways will cut down on its services due to the surge in COVID-19 infections, Sharma said trains will keep running.“Despite COVID, trains will continue to run. Wherever there is demand, we are increasing services. We can rationalise service where demand is less. Over 70 per cent of the trains are currently in operation,” he said.

25-04-2021||Kolkata||Bengal elections: 34 constituencies to go to polls in seventh phase on Monday||Over 86 lakh voters in West Bengal will decide the political fate of 284 candidates on Monday, when 34 assembly constituencies, including Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s home turf Bhabanipur, go to polls in the seventh phase, amid a raging second wave of COVID-19.Security measures have been heightened in view of the violence in the previous phases, particularly the death of five people in Cooch Behar in the fourth round of polling on April 10, an Election Commission official said.The poll panel has decided to deploy at least 796 companies of central forces in the seventh phase to ensure free and fair voting, he said.It will also put in place measures to ensure strict adherence to COVID-19 protocols during the voting process, the official said.West Bengal on Saturday registered its highest-single- day spike of 14,281 coronavirus cases, which took the tally to 7,28,061, and at least 59 more people succumbed to the infection, pushing the toll to 10,884.Voting will be held at 12,068 polling stations spread over nine assembly constituencies each in Murshidabad and Paschim Bardhaman districts, six each in Dakshin Dinajpur and Malda and four in Kolkata, the official said.All eyes will be on the Bhabanipur constituency, of which the TMC supremo is the sitting MLA and a resident.Banerjee, however, has opted for Nandigram to contest the elections this time and reposed faith in veteran politician and state power minister Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay to make a hat-trick of wins for the party from Bhabanipur.Chattopadhyay is pitted against a seasoned actor but a greenhorn in electoral politics, Rudranil Ghosh, who left the ruling party a few months ago to join the BJP.State minister Firhad Hakim is also seeking re- election for a third consecutive term from the Kolkata Port constituency, while the BJP fielded Lt General (Retired) Subrata Saha from the Rashbehari seat in the metropolis.Campaigning for the seventh phase has been a low-key affair, following curbs imposed by the EC in the wake of the second wave of COVID-19 cases in the state.Following the surge in coronavirus cases across the country, the EC has banned roadshows and vehicle rallies in the state and noted that the COVID safety norms were being flouted in West Bengal during campaigning.It also disallowed any public meeting with more than 500 people.The Election Commission has curtailed daily campaign hours and extended the “silence period” from 48 hours to 72 in each of the remaining three phases of the assembly polls in view of the Cooch Behar violence and the rising COVID-19 cases.The TMC chief and her nephew Abhishek Banerjee, who is the party MP, cancelled all their scheduled rallies and held them on the virtual platform as did Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 23.Polling for two assembly seats in Samserganj and Jangipur in Murshidabad district has been declared void following the deaths of two candidates there.The Election Commission has fixed May 16 for the polling in these two seats.

If they had a proper fire- fighting mechanism, such a big tragedy would not have occurred,” the official said.He said the police are waiting for the electric audit and fire audit reports and more arrests may happen after that.There were 83 patients in the hospital, 17 of them in the ICU when the fire broke out after a blast in the AC unit shortly after 3 am. It was extinguished at 5.20 am, an official earlier said.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had directed the local administration to conduct a probe into the cause of the blaze and also announced an assistance of Rs 5 lakh to the families of each deceased. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fire-tragedy-virar-hospitals-ceo-cao-arrested-244033
25-04-2021||New Delhi||Recurrence of COVID in March could be due to lack of antibodies in seropositive people: CSIR survey||The recurrence of coronavirus outbreak in March could have been due to lack of “meaningful antibodies” in seropositive people after a peak in September last year, suggests a survey by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).The CSIR conducted a sero-survey on 10,427 people comprising the staff members of its 40 laboratories, including contractual employees, and their family members from 17 states and two union territories.In 10,427 people, the average sero-positivity was 10.14 per cent.The survey suggested that the neutralising antibodies declined significantly after 5-6 months, making people prone to reinfections.The coronavirus cases in the country peaked in September 2020 and there was a nationwide decline of new cases starting in October, said Shantanu Sengupta, one of the lead authors of the paper.“Our data shows that while anti-NC (nucleocapsid) antibodies provide long-lasting evidence of viral exposure or infection, about 20 per cent of seropositive individuals lack meaningful neutralisation activity after 5-6 months.”“Using more stringent measures (more than 30 per cent inhibition of surrogate receptor-spike protein binding), the loss of neutralisation may be even higher. We speculate that this may be related to recurrence of outbreaks in March 2021 after the peak in September 2020,” the paper said.India is currently witnessing a massive surge in infections with logging a daily case count of over 3,00,000 on four consecutive days.According to the paper, the aggregate sero-positivity of 10.14 per cent in its multi-centre study suggests India had a large pool of recovered immune subjects by September 2020, especially amongst its high contact workers and people using public transport, leading to a decline in new infections.“However, the duration of such immunity may not be sufficient to prevent future outbreaks, even in highly affected regions,” the paper said.States like Maharashtra have witnessed an explosion of cases since March.“The present study, which recruited subjects from 24 cities in India, provides an important and timely snapshot of the spread of SARS CoV2 pandemic across India shortly before the peak of new cases. It confirms that by September 2020, a large pool of recovered Indians with at least partial immunity existed,” the paper said.Between its study and the other national sero-survey at the same time, more than a hundred million Indians were likely to belong to this category, it estimated.The study said the fraction of such recovered people was more than double amongst those performing high-contact jobs and using public transport.Thus, in combination with a strong emphasis on masking and distancing, new cases started declining soon after this sero-survey which started in June. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/recurrence-of-covid-in-march-could-be-due-to-lack-of-antibodies-in-seropositive-people-csir-survey-244030

The major ports will start implementing the direction from today onwards,” a senior government official said.In case, the vessel is carrying other cargo/containers in addition to the said oxygen-related cargo, waiver of charges on a pro-rata basis, considering the overall cargo or containers handled at the port, should be provided for oxygen-related cargo to such vessels, the statement said.The Ports Ministry will monitor the details of such vessels, cargo and time taken in the port from the time vessel entered in the port limits to exit of cargo from port gate.The government on Saturday had waived customs duty on the import of COVID vaccines as well as medical-grade oxygen and related equipment.India is struggling with a second wave of the pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days, and hospitals in several states reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds.

25-04-2021||New Delhi||ISRO to launch data relay satellite to track Gaganyaan||The Indian Space Research Organisation will launch a data relay satellite that will help maintain contact with the Gagangyaan mission throughout after the launch, sources said.The satellite will be launched before the final leg of the Gaganyaan mission, which will send astronauts to the Lower Earth Orbit (LEO). The first leg—the unmanned mission—is to be launched in December.“We’re planning to launch our own satellite, which will act as a data relay satellite before going for the first human space flight,” the sources said.The Rs 800-crore project has been approved and work has been going on, they added.Satellites in orbit cannot pass along their information to the ground stations on Earth if the satellite does not have a clear view of the ground station. A data relay satellite serves as a way to pass along the satellite’s information.The NASA, with a robust human space mission programme, also has its own data relay satellite.Its Tracking and Data Relay Satellite allows it to have global coverage of all the satellites round the clock without having to build extra ground stations on Earth.The ISRO uses several ground stations spread across the globe—Mauritius, Brunei and Biak, Indonesia.Last month, ISRO Chairperson K Sivan had said the space agency was also in talks with the Australian counterpart to have a ground station at the Coco islands for the Gaganyaan mission.However, there are blind spots, due to which there is a possibility of not receiving signals, sources added. The data relay satellite will help address the issues.Earlier this month, the ISRO signed an agreement with French space agency CNES for cooperation for the Gaganyaan, a move that will enable training of Indian flight physicians in French space agency’s facilities.Under this agreement, CNES-developed French equipment, tested and still operating aboard the International Space Station, will be made available to Indian crews.The CNES will also be supplying fireproof carry bags made in France to shield equipment from shocks and radiation, it said.Last month, four prospective astronauts also returned to India after spending nearly a year in Russia.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/isro-to-launch-data-relay-satellite-to-track-gaganyaan-244018

He was 66.A 1977-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer of the Bihar cadre, Chaudhary served for nearly two decades in the Intelligence Bureau (IB) where he headed the Jammu and Kashmir desk.In his early service days, he served in various positions in his cadre state and also had a stint with the Central Industrial Security Force, where he headed its airport security unit.In December 2012, he was appointed Director-General of the SSB and retired from service on April 30, 2014.The around 90,000-personnel-strong force paramilitary force guards the Indian borders with Nepal and Bhutan.The SSB condoled his death on social media, saying it was “saddened by the untimely demise of Chaudhary”.“His contribution to the nation and SSB cannot be forgotten,” it tweeted. “SSB stands by his family in this period of grief and sorrow and prays to the almighty that the departed soul may rest in peace.”               Chaudhary was active on Twitter and he used to comment on subjects of security, strategy, and law and order.

One more body was recovered on Sunday and a rescue operation is under way, the district disaster management office here said.Chamoli District Magistrate Swati S Bhadauriya and Superintendent of Police Yashwant Singh have been at the spot since Saturday to monitor the rescue operations.Uttarakhand police chief Ashok Kumar said a total of 430 BRO workers were at the road construction site when the avalanche occurred on Friday.Sumna, where the avalanche occurred, is approximately 25 km from Malari village and located near the confluence of the Girthigad and the Kiogad, two streams that originate from the Dhauli Ganga river, which witnessed a calamitous avalanche in February, killing 80 people and leaving 126 missing.A part of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off in Chamoli on February 7, leading to massive floods, recalling a 2019 study that warned about the dangers of climate change and said Himalayan glaciers have been melting twice as fast since the start of this century.The glacier collapse at Joshimath led to a massive flood in the Alaknanda river system and caused large-scale devastation in the upper reaches of the ecologically fragile Himalayas.In June 2019, a study spanning 40 years of satellite observations across India, China, Nepal and Bhutan, indicated that climate change is eating the Himalayas’ glaciers.The study, published in the journal Science Advances, shows that glaciers have been losing the equivalent of more than a vertical foot and half of the ice each year since 2000 -- double the amount of melting that took place from 1975 to 2000.

We have already procured new equipment to expand the capacity of our existing labs and have hired and trained more technical staff. These COVID warriors along with our partners on the ground are responding at a war footing and remain committed to address the diagnostic needs of people," he said.Anand acknowledged that the tremendous surge in COVID cases has amplified the caseload on the diagnostic facilities by manifold."It's worth noting that while the rapidly increasing caseload is unprecedented, it is difficult to predict the place, time, and scale of a surge. As a response, SRL is working round-the-clock to respond to the skyrocketing testing needs," he said, adding that the diagnostic facilities were responding to a three-fold rise in testing compared to February.SRL has a presence across the country with over 9,000 collection points along with multiple accredited laboratories.Dr Lal PathLabs said it is committed to serve the communities across the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic."Presently, the demand for RT PCR test has gone up exponentially and so has our testing. We have RT PCR labs at 13 locations and are in the process of adding 5 new locations. Subject to timely approvals, availability of manpower, machines etc, we estimate that these new locations will start testing in another 3-4 weeks," the company said in a statement.In addition, the company is continuing to leverage its current infrastructure to best manage operations amid rising COVID-19 test demand, it added.The diagnostic chain is also trying to enhance further capacity in existing locations as well, the Gurgaon-based firm said.Navi Mumbai-based Thyrocare Technologies Chairman and Managing Director A Velumani said that with COVID-19 cases increasing, workers have started to go back to their native places thus affecting the home collection activity."Migrant workers were mostly swab collection technicians, and 50 per cent of them have gone back in the last ten days, both from Delhi and Mumbai and hence the home collection has come to stand still when cases are alarmingly rising. New recruits are not convinced due to the risk involved, even if we are willing to pay more. Stalemate," he noted.The company is, however, looking to scale up its operations in the coming months."We have scaled up 5,000 more tests in March and 5,000 more in April and we will be able to scale up at this rate for another six months," Velumani noted.Over the past month, the COVID-19 outbreak in India has exploded.A record single-day rise of 3,49,691 coronavirus cases pushed India's tally of infection to 1,69,60,172, while active cases crossed the 26-lakh mark, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Sunday.The death toll rose to 1,92,311 with a record 2,767 more fatalities in a day, the data updated at 8 am showed.Registering a steady increase, the active cases have increased to 26,82,751 comprising 15.82 per cent of the total infections, while the national COVID-19 recovery rate has further dropped to 83.05 per cent.India's COVID-19 tally had crossed the 20-lakh mark on August 7, 30 lakh on August 23 last year, 40 lakh on September 5 and 50 lakh on September 16. It went past 60 lakh on September 28, 70 lakh on October 11, crossed 80 lakh on October 29, 90 lakh on November 20 and surpassed the one-crore mark on December 19.India crossed the grim milestone of a total of 1.50 crore COVID-19 cases on April 19 this year.

25-04-2021||New Delhi||Delhi’s LNJP Hospital receives oxygen refill; Pentamed seeks urgent supply||Amid an acute oxygen crisis in the national capital, Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital here received a supply of the life-saving gas in a cryogenic tanker around 10 am on Sunday, officials said.It came as a huge relief for the hospital which was running on its backup stock of oxygen.However, the situation is grim for hospitals like Pentamed in Model Town that had sent an SOS on Twitter around 11.30 am saying oxygen stock was left for 30 minutes only.The hospital officials claimed they didn’t get any refill even after sending an SOS on oxygen shortage last night also. There are around 50 patients in the hospital and most of them are on oxygen support.LNJP Hospital’s Medical Director Dr Suresh Kumar said, “We had exhausted our oxygen stock and were using the backup which would have lasted for two hours only.”   AAP MLA Raghav Chaddha, who is also the chairman of LNJP Hospital’s Rogi Kalyan Samiti, had earlier tweeted about the cryogenic tanker on its way to refill oxygen stock in the hospital.“Within the next 30 minutes, LNJP will receive liquid oxygen supply via cryogenic tanker. The tanker is on its way,” he tweeted around 9.55 am on Sunday.Chaddha had also helped Sir Ganga Ram Hospital get one metric tonne of oxygen around 12.20 am. The hospital has also received five metric tonnes of oxygen in the early hours of Sunday.The Delhi High Court on Saturday asked the Centre and the Delhi government to coordinate on the issue of making medical oxygen available to hospitals treating COVID-19 patients, observing that citizens cannot be left to die.The court also made it clear that the efforts which Delhi government has to make in this regard cannot be trivialised and they should not leave it entirely to the central government.While some hospitals have managed to make short-term arrangements, there is no immediate end to the crisis in sight.                 Metro Hospital, in Gurgaon’s Palam Vihar, which claims to be in its “last leg of medical oxygen”, had made an urgent appeal for help to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and other ministers.“INOX commitment to replenish liquid medical oxygen remain unfulfilled . Only 1.5 hours to go. Please help us urgently,” the hospital tweeted around 10.41 am tagging the Prime Minister Office, PM Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, Haryana chief minister Mahonar Lal Khattar, Railway Minister PiyushGoyal, Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij among others.Delhi recorded the highest single-day rise in its COVID-19 deaths with 357 more people succumbing to the viral disease on Saturday as well as over 24,000 fresh cases.The city has reported nearly 2,500 deaths due to the deadly virus in a 12-day period.

25-04-2021||Jhansi (Uttar Pradesh)||Mistaken identity: 'Dead' woman comes alive||In a bizarre situation, a 65-year-old woman, who had been declared dead due to Covid by Jhansi medical college authorities, was found alive a day later.According to reports, the woman Rajkumari Gupta, 65, was declared dead on Friday by the hospital authorities due to Covid.As per reports, Rajkumari had been admitted to the hospital on April 23 and 'died' on the same day. She was having a sore throat, fever and cough with breathing problems.The matter came to light on Saturday after some people contacted her relatives at her house.Later, a video clip also went viral in which Rajkumari was seen standing on the balcony of her house saying that she had recovered and was quite fit.Dr Narendra Singh Sengar, the principal of the Jhansi medical college, said that it was a matter of mistaken identity as a woman of a similar name had died of Covid on late Thursday night."The family members of the deceased entered the hospital's ICU ward and started creating a ruckus. They even manhandled the medical staff present at that time for which an FIR had been lodged. During this scuffle, the files got mingled which created this confusion", he said.Meanwhile, six people died due to Covid while 834 new patients were reported in the district on Saturday.Those who succumbed, include three women aged 69, 67, 45, years and three men aged 56, 59, 65 years. All of them were admitted to different hospitals with Covid like symptoms.--IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mistaken-identity-dead-woman-comes-alive-243981
25-04-2021||Islamabad||Pakistan offers relief materials to India to help fight COVID-19||Pakistan has offered to provide relief support, including ventilators, to India to help the country fight the deadly wave of COVID-19 and said the two countries can explore possible ways of further cooperation to mitigate the challenges posed by the pandemic.The Foreign Office in a statement late Saturday night said Pakistan was ready to send specific items quickly once the modalities were worked out.“As a gesture of solidarity with the people of India in the wake of the current wave of COVID-19, Pakistan has offered to provide relief support to India including ventilators, Bi PAP, digital X ray machines, PPEs and related items,” according to the statement.It said that the authorities concerned of Pakistan and India can work out modalities for quick delivery of the relief items. “They (authorities) can also explore possible ways of further cooperation to mitigate the challenges posed by the pandemic,” it said.The offer was made after Prime Minister Imran Khan expressed solidarity with the people of India battling the deadly wave of the pandemic, saying “we must fight this global challenge confronting humanity together”.In a tweet, Khan said: “Our prayers for a speedy recovery go to all those suffering from the pandemic in our neighbourhood and the world”.“I want to express our solidarity with the people of India as they battle a dangerous wave of COVID-19. “We must fight this global challenge confronting humanity together,” he said on Twitter.Several Pakistanis, including political leaders, sports celebrities, took to twitter to offer prayers and good wishes for the people of India.Hashtags like #pakistanstandwithindia in support of India were trending and twitteratis poured in their ideas for Pakistan and India to come together in the difficult times. Former cricketer Shoaib Akhtar said that it was time to support each other.“India is really struggling with COVID-19. Global support needed. Health care system is crashing. It's a Pandemic, we are all in it together. Must become each other's support,” said the fast bowler known as the Rawalpindi Express. The tweets from the Pakistani leaders came amidst some signs of rapprochement in the relations between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue.India's decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 angered Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad. Pakistan also snapped all air and land links with India and suspended trade and railway services.The militaries of the two countries, in a surprise announcement on February 25, said that they have agreed to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir and other sectors.

25-04-2021||Bhubaneswar||Odisha despatches over 500 MT oxygen to needy states: Police||Odisha has despatched at least 29 tankers carrying about 510 MT of medical oxygen under police escort to Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and other needy states in the last 48 hours, an official said.This apart, 15 more tankers are leaving from Dhenkanal, Rourkela and Angul by Saturday, an official statement released by Odisha Police said, adding that the state police has formed a dedicated corridor for speedy movement so as to serve thousands of needy patients in various states without delay.The Special Cell formed under ADGP (Law and Order), Y K Jethwais is coordinating various actions for prompt loading and transportation of medical oxygen by Odisha to states facing deficit. District SPs/DCPs and Range DIG/IG/CP are supervising the movement personally within their jurisdictions, it said.Meanwhile, Odisha's Health and Family Welfare department has set up modalities to meet the demands of oxygen cylinders in the Dedicated COVID Hospital, Covid Care Centres and others where the corona patients are admitted in the state.In an official letter to all district authorities, Additional Chief Secretary Health and Family Welfare P K Mohapatra said that drug inspectors of districts will ensure timely despatch of the empty cylinders to the assigned fillers and inform his counterparts at which the filler is stationed for timely filing of the cylinders.He said the hiring charges of vehicles can be met from the Public Health Response Funds or any other suitable head from which transportation districts will be done smoothly.Official sources said that as against the daily requirement of 23.78 tonne of medical oxygen for patients in Odisha, the daily production of cylinder oxygen in the state is 129.68 tonne. Besides, the daily production of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) is 60 tonne.While an LMO plant will be commissioned in the MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur by May 10, plans are afoot to set up LMO plants in 15 COVID hospitals including the Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (VIMSAR) at Burla.Mohapatra said the state is supplying oxygen to other needy states after fulfilling its own requirement. There is no question of giving oxygen to others by ignoring the state's requirement, he said, while rejecting the allegation that some patients in Odisha are denied oxygen.Meanwhile, BJP state general secretary Prithiviraj Harichandan alleged that oxygen stock has been exhausted at the MKCG Medical College and Hospital, Berhampur and patients died due to the oxygen shortage on Friday night.However, the Ganjam district administration has rejected the allegation.Ganjam District Collector VA Kulange wearing a PPE kit visited the MKCG hospital and interacted with Covid patients admitted to the hospital.He said the allegation of oxygen shortage at the hospital is not true. "There are some rumours about oxygen supply in Covid hospital in MKCG. We have sufficient oxygen supply and the supply chain is monitored in real time," Kulange said in a twitter post.

25-04-2021||New Delhi||Delhi’s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital receives 5 MT oxygen, highest in 3 days||After an all-night scramble for an oxygen refill, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here received five metric tonnes of the life-saving gas in the early hours of Sunday, according to officials.The hospital had raised an alarm at 10:30 pm on Saturday, saying its oxygen stock would last only an hour. There were 130 patients in the ICU, including 30 on invasive ventilation, when the SOS was sent.Around 12:20 am it received a tanker, with the help of local AAP MLA Raghav Chadha, which supplied one metric tonne of oxygen.“It should last two hours,” a hospital spokesperson said around 12:45 pm.According to him, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital’s primary supplier in Faridabad was supposed to send a tanker before 3 am.The tanker finally arrived at 4:15 am and delivered 5 metric tonnes of medical oxygen, the highest volume that the hospital has received in the last three days in one refill, he said.“It should last for 11-12 hours. Oxygen running at full pressure after a long time,” the spokesperson said.Some hospitals in the national capital continued to grapple with severe shortage of medical oxygen on Saturday even after receiving emergency supplies with the help of the Delhi government and the police.While some hospitals have managed to make short-term arrangements, there is no immediate end to the crisis in sight.At least two private hospitals in Delhi—Saroj Super Speciality Hospital in Rohini and Batra Hospital in Tughlakabad Institutional Area—on Saturday asked families of patients to shift them to other healthcare facilities in view of oxygen shortage.Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on Friday reported the death of 25 of its “sickest” patients as the administration grappled with depleting oxygen supplies.“I appeal to both the Centre and the state to help. On one hand, they increased COVID beds and on the other, they can’t supply oxygen in sufficient quantity. How are we supposed to work?” the hospital’s chairman Dr D S Rana said.“If this is COVID tsunami and the government has invoked the Disaster Management Act, then they should work according to it. We need immediate intervention,” he said.Dr Rana also said, “The government is doing its best but, perhaps, they too are helpless. But then they should admit it and reduce patient intake.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhis-sir-ganga-ram-hospital-receives-5-mt-oxygen-highest-in-3-days-243973

As Rabi procurement is also going on, more is being added.”94% got free ration last year: StudyAccording to Food Corporation of India officials, the country has reserve of 77.23 MT of foodgrain, including 49.93 MT rice (31.06 MT in form of unmilled paddy) and 27.3 MT of wheat as of April 1. The current stock is more than three times the buffer norm of 21.04 MT, they said.Pandey says the Centre is closely monitoring the situation to ascertain whether the scheme needs to be extended beyond June.“The Prime Minister has time and again repeated that there is no question of a complete lockdown. It was after reviewing the situation, the government yesterday made the announcement of providing additional foodgrain to NFSA beneficiaries in May and June,” he added.Pandey said the Chief Ministers of 13 states had requested the Centre to continue with the scheme launched during the Covid crisis in 2020. The Centre “successfully distributed” for eight months between April and November around 30 MT of foodgrain with a “high level of satisfaction”, he said.According to officials, an independent survey conducted by Dalberg (commissioned by the Ministry of Finance) has shown “a very high level of satisfaction among the beneficiaries with regard to distribution of foodgrain under the PM-GKAY and NFSA during the crisis”.Another study by Microsave Consulting (funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation) in 88 districts across 18 states/UTs has also shown that an average of 94 per cent households received the free ration on monthly basis during the crisis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sufficient-foodgrain-to-deal-with-any-situation-centre-243711

Price had said it is in the interest of the world that all Americans are vaccinated.Congresswoman Rashida Talib sought a patent waiver from the White House which has been sought before the WTO by India, South Africa and Pakistan but opposed by the US and the EU.The State Department deputy spokesperson Jalina Porter has suggested that the US will be mindful of the entire world affected by the pandemic. “And as we look to our Indian friends battling this pandemic, we’ll also acknowledge the toll that it’s taking not only on the people of India but as well as all throughout South Asia and, quite frankly, all over the world,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pressure-mounts-on-biden-to-ease-vax-raw-material-export-243717

25-04-2021||New Delhi||20 die in 1 hospital, Delhi begs for O2||India grappled with an unprecedented public health crisis on Saturday as critical Covid patients died across cities for want of oxygen, hospitals begged for supplies and several Delhi facilities halted admissions in the absence of life-saving O2 amid a tsunami of infections.Need funds to expand: SII amid pricing rowThe SII has defended Covishield price at 1.5 times the initial cost saying the earlier price was based on advance funding and now it had to invest in expansion.The situation across hospitals was worrisome with 20 critical patients dying overnight at Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi where half an hour supply was left this morning and replenishments were delayed. After another world record setting peak of today, the Centre asked the country to be ready for the worst. The signs of things to come were evident today after even AIIMS-New Delhi, India’s topmost central hospital, had to shut down its emergency for an hour to reorganise oxygen pipelines for 100 critical patients as demands surged. The admissions were later resumed.Several Delhi hospitals, including Fortis Healthcare and Gangaram, said they would halt fresh patient intake if oxygen supplies did not stabilise.At Gangaram hospital, 29 patients on invasive ventilation and in need of high flow oxygen were manually ventilated all night after O2 stocks dried up. The hospital lost 25 patients yesterday amid oxygen crisis.“Our supplier INOX has reneged on commitments. For invasive ventilation, the reservoir should be 3,000 cubic meters. We are getting supplies of 500 to 1,500 cubic meters only. We have 516 Covid patients; 129 in ICU and 29 on invasive ventilation. The 29 patients were ventilated manually, but now the staff is exhausted. This cannot go on for long. Anything can happen,” Gangaram chairman DS Rana said, noting that the government couldn’t force hospitals to admit more patients when oxygen for those already hospitalised remained inadequate.“How can we work like this?” asked Rana with Max Healthcare also tweeting today about two-hour oxygen supply left.The story being similar across most hospitals, the Centre attributed supply delays to the inability of the Delhi Government to arrange cryogenic tankers for transport, saying other states were arranging the equipment.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also wrote to his counterparts for assistance. “If you have spare oxygen, please help us,” he urged other CMs in a letter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/20-die-in-1-hospital-delhi-begs-for-o2-243661
