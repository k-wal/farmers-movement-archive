24-04-2021||New Delhi||Parliamentary panel asked govt in November last to augment oxygen production, cap price||Months before a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic hit the country, a parliamentary panel in November last year had suggested the Centre to augment hospital beds and oxygen production while flagging the “new normal” wherein patients were being turned away from hospitals due to lack of vacant beds.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Health, chaired by Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav and having 16 MPs from the BJP as members, advocated that the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority also takes appropriate measures for capping the price of oxygen cylinders so that their availability as well as affordability is ensured.“The Committee also recommends the government for encouraging adequate production of oxygen for ensuring its supply as per demand in the hospitals,” according to the report submitted in Parliament in November last year.It said the total number of government hospital beds in the country was “grossly inadequate” keeping in view the rising incidence of COVID-19 cases.The panel noted that lack of hospital beds and inadequate ventilators further complicated the efficacy of the containment plan against the pandemic.“As the numbers of cases were on the rise, a frantic search for vacant hospital beds became quite harrowing. Instances of patients being turned away from overburdened hospitals due to lack of vacant beds became the new normal. The scenario of patients holding oxygen cylinder rushing from pillar to post in search of bed in AIIMS Patna is a testimony to fact that tear apart humanity,” it said.Aggrieved at the poor state of healthcare system, the panel recommended the government to increase the investment in public health and take appropriate steps to decentralise healthcare services/facilities in the country.According to the report, the Health and Family Welfare secretary had informed the committee on October 16 last year that the ministry has requested the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) to fix the price of oxygen as non-invasive oxygen has been found to deliver good results. Since the hospitals are using oxygen on a large scale, its consumption is increasing.“The overall production in the country is roughly in the region of 6,900 metric ton every day. Out of 6,900 metric ton, the highest consumption of medical oxygen was reported in mid-September, in and around 24th or 25th September, when the consumption was almost 3,000 metric ton of oxygen a day,” according to the report.“He (Health secretary) also submitted that during the pre-COVID days, the consumption of medical oxygen was almost 1,000 metric tons per day and the rest of the 6,000 metric tons of oxygen was being used in the industry. Therefore, there is a strong need to ensure that the oxygen inventory is in place and oxygen prices are controlled.“The committee agrees with the department that the pandemic has led to an unprecedented increase in the demand of non-invasive oxygen cylinders and instances of lack of oxygen cylinders in the hospitals had also been reported,” according to the report.India is struggling with the second wave of the pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days, and hospitals in several states are reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds.

Speaking to the media about the additional free-of-cost foodgrains being provided to NFSA beneficiaries for the months of May and June, Food and Public Distribution Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey said: “There are sufficient stocks, much more than the buffer norm, available in the country to deal with any situation. Since Rabi procurement is also going on, more is being added.”According to Food Corporation of India officials, the country has reserves of 77.23 MT of food grains, including 49.93 MT rice (31.06 MT in form of unmilled paddy) and 27.3 MT of wheat as of April 1 The current stocks are more than three times the buffer norm of 21.04 MT, they said.Pandey said the Centre is closely monitoring the situation to ascertain whether the scheme needs to be extended beyond June. “The Prime Minister has time and again repeated that there is no question of a complete lockdown. It was after reviewing the situation the government yesterday made the announcement of providing additional foodgrains to NFSA beneficiaries in May and June. The government will further review to ascertain whether it needs to be extended,” he said.Pandey also said that Chief Ministers of 13 states had requested the Centre to continue with the scheme launched during the corona crisis in 2020. The Centre “successfully distributed” for eight months between April and November around 30 MT food grains with a “high level of satisfaction”, he said.According to officials, an independent survey conducted by Dalberg (Commissioned by Ministry of Finance) has shown “a very high level of satisfaction among the beneficiaries with regards to distribution of foodgrains under the PM-GKAY and NFSA during the crisis”.Another study by Microsave Consulting (Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funded) in 88 districts across 18 States/UTs has also shown that an average of 94% households received the free ration on monthly basis during the crisis. Further, there was a high level of awareness of about 97% regarding PM-GKAY distribution and the entitlement thereof, they added.However, this time the scheme will only include wheat and rice. “Pulses and chana provided last year were exceptional,” said officials. They also added that this time the country “is not facing the kind of migration issues it saw last year”, therefore “comparisons cannot be made”. “NFSA is about cereals wheat rice and millets. Chana and pulses provided last year was exceptional,” they said.The scheme includes 9.74 Crore AAY beneficiaries and 70.13 Crore PHH beneficiaries. 13 CMs, including Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Kerala, Uttarakhand, “requested the extension of the scheme and appreciated the decision to provide free foodgrain under PM-GKAY,” they said.Amid the fresh COVID-19 outbreak in the country, the Government yesterday decided to allocate free-of-cost foodgrains at the rate of 5 kg per person per month to nearly 80 crore beneficiaries covered under National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) over and above NFSA foodgrains for next two months (May and June) on the same pattern as the earlier “Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PM-GKAY)”.The Centre will bear full expenditure of over Rs 26,000 Crore on account of cost of food grains, intrastate transportation etc. as part of Central assistance to States/UTs, officials said, adding that this was in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s commitment to the poor.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/additional-foodgrain-to-nfsa-beneficiaries-sufficient-stocks-to-deal-with-any-situation-says-centre-243595

This unprecedented health and humanitarian crisis created by the second wave of COVID-19, is turning into a ‘tsunami’. The situation has been aggravated by the approach and attitude of the Union government,” Yechury said.“I am writing to you on an URGENT basis to ensure two things on utmost priority: ensure uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen to all hospitals and patients across the country by procuring it at any cost; and provide vaccines to all the state governments for a free and universal vaccination programme, bringing production of Indian vaccines under emergency provisions and importing from all available sources to prevent more deaths,” he said.The Left leader also suggested budgetary allocation of Rs 35,000 crore for the vaccination programme.He demanded that the ambitious Central Vista project be cancelled and all extravagant expenditures be put on hold as well as transparently releasing all the money collected under PM-CARES fund and transfer the same for the supply of oxygen and vaccine. “In case you are unable to provide oxygen and vaccines to our fellow Indians and prevent further deaths, your government will lose its moral authority to continue. This health and humanitarian disaster is preventable and must be averted. This is the basic responsibility your government has to discharge, which it has failed to do so far,” he said.Yechury’s older son Ashish Yechury passed away due to the novel coronavirus infection on April 22.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ensure-uninterrupted-oxygen-supply-free-covid-19-vaccination-for-all-yechury-writes-to-pm-modi-243592
24-04-2021||Mumbai||Maha: Six dead in Yavatmal after `consuming' sanitiser liquid||Six persons have died in Yavatmal district of eastern Maharashtra after apparently consuming hand sanitiser liquid as they could not get liquor, police said on Saturday.While in the case of three men doctors confirmed that consumption of sanitiser was the cause, the others who died in similar circumstances were cremated without informing the police, an official said.The police were alerted on Friday about the deaths of three persons at the rural hospital in Vani following complaints of uneasiness and vomiting, he said."Their family members said deaths were caused by the consumption of sanitiser as they could not get liquor due to coronavirus-induced restrictions. Three other men were said to have died in a similar manner," the police official said.Hand sanitiser liquids often have alcohol as their base though it is different from the alcohol in liquor.Doctors who conducted autopsy of the three persons who died at the rural hospital confirmed that the deaths were due to the complications caused by sanitiser consumption, the official said."The last rites of the other three were held without informing police.

'INC TV' is one such channel which will put forth the voice of people," he said.Maken said the media should put the government in the dock and question it, and only then will there be pressure on the dispensation to act in public welfare."The accountability of the government and leaders is a must," he said."Various institutions in the country are under attack from the government and this is not being highlighted in the media," party treasurer Bansal alleged.The idea behind the digital TV is to have dissemination of views and opinions of different sections of the society, especially that of the poor and oppressed classes, the party said.With the help of the platform, the party seeks to convey its message directly to people and raise issues of importance. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/on-panchayati-raj-day-congress-launches-digital-platform-inc-tv-243582

On behalf of the people of Pakistan, I extend our heartfelt sympathies to the affected families in #India," Qureshi tweeted.Pakistan continues to work with the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries to foster cooperation to tackle the pandemic, he said.Pakistan has reported 157 coronavirus deaths in the last 24 hours, the highest since last year, while the new number of cases recorded were 5,908, the health ministry said on Saturday.Pakistan's Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry also expressed similar sentiments for the people of India.“In these difficult times our prayers are with people of #India may God be kind and may these difficult times get over soon. #coronavirus,” he tweeted.The tweets from the Pakistani leaders came amidst some signs of rapprochement in the relations between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue.India's decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in 2019 angered Pakistan, which downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad. Pakistan also snapped all air and land links with India and suspended trade and railway services.The militaries of the two countries, in a surprise announcement on February 25, said that they have agreed to strictly observe all agreements on ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir and other sectors.

We have 516 covid patients, 129 in ICU and 29 patients on invasive ventilation. These 29 patients due to less supplies are on manual ventilation since midnight. This cannot go for long. Staff is getting exhausted,” Rana said.Noting that the government was doing its best but appeared helpless, Rana said the Delhi government should stop forcing hospitals to admit more patients.“The government should admit the crisis and reduce the patient intake. Today morning our oxygen had almost finished when we received 1.5 tons, which has depleted 0.7 tons as we speak. This will last for one hour only,” Rana said.Yesterday it was given in writing to Gangaram that INOX will start giving 9,000 cubic meters daily from midnight.But the hospital, despite being in crisis since 4 am today, has not received supplies.“INOX did not fulfill its commitment and just supplied 1.5 tons at 5.30 am. INOX says they don’t have oxygen. We want help and I appeal to both Centre and state to help,” a desperate Rana said as reports of patients dying from lack of oxygen came in from Rajasthan and Punjab.Rana rued that on one side the Delhi government has increased Covid beds in hospitals and on the other side they can’t supply oxygen in sufficient quantity.“How are we supposed to work? If this is Covid tsunami and Government has invoked Disaster Act then they should work according to Disaster Act. We need immediate intervention,” Rana said.Delhi hospitals have been engaged in panic management or oxygen for five days now with no solution in sight.The permanent solution is a PSA oxygen plant but that’s a long haul. Instant oxygen delivery remains critical to save patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/29-patients-on-manual-ventilation-since-last-night-in-delhi-hospital-as-oxygen-supply-ends-243557

24-04-2021||New Delhi||HC asks Centre, AAP government to coordinate to provide oxygen in Delhi hospitals treating COVID-19 patients||The Delhi High Court on Saturday asked the Centre and the Delhi government to coordinate on the issue of making available medical oxygen to hospitals treating COVID-19 patients, observing that citizens cannot be left to die.The court made it clear that the efforts which Delhi government has to make in this regard cannot be trivialised and they should not leave it entirely to the central government.“The Delhi government should, therefore, make all-out efforts for the procurement of cryogenic tankers from whatever source they can be made available, and look for all possible avenues. As aforesaid, the sub-Group in the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) shall also help in this regard, and we expect the officers of both the governments to interact and co-ordinate in this regard,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said.The bench, which conducted a special hearing that lasted three hours on the issue of escalating oxygen crisis in various hospitals in Delhi, observed, the citizens of Delhi “cannot be allowed to die like this because enough oxygen is not coming”.During the hearing earlier in the day, a senior central government officer submitted that the Delhi government was expecting the Centre to serve everything on platter and the state’s officers will have to do some work on their own, like other states are doing.The high court also directed all the suppliers and re-fillers of oxygen to give complete details to the AAP government about the oxygen supplied by them to various hospitals treating COVID-19 patients here, observing that there has to be “transparency” on this aspect.It said the information to be furnished by the suppliers to the nodal officer of Delhi shall include how much oxygen was supplied to each of the hospitals and when.“We direct all suppliers, who supply oxygen to Delhi, to provide complete details to the nodal officer about the quantity of oxygen supplied to each hospital and the timing,” the bench said.The direction was passed as senior advocate Rahul Mehra and lawyer Satyakam, representing the Delhi government, contended that the suppliers were not providing them the details of oxygen supplied to Delhi hospitals.The high court also directed the Delhi government to the communication to all the hospitals and nursing homes here the details of its new team—comprising 10 IAS and 28 DANIPS officers—constituted for monitoring the oxygen distribution in the national capital.The court was conducting an urgent hearing on a petition filed by Maharaja Agrasen Hospital over the shortage of oxygen for treating seriously ill COVID patients. The issue was joined by Jaipur Golden Hospital, Batra Hospital and Saroj Super Speciality Hospital which were also running out of oxygen.During the hearing, the court also asked the Centre when the 480 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen per day allocated for Delhi would see the light of the day.“You (Centre) had assured us (on April 21) that 480 MT per day will reach Delhi. Tell us when will it come? We want a definitive date. The 480 MT per day is still to see the light of the day,” the bench said The query came after the Delhi government said it was getting only 380 MT oxygen per day over the past few days and it received only around 300 MT on Friday.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the central government, said one of the reasons for the shortage in supply was due to the Delhi government not providing cryogenic tankers for picking up liquid oxygen.The court was informed that so far as Durgapur plant is concerned, empty cryogenic tanks have been airlifted and are in the process of being filled with liquid oxygen. “We have also been informed that the railway is waiting in readiness to transport the said tanks to Delhi as soon as the same is loaded. So far as, Rourkela and Kalinganagar plants are concerned, we have been informed by Sumita Dawra and Piyush Goyal (senior officers of central government) that the Delhi government has not made arrangements for cryogenic tanks for transporting the liquid oxygen from these plants,” the bench said.The hearing witnessed heated arguments between Mehta and Mehra on this issue.While Mehra told the court that it was not an industrial state and therefore, did not have access to such tankers, the solicitor general said various states are making arrangements for converting existing tankers for storage of oxygen or are procuring the same from other sources and the Delhi government too should make an endeavour in that direction.The court questioned the Delhi government officers as to what endeavours they have made to secure tankers to get the supply of oxygen allocated to it by the Centre.The Centre’s counsel submitted that the central government would look into the issue, so that a reasonable arrangement is worked out for making tanks available for transportation of liquid oxygen from all the three plants—Durgapur, Rourkela and Kalinganagar, in coordination with the Delhi government.The bench said in case tankers are in shortage, the Centre shall use them on a rotation basis by doing rationing and that both the Central and Delhi governments should work together on this issue. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-asks-centre-aap-government-to-coordinate-to-provide-oxygen-in-delhi-hospitals-treating-covid-19-patients-243535

For the purpose, the gurdwara has also set up a helpline, 9097041313.Explaining the process through which the oxygen is provided to the needy, Singh’s son Rumid Singh Rabin (in his 20s), who has been actively involved in the exercise, said, “As soon as the gurdwara receives a call on the helpline number, a car is sent to the patient and as soon as the patient reaches them, they are provided oxygen supply until the person’s oxygen level reaches to the safe level or till hospital bed is not allotted to him or her.” He said for some logistic reasons the services are not provided at the patient’s door.“Amid this critical situation when many leading hospitals are facing an acute shortage of oxygen, this initiative by the gurdwara is commendable as people are getting immediate relief. A large number of people are already gathering at the Indirapuram Gurdwara for oxygen supply,” said Raghav Pal, a local resident, who got oxygen for his brother at the facility.Covid has been creating havoc in Uttar Pradesh as the state recorded 34,379 new cases in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day spike. As many as 195 persons succumbed to the virus. Ghaziabad saw almost 1,000 cases in a single day.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gurdwaras-oxygen-langar-proving-lifesaver-for-covid-patients-as-govt-runs-out-of-supplies-in-ghaziabad-243515

They have responded to the inspirational ways shown by the Prime Minister and the Railway Minister," Sharma said."The railways will not be found wanting in its national duties in this time of crisis," he said.He said in spite of the Covid challenge, the Railways has resumed 100 per cent of freight services, 80 per cent of passenger trains, and 90 per cent of suburban trains across the country since the national lockdown.He said the transportation of Liquid Medicine Oxygen (LMO) from one part of the country to another is a huge challenge on account of the product being cryogenic, and dangerous. The trains cannot be accelerated beyond a certain speed, and deceleration has to be undertaken delicately.The production units of the LMO are concentrated in the eastern part of the country.The Railways had not faced such a delicate situation before logistics, including ramps had to be set up, and right kind of wagons had to be identified."But logistical requirements have been streamlined. The Railways is now geared up to meet the challenge and respond to the requisition of the states."Sharma said that besides Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi had requisitioned the transportation of LMO."We are ready for the services when the states are ready."The Railway authorities are in touch with the Delhi government, which made the requisition on Thursday afternoon.  Responding to a question, Sharma denied obstruction of movement of oxygen trains by public in any part of the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/93-000-railway-employees-infected-with-covid-243514

24-04-2021||Mukesh Ranjan||CBI books Maharashtra ex-home minister Anil Deshmukh in alleged bribery case||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 24The CBI on Saturday registered a case against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on the alleged charges of corruption against him and launched searches at his home in Mumbai and other places in Maharashtra.Sources in the CBI said that following the registration of the FIR, the agency officials have raided premises linked to Deshmukh in Mumbai and other places in Maharashtra. “Searches continue and details will emerge as the day progresses,” said a source.In Mumbai, teams of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) searched at two properties linked to Deshmukh.Taking precautions of COVID, the teams searched Dyaneshwari bungalow in south Mumbai’s Malabar Hill, which was allotted to Deshmukh, when he was a minister and his flat in Sukhada Apartment on Sir Pochkhanwala Road in Worli.The CBI teams wearing PPE kits and masks arrived early morning and made spot panchnama of recoveries.A similar action unfolded at Deshmukh’s hometown Nagpur where the CBI team, which had arrived Friday night, searched his residence at GPO Square in Civil Lines area in the early morning. The team left around 6.30 pm.“I cooperated with the CBI team which came for searches at my house,” Deshmukh told reporters.He had resigned as a minister after the high court asked the CBI to probe the allegations.Reacting to the CBI action against its leader Deshmukh, the NCP said nobody was above the law, but added that the truth behind the “political conspiracy” against him.Talking to reporters, NCP spokesperson and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik said, “Nobody is above the law. Anil Deshmukh is cooperating with the agencies.”He said he was not aware if any FIR has been registered against Deshmukh.“What was the role of former Mumbai police commissioner (Param Bir Singh) in the case? All these actions are taking place based on the ex-commissioner’s letter,” he alleged.“This is nothing but misuse of power to malign the state government and Anil Deshmukh. We have full faith in the judiciary and know that the truth behind the political conspiracy will be exposed through the probe,” he said.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut also said that nobody was above the law.“It is not correct to comment on CBI’s action. Anil Deshmukh had already given his statement in the case. CBI is doing its work, similarly high court and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government are doing their own work,” he said.“If there is a political agenda in the case against Anil Deshmukh, then the MVA government will take a stand. Hope the action against Deshmukh is restricted to directives of the high court,” he said.On March 25, Singh had filed the criminal public interest litigation seeking a CBI probe against Deshmukh, who, he claimed, had asked police officers, including Vaze, to extort Rs 100 crore from bars and restaurants.Earlier this month, after an order by the Bombay High Court, the CBI had registered a preliminary enquiry (PE) against Deshmukh to probe the Rs 100 crore extortion allegation levelled by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh. The CBI had questioned Deshmukh as part of its preliminary enquiry, which lasted for about 11 hours during which he was confronted with more than 75 posers. He was then questioned by Abhishek Dular and Kiran S, both SP-rank officers of the CBI in Mumbai.According to officials in the CBI, the questioning largely revolved around Deshmukh’s alleged messages with ACP Sanjay Patil. Following the letter written by Singh, the CBI took over the investigation and since has questioned several persons. Deshmukh was confronted with the statements made by the others.Deshmukh was also asked about the specific allegation made by former Mumbai Police commissioner as well as Sachin Waze, who accused him of setting a target of Rs 100 crore. He was asked if he had asked Waze to collect money through extortions from bars and restaurants in Mumbai.Following the questioning, Deshmukh had denied all the allegations and claimed that this was just an attempt to malign the state government. — With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-books-maharashtra-ex-home-minister-anil-deshmukh-in-alleged-bribery-case-243512
24-04-2021||Washington||Pressure mounts on Biden admn to ship AstraZeneca vaccine, other medical supplies to India||The Biden administration has come under intense pressure from various quarters, including the powerful US Chambers of Commerce, lawmakers and eminent Indian-Americans, to ship AstraZeneca and other Covid vaccines along with several life-saving medical supplies to India, which is witnessing a deadly surge in coronavirus cases.“As the Covid pandemic inflicts a heavy toll on countries around the globe, the US Chamber strongly encourages the administration to release the millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses in storage - as well as other life-saving support - for shipment to India, Brazil and other nations hard-hit by the pandemic,” said Myron Brilliante, executive vice president and head of international affairs at the US Chamber of Commerce.He said these vaccine doses would not be needed in the United States, where it's estimated that vaccine manufacturers would be able to produce enough doses by early June to inoculate every American.This move would affirm US leadership, including in initiatives such as COVAX, and as we work with partners around the globe because no one is safe from the pandemic until we are all safe from it, Brilliante said.The US Chambers issued the statement after Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar sought global help in fight against Covid. “Will strive to ensure that our supply chains are as smooth as possible in a difficult global situation. The world must support India, as India helps the world,” he said in a tweet.US State Department Deputy Spokesperson Jalina Porter told reporters that the United States continues to work closely with India to facilitate the movement of essential supplies and also address the bottlenecks of the supply chains.“The COVID-19 situation in India is a global concern,” she said.“We also continue to collaborate with our partners in India to battle this at the highest level. We know Secretary (of State, Tony) Blinken spoke to his counterpart on Tuesday and we remain deeply engaged with India at all levels as we work to combat this crisis of the pandemic together,” Porter said.Congresswoman Rashida Talib tweeted that the COVID-19 crisis in India is a harsh reminder that the pandemic is not over until the whole world is safe.President Biden “must support a patent waiver to ramp up global production now,” she said.“As we look to our Indian friends battling this pandemic, we'll also acknowledge the toll that it's taking, not only on the people of India, but as well as all throughout South Asia and, quite frankly, all over the world,” Porter said.The Washington Post in a lead editorial hoped that all of India can seize the moment and begin to reverse the course of this disaster. “India is not a faraway problem. In pandemic time and distance, every place is nearby,” it said.Major Democratic fundraiser for the Biden's presidential campaign Shekar Narasimhan urged the US President to speak to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “We have to do something in the face of a humanitarian disaster. Every friend I know in the US with family in India reports that relatives have died or been affected,” he said.President “please speak to the Prime Minister and see if we can lend 10M doses of AZ vaccine like tomorrow. We must help now!” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pressure-mounts-on-biden-admn-to-ship-astrazeneca-vaccine-other-medical-supplies-to-india-243511

24-04-2021||Gurnaaz Kaur||Shravan Rathod's music stirred  the soul||In today’s age of remixes, most Bollywood music lovers know melody because of the film songs of the 90s, an era that was ruled by music director duo Nadeem-Shravan. Thursday brought an end to the epoch as composer Shravan Rathod passed away due to Covid-related complications.The 66-year-old composer was admitted to SL Raheja hospital in Mahim, Mumbai. There were complications in his case and he had been in the ICU for the past few days.Nadeem-Shravan is credited to have created history in Bollywood in the 1990s and 2000s. The duo gave chartbuster soundtracks one after another and their breakthrough film was Aashiqui (1990), which sold 2 crore cassettes in India and became the best-selling Bollywood album of all time. And the decade that followed was for them to reign.Saajan, Phool Aur Kaante, Sadak, Deewana, Dil Kya Kare, Kasoor, Hum Hain Rahi Pyaar Ke, Rang, Dilwale, Raja, Barsaat, Raja Hindustani, Pardes, Sirf Tum and so many more; they belted out some of the most popular tunes of the industry and left an indelible mark on the map. What made their music unique was the strong influence of Hindustani music in their compositions. For most of their songs, they sued three instruments — bansuri, sitar and shehnai. In one of his interviews, Shravan had expressed his disappointment with today’s music. He said, “There is a lot of technology. Electronic music is artificial. It cannot be compared to a live orchestra. The focus should be on the lyrics and the concept of Indianness. We are copying Western style too much.”What made Nadeem-Shravan unique according to him was, "We used the bansuri, sitar and shehnai in all our compositions. The soul of India is contained within these three instruments. RD Burman always used the bansuri. That is why his songs have lasted."Having teamed up with the best of singers, the duo made all kinds of music but melody was their speciality.As the news of Shravan’s demise broke, the film and music fraternity poured their grief on social media. While the family is inconsolable, Nadeem (as a name and perhaps as a person) too is left with a void that can never be filled.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shravan-rathods-music-stirred-the-soul-243340

The tragedy comes two days after 24 Covid patients either on ventilator or oxygen support were suffocated to death when the oxygen supply stopped suddenly due to a malfunction in the main storage at a civic hospital in Nashik. A fire broke out in Mumbai’s Dreams Mall, which housed a Covid-designated hospital, in the intervening night of March 25-26. The fire, that raged for over 40 hours, claimed nine lives, including those of patients on ventilator support. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/another-tragedy-14-covid-19-die-in-hospital-blaze-in-maharashtras-palghar-district-243384

Oxygen supplies far from stabilising, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met CMs of 11 high-burden states, including Delhi, and said the Indian Air Force and Railways had been deployed to reduce travel time for oxygen supplies.After Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal told the meeting that Haryana and UP had been obstructing Delhi’s oxygen supplies, the PM said every state must ensure no oxygen tanker was stopped or stranded. Later in the day, the MHA said it had written to all states/ UTs to provide adequate security and exclusive corridors to oxygen transporting vehicles.No oxygen at MP hospital, 5 die5 patients died after the stock of oxygen got over at a hospital in MP's JabalpurThough the PM today also met leading oxygen manufacturers, including Reliance’s Mukesh Ambani, urging them to boost supplies, the ground situation remained grim with India logging 3,32,730 daily cases in another world record. Delhi continued to remain the third top contributor to the burden with 26,995 cases and more 350 deaths.Story Highlights24,28,616make up for 59.12% of the active casesIn worrisome new evidence, the National Centre for Disease Control said the Delhi surge was directly correlated to the UK variant. “We have seen a rise in the proportion of the UK variant from 28 per cent of Delhi’s genome sequenced samples in the second week of March to 50 per cent in the last week of March. The surge in Delhi directly correlates with the UK variant. Nationally, we have sequenced 15,135 samples and found 1,735 (11%) variants of concern,” SK Singh, Director, NCDC, said, not ruling out challenging times ahead.PM’s assurances of smooth supplies apart, Ganga Ram Hospital had not received any supplies till 9 pm when the hospital was left with 800 cubic metres of oxygen lasting just 45 minutes.At Ganga Ram Hospital, a tanker entered the facility late at 11 pm on Friday to deliver oxygen for 140 critical patients. Reeling under oxygen shortage, the hospital was on the brink with just half an hour supply left for the night. A tanker arrived in the “nick of time,” said Ganga Ram PRO Ajoy Sehgal. “The oxygen tanker has given us half a tonne, which is sufficient for for 1.5 hours. Hopefully, by that time INOX tanker should arrive. It will be a long night.”Such was the desperation of hospital managements that Ganga Ram, Bram Healthcare and Batra Hospitals approached the High Court with an SOS.Outside Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, relatives expressed shock at the state or affairs. A wailing wife whose husband was refused admission asked: “Aise kaise chalega?”Cries of disbelief rented the air outside all Delhi hospitals even as Kejriwal was chided by the PM for live telecasting his remarks at the meet where he asked the PM to tell Haryana and UP not to obstruct Delhi’s oxygen tankers. The PM urged states to come down heavily on hoarders and black marketers of essential medicines and injections and acknowledged that Covid was now affecting Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities at once.“We are working on all options to reduce the travel time and turnaround time of oxygen tankers,” the PM said.Zydus’ drug cleared for Covid treatmentNew Delhi: The Drug Controller General of India on Friday granted emergency use authorisation to Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadilla’s anti-viral Virafin for treatment of moderately ill Covid patients.

We fear a big tragedy may happen and we will never be able to forgive ourselves. I request you with folded hands to direct all CMs to ensure smooth movement of oxygen tankers coming to Delhi,” Kejriwal said.Government and BJP functionaries accused him of playing politics on a serious issue by airing what they called a “private conversation between him and PM Modi”.“Kejriwal has descended to a new low,” they said, accusing the Delhi CM of “playing politics using a government platform” and “palming off” his inadequacies on to the Centre. “He could have held a press conference. The proceedings of the conference were not supposed to be televised,” they said.Speaking at a meeting chaired by the PM on the Covid-19 situation, Kejriwal requested him to direct CMS of all states to ensure smooth movement of oxygen tankers coming to the national capital.“Will people of Delhi not get oxygen if there is no oxygen-producing plant here? Please suggest whom should I speak to in the central government when an oxygen tanker destined for Delhi is stopped in another state,” the Delhi CM said. However, cutting him off midway, the PM ticked him off for telecasting an “in-house” meeting.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-narendra-modi-pulls-up-arvind-kejriwal-for-live-telecast-of-meeting-243194

Oxygen meant for Bengal was being diverted to Uttar Pradesh by the Centre, she alleged. “The chain that supplies oxygen to Bengal, namely SAIL, is being shifted to UP. Our chain is being shifted to UP so that there is oxygen shortage here,” Mamata alleged. Addressing a press conference at Durgapur, Mamata alleged that the Modi government at the Centre was bent upon destroying Bengal. “Why supply of one state be cut to benefit another,” she asked. State government sources said the GoI on Wednesday allotted 200 MT of oxygen from different plants located in West Bengal to UP. Sources said taking into account the current patient load and the rising trend of the infections, it was estimated that the consumption level in West Bengal would rise to roughly 450 MT per day in the next couple of weeks. Allocation of liquid oxygen to UP could jeopardise the medical treatment of Covid patients in the state, sources said. Stating that she had written to GoI to consider the need of the state and not send medical oxygen available in the state elsewhere, the Chief Minister claimed that her “priority was Covid” and not the ongoing Assembly elections in the state. “I have been holding five to six meetings daily on the Covid situation in the state,” Mamata said. “Today I took stock of Durgapur and Asansol districts. I will go to Berhampore and Birbhum tomorrow and review the situation prevailing in Murshidabad and Birbhum districts. Then I will head to Malda,” Mamata said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-choking-oxygen-supply-to-state-says-mamata-243190

He said the ongoing Assembly elections in West Bengal were not simply for changing the regime.“I see hope and aspirations for a new West Bengal in the minds of the voters. West Bengal wants a government that is free of partiality,” Modi said.The Prime Minister said this while addressing a virtual rally for those living in Murshidabad, Malda, Berhampore and south Kolkata. Modi said people were looking for employment opportunities, ease of living and ease of doing business.

It is eager for a regime where every department of the government does its work and accomplishes its responsibilities,” Modi said. Stating that record foreign investment was coming to India, Modi said a major portion of the investment would be used in Bengal to promote industry and employment.

The news did not just come as an emotional trauma for us but also affects us financially as we have paid huge sums on air tickets and also for mandatory provision for hotel quarantine,” rued an affected person.Ranjeet Kaur from Sangrur, who was set to fly to Canada this evening, said, “I had got a Covid negative test report. I had got my hotel bookings done for the mandatory quarantine. My taxi to Delhi airport was booked and I was so excited to join my husband after a year of our marriage when this news brought everything to a standstill.”Shaurya Arora, who has already completed his first semester in Bachelors in Business Administration on online mode from a Toronto-based college, said, “I was to board a flight from Amritsar to Toronto and was to leave from Jalandhar this afternoon.

24-04-2021||London||Boris Johnson says looking to ‘help and support' India as UK travel ban begins||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday said the UK was looking at ways to "help and support" India, as it copes with a devastating second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic."We're looking at what we can do to help and support the people of India," Johnson told reporters while on a visit to Derbyshire on a local elections campaign trail.It is believed this support could be in the form of ventilators or therapeutics.The comment by Johnson, who was forced to cancel a planned visit to India this weekend amid a surge in infections, came as the “red list” COVID-19 travel restrictions came in force for India on Friday, which bans entry for travellers from India and requires British and Irish nationals and long-term UK residents returning home to undergo a compulsory 10-day hotel quarantine.The ban comes in as Public Health England (PHE) confirmed 55 more cases of the so-called double mutant Indian variant, B.1.617, from all coronavirus cases tracked until April 14, taking the total for the Variant Under Investigation (VUI) in the UK to 132.Experts are still studying whether any of the mutations mean the variant can be transmitted more easily, is more deadly or can evade the effectiveness of vaccines or natural immunity.“At this point they are designated Variant Under Investigation (VUI) with a year, month, and number. Following a risk assessment with the relevant expert committee, they may be designated Variant of Concern (VOC),” PHE said of the Indian variant, designated as VUI-21Apr-01.The last flight from India before the red list categorisation, which includes 40 countries considered high-risk zones for the spread of new variants of the deadly virus, landed at Heathrow Airport in London from Delhi on Thursday evening.Earlier, Heathrow had confirmed that it turned down requests for at least eight additional flights that were seeking landing rights ahead of Friday's 4am cut-off to avoid long queues and crowds building up at the airport.Families and students who were able to make it back in time must now self-isolate at their own homes or student accommodation registered on passenger locator forms and take follow up coronavirus tests for the National Health Service (NHS) to continue tracking their results.Anyone arriving from India from Friday must now budget for a 10-day quarantine period at a government-approved hotel quarantine facility and take two follow up PCR tests, adding approximately 2,000 pounds per person to the travel costs.Indian students are the worst-hit by this additional requirement as they were preparing to either resume their on-campus studies at UK universities or start a new term next month.“We have received confirmation from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office that those with vignettes for valid routes that confer residency in the UK can enter the UK, even if they have no Biometric Residence Permits when they land,” reads an advisory issued by the National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK (NISAU-UK), a representative group for Indian students in the UK.It has been fielding frantic calls and messages ever since India's red list classification was announced in the House of Commons earlier in the week. The group is working on steps to raise hardship requests and student discounts for the compulsory quarantine.Meanwhile, some UK universities are also reaching out to the government to offer assistance in the quarantine process on campus to help support some of these overseas students.Universities UK International (UUKi), a representative group for the UK's leading universities, has said that given the government may have difficulty providing capacity, they should look at where universities have accommodation that could meet the standard of the hotel quarantine system.

The weight of the tank would be below 25 tonnes.The Army had airlifted its T-90 main battle tanks, which weigh about 46 tonnes, to the area to beef up its capability after the stand-off with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh unfolded in May last year.The Army already had a brigade of the older generation T-72 tanks along with BMP-2/3 mechanised infantry combat vehicle in Ladakh that were moved there over a decade ago. Airlifting tanks and armoured vehicles is the only way to deploy them in Ladakh as there cannot be moved by road due to the terrain, narrow roads and hairpin bends.Procurement of light tanks is part of the Army’s plan to enhance the mobility and maneuverability of its armoured elements as these are considered to be more versatile in rugged terrain and narrow confines that Ladakh offers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mod-issues-request-for-information-to-procure-350-light-tanks-for-ladakh-frontier-243119

Fresh instructions and revised protocols were issued by service headquarters last week to help mitigate the spread of infections.“These 23 mobile oxygen generation plants are being airlifted from Germany. These will be deployed in AFMS hospitals catering to the COVID patients,” Babu said.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, at a high-level review meeting on April 20, directed the armed forces to go ahead with the procurement of critical medical requirements under emergency powers of procurement.These oxygen generating plants are expected within a week, according to the Ministry of Defence.The Defence Research and Development Organisation has also pitched in with oxygen generation plants and associated equipment produced by it. In addition to other gadgets, the onboard oxygen generation plant developed for the Tejas fighter has been adapted for medical use.As the country witnesses an unprecedented number of COVID-19 infections, the Armed Forces have deployed their men, equipment and facilities to assist the civilian administration as and where required.IAF aircraft as well as Army's railway wagons have also been pressed into service to ferry oxygen tankers and oxygen cylinders along with other essential items to various parts of the country. Military medical facilities are also open to treating civilian patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mod-to-airlift-23-oxygen-generating-plants-from-germany-243097
24-04-2021||New Delhi||Government functionaries, BJP slam Kejriwal for going live with PM conference||Even as Delhi gasps for breath amid the shortage of medical infrastructure, beds, medical oxygen and drugs, senior government functionaries slammed Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for televising what they called a "private conversation between him and Prime Minister Narendra Modi"."Arvind Kejriwal has descended to a new low," they said, accusing the Delhi CM of "playing politics using a government platform"."He could have held a separate press conference but proceedings of the conference were not supposed to televised," they claimed.Soon after Kejriwal made an appeal to the Prime Minister for uninterrupted supply of oxygen, BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said that "there is no fight between the Centre or the Delhi as the CM has tried to make out as"."A lot of charges can be made against Arvind Kejriwal but this is not the time," BJP spokesperson said."Four days back he said there is no shortage of beds. There was no need to politicise it," he said.A few minutes ago, Kejriwal had gone live, appealing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to help Delhi with medical oxygen. He said other states of "blocking" oxygen for Delhi. He was speaking at a meeting the Prime Minister is holding with chief ministers of 10 affected states.Government functionaries say that the meeting was not meant to be televised and that the Delhi CM had tried to "palm off his inadequacies on the Centre".At least 25 critically ill patients who were on high flow oxygen at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi have died in the past 24 hours, according to reports.‘Regrets’Responding to the sharp reaction of the Union government officials, the chief minister’s office (CMO) issued a brief statement, saying: “Today, the CM address was shared live because there has never been any instruction, written or verbal, from central government that the said interaction could not be shared live”. “There have been multiple occasions of similar interactions where matters of public importance which had no confidential information were shared live. However, if any inconvenience was caused we highly regret that.”  During the meeting, Kejriwal said the Centre should take over all oxygen plants through the Army and requested Modi to direct chief ministers of all states to ensure smooth movement of oxygen tankers coming to the national capital. “People in major pain due to oxygen shortage. We fear a big tragedy may happen due to oxygen shortage and we will never be able to forgive ourselves. I request you with folded hands to direct all CMs to ensure smooth movement of oxygen tankers coming to Delhi,” he said during the meeting.      “We need a national plan to deal with the crisis. The Central government should take over all oxygen plants through the Army and every tanker coming out of the oxygen plant should be accompanied by an Army escort vehicle,” he said.             “The oxygen supply scheduled to come to Delhi from Odisha and West Bengal should either be airlifted or brought through the Oxygen express started by the Centre,” he said.    The chief minister also objected to different rates being charged from state governments and the Centre for the COVID-19 vaccine, and said “one nation, one rate” policy should be followed.     Union government sources alleged that Kejriwal has chosen to spread lies on vaccine prices despite knowing that the Centre does not keep one vaccine dose with itself and shares with states only.Modi held a meeting on Friday with chief ministers of 10 states with the most number of COVID-19 cases. The meeting via video conferencing comes amid a huge surge in coronavirus cases, which have now clocked a daily total of over 3 lakh in the country.     Apart from Delhi, chief ministers of Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh are among those who attended the meeting.Modi also held a meeting with leading oxygen manufacturers in the country via video conference amid concerns expressed by some states that their supply of the life-saving gas is running short with a number of hospitals, including many in the  national capital, sending out SOS for immediate supply.          Central government sources also noted that it has done a lot to boost health infra in the national capital, and referred to the DRDO facility with 500 ICU beds, which has been funded from the PM CARES Fund.The home ministry has also ordered medical manpower for re-activating Sardar Patel COVID Care Centre (SPCCC) at Chhattarpur, they said, adding that this caters to 500 oxygenated beds.Bed capacity in the central government-run hospitals has been increased from 1090 to 3800, they said.The per day oxygen allocation to Delhi has been increased from 378 MT to 480 MT, they said, adding that the movement of allocated oxygen supplies is being monitored on a real-time basis.

A woman whose husband had been lying in the open since last night for want of bed or oxygen broke down saying, “Aise kaise chalega?”Cries of disbelief and anguish rent the air outside all Delhi hospitals even as state Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was ticked off by the PM for telecasting his live address at the official meet.Kejriwal was heard saying to PM at the meet, “Please, Mr PM, call up the chief ministers of states that are blocking oxygen supplies to Delhi even after you enhanced our quota and also tell us who should we call in the Centre if reports or supply obstruction continue to come in. Will Delhi gasp for oxygen because we do not have oxygen plants here?”The PM interrupted Kejriwal as he relayed his address live and said, “What is being done is against the decorum and discipline of the internal meeting. This is not right.”Kejriwal apologised, saying “Will take care in future and please forgive me for any trespass.”The PM said railways and the IAF had been pressed into service to smoothen oxygen supply. The PM urged states to come down heavily on hoarders and black-marketers of essential medicines and injections and acknowledged that Covid is now affecting several states as well as Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities at once.“We have to work together. If we work together our resources won’t look scarce,” said the PM.On oxygen supply, he said industrial oxygen had been diverted to meet immediate requirement and urged all states to work together and coordinate with one another to fulfil requirements relating to medicines and oxygen.“Every state should ensure that no oxygen tanker, whether it is meant for any state, is stopped or gets stranded. Every state should set up a high-level coordination committee to carry oxygen to different hospitals. This committee should ensure that as soon as there is allotment of oxygen from the Centre, it can deliver oxygen as per requirement in different hospitals of the state immediately.”The PM later met leading oxygen manufacturers and urged them to further boost supplies.After the CMs flagged supply constraints and travel time loss as the major challenges to the oxygen issue, the PM said, “The central government is working all possible options to reduce the travel time and turnaround time of oxygen tankers. For this, the railways has started Oxygen Express. Empty oxygen tankers are also being transported by the Air Force to reduce one-way travel time.”In an important message to states, the PM urged more testing to detect the latent infections. He said the Centre had provided 13 crore vaccine doses free of cost to the states.“We will need to work in mission mode to get more and more people vaccinated,” the PM said, urging hospital safety after oxygen tanker leak at a Nashik hospital left 24 dead.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/deploying-iaf-to-reduce-travel-time-for-oxygen-supply-modi-tells-cms-of-11-high-burden-covid-states-243079

24-04-2021||Dubai||Flight reschedules, cancellations galore as UAE India travel ban nears implementation||The UAE's decision to ban flights from India due to the worsening COVID-19 situation in the country has upset a lot of travel plans as people are making frantic efforts to reach to their destinations before the restrictions come into effect.The UAE has banned travel from India for 10 days from Sunday. The ban will come into effect from 11.59 pm on Saturday, April 24, and is subject to review after 10 days, the Gulf News reported.Passengers who have transited through India in the last 14 days will also not be permitted to board from any other point to the UAE, the report said.However, departure flights will continue to operate and the ban will not extend to UAE citizens, diplomatic passport holders and official delegations, it said.Hajra Memon (name changed on request) was scheduled to travel to Dubai from Kolkata on Flydubai (FZ 4016) on Saturday, April 24, which was scheduled to take off at 2 am. As soon as the announcement came, she made frantic calls to find out whether she can still fly on that schedule.“I just wanted to make sure whether I will be allowed to board on my existing ticket as April 24 should mean the midnight separating Friday and Saturday. When all my calls went unanswered, I had to take a quick call and make a new booking for a Friday morning Emirates flight (EK571), which is scheduled to take off at 9.45 am,” she told PTI.The Dubai-based banker said she had no choice but to pay extra money and get a seat on this flight as she could not afford to stay stranded in India for at least 10 days. “If I was assured I can still on Saturday, I wouldn't have spent the extra bucks,” Menon said.When asked how the ban is impacting travel plans, Nazir Khan of Dubai-based Zain travels said flights are closed from the April 24 for 10 days. So, people who have a visa will either rush to travel on Friday or postpone their travel plan for 10 days, he said.Khan said inflated airline tickets would be the costs involved in most of these cases.“People who have their visas issued but not in a hurry to visit the UAE can defer their plans, but all tickets beyond this date will now have to be rescheduled,” he said, adding that it will take a few days to assess the losses people have incurred as a result of the ban.However, there have also been those who were lucky to escape the travel ban. Delhi-based brothers, Naveen and Armaan, were visiting Dubai and were scheduled to leave on April 25, Sunday. But as their mother wasn't feeling well back home, they flew a couple of days ahead of the schedule.“We really got lucky as getting stranded in Dubai for another 10 days would have been a really costly option for us,” Naveen said.The UAE imposed a travel ban on passengers from India after the country recorded the world's highest number of 3,14,835 COVID-19 cases in one day on Thursday.

24-04-2021||New Delhi||25 Covid patients die at Delhi’s Ganga Ram Hospital in 24 hours; govt sources say sufficient oxygen at facility||Twenty-five Covid patients have died at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here in the last 24 hours, and the lives of 60 other such patients are at risk, officials said on Friday, amid a serious oxygen crisis unfolding in the national capital.Sources said "low pressure oxygen" could be the likely cause for the deaths.A central government source said the SGRH had "sufficient balance of oxygen and a tanker has reached the hospital, which will fill up the storage capacity".The tanker reached the hospital around 9.20 am. The stock could last up to five hours, depending on the consumption, an official at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital said."All we need is uninterrupted and timely supply of oxygen,” SGRH Chairman Dr DS Rana said.There are more than 500 coronavirus patients, including around 150 on high-flow oxygen support, admitted to the hospital located in central Delhi."Ventilators and BiPAP machines are not working effectively. Lives of 60 other patients at risk. Major crisis likely," a senior official at the hospital said.The hospital authorities are resorting to manual ventilation in ICUs and the emergency department, according to the official.On Thursday night, the hospital officials had sent an SOS to the government, saying there's only five hours of oxygen left at the health care facility and requesting that it be replenished urgently."At 8 pm, oxygen in store is for five hours for peripheral use till 1 am and less for high-flow use. Need urgent oxygen supplies," an official had said.The hospital had received some oxygen around 12.30 am, but the stock had to be supplemented later, sources said."A tanker carrying two tonnes of oxygen is stuck near Ambedkar Hospital," a source said.Several private hospitals in the city have been struggling to replenish their oxygen supply for the last four days.Some of them have even requested the Delhi government to transfer patients to other health care facilities.While some hospitals have managed to make short-term arrangements, there is no immediate end to the crisis in sight, a government official had said on Thursday.In a letter to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said six private hospitals had exhausted their oxygen supply by Thursday evening.As patients and their family members waited outside hospitals, hoping to get a bed, Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday had said beds would be increased in large numbers once the oxygen crisis was resolved.A government doctor said hospitals in Delhi are wary of admitting more patients amid a serious shortage of oxygen in the city.

24-04-2021||Virar (Maharashtra)||Another hospital, another fire; 14 die in ICU blaze in Maharashtra's Virar||Fourteen COVID-19 patients died after a fire broke out at the intensive care unit of a private hospital in Palghar district of Maharashtra on Friday, police said.While 13 were charred to death in the ICU, one patient died while being taken to another hospital, an official said.There were 83 patients in the hospital, 17 of them in the ICU when the fire broke out after a blast in the AC unit, an official said.TV visuals showed the smoke-filled ICU in disarray after the blaze, with the ceiling falling off in some places, beds and other furniture strewn around and kin of the deceased wailing outside the hospital.The fire broke out in the ICU located on the second floor of the four-storeyed Vijay Vallabh Hospital at Virar shortly after 3 am, an official said. It was extinguished at 5.20 am, he added.The other patients in the hospital were not affected as the damage was confined to the ICU, the official said.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray expressed grief over the tragedy and directed the local administration to probe the cause of the blaze.Thackeray also announced an assistance of Rs five lakh to the families of each deceased.“The fire at a COVID-19 hospital in Virar is tragic.Condolences to those who lost their loved ones. May the injured recover soon,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.“PM@narendramodi has approved an ex-gratia of Rs. 2 lakh each from PMNRF for the next of kin of those who have lost their lives due to the hospital fire in Virar, Maharashtra. Rs. 50,000 would be given to those seriously injured,” the PMO tweeted.Fire at Vijay Vallabha hospital, Mumbai on Friday.

24-04-2021||New Delhi||Private Covid vaccination centres to procure directly from manufacturers starting May 1||From May 1, the present system of private COVID-19 vaccination centres receiving doses from the government and charging up to Rs 250 per dose will cease to exist and they will procure directly from vaccine manufacturers. According to the Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy, COVID-19 vaccination will continue to be free for eligible population groups comprising health care workers, frontline workers and population above 45 years of age in government COVID vaccination centres which receive doses from the Government of India.Vaccine manufacturers would make an advance declaration of the price for 50 per cent supply that would be available to state governments in the open market before May 1.  Based on this price, states, private hospitals, industrial establishments may procure vaccine doses from manufacturers.  Private hospitals would have to procure their supplies of COVID-19 vaccine exclusively from the 50 per cent supply earmarked for other than the Government of India channel. The price charged for vaccination by private hospitals would be monitored, it said.  "Consequently the present dispensation where private COVID vaccination centres receive doses from the government and can charge up to Rs.250 per dose will cease to exist," the Union Health ministry document said.Vaccine manufacturers would supply 50 per cent of their monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) released doses to the Government of India and would be free to supply the remaining 50 per cent doses to state governments and in the open market.  For the Government of India vaccination centres, the eligible population would be the same which exists today that is healthcare workers (HCWs), frontline workers (FLWs) and population above 45 years of age.  For other than the government of India channel, the eligibility would be all adult citizens of the country, the document said.The COVID-19 vaccination will continue to be free for eligible population groups in all those Government COVID Vaccination Centres which receive vaccine doses from the Government of India.  All vaccination (through Govt. of India vaccination centres and other than Govt. of India channel) would be part of the National Vaccination Programme, will follow all existing guidelines, will be captured on CoWIN platform along with the stocks and price per vaccination applicable in all vaccination centres, will comply with Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) management and reporting, digital vaccination certificate and all other prescribed norms.  The division of vaccine supply which would mean 50 per cent to Govt of India and 50 per cent to other than Govt of India channel would be applicable uniformly across all vaccines manufactured in the country.  However, the fully ready to use imported vaccine would be allowed to be utilized entirely the other than Government of India channel.  The Centre from its share will allocate vaccines to states and UTs based on the criteria of performance (speed of administration, average consumption), the extent of infections (number of active Covid cases), the document stated.Wastage of vaccine will also be considered in the criteria and will affect the allocation negatively. Based on the above criteria, the state-wise quota would be decided and communicated to the states in advance.  The second dose of all existing priority groups i.e. HCWs, FLWs and population above 45 years, where ever it has become due, would be given priority, for which a specific and focused strategy would be communicated to all stakeholders.  This policy would come into effect from May 1 and will be reviewed from time to time.  "The Government of India will make an advance purchase offer for a maximum quantity that manufacturers commit to supply by a pre-defined period. Such an advance purchase provision signals Government's willingness to pay upfront to vaccine manufacturers to enable them to augment their production and supply capacities," the document said.    In its phase-III, the National Vaccine Strategy aims at liberalized vaccine pricing and scaling up vaccine coverage.  This would incentivise vaccine manufacturers to rapidly scale up their production and also attract new vaccine manufacturers.  It would make pricing, procurement and administration of vaccines more flexible and ensure augmented vaccine production as well as wider availability of vaccines in the country, the document said.--PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/private-covid-vaccination-centres-to-procure-directly-from-manufacturers-starting-may-1-242171
24-04-2021||Washington||Public healthcare expert recommends new COVID-19 vaccine strategy for India||As India experiences a new wave of COVID-19 pandemic, an Indian public healthcare expert has called for adopting a “build, buy and jab” strategy for mass vaccination to handle the crisis along with the enforcement of appropriate behaviours and continuous communication from doctors, political leaders and administration.“We are witnessing an awful resurgence of the pandemic in India, where it was perceived, just a few months back, to be essentially over. Unfortunately, it lurked in the population and hit back with a vengeance when our guard was down,” Indian civil servant Dr Mrinalini Darswal, currently pursuing doctoral studies in public health with a focus on COVID-19 at Harvard University, told PTI.It may be attributed in part to the pandemic fatigue in a population that relies on hard labour to earn a living and for whom waiting out the crisis over a prolonged period is not an option. However, the main reason seems to be the immune evading and highly infectious mutants, she said.A 2002-batch Odisha-cadre IAS officer, Darswal served as Special Secretary, Health; Commissioner Food Safety; Drugs Controller, and Project Director for HIV/AIDS Control Programme for the Delhi government.Darswal, who recently earned MSc Economics at University of Texas at Austin, argued that this virus is more elusive and unpredictable than the viruses that have been dealt with before, like flu and HIV. As such, vaccination is unlikely to be a successful strategy in isolation.At the current rate of vaccination, it would take two years to cover 75 per cent of the Indian population, she said, adding that to get back to normal, there is a need to step up speed and coverage of the population manifold.“As we aim to achieve the goal of full coverage, we need to move strategically,” Darswal said and called for the new potential strategy “build, buy and jab”.“Build: We did exceptionally well in rolling out indigenous vaccines like Covaxin by utilising our expertise and getting priority allocation of Covishield from the Serum Institute of India (SII) -- the biggest vaccine manufacturer in the world. Given the sheer number of people we need to vaccinate, the quantum is falling short of the requirement,” she said.There are at least two major concerns with this gap, Darswal said. First: the transmission of the virus is not suppressed enough for us to go back to normal. Second: the 'to and from' transmission of infection from non-vaccinated to vaccinated population gives a vast laboratory to the virus to learn to evade the immune response and develop into more virulent forms.“That means we need to come up with modified vaccines frequently, and the goal of achieving transmission control through herd immunity will stretch indefinitely.“Therefore, other indigenous vaccine developments, trials, and Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) need to be fast-tracked. Government must keep a keen eye on raw material shortages faced by the SII in the production of the Novavax vaccine due to the export embargo on bags and filters imposed by the Biden administration under the Defence Production Act,” she said.Production of other stuff like gloves, refrigerators, syringes among others also needs a full assessment, regulatory ease, and oversight for the long term.Observing that meeting the entire requirement for vaccines within the home is possible but would take a long time, Darswal said utilising India's pharmaceutical manufacturing strength to get licenses for new manufacture and distribution of vaccines like the mRNA vaccines is something they can seriously consider.And finally, India needs to replicate the Bhutan model in thousands of locations using a Primary Health Care (PHC) as the focal center. Using vaccines gifted by India, Bhutan vaccinated its entire population in two weeks.Vaccine coverage must be provided at worksites like factories, big markets through market associations among others to ensure workers get vaccinated. Their safety will prevent mass migration as seen during the first lockdown, keep them safe, and add to the communities' overall immunity, she said.“Even with a low attributable death rate, given that many people are getting infected in this new wave, the absolute count we may face may be staggering and spread panic among the people. Continuous communication from doctors, political leaders, and administrators is essential to calm the sentiments in this critical time,” said Darswal, who was a medical doctor before becoming an IAS officer.“These measures need to be bolstered by solid regulation enforcing mandatory covid appropriate behaviours like universal mask-wearing, prohibition of activities where people can gather and form crowds, and compulsory maintenance of social distance when out. Only by being vigilant and responsible can we hope to minimise the damage of the current wave and make fast strides in beating the pandemic for good,” she said.According to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Wednesday, the  single day rise in new coronavirus infections inched closer to 3 lakh, pushing India's total tally of COVID-19 cases to 1,56,16,130, while the death toll increased to 1,82,553 with a record 2,023 daily fatalities.A total of 2,95,041 fresh infections were registered in a span of 24 hours, while the active cases crossed the 21-lakh mark, it said.
