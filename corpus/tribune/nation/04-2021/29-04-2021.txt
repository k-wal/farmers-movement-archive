They have also termed the Centre’s new vaccination policy discriminatory.In a tweet on Thursday, Gandhi further stressed his demand.“free /fri?/ adjective, adverb—costing nothing, or not needing to be paid for,” he wrote and then went on to illustrate the usage of the word “free” through two examples relevant to his demands, “India must get free COVID vaccine. All citizens must receive the inoculation free of charge.free /friː/adjective, adverbcosting nothing, or not needing to be paid for. e.g.-• India must get free COVID vaccine. • All citizens must receive the inoculation free of charge. Let’s hope they get it this time. #vaccine  “Let’s hope they get it this time,” he wrote on Twitter with the hashtag #vaccine.In another tweet in Hindi, the former Congress chief hit out at the government, saying the one who does not listen to people’s pain and emotions does not have a heart but a stone.“One who is not filled with emotions, who is not willing to listen to people’s pain, he has a stone and not a heart, the ‘system’ that the public does not love,” he said.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh demanded the option of on-the-spot registration for all adults at the inoculation centres, saying the online process may end up excluding many.“I fail to understand why BOTH options of online pre-registration and on-the-spot registration for walk-ins should not be allowed for vaccination. Online registration should help not hamper. In India’s case, mandatory online registration may end up excluding many,” the former Union minister wrote on Twitter.

They, however, have found the place feasible to start a COVID care facility.”He said, “They do not-have spare manpower and they are not in a position to supply the hardware also.

29-04-2021||Islamabad||Pakistan’s Khewra rock salt to be registered with international trade bodies: Report||Pakistan could take the lead in the global salt trade as the local rock salt of Khewra in Punjab province is set to be registered with international trade bodies that will prevent Indian traders to market Pakistani rock salt as Himalayan Pink Salt, according to a media report on Thursday.Pakistan Minerals Development Corporation (PMDC), designated by the Cabinet as the registrant agency for rock salt produced in the country, has finalised requirements for registration of rock salt with the Geographical Indications (GI) registry, under the management and control of Intellectual Property Organisationof Pakistan (IPO-Pakistan).After the registration with IPO-Pakistan, the country will file for registration at foreign markets which will prevent Indian traders to market Pakistani rock salt as Himalayan Pink Salt, the Dawn News reported.The GI rules were formulated in January this year in the country that had been pending for around two decades, but traders from India took advantage of the vacuum and applied for GI tagging of Basmati rice in the European Union, claiming that it was an agricultural produce of India, the report said.The PMDC Managing Director (retired Brig) M Iqbal Malik said Pakistan has branded the Khewra salt as “Pink Rock Salt” and its specifications were being finalised.“Currently, rock salt was neither a lucrative commodity for exports nor was Pakistan selling the rock salt as a commercial and industrial product,” he said, adding, “soon after the GI tagging at international markets, Pakistan will be in a position to sign long term sale contracts with buyers abroad.”      Incidentally the term, Himalayan Pink Salt has been used by Indian traders for global marketing of rock salt mined from Khewra, however, after trade of non-essential items with India was suspended around two years back, salt exports to India were also suspended.Since, there is no sale policy regarding rock salt, most of the rock salt was exported in rock form to the Middle East.A Karachi-based salt trader Ahmed Khan said there is a very high global demand for rock salt, not only as table salt but even as a healing agent by massage centres of Korea and Thailand to other industrial usages.He claimed that salt bought by Indian traders in the UAE was re-exported in small and attractive packs at a very high price to the European Union, the US and even the far East, with labels showing that this salt was a product of the Indian Himalayas.

Its current supply will last for two hours, the institute’s medical director Dr Ubaid Hamid said.“We have been facing an oxygen shortage for the last few days. The tanker was supposed to arrive around 3 pm but it didn’t. The district magistrate, SDM and DCP of the area arranged a government tanker and we received 800 litres of oxygen, which will last for two hours,” he said.The hospital has 210 patients, out of which 170 patients are oxygen dependent with the daily requirement being five metric tonnes, Hamid said.He said that the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) has spoken to the company for the tanker and the hospital expects it to arrive by evening.Jasbir Dabas, owner of Rosewood Hospital, said it has only half an hour of the life-saving gas left.“We have around 40 patients admitted in our hospital and we have informed them about the shortage. Our cylinders are at Mayapuri waiting to be refilled. The government has prepared a list of hospitals who will be provided oxygen but what about the other hospitals. We need help,” he said.Delhi recorded 368 more COVID-19 deaths and 25,986 new cases of the infection on Wednesday with a positivity rate of 31.76 per cent, according to the latest bulletin issued by the city health department.

29-04-2021||New Delhi||Domestic travel bans can increase COVID-19 cases: Study||Domestic travel bans can increase COVID-19 cases, a new research by the University of Chicago has found.According to a statement from the university, the study using data from India and five other countries finds that using domestic travel bans to control COVID-19 infections may be inadvisable.The study has found that imposing travel bans can counter-intuitively increase the total spread of coronavirus disease, creating a “lose-lose situation”, the university said in the statement.Elaborating on these findings, Anant Sudarshan, South Asia Director of The Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago and one of the study authors, said the national lockdown in the first wave trapped millions of migrants inside big cities like Mumbai that were fast-growing coronavirus hotspots.“Eventually people were able to leave, but variations in government policy meant that the length of time they were detained depended on where they wanted to go. In the case of rural districts where people could return quicker – using the Shramik Special Trains for example - cases rose modestly at the destination,” he said.“But for those areas where bans were in effect longer, there was a much more intensive increase in coronavirus, likely because the returning population was now more likely to be infected, having been trapped in the hotspot longer,” he said.The paper further analyses data from five other countries where migration is prevalent – China, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Africa, and Kenya.Together these countries comprise roughly 40 per cent of the global population and all of them had initial outbreaks in a few hotspot locations.The researchers used epidemiological data, migration data, and information on travel bans from all these countries to show that although exceptionally long bans may work to reduce total cases, moderate durations are associated with significant increases in disease spread.Fiona Burlig, Assistant Professor at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, one of the co-authors of the study, said the evidence indicates that if the duration of a travel ban is not long enough, we may end up imposing hardship on people while perversely seeing more spread of infection.“Getting the duration wrong is easy because it is not possible to predict in advance what the optimal length should be, and in a democracy such restrictions cannot be easily sustained. There may be merit in letting people go home early, and indeed encourage them to do so, rather than forcing them to stay,” Burlig said.

29-04-2021||New Delhi||Cases against people for protests is curb on freedom of speech: Former SC judge||Filing of cases against people protesting against government is curtailment of freedom of speech and expression, former Supreme Court judge justice Madan B Lokur has said.“In recent past there has been an alarming increase in speech related sedition cases. Sedition is a very serious charge. We have had freedom fighters like Gandhiji, Lok Manya Tilak who have been accused of sedition and today the common man is being accused of sedition,” Justice Lokur said.“When there were protests against Citizenship Amendment Act, 25 cases of sedition were filed against 3700 persons. When gang rape and murder of young girl took place in Hathras, 22 cases of sedition were filed against 23 persons. Can anybody objecting to gang rape and murder be accused of sedition?” he said.Justice Lokur was speaking at the inaugural Madhu Babu Memorial Lecture organised by Odisha Dialogues on Wednesday on topic, ‘Can India’s Judiciary Rescue Her Democracy?’He cited a recent incident in Uttar Pradesh involving a man who tweeted for help seeking oxygen for his ailing 88-year-old grandfather and the Amethi police booked him under the Epidemic Act, accusing him of creating fear among the people.“So if a person seeks help on social media, he is committing an offence. These are ways and means by which freedom of speech and expression are being curtailed,” he said.Justice Lokur also expressed concern over state of judiciary and said, “the judiciary has to first put its own house in order”.“Appointment of Judges has been stalled for months and for few years in some cases. There are huge shortages of infrastructure. There is 40 per cent vacancy in High Courts and 20 per cent in trial courts. There is lack of transparency in the functioning of the judiciary. More importantly, the independence of the judiciary is being increasingly viewed with suspicion.“We need to seriously introspect. Are we doing the right thing,” he asked, referring to the current state of the Indian judiciary.“How can the judiciary rescue democracy? … Can it rescue itself to some extent? I don’t know; I leave that you - the citizens,” he said.Justice Lokur said free and fair elections, fundamental freedom and an independent judiciary are some components of India’s democracy.Commenting on use of electoral bonds in elections, Justice Lokur said hundreds of crores are being collected through non-transparent electoral bonds and spent on state elections at a time when the country is short on resources to fight the pandemic.

29-04-2021||New Delhi||AYUSH-64 drug useful in treating mild to moderate COVID-19 cases: AYUSH ministry||AYUSH-64, a drug developed for curing malaria in 1980, can be useful for the treatment of asymptomatic, mild and moderate COVID-19 infection cases, the Ministry of AYUSH said on Thursday.Addressing a virtual press conference, Arvind Chopra, director, Centre for Rheumatic Diseases, Pune, said the trial of the drug in this direction was conducted at three centres.The trial at King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow; Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences (DMIMS), Wardha; and BMC COVID Centre, Mumbai involved 70 participants in each arm.Chopra, also honorary chief clinical coordinator of the Ministry of AYUSH-CSIR collaboration, said AYUSH-64 as an adjunct to standard of care (SoC) showed significant improvement and thus lesser period of hospitalisation as compared to SoC alone.He said several significant beneficial effects of the drug on general health, fatigue, anxiety, stress, appetite, general happiness and sleep were also observed.“The drug’s trial study has provided substantial evidence that AYUSH-64 can be effectively and safely used to treat mild to moderate cases of COVID-19 as adjuvant to SoC,” he said.The official, however, said patients on AYUSH-64 drug will still require monitoring so as to identify any worsening of disease requiring more intensive therapy with oxygen and other treatment measures provided during hospitalisation.“It is useful in the treatment of asymptomatic, mild and moderate COVID-19 infection as an adjunct to standard care. It is worthwhile to mention that initially the drug was developed for malaria in the year 1980 and now is repurposed for COVID-19,” he said.The Ayush-CSIR Joint Monitoring Committee has also recommended the ministry to communicate to state licensing authorities/regulators regarding adding new indication of AYUSH-64 for repurposing in the management of mild to moderate COVID-19.AYUSH-64 comprises Alstonia scholaris (aqueous bark extract), Picrorhiza kurroa (aqueous rhizome extract), Swertia chirata (aqueous extract of whole plant) and Caesalpinia crista (fine-powdered seed pulp).“It is extensively studied, scientifically developed, safe and effective Ayurveda formulation. This medicine is also recommended in the National Clinical Management Protocol based on Ayurveda and Yoga, which is vetted by the National Task Force on COVID-19 Management of ICMR,” the ministry said.V M Katoch, former director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the committee has carefully reviewed the outcome of AYUSH-64 study and recommended the use of the drug in the management of asymptomatic, mild to moderate COVID-19 cases.N Srikanth, Director General, Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) noted that additional studies on the drug are underway at reputed research institutes.“Results received so far have shown the usefulness of AYUSH-64 in dealing with mild and moderate COVID-19. The outcome of seven clinical studies has also revealed that the drug exhibits early clinical recovery in COVID-19 cases without further progression. In all the clinical studies, the drug was found to be well tolerated and found clinically safe,” he said.

Col. Wu responded at a regular press conference of the Ministry of National Defence on April 29 that the relevant remarks by the Indian side are completely inconsistent with the facts,” the report said.“Regarding the situations in the western section of the China-India boundary, China has explained the ins and outs in detail, and the responsibility does not lie with China,” he said.“Thanks to the joint efforts of China and India, the border defence troops of both sides have recently disengaged from contact in the Galwan Valley and Lake Pangong, and the situation in the border area has eased on the whole,” Wu said.He said earlier this month, China and India held the 11th round of Corps Commander-Level Meeting, exchanging views on issues of mutual concern and agreeing to continue to maintain close communication through diplomatic and military channels, according to the report.Wu stressed that China’s position on the China-India boundary issue is consistent and clear.China hopes that the Indian side will cherish the hard-won situation, abide by the relevant agreements of the two countries, he said.He said two militaries and the consensus reached in previous talks, and work with China to safeguard peace and tranquillity in the border area, so as to bring the relations between the two countries and two militaries back to the track of healthy and stable development, the report stated.India and China were locked in military standoff at multiple friction points in eastern Ladakh since early May last year but they have completed withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of Pangong Lake in February following a series of military and diplomatic talks.The two sides are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points.

This gaseous oxygen can be utilised for COVID-related needs across existing hospitals and upcoming COVID-19 specific facilities by providing a continuous supply of oxygen, it said.“It has been done by fine-tuning the existing Nitrogen Plant setup and changing the molecular sieves from Carbon to Zeolite,” says Prof Milind Atrey, Dean (R&D), IIT Bombay, who led the project.“Such nitrogen plants, which take air from the atmosphere as raw material, are available in various industrial plants across India. Therefore, each of them could potentially be converted into an oxygen generator, thus helping us tide over the current public health emergency,” he added.The pilot project is a collaborative effort between IIT Bombay, Tata Consulting Engineers and Spantech Engineers, Mumbai, who deal with PSA Nitrogen & Oxygen plant production.A PSA Nitrogen plant in the Refrigeration and Cryogenics Laboratory of IIT||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oxygen-crisis-iit-bombay-shows-the-way-converts-nitrogen-generator-into-oxygen-generator-245912

We have requested the companies to provide it,” Jain told reporters when asked if there were enough vaccines available for the 18-44 age group."We will tell you in a day or two,” he replied to another query about starting the inoculation drive for this category on May 1.He also said that the manufactures are yet to provide a schedule of vaccine supply to the Delhi government.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday had said that everybody aged above 18 would be administered anti-coronavirus vaccines free of cost in Delhi.He had said his government had approved the procurement of 1.34 crore vaccine doses from various manufacturers.Jain ascribed the dip in the number of testing over the few days to the restricted movement of people due to the lockdown.Health authorities in the capital have been conducting around 75,000 tests a day over the last few days. Before that, the average number of tests was around 1 lakh.On the opposition's claim about a big difference in data related to deaths compiled at crematoriums and that released by the Delhi government, Jain, said, “This is not the time to play politics. They had raised the issue six months ago also. Everything was fine.” "Who has the right to hide the number of deaths? Everything is being done in a transparent manner in Delhi,” he added.The minister said there were a few discrepancies in the health bulletin issued on Wednesday night and these have been rectified.Delhi recorded 368 more COVID-19 deaths and 25,986 cases with a positivity rate of 31.76 per cent, according to the latest bulletin issued by the city health department.This was the seventh day on the trot that Delhi had recorded over 300 deaths due to coronavirus.

But our offer stands, and we're willing to help in whatever way we can,” Haq had said Tuesday.Haq said WHO is also helping to set up mobile hospital units and is providing for laboratories.About 2,600 WHO field officers have been immediately deployed to support health authorities to curb the spread of the pandemic.In Maharashtra, UNICEF has engaged experts to work on risk governance. The UN team is also continuing its campaign highlighting the “three Ws: Wear a mask, Wash your Hands, Watch your distance and stay six feet apart,” he said.According to the latest WHO figures, the death toll in India crossed 201,000 and confirmed cases in the country stand at nearly 18 million.“In India's time of need, the UN is doing everything it can to rapidly provide critical equipment and supplies to central and state governments," Dessallien said.The WHO said in a press release that filling critical gaps in essential medical supplies and hospital capacities should be the top priority as India battles surge in COVID-19 cases. WHO is chartering flights to bring in 4,000 oxygen concentrators to help meet the increased demands.“The current rapid surge of COVID-19 cases has put immense pressure on the health systems, already overburdened since the start of the pandemic. We need to act with speed, expand hospital capacities and equip them with medical supplies, most needed to save lives,” Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region, Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh said.A UN News article said the South-East Asian region has led the world in COVID-19 infections for a third straight week, mainly due to the situation in India.In order to make available additional hospital beds and critical equipment for India, WHO is procuring mobile field hospitals with a capacity of 20-30 beds, which could be set up in the most affected areas.The bed capacity at these field hospitals can be increased to a maximum of 50, if needed, without impacting infection prevention and control protocols, and water and sanitation, the WHO release added.The agency is also providing for laboratories to meet the huge demand for testing, and over 2600 WHO technical staff, working on various programmes such as polio, TB and NTD, have been repurposed to support pandemic response in India.WHO is procuring laboratory supplies, including 1.2 million reagents, to meet the huge demand and need for testing.Khetrapal Singh added that with a rapid surge of cases, it is important to triage people well to optimize available resources such as ICU beds. Simultaneously, all efforts need to be made to scale up COVID-19 vaccination coverage, she added.India this week completed a 100-day COVID-19 vaccination drive, with over 145 million doses administered.“Irrespective of the numbers that we see today or the virus variants that may be circulating during the ongoing surge, our key public health measures – test, trace, isolate and treat – along with physical distancing, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and masks continue to be our tried and tested measures to curtail COVID-19 transmission,” she said.Underlining WHO's commitment to continue working with health authorities at all levels, Khetrapal Singh said “Together we must do all we can to halt the current COVID-19 surge”.Haq had said that the UN is in touch with authorities in India at various levels. Chef de Cabinet to the United Nations Secretary-General Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti has been in touch with India's Permanent Representative to the UN T S Tirumurti over the COVID-19 situation in India and other officials in the system have also been in touch with officials both here in New York and on the ground.

The stories coming out of India are just absolutely heart-wrenching, and they're horrifying, where it's the kind of circumstance that we hope never comes to be in our country or in our communities," Murthy told the media on Wednesday."But what India is seeing now are more than 350,000 people a day getting infected. They're seeing the hospital systems in many cities on the brink, unable to meet the full demands, and they're running out of oxygen. They're in a very, very difficult place right now," he said.Responding to a question, Murthy said he was very pleased to see the United States step up and extend help to India in its hour of crisis."The US government will also be sending strike teams from the CDC and the USAID, Agency for International Development, to help India by working with their teams to strengthen laboratory capacity, to help with infection prevention and control," he added."This is what we have to do broadly across the world, because global pandemics require global cooperation and mutual support. And we know that when there's uncontrolled spread of the virus in any part of the world, that means that variants can arise, variants which may over time become resistant to the protection that we get from vaccines, which could mean a real problem for us here in the United States," Murthy said.He said that it is in America's interests to make sure that countries around the world are protected, that they have vaccine, and the ability to limit the spread of infection.

29-04-2021||London||Levels of air pollutants on rise in Indian cities: Study||Levels of air pollutants in Indian cities, including national capital New Delhi, are on the rise, according to a study using observations from instruments on satellites that scan the global skies, emphasising the need to monitor air and importance of ongoing measures for a cleaner environment.Researchers used a long record of data gathered by space-based instruments to estimate trends in a range of air pollutants for 2005 to 2018, timed to coincide with well-established air quality policies in the UK and rapid development in India, a press release issued by the University of Birmingham said.The study was led by the University of Birmingham and UCL and included an international team of contributors from Belgium, India, Jamaica and the UK.The researchers published their findings in the journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, noting that fine particles (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), both hazardous to health, are increasing in Kanpur and Delhi, it said.Delhi is a fast-growing megacity and Kanpur was ranked by the WHO in 2018 as the most polluted city in the world. The researchers speculated that increases in PM2.5 and NO2 in India reflect increasing vehicle ownership, industrialisation and the limited effect of air pollution policies to date.This contrasts with trends in the UK cities, London and Birmingham, which show modest but ongoing declines in PM2.5 and NOx, reflecting the success of policies targeting sources that emit these pollutants.The study also found an increase in the air pollutant formaldehyde in Delhi, Kanpur and London, it said.“We were surprised to see the increase in formaldehyde above Delhi, Kanpur and London – a clue that emissions of other volatile organic compounds may be changing, potentially driven by economic development and changes in domestic behaviour. Our results emphasise the need to monitor our air for the unexpected, and the importance of ongoing enforcement of measures for cleaner air,” the study's co-author Professor William Bloss, also from the University of Birmingham, said.Formaldehyde is a marker for emissions of volatile organic compounds that include a large contribution from vehicle emissions in India, and, in the UK, an increasing contribution from personal care and cleaning products and a range of other household sources.Karn Vohra, the study's lead author and PhD student at the University of Birmingham, said, “we wanted to demonstrate the utility of satellite observations to monitor city-wide air pollution in the UK where ground-based measurements are in abundance and in India where they are not."Our approach will be able to provide useful information about air quality trends in cities with limited surface monitoring capabilities.This is critical as the WHO estimates that outdoor air pollution causes 4.2 million deaths a year." “There is more than a decade of freely available observations from instruments in space to monitor and assess air quality in cities throughout the world. Greater use of these in the UK, India, and beyond is paramount to successful air quality policies,” stated Dr Eloise Marais, Earth observation expert at UCL and conceptual lead of the study.

29-04-2021||Kolkata||Gruelling Bengal polls over, bigger battle ahead for winner||Blotched by violence, vicious personal attacks and jingoistic fulminations, polling for one of the most gruelling and long-drawn West Bengal assembly elections concluded on Thursday with an estimated around 80 per cent of over 84.77 lakh voters exercising their franchise.Arguably the most bitterly fought in a long time, the polls got mired in controversy the very day the Election Commission announced an 8-phase election schedule for the politically volatile state on February 26, drawing accusation from the ruling TMC that it was aimed at helping the BJP.Barring Assam, where the exercise was held in three stages on March 27, April 1 and 6, votes were cast in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and the Union Territory of Puducherry in a single phase on April 6.In Bengal, despite the elections dragging on for over a month—from March 27 to April 29--voter enthusiasm hardly showed any sign of waning, with the turnout ranging between 76.90 per cent in the 7th phase, held amid a raging COVID-19 pandemic, and 86.11 per cent in the second phase, when the contagion seemed like ebbing away.The December 10, 2020 incident in Diamond Harbour near Kolkata, when BJP president J P Nadda’s convoy came under attack by alleged TMC supporters, was portentous of how grimly fought will the elections be a little over three months later.As brickbats rained like hailstones, smashing windscreens of vehicles and injuring many leaders, including BJP’s Bengal minder Kailash Vijayvargiya, ominous clouds had started gathering over the state’s political landscape much before the elections truly got underway.Every few days since, political workers and ground level leaders of the BJP and TMC were reported injured or killed in clashes, or their bodies found in fields and barns and hanging from trees.Mamata Banerjee, arguably fighting the toughest poll of her enviable political career against the battle-hardened election army of the BJP led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, conjured up the weapon of Bengali subnationalism, something never seen before in West Bengal politics, to mount a counteroffensive.The BJP responded to her “jingoistic” tactical manoeuvre of starting the insider-outsider debate by invoking Syama Prasad Mookerjee, the founder of Jana Sangh, the forerunner of the saffron party, calling itself a party which had its roots in Bengal.Whether the weapon of Bengali subnationalism did neutralise the BJP’s aggressive Hindutva campaign, during which chants of “Jai Shri Ram” were heard more as a battle cry than a religious pitch at election rallies, only time will tell.However, the saffron party’s combative Hindutva posturing brought out the hidden Hindu in Banerjee, often accused by the BJP of minority appeasement. She began reminding people attending her rallies of her being a Brahmin, and reciting ‘Chandi Path’, an ode to Goddess Durga, alongside verses of Quran.However, unsure whether her soft Hindutva will cut ice with hardline Hindu voters, Banerjee, at a rally in Hooghly district, appealed to Muslims not to allow their votes to get divided, drawing flak from the Election Commission, which was also upset with her remarks that central forces on election duty were “helping the BJP under instructions from Home Minister Amit Shah”.The EC stopped Banerjee from campaigning for 24 hours for her “highly insinuating and provocative remarks laden with serious potential of the breakdown of law and order” and one that had “communal overtones”. The often rambunctious Bengal leader staged a sit-in following the order.“Bhaipo” (nephew) and “tolabaji” (extortion) became catchwords in the BJP’s campaign lexicon to attack Mamata Banerjee, whose nephew and Diamond Harbour MP Abhishek the BJP accused of running syndicates which took bribes “even for issuing death certificates”.Banerjee shot back with vengeance. Calling Home Minister Amit Shah a “demon”, the chief minister took a swipe at Modi over his beard, saying, “Industrial growth has stopped and only Modi’s beard is growing”.“Sometimes he calls himself Swami Vivekananda and sometimes renames stadiums after his own name. Something is wrong with his brain. It seems a screw is loose,” said told a rally as electoral discourse plumbed new depths.As violent clashes continued to rattle the state with alarming frequency widening political and societal chasm, came the fourth phase of polling on April 10 when five people were killed at Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar district, including four in firing by CISF personnel in “self defence” after they allegedly came under attack by a mob.Banerjee claimed the four belonging to the minority community were TMC supporters who were killed in a “genocide” while standing in queue to vote.Several BJP leaders including its state chief Dilip Ghosh made patently intemperate remarks, inviting notices from the election watchdog.“Where did so many naughty boys come from? There can be more Sitalkuchi-like incidents if naughty boys like the ones who received bullets try to take law into their hands,” Ghosh had said after the incident.The EC, while issuing a notice to Ghosh, said his remarks were “provocative”, could incite “emotions” and “lead to a breakdown of law and order thereby adversely affecting the election process”.Rahul Sinha, another senior BJP leader, stirred the pot further with his remarks that “eight not four people should have been shot” in the incident, provoking the poll panel to bar him from campaigning for 48 hours. Sinha is a former national secretary of the BJP.As the election process meandered unhurriedly through its course, the COVID-19 scourge that appeared to have been tamed in the initial stages began rearing its ugly head.As experts sounded an alarm while rival contenders for power held massive rallies where COVID-19 norms were flouted with impunity, the TMC knocked on the doors of the Election Commission for clubbing together the last three phases of polling but its request was turned down.Various high courts came down hard on the Centre and state governments over spurting COVID cases, and the Madras High Court chastised the Election Commission, holding it “singularly” responsible for its spread and calling the poll panel “the most irresponsible institution”.The TMC, which repeatedly criticised the election panel over the protracted state polls, protested indignantly, saying, “The Centre and the EC have the blood of COVID-19 patients on their hands as they refused to consider the serious threat to the health of the people and stuck to their agenda.”On May 2, when the votes are counted, there will be no victory lap for the winner of the rancour-filled electoral battle but yet another daunting fight against a bigger, invisible enemy—the coronavirus.

29-04-2021||Washington||US delivering supplies worth USD 100 million to India; first flight to land today: White House||The United States will be delivering Covid relief materials worth over USD100 million to India in the coming days, the White House said as the first flight carrying urgent health supplies left for the country.The flight took off from the Travis Air Force Base on the world’s largest military aircraft on Wednesday night, the US Agency for International Development said.The shipment includes 440 oxygen cylinders and regulators, generously donated by the state of California, USAID said.In addition, on this first flight, USAID is sending 960,000 Rapid Diagnostic Tests to identify infections early to help prevent the community spread of Covid, and 100,000 N95 masks to protect India’s frontline health-care heroes, it added.US state governments, private companies, non-government organisations and thousands of Americans from across the country have mobilised to deliver vital oxygen-related equipment and essential supplies to Indian hospitals during the current outbreak, the White House said.Asserting that this reflects America's solidarity with India as it battles a new wave of COVID-19, the White House said that the immediate emergency assistance includes oxygen support, oxygen concentrators, oxygen generation units, personal protective equipment, vaccine manufacturing supplies and rapid diagnostic tests.According to the White House, an initial delivery of 1,100 cylinders will remain in India and can be repeatedly refilled at local supply centres, with planeloads more to come.The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has also locally procured oxygen cylinders and will deliver them to support hospital systems in coordination with the Government of India, it said.The US is providing Oxygen Generation Units (PSA Systems) as well."Multiple large-scale units to support up to 20 patients each, and additional mobile units will provide an ability to target specific shortages. A team of US experts will support these units, working hand-in-hand on the ground with Indian medical personnel," the White House said.The US is further providing 15 million N95 masks to protect both patients and Indian health-care personnel.The Biden administration has re-directed its own order of AstraZeneca manufacturing supplies to India. This will allow India to make over 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, the White House said.According to a factsheet issued by the White House, the US is providing the first tranche of a planned 20,000 treatment courses of the antiviral drug remdesivir to help treat hospitalised patients.Further, the CDC experts will work hand-in-hand with India's experts in the areas of laboratory, surveillance and epidemiology, bioinformatics for genomic sequencing and modelling, infection prevention and control, vaccine rollout, and risk communication, it said.Observing that the US and India have closely worked together to respond to the pandemic, the White House said American COVID-19 assistance has reached more than 9.7 million Indians across more than 20 states and union territories.The US has partnered with more than 1,000 Indian health-care facilities to strengthen preparedness, including training of over 14,000 people on infection prevention and control, it said.

Similarly, doxycycline has jumped from Rs 6,000 per kg to Rs 12,000 per kg and the price of azithromycin has increased to Rs 11,500 per kg from Rs 8,000 per kg prevailing in the market a few weeks ago, said Yuvraj Chhoker, who runs Tiruvision Medicare in Baddi.Even packaging material like foil and cartons has registered a price hike of 10 to 20 per cent and empty capsules have become dearer by 30 to 40 per cent. The price of I gram maropenem, another raw material, has increased from Rs 100 to Rs 180 added Chhoker.“The price of the APIs has increased by as much as 300 per cent ever since the second wave of Covid has erupted. There was no check on the price by the government. Since the price of the medicines manufactured using these ingredients is regulated under the drug price control order, their maximum price cannot be enhanced,” said SL Singla, adviser, Himachal Pradesh Drug Manufacturers Association.“Azithromycin has gone off the shelf today as its manufacturing has become unviable. More drugs would follow suit if the government doesn’t intervene to either regulate the price of the APIs or to enhance the price of the final product,” claimed Singla.Drug manufacturers asserted that they had given up their margins in this hour of crisis, but the government had done little to address their representations.With China suspending cargo flights to India, the manufacturers feared that more trouble was in the offing. A sizeable chunk of the APIs comes from China.Pharma companies are largely dependent on China for their API requirement. A sizeable decline in imports from China triggered its shortage in the domestic markets since the advent of Covid. The API shortage led to uncertainty in the market, fuelling price hike. Also, there was a scramble to manufacture these drugs due to their burgeoning demand, said a manufacturer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/paracetamol-azithro-raw-material-cost-shoots-up-pharma-cos-worried-245629

29-04-2021||New Delhi||India’s GDP to grow at 11% this fiscal: Asian Development Bank||The Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Wednesday said the Indian economy is projected to grow at 11 per cent in the current financial year on the back of the strong vaccination programme, but cautioned that the second Covid wave is worrying.“India’s economy is expected to grow 11 per cent in fiscal year (FY) 2021, which ends on March 31, 2022, amid a strong vaccine drive. However, the recent surge in Covid-19 cases may put this recovery at risk,” said the Asian Development Outlook (ADO) 2021.Continued economic recovery boosted by increased public investment, vaccine rollout and a surge in domestic demand will trigger this strong rebound, the ADB said.The predictions are based on assumption that there is extensive vaccine deployment across the country and the second wave of Covid is contained.According to ADB’s flagship publication Asian Development Outlook, “The second wave of Covid-19 cases is worrying, especially if vaccine rollout faulters or fails to contain it.”Another risk is further tightening of global financial conditions, which would apply pressure on India’s market interest rates and therefore affect economic normalisation, the report added.Going further, the ADB forecasts India’s economic growth to moderate to 7 per cent in FY2022, on account of disappearance of base effect.The economy is expected to have contracted by 8 per cent in FY2020, in line with the government’s second advance estimate, it said.ADB Country Director for India Takeo Konishi said India’s economy faced its worst contraction in FY2020 due to the Covid-19 shock.“With large government stimulus and the ongoing vaccination drive, we expect economic activity will continue its recovery that started from the third quarter of FY2020 and rebound strongly in the current fiscal year with an uptick in domestic demand, especially in urban services,” said Konishi.2nd wave poses downside risk to growth: S&PNew Delhi: S&P Global Ratings on Wednesday said the second wave of Covid poses downside risks to India’s GDP and heightens the possibility of business disruptions.

But Chinese medical suppliers are working overtime with at least 25,000 orders for oxygen concentrators placed in recent days. Cargo planes are under plan for medical supplies and the Chinese customs will facilitate relevant process, said Chinese ambassador to India Sun Weidong.Aid being received by the Centre is being routed through the Indian Red Cross Association for distribution to states while some NGOs are receiving help directly, said the sources.

Central Govt with a vision- essential”.                The construction work of a new parliament building and the revamp of Rajpath are underway as part of the Central Vista redevelopment work.On April 19, the Delhi Police had given its nod for the movement of vehicles ferrying workers engaged in the project during lockdown following the request of CPWD  --- the executing agency of the ambitious plan.“We have given permission to the request of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD). The permission has been granted for the onsite work. No movement from the outside is permissible,” a senior police officer told PTI.According to DDMA’s order, construction work has been allowed at those construction sites where workers have been given on-site accommodation.An official at the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) said: “We are continuing the work to the extent possible with the labour available at site.”         TMC national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Derek O’Brien took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah over the project.“Why are we in the Opposition criticising the Central Vista project? It is a very, very important project! Modi must have a peacock garden built next to his new office and Shah must have a verandah next to his office for his three pet poodles ( also known as the EC).“This is why the central Vista project is needed. We, the silly opposition, want the Rs 20,000 crores being spent for central Vista to be used instead to vaccinate 80 per cent of the people of India. Priorities?” O’Brien told PTI.Delhi logged a record 381 COVID-19 deaths on Tuesday, while the positivity rate stood at 32.72 per cent.The redevelopment project of Central Vista—the nation’s power corridor—also envisages a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat and revamping of the three-km-long Rajpath, from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate.Congress leader Digvijaya Singh also slammed the government for continuing with the construction work even during lockdown.“They are heartless ruthless pair of Twins. They are not releasing our MP LAD fund through which we can extend help in our Constituencies. Central Vista and new Parliament building could have waited but Modi ji give more funds to fight COVID, release our MPLAD fund,” Singh said on Twitter.Last year, the CPWD had revised the estimated cost from Rs 11,794 crore to Rs 13,450 crore.According to the CPWD’s proposal, the prime minister’s new residence will be built on a 15-acre plot and it will have 10 buildings and they will have ground plus three floors.

29-04-2021||New Delhi||Serum Institute brings Covishield procurement price for states down to Rs 300||Serum Institute of India said it was reducing its vaccine Covishield’s procurement price for states from Ra 400 to Rs 300 a dose—a development that comes after India’s vaccine makers faced backlash over their prices as registration opened for people over 18.SII’s Chief Executive Office Adar Poonawalla said in a tweet that the company, one of  India’s leading vaccine maker, had brought down the price of the Oxford vaccine after a meeting with the central government.Read also: SII CEO Adar Poonawalla to get ‘Y’ category security“As a philanthropic gesture on behalf of @SerumInstIndia, I hereby reduce the price to the states from Rs.400 to Rs.300 per dose, effective immediately; this will save thousands of crores of state funds going forward. This will enable more vaccinations and save countless lives,” the tweet said.He said nothing about prices at which private hospitals could buy it, which presumably remains the same at Rs 600 a dose.India's other vaccine maker making COVID vaccines, Bharat Biotech, is expected to follow suit. The vaccine maker, whose COVAXIN was developed in association with Indian Council for Medical Research, India's leading medical research fraternity, had announced its new vaccine prices earlier this week—Rs 600 for states and double that, Rs 1,200, for private hospitals. The prices have drawn significant backlash in India. The development comes as the country faces an unprecedented and crippling health crisis that has swamped its healthcare facilities. A similar lowering of prices or expected from Bharat Biotech for COVAXIN. Opposition states have been demanding uniformity in vaccine pricing, with SII charging the Centre Rs 150 a dose for the pre-booked orders.As a philanthropic gesture on behalf of @SerumInstIndia, I hereby reduce the price to the states from Rs.400 to Rs.300 per dose, effective immediately; this will save thousands of crores of state funds going forward.

This will improve access to oxygen, especially in district HQs and Tier-2 cities.”These 500 PSA plants will be established with the transfer of the indigenous technology developed by DRDO and CSIR to the domestic manufacturers.Establishing PSA plants and procurement of portable oxygen concentrators will greatly augment the supply of oxygen near the demand clusters, thereby addressing the current logistical challenges in transporting oxygen from plants to hospitals, the statement said.The demand for life-saving gas has increased with the surge in the COVID cases with several hospitals sending out SOS for its supply. Several deaths have also been reported due to lack of oxygen supply in hospitals.

29-04-2021||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||Cowin, Aarogya Setu crash as citizens over 18 rush to register for vaccines||The central government’s CoWIN website and Aarogya Setu app faced glitches and server problems on Wednesday within minutes of opening registration for people over 18 as several thousand Indians tried to register for the vaccination drive amid a growing surge of COVID-19 cases in the country.Several people took to Twitter and Facebook about server problems as registrations opened at 4 pm on Wednesday.Initial complaints were about people not receiving one-time passwords required for the process, but servers crashed less than 30 minutes into registration. Some said although they could register, slots were still unavailable for people over 18.  Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said people are unable to log on to the CoWIN web portal for registering themselves for the next vaccination phase starting May 1 and highlighted the "shortage" of vaccines in the country.At 4.35 pm, a tweet from the verified Twitter handle of the Aarogya Setu mobile application said the CoWIN portal is working and that there was a minor glitch at 4 pm, which was fixed."Cowin portal is working. There was a minor glitch at 4 pm that was fixed. 18 plus can register," it said.At 4.54 pm, a tweet from the same handle stated: "Vaccination appointments for 18 plus will be possible once the state governments and private vaccination centres schedule vaccination sessions. Registration is happening on cowin.gov.in." Registration for the newly-eligible category for COVID-19 vaccination is possible through the CoWIN platform and the Aarogya Setu app.The government of India’s servers for vaccine registration faced similar issues when registration first opened for the elderly last month.As provided in the Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National COVID-19 Vaccination Strategy document, all priority groups such as healthcare workers, frontline workers and citizens aged 45 years and above shall continue to be eligible for vaccination for free from government CVCs and on payment from private CVCS. After registration, taking an appointment to get a COVID-19 vaccine jab would be mandatory for those between 18 and 44. Walk-ins will not be allowed initially.Those over 45 could still opt for on-site registration to get vaccinated, officials said.— With PTI#CowinApp not able to register for the vaccine...what next???? pic.twitter.com/B3udqTpPdhyour incognito hack worked.

29-04-2021||Satya Prakash||Jailed Kerala journalist should be moved to Delhi for treatment, Supreme Court tells UP||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 28The Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the Uttar Pradesh government to shift ailing Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan from a hospital in Mathura to a hospital in the national capital for medical treatment.He was arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, in October last year while on his way to Hathras to cover a gang-rape of a Dalit woman."We direct the UP government to shift Kappan to RML Hospital, or AIIMS or any other government hospital. He be transferred back to jail after doctor certify him to have recovered," a Bench led by Chief Justice NV Ramana said.As Solicitor General Tushar Mehta requested the Bench to direct a hospital to vacate a bed for a non-covid patient, the CJI said, "Mr Mehta, you sort it out with the government. Leave it here."Kappan's wife Raihanth Kappan and Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) had sought the court's immediate intervention, alleging that he had been chained to his hospital bed in Mathura despite being Covid positive.Disposing of their petitions, the Bench said the accused might approach the subordinate court for regular bail.Mehta told the Bench that Kappan was a covid-negative patient and was getting treatment for his other ailments.In the pre-lunch session, the court had asked the UP government to inform it by 1 pm if it's ready to shift Kappan from Mathura to Delhi for better treatment.Mehta had opposed it saying thousands of inmates with similar health problems were there. He wondered if the court should order their admission to Delhi hospitals, which are already packed beyond capacity."Why should a man accused under UAPA and associated with a banned organisation get such a preferential treatment?" he asked.The Supreme Court had on Tuesday asked the Uttar Pradesh government to produce all medical reports of Kappan, who was arrested on October 5 last year under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 -- the top court had posted the matter for hearing on Wednesday.The UP government had refuted the allegation that Kappan was chained.According to Uttar Pradesh Police, the investigation found that he was a PFI activist who attempted to create communal tension in Hathras and the newspaper he claimed to represent had already shut down two years ago.The Supreme Court had on February 15 given a five-day interim bail to Kappan to visit Kerala to meet his 90-year-old ailing mother.However, it had restrained him from giving any interviews to the media, including social media; and meeting members of the public, except his own relatives and doctors.The order had come on a petition by KUWJ challenging his arrest.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jailed-kerala-journalist-should-be-moved-to-delhi-for-treatment-supreme-court-tells-up-245404
29-04-2021||United Nations||Citing own robust system, India turns down UN supply chain help: Spokesperson||India has turned down the UN's offer of assistance from its integrated supply chain saying it has its own "robust" system to manage the logistics of getting material for dealing with the Covid surge, according to a UN spokesperson."We offered the assistance of our integrated supply chain if it was required. We've been told at this point that it's not needed because India has a reasonably robust system to deal with this.  But our offer stands, and we're willing to help in whatever way we can," Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq said on Tuesday.The Secretary-General's Chef de Cabinet Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti has been in touch with India's Permanent Representative TS Tirumurti, and other UN staffers have also been in touch with Indian officials in New York and in India, he said."Our people who deal with operational and logistical issues are willing to help, if we're needed, and we're in touch with our counterparts in India to see whether that will be useful," Haq added.He said there had been only a "low level" of cases among the international and local UN staff in India and the UN was taking care of them so that they didn't add to the Indian health system's pressure.UN General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir has called for support to India, "a country which did so much to ensure the distribution of Covid vaccines to vulnerable countries," according to his spokesperson Brenden Varma.Bozkir said his thoughts are "with the Indian government and people" and "it is now time for the world to extend aid to India".While the UN is not involved with the immediate issues of the pandemic's surge, Haq said  it had been helping India deal with the fallout of the Covid pandemic on a long-term basis. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/citing-own-robust-system-india-turns-down-un-supply-chain-help-spokesperson-245401
