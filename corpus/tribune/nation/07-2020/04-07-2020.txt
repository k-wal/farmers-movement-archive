Some of them are living on the banks of the Yamuna off a busy road in makeshift tents and unplastered walls with metal roofs in north Delhi’s Majnu Ka Tilla area.Some of them are well-educated but felt unsafe in Pakistan. Like the other minority communities, they too were concerned about the security and dignity of their family members, especially young daughters, said Sirsa, adding that Pakistani Hindus and all other minorities were not feeling safe in Pakistan.The blasphemy and other laws are misused in Pakistan to arrest members of Hindu and Sikhs families.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/home-minister-amit-shah-meets-delegation-of-pak-hindus-108566

The highway and Pakistani occupation of Gilgit-Baltistan also denies India land access to Afghanistan and Central Asia.India has seriously viewed the impending elections and had even called in a Pakistani diplomat to protest against the Pakistan Supreme Court’s order in “Gilgit-Baltistan’’.Recently, National Security Advisory Board member Tilak Devasher urged New Delhi to move beyond the cosmetic exercise of including Gilgit Baltistan in its weather bulletin.The raising of diplomatic tensions on Gilgit-Baltistan closely follows expulsions of High Commission staffers from both countries and halving of mission strength from 110 to 55 staffers each. Both High Commissions are already serving without their top envoys.Government of India’s position in the matter is reflected in the resolution passed by Parliament in 1994 by consensus.Security analysts apprehend that one of the reasons for China’s aggressive moves in eastern Ladakh is to strengthen its hold on the region in order to make more secure land connections to Pakistan and between Tibet and Xinjiang. In this scenario and with elections due on August 18, India’s aggression on Gilgit-Baltistan, while relying on a Parliamentary resolution of 1994, is unlikely to be scaled down||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/war-of-words-heats-up-between-india-and-pakistan-over-gilgit-baltistan-108557

They (political observers) view a party’s organisation within the ‘daayra’ (limitation) of elections but for the BJP, its ‘sangathan’ is not just a machine to win elections but help people.”In the BJP, the organisation always means “taking everyone along, their prosperity and nation first”, the Prime Minister said while addressing the virtual conference in which BJP units from seven states, including Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Delhi, made a presentation about welfare works during the nationwide lockdown      Recounting the ‘saat sa’ (seven ‘Ss’) he had mentioned during a party meeting in Allahabad, PM Modi said the work done by the party during the lockdown further strengthened his views“While watching the presentation I found all the seven elements—‘seva bhav’ (service) ‘santulan’ (balance), ‘sainyam’(self control), ‘samanvay’ (coordination), ‘sakaaratmakta’ (positivity), ‘sadbhavna’ (goodwill) and ‘samvaad’ (dialogue/communication),” he said  Despite knowing the dangers involved, the BJP cadres worked selflessly. This was the very basis of formation of the BJP and its forerunner Jana Sangh, the PM said“We in the BJP have always believed that politics is the path for service of people and not just power. The selfless service by BJP cadres during the lockdown has shown that. I feel proud that we are part of an organisation which believes in ‘seva’ and ‘smaarpan’,” he said attributing it to the ‘sanskaar; received from ‘tapasya’ of generations of party workersHe also appreciated party president JP Nadda’s gesture of providing food to 500 people every day from his home and the way the BJP developed itself into a digital edition, turned ‘aafat into avasar’ (calamity into opportunity) during the lockdown.The BJP has always been all inclusive, he said, adding that the party has 52 Dalit MPs, 43 tribal and 113 from the backward class in Parliament.Earlier, Nadda lauded the PM for giving direction to the country with bold decisions to battle the difficult period, like a timely lockdown and economic package which were appreciated by the world and also the WHO, the World Bank and the UN.“You told us that we have to make this lockdown successful and ensure that no one goes hungry and do it with compassion,” he said, crediting the PM for giving the BJP the idea of digital communication.“We did 4000 video conferences during the lockdown and reached 2.5 lakh workers. Through 700 audio bridges, we connected 70 lakh karyakarta and managed to activate the party to the grassroots,” Nadda said.The party organised over 61 virtual rallies to mark the first anniversary of the Modi Government’s second term, and about 11.50 crore people attended them. As many as 7,549 video conferences and 690 press conferences were orgnaised to mark the occasion.The party also held 1457 ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ abhiyaan dialogue.As part of the BJP’s door-to-door campaign to publicise the highlights of the government’s first year, its workers contacted over 5.41 crore people.The party provided meals to over 22 crore people and distributed around 80 lakh sanitisers and 2.5 crore face covers and worked to spread awareness about Aarogya Setu app and donation to the PM Cares fund, according to the BJP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-not-an-election-machine-organisation-a-medium-to-serve-people-pm-modi-108549

04-07-2020||Kanpur/Lucknow||Day after 8 cops killed in ambush, UP Police suspend Chaubeypur Station Officer||Uttar Pradesh Police on Saturday suspended a station officer for his alleged connivance in the killing of eight of his colleagues, ambushed in his police station area Chaubeypur while they were going to arrest notorious local criminal Vikas Dubey.As the eight policemen, who walked into a trap set by Dubey and fell to a hail of bullets fired from rooftops shortly after midnight on Friday, were given a tearful farewell, the police began demolishing the criminal’s lavish hideout in Bikru village, the scene of the bloody crime.Swinging into action after the brutal deaths of the men, 25 police teams fanned out across Uttar Pradesh and other states to hunt down Dubey, wanted in 60 criminal cases, and his associates, officials said.The attackers had fled, snatching weapons from the dead and the wounded policemen.Police officials also said a surveillance team was scanning over 500 mobile phones and frantic efforts were on to retrieve information from the devices.The needle of suspicion swivelled to Vinay Tiwari, the SO of the Chaubeypur Police Station, about 40 km from Kanpur city, under which Bikru falls.“In view of the allegations levelled against SO, he has been suspended and all the allegations are being thoroughly looked into,” IG Kanpur Range Mohit Agarwal told reporters.                   “If his involvement or that of any other personnel of the police is found in this incident, they will be sacked from the department and also sent to jail,” he said.The officer, however, did not disclose the nature of allegations against Tiwari. He also refused to divulge details of how many people have been detained and which other states the police was focusing on in its hunt for Dubey.“Operational and strategic things are not revealed by the police,” he said.An official indicated that about 30 people were detained for questioning. Another said there was a possibility that Dubey may have fled to Nepal or taken shelter in a neighbouring state.The eight men killed in the line of duty, mostly in their 20s and 30s, included Deputy Superintendent of Police Devendra Mishra (54).The others are Mahesh Kumar Yadav (42), Sub-Inspector Anoop Kumar Singh (32), Sub-Inspector Nebu Lal (48) and Constables Jitendra Pal (26), Sultan Singh (34), Bablu Kumar (23) and Rahul Kumar (24). Their bodies were taken back to their homes where senior police officers attended their last rites, Seven others, including a civilian, were injured in the attack that took place in the dead of night on Thursday.Hours earlier, Rahul Tiwari of Jadepur Gharsa village nearby had lodged an FIR alleging attempt to murder against Dubey and four others with the Chaubeypur police station.Recapping the events of Thursday night that unfolded like a gangster film, sources said Vinay Tiwari initially led a small police team to Dubey’s house in a bid to persuade him to settle the issue with Rahul Tiwari.However, Dubey is believed to have thrashed and threatened the SO in his den.Vinay Tiwari then informed DSP Mishra, who reached Bikru with a team drawn from three police stations in the vicinity to arrest Dubey.But they were caught by surprise  instead. Dubey’s henchmen put up roadblocks to stop policemen from reaching their hideout. As they got off from their vehicles at one hurdle, there were caught by a hail of gunfire.Later, police sealed the entire area and began a combing operation, which led to another encounter with Dubey’s men in Nivada village in which two people were killed. Vinay Tiwari told reporters in a video widely circulated on Saturday that the team went to Dubey’s house only to arrest him and did not anticipate the ambush.He is also seen getting angry when questioned by reporters if he was lagging behind deliberately. “Do you think that this could have happened. It is the jurisdiction of my police station area, and I will be the person to lag behind others? Some people are floating this theory only to benefit Dubey,” he said.Minutes after the video appeared on local news channels, IG Mohit Agarwal ordered his suspension.Bikru village appeared like a war zone.The place was deserted with many houses locked. And the centre of activity was Dubey’s house. Police personnel stood on guard and some passer-by watched  as a bulldozer razed the boundary wall before bringing down the house. TV channels also showed visuals of luxury cars in the complex being crushed by the giant machines.It was the same earthmover that was used to block the way of the policemen when they went for the raid.“Most of the villagers said Dubey has grabbed people’s land using muscle power, and built his house. He used to extort money from people. It was a hub of crime. There was anger among the local people, and there was a feeling of vengeance among them,”Agarwal said.The Kanpur Range IG added that family members of the criminals could have been attacked by the local people, but the situation did not go out of control due to police presence.Local police sources also said Dubey, who was accused in 2001 of killing a senior BJP leader, maintains a private ‘army’ and recruits mostly local youth. He also provides them with weapons.A senior police official in Lucknow ruled out “intelligence failure” on part of the police.Late on Friday night, police also raided Dubey’s house in the state capital’s Krishnanagar area.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had rushed to Kanpur on Friday to meet the family members of the slain policemen and announced financial assistance of Rs 1 crore each to the bereaved families.

Bomb Threat Assessment Committee later dismissed the call as non-specific, and allowed Jabina, a woman from Chennai, to fly out on August 10.He faces charges under the Anti-Hijacking Act, 2016. The case was to come up for hearing at Panchkula’a NIA court on July 3, but has now been put off to September 11 because of the ongoing coronavirus health crisis.Nasrudeen met Jabina in Chennai in May 2017 and began a relationship with her, and later even moved into the house that she shared with her mother Kathoon Bee and younger sister Karishma. The chargesheet said Jabina, a divorced mother of two, wanted them to do better financially---a source of constant arguments between the couple.  In July 2019, when Nasrudeen returned to Sitamarhi in Bihar for about a month, Jabina approached a travel agent Yasin Ahmed asking him to arrange for her to find work in the Middle East. He put her in touch with another agent, Shaukat Ali from Vilupuram in Tamil Nadu.Jabina then applied for work permit through Ali and found employment as a housemaid in Kuwait. She was to fly to Bengaluru from Delhi and from there to Kuwait via Dubai on August 8, 2019.Jabina informed Nasrudeen of her plans when he called her, prompting him to come rushing to Chennai on August 8.When he realised that she had left home for Bengaluru, he allegedly called the control room at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport to claim that Jabina and her three other female companions were carrying a bomb with them.The chargesheet said that he boarded a train to Delhi, where his sister lived, the same day.The Bomb Threat Assessment Committee then raised their security checks and offloaded Jabina, but allowed her to travel two days later after they found nothing.Meanwhile, Nasrudeen was booked in Gurugram and arrested on August 15.The NIA said in their chargesheet that Nasrudeen’s call led to panic at the Indira Gandhi International Airport and disrupted functioning.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-files-chargesheet-against-bihar-man-who-made-hoax-bomb-call-to-igi-airport-108534

BCI sets up panel to examine||New Delhi, July 4The Bar Council of India (BCI)–which regulates legal education in the country—has set up a seven-member committee to examine if Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) for admissions to national law universities can also be conducted in regional languages as well.Currently, CLAT is held in English for admission to 22 of the 23 national law universities. National Law University, Delhi holds a separate admission test.“The Council being the regulator of Legal Education and Legal Profession, prima facie is of the view that no deserving candidate should be deprived from giving the CLAT on account of his/her inability to be proficient in English”, BCI Secretary Srimanto Sen said in a letter dated June 30 to petitioners who had moved the Delhi High Court demanding CLAT to be held in regional languages. The High Court had asked BCI consider the demand.“…the knowledge or lack of English language does not determine ones intelligence, ability, acumen, dedication, IQ etc., therefore, prima-facie the exam should be conducted in vernacular languages too. In fact the Bar Council of India conducts All India Bar Examination in 11 languages including English,” said BCI, which has set up a seven-member panel to examine the issue.Headed by a former Chief Justice of a High Court, the panel included former and sitting vice-chancellors of national law universities, academics and two members of BCI.Terming it a “multi-dimensional” issue, BCI said, “Another aspect that would be required to be considered is, as to in how many vernacular languages are semester exams being conducted in Law Universities across the Country, as on date. It is but obvious that after clearing CLAT, the next request could be to hold semester exams in regional languages too in National Law Universities.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/should-clat-be-held-in-regional-languages-also-bci-sets-up-panel-to-examine-108532

We already have a gender-neutral work environment. In view of the impending policy guidelines of the MHA, we shall make it further compatible as per the need.”Similarly, in the Border Security Force (BSF), an official said the security outfit had already communicated their consent for recruiting transgender candidates in its ranks at the officer level (Assistant Commandant-AC).“The consent was sent soon after receiving the communication from the MHA around the 2019-year end,” he said.The Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) have already put in place the process of firming their opinion. The two forces have written to their field formations to elicit their opinion on the issue of transgenders’ recruitment.“All border guarding forces are by and large have, in principle, agreed to the proposal and are in the process of finalising their respective formats to recruit transgender candidates in their ranks at the officer level,” said a senior MHA official.The BSF guards India’s border with Pakistan and Bangladesh, whereas the ITBP has been assigned the borders with China. The SSB is manning India’s border with Nepal and Bhutan. The CRPF, the largest among the forces, is mostly engaged in anti-terror, anti-Naxal and anti-insurgency activities, besides normal law and order duties.In a communication to the CAPFs, the MHA has sought their views to give their opinions for incorporating the ‘third gender’ along with male/female sections for the CAPF (AC) Examination 2020.In the reminder letter, the MHA has asked them to furnish their views at earliest so that the final decision on this issue can be taken soon to recruit transgender candidates at the level of Assistant Commandant.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/crpf-border-guarding-forces-indicate-willingness-to-take-transgender-candidates-on-board-108531

ICMR’s process is exactly in accordance with the globally accepted norms to fast-track the vaccine development for diseases of pandemic potential wherein human and animal trials can continue in parallel,” the body said, adding that the inactivated vaccine ICMR has developed with Bharat Biotech is promising.The council also said that since preclinical studies have been completed successfully, the phases 1 and 2 human trials are to be initiated.“The letter by DG-ICMR to investigators of the clinical trial sites was meant to cut unnecessary red tape, without bypassing any necessary process, and speed up recruitment of participants.Just as red tape was not allowed to become a hindrance in the fast track approval of new indigenous testing kits or for introducing in the Indian market potential COVID-19 related drugs, the indigenous vaccine development process has also been sought to be insulated from slow file movement. The aim is to complete these phases at the earliest, so that population-based trials for efficacy could be initiated without delay,” said the council exuding confidence of meeting its stipulated August 15 deadline for COVAXIN launch.The ICMR also reiterated that it was among the world’s most reputed organisations in the field of medical research and regulation and its track record of facilitating India’s globally respected and acknowledged vaccine and drug industry spoke for itself.“Our trials will be done following the best practices and rigour, and will be reviewed, as required, by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB),” ICMR said assuring people safety.An inactivated COVID-19 vaccine candidate has been developed by Bharat Biotech International ltd. in collaboration with ICMR – National institute of Virology, Pune.After intense characterisation and review of all data from BBIL, ICMR is supporting the clinical development as the vaccine candidate appears to be promising.“Based on in-depth scrutiny of the available data from pre-clinical studies, the Drugs Controller General of India has accorded permission to conduct phase 1 and 2 clinical trial,” said the Council.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-second-guess-indias-top-scientists-icmr-rejects-apprehensions-on-covid-vaccine-108530

Jana’s body was found hanging from a tree, so we suspect that he has committed suicide. The exact cause can be ascertained only after we get the post-mortem report,” an officer said.Eleven persons have been arrested in connection with the clashes, officials said, adding that three more have been detained.Former SUCI MLA Joykrishna Halder said several houses of his party members were looted, vandalised and set ablaze.Police said forces have been deployed in the area to tackle the situation.Several members of the TMC and SUCI are admitted to different hospitals with injuries, officials said.Sources said though the TMC has only eight members in the Maipith-Baikanthapur panchayat, it still managed to hold on to power for more than two years. However, the SUCI, with eleven members, decided to move a no-confidence motion recently, leading to the clash.

04-07-2020||Mumbai||COVID-19 patient kept in ambulance for one day for want of bed succumbs||Family of a 64-year-old man who succumbed to COVID-19 in neighbouring Navi Mumbai has alleged that he had to be kept in an ambulance for a whole day before he could be admitted to a hospital.When he was finally admitted, the family did not have the money to buy an injection that cost Rs 32,000. The man, who performed in a music band, died on June 25.“He developed coughing and breathing problem on June 20. We took him to the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation’s (NMMC) COVID hospital at Vashi,” his son told PTI.“There was no bed with oxygen supply available, so I was asked to go to another hospital,” he said.“I asked them to tell us where to go, but they did not guide us and only said go to a private hospital,” he said.“Then I started searching for a hospital. After a few hospitals refused to admit him, I called a cardiac ambulance and put my father in it because he needed oxygen support,” said the son, who also performs in a music band.The next day the man was admitted to a private hospital in Kopar Khairane area.When the doctors told him that his father would need an injection which cost around Rs 32,000, he approached the NMMC for help, but the authorities said they could not do anything, he alleged.Four days after he was admitted, his father died on June 25, he said.The hearse arrived after three hours and there was no attendant with it, he said.“I and my brother-in-law donned PPE kits and took the body for last rites,” he said.“It is all very unfortunate. We are sons of the soil, this city stands on our land, and I am a regular taxpayer, but the NMMC could not provide a single injection to save father’s life,” he said.“I am telling this to the media now because I don’t want any other patient to die in this way. The NMMC should improve its medical facilities,” he added.As of Friday, the virus had claimed at least 232 lives in Navi Mumbai.

Maybe by the beginning of the next year if the vaccine clicks, we can expect. Not before that.“Before that (it is) very unlikely as far as I understand,” Mishra said.He said thousands of people are given vaccine during clinical trials and one has to wait for the data and results, which normally takes months.To a query, he said CCMB is currently doing 400-500 COVID-19 tests every day and had sent proposals to the ICMR for undertaking a new way of testing, which will consume less time and manpower.“We are doing a lot of tests... 400 to 500 tests every day. But there are limitations that you cannot go beyond certain numbers.“But we had proposed to the ICMR a new way of testing. It is a shorter method. It can be done in a safer way and will take half the time.“It is much less expensive and less human resources required. We are waiting for the ICMR to give an advisory on that,” he said.

04-07-2020||Bhubaneswar||Odisha Government to give monthly pension to transgenders||The Odisha Government has decided to include members of the transgender community in a social welfare scheme which provides a monthly pension to the needy, a minister said.Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has approved a proposal to cover the members of the community under the Madhu Babu Pension Yojana (MBPY) which aims at providing financial assistance to the destitute elderly, differently-abled persons and widows, he said.Around 5,000 transgenders will get a monthly pension in between Rs 500 and Rs 900 depending on their age, Social Security and Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (SSEPD) Minister Ashok Panda said.The government’s decision was taken in view of the promises made in the ruling BJD’s manifesto for the 2019 Assemble polls, the minister said.Panda said that the transgender people will have to apply on the official website of the department to register themselves under the MBPY.“Around 5,000 transgenders will benefit from the government’s decision,” he said.The associations of transgenders hailed the state government for including them under the social welfare programme.Some other states have already introduced such social welfare schemes for the community.For instance, the J&K Administrative Council has reportedly extended the coverage of its Integrated Social Security Scheme to transgenders. Andra Pradesh and Kerala governments had earlier announced pension schemes for them.Panda, however, said that the Odisha government has also decided to give one-time additional assistance of Rs 1,000 to each of 48 lakh existing beneficiaries under the MBPY scheme in view of the COVID-19 crisis.The minister said the funds required for the purpose have already been allocated, and the beneficiaries will get the assistance soon.He said the beneficiaries have already received pensions in advance for four months during the current fiscal in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

Inconvenience caused is regretted”.The step follows request by the West Bengal Government to the Aviation Ministry to stop flights to Kolkata from the six above-mentioned cities plus Surat and Indore for two weeks in view of the rise in coronavirus cases in the state.According to the state government, the spike is largely owing to COVID-19 infected people coming to the state from outside.West Bengal chief secretary Rajiva Sinha recently wrote a letter to civil aviation secretary P S Kharola to stop operation of flights Kolkata from eight “high prevalence” cities.“A large number of cases have been reported from people coming in the state from outside with infection. Government of West Bengal has decided to stop or curtail movement of incoming flights and trains into the State. Accordingly, I approach you with a request kindly not to schedule any flight to West Bengal from high prevalence places viz. Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Chennai, lndore, Ahmedabad and Surat and to stop movement of flights from these cities to Kolkata for 2 weeks starting 6 July 2020”, Sinha wrote to Kharola.The state government has also asked the Civil Aviation Ministry to stop flights from these locations to the two others airports of West Bengal located at Bagdogra (Siliguri) and Andal (Durgapur), respectively.While asking for suspension of flight services from the eight cities mentioned in the letter, the Chief Secretary also wrote that flight services to West Bengal from the remaining Indian cities should also be restricted to once a week only.It is not immediately known what the Civil Aviation Ministry is planning to do with regard to West Bengal government’s request for suspension of flight services to the state from Surat and Indore and reduction of the existing service to Kolkata from various locations to only one flight a week.The country had resumed domestic passenger flights from May 25While more than two hundred flights operated at Kolkata Airport daily in the pre-lockdown days, the number came down to daily 65 flights only after the airport re-opened with the easing of restrictions.Civil Aviation Secretary Kharola wrote to Chief Secretary Sinha and reportedly spoke to him also yesterday for reconsidering the request on suspension on flights. But the state government was unrelenting.West Bengal has also written to Railway Board to stop train service to the state from five locations having high prevalence of corona positive cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-crisis-no-flights-to-kolkata-from-delhi-mumbai-chennai-and-3-other-cities-from-july-6-19-108502
04-07-2020||New Delhi||Follow ‘raj dharma’, tell people about reality of Chinese incursions: Congress to PM||A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Leh and addressed frontline soldiers, the Congress on Saturday said the time has come for him to follow his “raj dharma” and tell the people of the country about the reality of Chinese “incursions”.Addressing a virtual press meet, Congress leader Kapil Sibal used satellite images of Ladakh’s Pangong Tso from May and June to show Chinese structures in the area and asked the prime minister to at least speak the truth about it.He also asked Modi to stop doing the politics of “illusion and delusion” and showing “red eyes” to China, and protect Indian territory.“The times warrant India to look eye-to-eye at China and unequivocally tell them to retreat from their illegal and brazen occupation of Indian territory. Mr Prime Minister, this is the only ‘raj dharma’ that you must follow,” Sibal said.Posing a set of five questions to the prime minister, he asked Modi to say whether the actual picture of “Chinese occupation of our territory” up to the “Finger 4 Ridge” in the Pangong Tso area depicts the truth on the ground.“They say ‘pictures do not lie’. Will the prime minister now tell the nation—is this Indian territory on which radars, helipad and other structures have been built by the Chinese in a brazen act of transgression?“Have the Chinese occupied our territory in Galwan Valley, including ‘Patrol Point 14’, where our 20 jawans of the 16 Bihar Regiment made the supreme sacrifice? Has China also occupied Indian territory in Hot Springs?” the Congress leader asked.“Has China occupied our territory up to ‘Y-Junction’ (18 kms inside the LAC) in the Depsang plains, threatening India’s strategic DBO airstrip, which is the lifeline for our military supplies to the Siachen glacier and Karakoram pass?” he asked.On Modi saying this is not the India of 1962 and the era of expansionism is over, the former Union minister said Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of the country, had told China then that India will never accept the Chinese claim-line.According to Sibal, Nehru wrote to China, saying India will never submit to the demand for it to accept the Chinese 1959 line, whatever the consequences and however long and hard the struggle may be.The Congress leader said paradoxically, the Chinese 1959 line clearly depicted the entire Galwan Valley in India and it was only on June 16, 2020, a day after the fatal clashes, that China formally laid claim, for the first time ever, to the entire Galwan Valley.Sibal said former prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri had visited forward locations to boost the morale of Indian soldiers and Nehru had also visited soldiers in the forward locations in NEFA in 1962 to boost their morale.“But it appears that our prime minister stayed 230 km away in Nimu, Leh,” the he said, taking a swipe at Modi’s visit.“Isn’t it correct that the local councillors of Ladakh, including BJP councillors, submitted a memorandum to Prime Minister Modi in February about the capture of our land by China? What action did the prime minister take? Had he acted, wouldn’t we have been able to pre-empt the brazen Chinese transgressions?” Sibal asked.In a clear message to China, Modi on Friday said the era of expansionism is over and that India’s enemies have seen the “fire and fury” of its armed forces, as he made an unannounced visit to Ladakh, signalling India’s firmness in dealing with the border row with the neighbouring country.In an address to troops in Nimu, the prime minister paid glowing tributes to the 20 Indian soldiers killed in the Galwan Valley clashes and said tales of the bravery and valour of the armed forces are echoing in every part of the country.“Bharat Mata’s enemies have seen your fire and fury,” Modi said, in an apparent reference to the military clashes between the Indian and Chinese troops, and asserted that bravery is a prerequisite for peace and that the weak can never accomplish it.

04-07-2020||New Delhi||Scientists strike note of caution as ‘Made in India’ vaccine programme gains momentum||India's COVID-19 vaccine programme has gained sudden traction but it is imperative to strike a balance between giving it high priority and rushing into a process that takes months, even years, several scientists said a day after the ICMR announced it envisaged a preventive vaccine by next month.There was hope but caution too as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Friday said it aimed to launch the world's first COVID-19 vaccine by August 15.The same day, Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila announced it has got the Drugs Controller General of India's (DCGI) nod for human clinical trials for a potential vaccine.“Fast tracking a vaccine trial in four weeks for safety, immunogenicity and efficacy is just not possible if things are to be done correctly,” Shahid Jameel, virologist and CEO of the Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance, a public charity that invests in building biomedical sciences and health research framework, told PTI.Immunogenicity is the ability of a foreign substance, such as an antigen, to provoke an immune response in the body of a human or other animal, he explained.Also read: ICMR eyes indigenous vaccine by Aug 15Virologist Upasana Ray added that an accelerated launch or promise for launch of a vaccine against the novel coronavirus deserves applause but it was important to ask whether “we are rushing too much”.“We must rush albeit carefully. Giving this project high priority is absolutely important. However, excess pressure might not necessarily lead to a positive product for public use,” said the senior scientist at CSIR-IICB, Kolkata.India's premier medical body ICMR has said 12 clinical trial sites for the indigenous Covaxin, being developed in collaboration with the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and the National Institute of Virology (NIV), had been identified.It asked medical institutions and principal investigators to ensure that the subject enrolment was initiated no later than July 7."It is envisaged to launch the vaccine for public health use latest by August 15 after completion of all clinical trials,” ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said in his letter to the principal investigators of the 12 sites.The tone of the letter and the haste it indicated had some scientists worried. They questioned the timeline of the announcement mentioned in the letter, and advised against subverting the due vaccine development process.“The ICMR letter is, to say the least, a deeply inappropriate letter, in tone and content, both in terms of the integrity of due processes of product development, and in terms of technically realistic estimates,” said immunologist Satyajit Rath.Vaccine development is a multi-phase process. Phase 1 trials are small-scale, usually involving few participants, to assess whether the vaccine is safe for humans.Phase 2 trials often involve several hundred subjects, and mainly evaluate the efficacy.The final phase involves thousands of people to further assess the efficacy of the vaccine over a defined period of time, and can last several months.Ray added that a vaccine normally takes at least 12-18 months to pass all necessary clinical trial phases.“From now till August 15, the company has just over a months' time to wrap up everything that normally a vaccine development process requires for releasing a vaccine for clinical use,” she said.“How can such a sharp timeline be even decided? Where does the evidence come from that by such a short time all the essential steps will be completed? What about the safety and efficacy, the fundamental steps of any drug development? Have even the pre-clinical studies been completed? Too much rush comes with possible risks,” she said.Ray noted that there are some broad mandatory steps for developing a vaccine. Preclinical tests in small animals and mammals, she stressed, were essential to assess neutralising antibody titers and that itself could take at least a month or two.A titer is a laboratory test that measures the presence and amount of antibodies in blood.“Next, we check for safety. Then is the human trial. Even if we are in a deep rush we have to wait for some time for immunised individuals to start generating antibodies. After that a population needs to be monitored over time to investigate if people are still being infected,” she explained.Skipping steps could either be dangerous or lead to poor product, said Ray.“We must not compromise with the standard, the quality. We don't need to be the first to launch a drug but what we need is a Made in India vaccine that the entire world can rely on,” she added.The vaccine landscape in India has been also bolstered after the approval for Zydus Cadila's vaccine candidate. It was fast-tracked following a recommendation by the subject expert committee on COVID-19, considering the emergency and unmet medical need during the pandemic.Also read: When coronavirus vaccine will be available, at what price: Adar Poonawalla, CEO, Serum Institute of India, explains"DCGI Dr VG Somani has given approval for the phase I and II clinical trials (on humans) of the potential novel coronavirus vaccine developed by Zydus Cadila Healthcare Ltd on Thursday after its animal studies were found to be successful," said an official source.Jameel, winner of the 2000 Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, noted that it was a vaccine funded by Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) and the Department of Biotechnology.“Congratulations to Cadilla, BIRAC and DBT. We would look forward to properly conducted trials and good news in due course,” he said.“I am glad that a locally made vaccine candidate is making the same progress that others elsewhere in the world are making, not just with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates but with DNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, and I will look forward to the results,” added Rath from Delhi's National Institute of Immunology (NII).Gautam I Menon, professor from the Departments of Physics and Biology at Ashoka University, said Zydus Cadila's vaccine appeared to have shown safety and efficacy in animal trials and so they have been allowed to go to the next step, to human trials.“This is the standard procedure. It is the human trials that are time-consuming and it is important to get this right,” said Menon.In another development, Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO Adar Poonawalla told The Tribune newspaper that the Covid-19 vaccine being developed at the University of Oxford will hit the market by the year-end.ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is made from a virus (ChAdOx1), which is a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees, and has been genetically changed so that it is impossible for it to reproduce in humans.“I think it is likely that the ChAdOx1-S vaccine candidate which has entered a phase 3 clinical trial in Brazil, will give at least somewhat promising results by late this calendar year,” Rath said.“Whether this will lead to the 'vaccine' becoming available in the market, and in the public health system, more importantly, by the end of this calendar year in India is much more uncertain, Mr Poonawala's welcome optimism notwithstanding,” he added.

Under this regime, the BBMB earned Rs 92.47 crore till June, 2020 through Deviation Settlement Mechanism (DSM). This was achieved by optimum utilisation of the available resources and close monitoring of the real time generation schedule and actual energy generated from the BBMB generating stations round the clock and operation of machines, read the statement.  BBMB Chairman DK Sharma applauded the employees for their untiring efforts to maintain excellence in irrigation and power sectors and for their efforts to surpass targets even during the COVID-19 lockdown period.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhakra-beas-management-board-exceeds-power-generation-target-by-131-per-cent-for-1st-quarter-108496

The injured soldiers from the Galwan Valley clash (June 15-16) have been kept there since their arrival to ensure quarantine from Covid areas.“There have been malicious and unsubstantiated accusations in some quarters regarding the status of the facility visited by the Prime Minister,” the Army said.Army chief General MM Naravane and Commander Lt Gen YK Joshi had also visited the injured soldiers at the same location, officials said, pointing out to the images of  the Army chief and the Commander in the same hall meeting the injured on earlier occasions.The Army response comes after people have been asking questions on social media if the place visited by the PM was a hospital since audio-visual equipment like overhead projectors is visible and no ‘hospital-like’ ancillary equipment can be seen.The Army, in a statement, said it is unfortunate that aspersions are being cast on how our bravehearts are being treated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hall-visited-by-modi-at-leh-part-of-hospital-clarifies-army-108491
04-07-2020||New Delhi||Govt revises dosage of anti-viral drug remdesivir to be administered to coronavirus patients||The Union health ministry on Friday revised the dosage of anti-viral drug remdesivir to be administered to coronavirus patients in the moderate stage of illness from the earlier six days to five days as it issued an updated 'Clinical Management Protocols for COVID-19'.The drug, administered in the form of injection, should be given at a dose of 200 mg on day one followed by 100 mg daily for four days (total five days), the new treatment protocols stated.The Health Ministry on June 13 had allowed the use of remdesivir for restricted emergency use in moderate cases under "investigational therapies"."Under emergency use authorisation, remdesivir may be considered for patients in moderate stage requiring oxygen support," the document stated.It is not recommended for those with severe renal impairment and high level of liver enzymes, pregnant and lactating women, and those below 12 years, it said.The ministry also okayed off-label application of tocilizumab, a drug that modifies the immune system or its functioning, and convalescent plasma for treating COVID-19 patients in the moderate stage of illness as "investigational therapies".It also recommended hydroxychloroquine for patients during the early course of the disease and not for critically-ill patients.On June 27, the ministry had included an inexpensive, widely used steroid dexamethasone in treatment protocols for COVID-19 patients in the moderate to severe stages of their illness among other therapeutic measures.The ministry advised use of dexamethasone, which is already used in a wide range of conditions for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects, as an alternative choice to methylprednisolone for managing moderate to severe cases of coronavirus infection.India's COVID-19 cases soared by over 20,000 in a day for the first time taking the country's total tally to 6,25,544 on Friday while the death toll climbed to 18,213 with 379 new fatalities, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated at 8 am.

04-07-2020||New Delhi||As Covid ravages human lives, Buddha's message serves like a beacon: President Ram Nath Kovind||As the coronavirus pandemic ravages human lives and economies across the world, Lord Buddha's message of shunning vices like hatred and violence to find happiness serves like a beacon, President Ram Nath Kovind said on Saturday."We all know that the moment the virulence of coronavirus slows down, we have a far more serious challenge of climate change before us," he said in a virtual event organised by the International Buddhist Confederation at Rashtrapati Bhavan.Kovind said the world seemed full of suffering, in short term as well as in long term."There are many stories of kings and affluent people suffering from acute depression who took refuge in Buddha to escape cruelties of life," said the President.He said the life of Buddha challenged earlier convictions as he believed in finding deliverance from suffering in the midst of this imperfect world."Today, as the pandemic ravages human lives and economies across the globe, Buddha's message serves like a beacon. He advised people to shun greed, hatred, violence, jealousy and many other vices to find happiness. Contrast this message with the hankering of an unrepentant mankind indulging in the same old violence and degradation of nature," said Kovind.The President said India was proud of being the land of the origin of 'Dhamma'."In India, we see Buddhism as a fresh expression of the sublime truth," he said at the event organised on the occasion of the Dharma Chakra Diwas.Also read: Lord Buddha's ideals have lasting solutions to challenges world faces today: ModiKovind said Lord Buddha's enlightenment and subsequent preaching by him for over four decades were in line with India's tradition of respect for intellectual liberalism and spiritual diversity.In modern times, two exceptionally great Indians, Mahatma Gandhi and Babasaheb Ambedkar, found inspiration in the words of the Buddha and went on to shape the destiny of the nation, he said."Following in their footsteps, we should strive to hear the call of the Buddha, to respond to his invitation to walk the noble path," said the President.The International Buddhist Confederation or IBC, with its presence in 36 countries, is holding the celebrations around the world."We, however, are in the midst of a virulent pandemic that has overwhelmed the entire humanity. Perhaps no part of the world remains untouched by this calamity that adversely affects every individual. As a precaution, we have to follow certain discipline and maintain physical distance," he said.The IBC is, therefore, holding the events virtually, Kovind said, adding that such an effort is praiseworthy, because this makes it possible for a far larger number of people, from all corners of the world, to participate in them."The world has suffered much this year, and I sincerely wish that this sacred day heralds a new ray of hope and grants a glimpse of happiness. I also pray that it lights the lamp of wisdom in the heart of everyone," the President concluded.

A team was rushed to find the body which was later identified by her husband.The autopsy report also made the shocking revelation—that she had been sexually assaulted after her murder.Hot footing into the probe, police teams fanned out in the area and after scanning the CCTV footage of the neighbourhood, zeroed in on the possible suspect Choudhary."He was picked up and during sustained interrogation, confessed to murdering the woman and then having sex with her corpse. Thereafter, he was placed under arrest and further investigations are on," Gurjar told IANS.A police official said that Choudhary was living alone in the shop as his wife and children are in Pali village of Rajasthan since nearly a year, and could not control his urge after killing the woman."He had no previous acquaintance with the victim, and we shall also probe whether he had any mental issues after he violated the body," said the official.Gurjar, who helped crack this first of its kind case in the district, said the accused is charged with murder and rape.

The state concerned makes a matching contribution to the fund provided by the Centre. Launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 15 last year, it aims to provide piped water connection to every rural household in the country by 2024.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-hails-haryanas-fast-paced-implementation-of-jal-jeevan-mission-108469

Ace choreographer Saroj Khan, whose iconic dance moves made India go 'Dhak Dhak', passed away on Friday. The ‘Masterji’ of Bollywood, Saroj, in more than one way, created a new lexicon of Bollywood dance —fluid, spontaneous and high on ‘adaas’ and rare chutzpah. In her dance arrangements, actresses oozed a rare sensuality.Under choreographer Saroj Khan’s guidance, cinestars grooved to perfectionOne of the finest dancers in Bollywood Madhuri Dixit has gone on record to admit that it was Saroj Khan who taught her the rudiments of Bollywood dance.It was under the guidance of Saroj, Bollywood’s first female choreographer and three-time national award winner, that cinestars like Madhuri, Sridevi and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan grooved to perfection. Paying tributes, actor Akshay Kumar tweeted, "She made dance look so easy." The path she created and the niche she carved for herself made many follow in her footsteps.Born Nirmala Nagpal, she was rechristened Saroj by her conservative business family, which did not want the world to know her real identity. A child artiste in 'Nazarana', background dancer, assistant and finally a choreographer in her first independent film 'Geeta Mera Naam', she went on to rewrite many of the rules of Bollywood dance.Working behind the scenes, Saroj gave visibility and prominence to choreographers. “She immortalised stars,” tweeted actor Nimrat Kaur.In a career spanning four decades, she immortalised many songs like 'Ek Do Teen', 'Dhak Dhak', 'Kaate Nahi Kat Te', 'Choli Ke Peeche', 'Madhuban Mein Jo Kanhaiya', 'Dola Re Dola' and 'Maar Daala'.Though she learnt dance from film choreographer B Sohanlal, whom she married when she was all of 14 and he 41, she considered PL Santoshi her real guru. In an interaction during her visit to Chandigarh, she revealed how it was Santoshi who initiated her into the art of choreography.In an interview, her remarks on the casting couch created a furore. But a misstep in her dancing library of over 2,000 songs would be nearly impossible to pin down.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bollywoods-dancing-queen-takes-final-bow-108323

At the same time, he underscored that India and China were capable of finding solutions without any mediation from third parties.No mediationAny intervention in such a delicate matter as border dispute is not just inexpedient, but can also seriously hurt the efforts Beijing and New Delhi are independently making to find a way out of this situation—  Russian officialSignificantly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had initiated a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday during which both sides had resolved to strengthen their bilateral partnership.Though US Defence Secretary Mark Esper twice called up Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in a gesture of solidarity and French counterpart Florence Parly had condoled the deaths of soldiers in Galwan Valley, India’s first port of call for solidarity and military hardware after the June 15 LAC clash has been Russia.Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Friday briefed Japanese Ambassador Satoshi Suzuki on the situation along the LAC. “Japan also hopes for a peaceful resolution through dialogue. Japan opposes any unilateral attempt to change the status quo,” Suzuki observed after the briefing. South Block has also provided its version of the tensions on the LAC to envoys from EU, US, France, Germany and Russia.While India-China tensions continued, Moscow had initiated a meeting of RIC Foreign Ministers. In continuation with this dual-track policy, Russia on Thursday initiated a virtual meeting of sherpas from the five BRICS countries —Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — in which MEA Secretary Sanjay Bhattacharya participated.On the bilateral front, Russia said it did not set any limits. “There is an expression ‘the sky’s the limit’. For Russia and India, the sky is not the limit,” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov said in an interview with TASS news agency.Russia found itself in the ideal position to play the role of ice-breaker as it has mutually-exclusive defence and energy ties with both China and India. During the epidemic, as against China-baiting by the West, Moscow saw Beijing as the first victim of Covid rather than the initiator.Touching on the existing problems in the Indian-Chinese relations, Morgulov said the border dispute was “undeniable”, but it did not interfere with trilateral cooperation.Interestingly, the Russian media is rounding off its reports on the LAC tensions by citing Indian figures for the fatalities — 20 Indian soldiers killed and 76 wounded while 45 Chinese soldiers were killed or wounded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/russia-to-insulate-trilateral-with-china-india-from-lac-tensions-108306

04-07-2020||New Delhi||ICMR eyes indigenous vaccine by Aug 15||The Indian Council of Medical Research today said it was eyeing an August 15 launch for India’s first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine — COVAXIN — inviting a sharp reaction from scientists.In a letter to 13 principal investigators of the clinical trials for the vaccine, ICMR chief Balram Bhargava directed fast-tracking of approvals needed to initiate the trials and warned against laxity.“The ICMR has partnered with Bharat Biotech International Ltd to fast-track clinical trials of indigenous Covid-19 vaccine BBV152 COVID. This is a top-priority project for the government being monitored at the highest level. It is envisaged to launch the vaccine for public use latest by August 15 after the completion of clinical trials,” said the letter.The letter asked investigators to ensure subject enrolment “no later than July 7, 2020”. “In view of the public health emergency, you are strictly advised to fast-track all approvals related to initiation of clinical trial.... Non-compliance will be viewed very seriously,” it said. Scientists, however, said the timeline was a “bit too much” since the Drug Controller gave Phase 1 and 2 human trial approvals on June 29 and the ICMR seeks to launch it in 45 days. Health policy researcher Anant Bhan said the claim was “highly unlikely”, while virologist T Jacob John called it “optimistic but unrealistic.”Meanwhile, India’s caseload today rose to 6,25,544 with record 20,903 infections over 24 hours. In a positive sign, the recovery rate surged past 60 per cent. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/icmr-eyes-indigenous-vaccine-by-aug-15-108308
