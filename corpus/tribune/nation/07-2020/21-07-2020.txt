21-07-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Trujet reduces salaries of employees by minimum 50%||Regional airline Trujet on Tuesday said it has decided to slash the salaries of its employees by minimum 50 per cent due to a "serious financial crunch" precipitated by the coronavirus pandemic.The Hyderabad-based company, which has a total of seven ATR aircraft in its fleet, said in a letter to employees that those who have gross salaries between Rs 15,001 and Rs 10 lakh will see a reduction of 50 per cent.Those employees who earn more than Rs 10 lakh will see a salary reduction of 60 per cent, the letter said, adding that this decrease will come into effect from June 26."As you are aware, COVID-19 has very severely hit the aviation industry and Trujet is no exception," the letter noted.The airline said it is "facing serious financial crunch/cash flow situation".              "Though Trujet management was liberal in paying full salaries in the month of March and April, slight reduction in May and June, going forward, we need to take tough decisions, though unpleasant, in the interest of the survival of the company,” the letter noted."There is no clarity as to when the COVID pandemic will come into control and as per health and industry experts, it may take at least 12-18 months to recover fully," it added.The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the coronavirus pandemic. All airlines in India have taken cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts, leave-without-pay and firings of employees in order to conserve cash flow.India's largest airline IndiGo announced on Monday it has decided to lay off 10 per cent of its workforce.                 India resumed domestic passenger flights from May 25 after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, the airlines have been allowed to operate only a maximum of 45 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights. Occupancy rate in Indian domestic flights has been around just 50-60 per cent since May 25.Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23.

21-07-2020||Amaravati||Dalit youth has head tonsured, beaten up by police; SI arrested||A Dalit youth had his head tonsured and was allegedly beaten up by police in East Godavari district after a ruling YSR Congress party leader lodged a complaint over blocking of a sand-laden lorry.The incident came to light on Tuesday, inviting the wrath of opposition parties, following which Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy took serious note of it and pulled up the police.Director General of Police DG Sawang said a sub-inspector at the police station concerned has been arrested, while two constables were placed under suspension.A case has been registered under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, he said.The DGP warned that such acts would not be tolerated and said further legal steps would be taken in the case.The youth has been admitted to the government hospital in Rajamahendravaram for treatment.A senior police officer said the Dalit youth was booked in a case filed by YSRC leader Kavala Krishna Murthy for allegedly blocking the truck that was reportedly transporting sand illicitly.According to the statement issued by the aggrieved youth, Krishna Murthy knocked him down with his car when he questioned the illegal transport of sand.Later a case was registered against him in Seetanagaram police station and the police picked him up.He was allegedly beaten up before being tonsured.On learning about the incident, local Deputy Superintendent of Police S N Rao visited the youth in the hospital and conducted an inquiry.Based on his statement, the Seetanagaram Sub-Inspector and two constables were placed under suspension and the SI was later arrested.Leader of the Opposition N Chandrababu Naidu denounced the police action and alleged that atrocities on Dalits have increased under Jagan Mohan Reddys rule.State Congress president S Sailajanath also strongly condemned the incident and demanded stern action against those responsible.Home Minister M Sucharita and Education Minister A Suresh also condemned the incident.Sucharita said in a statement that the government has taken the incident very seriously and would punish the guilty sternly.

21-07-2020||Mumbai||Serum Institute to begin trials of Oxford’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate by August-end||Serum Institute of India on Tuesday said it will be starting trials of the COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca by the end of August on up to 5,000 Indian volunteers after getting the necessary nods, and launch the vaccine by June next year if all goes well.The Pune-based company’s chief executive Adar Poonawalla said the company, which is the largest vaccine maker in the world, is putting USD 200 million at risk by manufacturing nearly 300 million doses before the final nod to launch the vaccine in market, which is expected at best by the end of the year.Oxford University on Monday announced satisfactory progress with the vaccine, making it one of the leading ones among the dozens of vaccine candidates being developed around the world.The varsity has tied up with Serum Institute of India (SII) to manufacture and supply the vaccine to India and over 60 other countries having a combined population of 3 billion, Poonawalla said.“We are making this application within the next 48 hours to the Drug Controller General of India’s office. They will probably take about 1-2 weeks on what kind of study and trial we will have to do,” Poonawalla said, speaking to CNBC-TV-18 news channel.It will take another three weeks to inject patients in hospitals, he said, adding: “We are talking about a month or month and half maximum from today...maybe even sooner”. The vaccine under development will be injected into 4,000-5,000 volunteers in Pune and Mumbai—which have high rates of coronavirus infections—as part of the crucial phase three of the trial which will determine if the antidote can be introduced in the market or not.Poonawalla said there is no dearth of volunteers and added that unlike the exclusion of older people in the initial phase of trials at Oxford, the Indian trials will include elderly people and health workers as well because the initial phase has conclusively proven the safety of the vaccine.Parallel to the process of applying for trials and having actual trials on humans in India, the company will be applying for a special permission to start manufacturing the vaccine in the country, which exposes it to a commercial risk if the vaccine fails at the last stage, he said.As part of the special permission, the company will manufacture up to 70 million doses of the vaccine per month up to October, and plans to take it up to 100 million per month by December, so that it is ready to hit the market once the final approvals are in place.If this goes to plan, the phase three trials will take two months after the patients get injected and the vaccine gets a final nod by November, he said, adding that in such a scenario, it can get introduced either in “quarter one or two” of next year.The company has already manufactured around 2-3 million doses of the vaccine for getting the process correct and also stabilising its machinery, Ponnawalla said, clarifying that these will never be used on humans.“If you look at the process right now, the risk of the opex (operating expenditure) which we are putting in is more than USD 200 million. If this vaccine fails, we will be down (by) USD 200 million,” he said, adding the expenses exclude the opportunity cost of using the same facility for some other purpose.Poonawalla also said SII is looking at external investors for the vaccine-related endeavour and added that it has tie-ups with five other vaccine candidates which will be housed into a separate step-down subsidiary, where the family will dilute its stake by 15-20 per cent. Apart from the five tie-ups already forged, SII is in talks with two other candidates, he said, adding that a manufacturing plant with capacity to produce 1 billion units of the vaccine per year will also get housed in the subsidiary. He further said it is extremely likely that the COVID-19 vaccine would require two or more doses, like in the case of antidotes for measles and other diseases.“We have got a lot on the line and bet big on this (Oxford-AstraZeneca) candidate. And we really hope it works,” he added. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/serum-institute-to-begin-trials-of-oxfords-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-by-august-end-116001
21-07-2020||New Delhi||Navy's P-8Is deployed in Ladakh; MiG-29K jets may be moved to North bases||The Indian Navy's Poseidon 8I anti-submarine warfare aircraft have been deployed in eastern Ladakh to carry out surveillance along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and some of its MiG-29K jets are likely to be stationed in key IAF bases in the northern sector amid the border row with China, sources said on Tuesday.The sources said the military brass is considering deploying Indian Navy's MiG-29K fighter jets in a couple of air bases in the northern sector as part of efforts to bring in tri-services synergy in dealing with national security challenges.The maritime fighter jets will complement the Indian Air Force's efforts to significantly boost deep strikes and air dominance capabilities, they said.    At present, the Navy has a fleet of around 40 MiG-29K jets and at least 18 of them are deployed on board the country's aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya.The IAF has already positioned almost all its frontline fighter jets like Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar and Mirage 2000 aircraft in the key frontier air bases in eastern Ladakh and elsewhere along the LAC, a move that came against the backdrop of the border row with China. Diplomatic and military talks between China and India are continuing for complete disengagement of troops from a number of friction points in eastern Ladakh.The IAF has been carrying out night time combat air patrols over the eastern Ladakh region in the last few weeks as part of its preparedness to deal with any eventualities in the mountainous region.By the second half of August, the IAF is planning to deploy five Rafale fighter jets in the Ladakh sector which are expected to significantly enhance its combat capabilities. India is scheduled to receive the first batch of five Rafale jets on July 27.As part of its high-level of alertness, the IAF has also deployed Apache attack choppers as well as Chinook heavy-lift helicopters to transport troops to various forward locations in eastern Ladakh.The sources said Poseidon 8I aircraft of the Navy has been deployed for monitoring the movement of Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh. The long-range anti-submarine and reconnaissance aircraft was deployed in Doklam along the Sikkim border too during the 73-day standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in 2017.The P-8Is were also deployed to keep an eye on movement of Pakistani troops after the Pulwama terror attack last year.In the midst of the border row with China, the Indian Navy on Monday and Tuesday carried out a military drill with a US Navy carrier strike group led by nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz off the coast of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.Four frontline warships of the Indian Navy participated in the "PASSEX" exercise when the US carrier strike group was transiting through the Indian Ocean Region(IOR) on its way from the South China Sea, officials said.The USS Nimitz is the world's largest warship and the exercise between the two navies assumed significance as it took place in the midst of China's renewed military assertiveness in eastern Ladakh as well as in South China Sea.The US Navy carrier strike Group comprises USS Nimitz, Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser USS Princeton and Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers USS Sterett and USS Ralph Johnson, the officials said.India carried out similar exercises with the Japanese navy last month.The Indian Navy has increased its surveillance missions and beefed up operational deployment in the IOR in the wake of the bitter border standoff with China in eastern Ladakh.The Indian Navy is also ramping up its operational cooperation with various friendly naval forces like the US Navy and Japan Maritime Self Defense Force in view of the fast evolving regional security landscape, the officials said.Navies from the US, India, Australia, Japan and France have been deepening their mutual cooperation in the IOR in view of China's growing attempt to expand military influence in the resource rich region.Following escalation in tension between India and China in eastern Ladakh, the government put all the three forces on high alert. The Indian Navy was asked to raise its alert-level in the IOR where Chinese Navy has been making regular forays.

21-07-2020||Kolkata||Centre plotting to topple my govt, says Mamata; BJP asserts it will go on its own||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday accused the Centre of “hatching conspiracies” to pull down the governments in opposition-ruled states by employing federal agencies and money power, and branded the BJP as the “most destructive” party.The BJP, which leads the ruling coalition at the Centre, hit right back, dismissing her allegation as “baseless” and asserting she will be ousted from power “democratically” after the assembly elections due next year.Invoking Bengali subnationalism, Banerjee termed BJP an “outsider” in West Bengal and said the state should not be ruled by “Gujarat and outsiders but by the people of the soil”.Banerjee alleged the Centre has deprived West Bengal of resources and asserted people will give a befitting reply to it for the injustice.“A conspiracy is being hatched by the union government to destabilise the elected government of Bengal by using central agencies and money power. BJP is the most destructive party the country has ever seen.“When the country is busy fighting the COVID pandemic, the BJP is busy destabilising the elected governments in Rajasthan and West Bengal after Madhya Pradesh,” she said addressing her first digital rally to mark the ‘Martyrs’ Day’.The TMC holds a ‘Martyrs’ Day’ rally on July 21 every year to commemorate the death of 13 people in police firing during a protest led by Banerjee against the then Left Front government in 1993.“Why should Gujarat rule all states? We won’t tolerate this rule of two brothers (Narendra Modi and Amit Shah).What’s the need for a federal structure? Create a ‘one nation-one party’ system then,” she said, attacking the Centre over the political turmoil in Rajasthan while referring to the Gujarati origin of the prime minister and the home minister.Warning the BJP against dislodging her government through “dubious” means, she asserted, “They should always remember that an injured tigress is more dangerous than the dead.“We don’t need to nor are we interested in destabilising the state government. This government will be voted out of power democratically. The people of this state are fed up with TMC’s goondaism and corruption,” state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh told reporters after Banerjee’s address.Reacting to Banerjee’s assertion that the TMC will hold its biggest ever rally in Kolkata in 2021 to observe the Martyr’s Day, Ghosh said she should stop “daydreaming”.“Next year she will be out of power. This year the coronavirus pandemic acted as a face-saver for her. Had the rally been held in normal circumstances you would have seen vacant galleries. This year’s digital rally was her farewell rally,” Ghosh asserted.In her speech, Banerjee alleged a “reign of fear” is prevailing across the country.The feisty TMC boss asked people to vote her party to power in the assembly elections due next year and promised to take West Bengal to new heights.“People of Bengal will rule the state and not outsiders and people from Gujarat. We should strive to ensure that security deposits of all the BJP candidates get forfeited,” she said, invoking Bengali pride.Accusing the central government of “maligning, insulting and depriving” the people of West Bengal, she said, before pointing fingers at her state the Centre should talk about the “jungle raj and encounter raj” in Uttar Pradesh.“Centre is conspiring against Bengal, saying every day there is violence and lawlessness. What about UP where jungle raj prevails. People there are afraid of even lodging a police complaint. Several police officers were killed in a single incident. The main culprit was killed in a so-called encounter to hide the truth,” she said.Indicating that the controversial National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) will be among the TMC’s major electoral planks in the assembly polls, Banerjee said the people of West Bengal have not forgotten “how innocent people were killed during the Delhi riots and genuine citizens thrown into detention camps in Assam”.Banerjee alleged the NPR and NRC were tools to create a rift between communities.“What citizenship is the BJP talking about? The refugees (from Bangladesh) have already got citizenship,” she said.“An attempt is being made to stir up communal disharmony. A party is trying to incite Hindu-Muslim riots.Remember that people of all faiths are equal. This country....Bengal...is for all,” Banerjee said.She appealed to TMC leaders “not to get lured by dirty tricks of BJP”.We have fought many battles together for the last three decades. We ousted the mighty CPI(M). We will fight out the BJP too. If they (BJP) call, try to lure you with money or threaten and intimidate you, please hang up the phone. Do not talk to them,” she said.Many TMC workers and leaders, including some MLAs, have shifted their lolalty to the BJP in the recent months.She also cautioned intellectuals of West Bengal against “falling into the BJP trap”.Banerjee also appealed to anti-BJP leaders within the CPI(M) and the Congress to join her fight against the BJP.Meanwhile, Abdul Mannan, Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly, termed the TMC as the “biggest ally” of the BJP in West Bengal.“The way the TMC engineered defections in the Congress and CPI(M) in the last few years, it will also get a dose of its own medicine. It was Mamata Banerjee who helped BJP grow in Bengal at the cost of the Congress and the Left,” the senior Congress leader said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-plotting-to-topple-my-govt-says-mamata-bjp-asserts-it-will-go-on-its-own-115998
21-07-2020||Ahmedabad||5 booked for making, distributes fake injections for critical COVID-19 patients||Five persons were booked here in Gujarat on Tuesday for allegedly manufacturing and distributing spurious tocilizumab injections being used in the treatment of critical COVID-19 patients, police said.Two of the five accused have been detained, an officer said.The action follows the state Food and Drugs Control Administration (FDCA) busting a racket involved in running a bogus pharma company based in Surat, police said.The racket was operated in Surat and Ahmedabad."The FIR has been lodged at Vastrapur police station (in Ahmedabd) against five persons. While two persons have been detained, further investigation is underway," said police inspector YB Jadeja.The accused are identified as Ashish Shah, Akshay Shah, Harsh Thakor, Nilesh Laliwala, and Sohel Tai, who is the alleged mastermind.Of them, Thakor and Laliwala have being detained, he said.Tai is the owner of Genic Pharma, a bogus firm based in Surat, from where spurious tocilizumab (Actemra) injections were being supplied to Ahmedabad.All the five accused have been booked under Sections 308 (doing act knowing that it could make him guilty of culpable homicide in case it causes death), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 276 (sale of drug as a different drug or prescription), and 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code, Jadeja said.Sections 18 (c) (selling drug without valid licence) and 27 (manufacture and sale of spurious or adulterated drug) of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act have also been invoked against them.The accused had hatched a conspiracy to make fast money during the coronavirus pandemic by producing a spurious medicine called Nandrolone Decanoate under the aegis of the bogus company, the FIR stated.They would change the name of the spurious drug and sell it as a genuine tocilizumab injection."If injected, the medicine could cause death," the officer said quoting the FIR.The complaint was lodged by FDCA drug inspector Tapan Chudasama.The racket exposed after a doctor of a private company alerted the FDCA.The concerned doctor had received a box of spurious tocilizumab injections from a relative of a COVID-19 patient whom he had prescribed the medicine, it said.During probe, the FDCA found that the medicine was purchased from Dinesh Shah who runs a pharmacy in Ahmedabad without a receipt.Shah was given the injection by his brother Ashish Shah, the FDCA had said.The probe led officials to Harsh Thakor, Nilesh Laliwala and finally to Tai, it had said.

21-07-2020||Washington||‘US monitoring situation between India and China very closely’||Describing the Chinese military's activities in the region as “destabilising”, US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper on Tuesday said America was "very closely" monitoring the situation between India and China along the Line of Actual Control.Esper made the remarks during his interaction with London-based think-tank International Institute for Strategic Studies amid China's renewed military assertiveness in eastern Ladakh as well as in the South China Sea."We are obviously monitoring the situation between India and China very closely, what's happening along the Line of Actual Control and we are very pleased to see both sides are trying to de-escalate the situation," Esper said in response to a question on the tension between the two neighbours.Asserting that the People's Liberation Army's activities in the region are “destabilising”, he said that it “continues its aggressive behaviour in the East and South China Seas.”In the midst of India's border row with China, a US Navy carrier strike group led by nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz carried out a military drill with a fleet of Indian warships off the coast of Andaman and Nicobar Islands on Monday.The USS Nimitz is the world's largest warship and the exercise between the two navies assumed significance as it took place in the midst of tensions between India and China in eastern Ladakh.Esper said that the joint exercise between the Indian Navy and the USS Nimitz in the Indian Ocean just showed the growing cooperation between the two countries."I want to highlight our increased defence cooperation with India, one of the most important defence relationships of the 21st century. We conducted our first-ever joint military exercise last November. As we speak today, USS Nimitz is conducting a combined exercise with Indian Navy in the Indian Ocean, demonstrating our shared commitment to stronger naval cooperation and support to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” he said."We firmly believe no single nation can – or should – dominate the public commons, and we will continue to work alongside our allies and partners to support a prosperous and secure Indo-Pacific for all," Esper emphasised."We also continue to grow our defence sales and look forward to a robust 2+2 ministerial dialogue later this year to build on this progress,” he said on US-India defence cooperation.Under promoting a more networked region, Esper said that the US was encouraging Indo-Pacific nations to expand their own interregional security relationships and networks of like-minded partners.For example, over the past several years, Japan has provided maritime vessels to the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Bangladesh bolstering their maritime security. "In June, Australia and India finalised an important logistical support in agreement," he said."Our carriers have been in the South China Sea and Indo-Pacific since World War II. We will back the sovereignty of our friends and partners,” he added.Esper said that to support its Indo-Pacific strategy, the Trump Administration looked forward to working with the Congress to establish a Pacific Deterrence Initiative that would prioritise its investments, maintain a credible deterrent and demonstrate and enduring whole of government commitment to the region."The US government has committed more than USD 325 million in coronavirus released support for its Indo Pacific partners," he said.When asked, how much is the US worried about nuclear and crisis stability between India and Pakistan, Esper said that obviously, when there were two countries with nuclear capabilities and tension between them, it's something the US watched very closely."I also talk to my Indian and Pakistani counterparts fairly routinely. This is just something that you got to keep a close watch on because nobody wants to see a conflict between two countries. And certainly not one that could escalate. I don't see any indications right now that that's happening at all. But, it is something that we watch, not just in that part of the world, but in other parts of the world,” he said.Esper said that China's unlawful land reclamation and military exercises on and around disputed features in the South China Sea were patently inconsistent with its commitments set out in the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the region."The Chinese Communist Party continues to engage in systemic rule-breaking, coercion and other malign activities,” he said.China has been fast expanding military and economic influence in the Indo-Pacific region, triggering concern in various countries of the region and beyond.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. Beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region.Esper asked the Chinese leaders to abide by the international laws and norms that China – and the Chinese people – have benefited greatly from over the years. “And while we hope the CCP will change its ways, we must be prepared for the alternative,” he cautioned.Relations between the US and China have taken a turn for the worse in recent months over Beijing's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Fresh concerns over China's crackdown of its Uygur Muslim community in Xinjiang and Beijing imposing a controversial national security law in Hong Kong have also raised tensions.

21-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Accused didn’t see ‘bottomless stupidity’ of propaganda to take revenge against Muslims, says court||There was a well hatched conspiracy in the murder of a local youth during the northeast Delhi riots as in order to take revenge from the Muslims, the accused, who failed to perceive the “bottomless stupidity” of the propaganda, created a WhatsApp group as “saviours” of their community, a Delhi court has observed.The court made these observations while taking cognisance of the charge sheet filed against 11 persons in the case of the alleged murder of Aamir Khan, whose body was found in a nearby drain in the Gokulpuri area.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Purushottam Pathak said there was no doubt about it that prima-facie case for commission of the offence, as alleged, did exist.The court will next hear arguments on framing of charges against the accused in the case.The incident took place when those against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the ones supporting it clashed in Delhi in February this year.In its July 20 order, the court further said: “The accused—Lokesh Kumar Solanki, Pankaj Sharma, Sumit Chaudhary, Ankit Chaudhary, Prince, Rishabh Chaudhary, Jatin Sharma, Vivek Panchal and Himanshu Thakur—have committed an offence under sections 302 (murder), 144 (unlawful assembly), 147 and 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 201 (disappearance of evidence), 395 (dacoity), 396 (dacoity with murder), 427, 432 and 435 (mischief), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. “The accused persons namely Pawan Kumar has committed the offence under sections 412 (dishonestly receiving property stolen in the commission of dacoity), 201 IPC and accused Lalit Kumar has committed the offence under section 412 IPC,” it said.The offences carry a maximum punishment of death penalty.The court said the members of the WhatsApp group, named ‘Kattar Hindu Ekta’, lost their individuality and started working with mob mind and sacred slogans “deadened” their mind.“From the investigation and the statements of the witnesses, and the charge sheet, it is prima facie revealed that there was a well hatched conspiracy amongst the accused persons. Same is evident from the fact that in order to take revenge from Muslims some youths of that area who failed to perceive the bottomless stupidity of the propaganda, they as saviours of their community created a WhatsApp group,” it said. “The group members lost their individuality and started working with mob mind. ‘Jai Sri Ram’ and ‘Har Har Mahadev’ which are the sacred slogans and are attached to the victorious yelling, deadend their mind and paralyzed their creative nature,” it said.The mob turned into rioters and allegedly caused death of Aamir by inflicting multiple injuries in a brutal manner and to conceal the evidence threw his body in the drain, the court said. “It has been found that the common object of the unlawful assembly was not only to kill but also to destroy all evidence of that crime... There cannot be any doubt that the accused who killed Aamir Khan were certainly up to their neck in the conspiracy and were thus very active members of the unlawful assembly,” it said.It was also clear that there were averments in respect of promoting enmity between different groups on the ground of religion and acting in a way that are prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony, the court noted.“In a case where a group of people conspired, thereafter assembled to take revenge and where the victims have been targeted on the basis of their religious identity, the relevant provisions of law attracting relevant offences should have been mentioned in the Charge Sheet. Further no Sanction has been obtained in this regard,” it added.According to the charge sheet filed on June 4, emphasis was laid on the calls made to the police control room (PCR) during the riots in the area.During scrutiny of PCR calls it was found that total 27 calls regarding riots were made in the proximity area of Gokalpuri Ganda Nala Pulia, of which five were made by eyewitnesses, including two calls made regarding the incident, the charge sheet said.It further said that one of the callers who was traced and examined, stated that on February 26 he had gone towards Bhagirathi Vihar side to search his missing bike and on reaching there, he found there was a huge mob at the spot, armed with stones, cudgel, sticks, swords and iron rods and they were allegedly shouting slogans like ‘Jai Sri Ram’, ‘Har Har Mahadev’.He had seen the mob allegedly stopping two persons riding on a bike and after establishing their Muslim identity they killed both of them with stones, cudgel, sticks, swords and iron rods and thereafter threw the bodies in the drain, it said.Further during the course of investigation, the investigating officer noticed that three persons, Mohit Sharma, Shivam Bhardwaj and Dimple Rai, were continuously hovering around the investigation team and were trying to snoop on their conversation, the police told the court.The police said that the three persons were stopped and mobile data of their phones were looked into, from which it was revealed that they were members of the WhatsApp group namely ‘Kattar Hindu Ekta’.Further investigation of this group revealed that it was created on February 25, allegedly for taking “revenge” from Muslim community, the charge sheet said.It further said that the accused were identified by the witness and they have been accused of allegedly leading the Hindu mob and were allegedly involved in the killing of nine Muslim persons, including Aamir. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-accused-didnt-see-bottomless-stupidity-of-propaganda-to-take-revenge-against-muslims-says-court-115986

Jis se shikayat karo wo khud vasooli kar leta hai,” broadly suggesting: “I have not seen so much corruption in my entire political life as much as I am seeing and hearing now. And if you complain about it to someone, you have to pay for it.”This is not the first time the MLA has posted against the government, the system and officials on the social media, according to reports. Shyam Prakash, who left the SP to join the BJP, has also been in the BSP and the Congress. In the SP also he had spoken against the government.Sources say Shyam Prakash is drawing support from not just the Opposition but also “many within the BJP” who all have complaints about “over-centralisation” of power and their own lack of relevance and clout in the Adityanath regime. “The UP government is functioning on the lines of the Central BJP government,” they claim.UP-based political observer Sudheer Panwar explains: “Wave politics has dwarfed local politicians and their issues. Local politicians are largely treated as mere extension of the Central leadership. Earlier, Congress and regional parties suffered from the syndrome but after the Modi phenomenon, situation has also changed in the BJP. Power is concentrated in a handful of politicians and administrative team making the rest more or less redundant.”The BJP won the 2017 Assembly elections on the Narendra Modi wave and without a chief minister face. Notably, Shyam Prakash had also alleged “misuse” of MLA funds in the name of Covid fund and asked the balance to be returned to him. Though the BJP appears to have chosen to ignore the issue, its MLA has been drawing support from the Opposition parties who are using the opportunity to level accusations against it. “The public is upset with all-round corruption, now even BJP MLAs are saying that,” they said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-mla-in-up-targets-own-govt-says-corruption-at-its-peak-115982

Later, it turned out that the CJI didn’t ride Harley Davidson bike and just sat on it to have a feel of the machine. He didn’t even know who its owner was, it was clarified.But it was immediately not clear if Bhushan’s tweet about the CJI was the reason behind the contempt proceedings or the development related to something else. Known for his comments critical of the judiciary, Bhushan, when contacted, said, “I don’t know the reasons for the contempt (proceedings) against me.”A criminal contempt petition is already pending against him since 2009. His father and senior advocate Shanti Bhushan intervened as a party in the case and filed an affidavit about corruption in judiciary. But the matter has not been heard for several years.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-initiates-contempt-proceedings-against-prashant-bhushan-twitter-india-115976

As an emergency measure, the agency wrote to the concerned banks to freeze the said bank accounts. Notices have been issued to the bank account holders,” said a senior ED official.It is also learnt that the Brazilian government has shared evidence which prime facie substantiates charges of money laundering involving the Brazilian governor and Indian individuals, who allegedly transacted with the governor.Sources said frozen bank accounts are mostly held by companies, which deal in household and consumer products. They went on to add that since the alleged money laundering involved in the case has “Indian footprints”, the agency was swift to act upon and “the necessary information sought by the Brazilian government” will be shared in due course.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-acts-on-brazils-request-freezes-over-60-bank-accounts-in-india-under-pmla-115964

That is the goal,” Bhushan said on Tuesday.The Health Ministry official also stated that India’s tests per million figure was improving substantially and had reached 180 tests per day per million. “At present 30 states are testing more than 180 persons per day per million,” said Bhushan, adding that the rate of testing needed to be seen in conjunction with the positive rate.India’s overall positivity rate from COVID-19 as of Tuesday is 8.07 per cent with 30 states posting corresponding rates lower than the national average. “The WHO has said aggressive testing is the biggest tool to contain COVID-19 and that 140 tests per day per million people is comprehensive and should be maintained over a period of time. We have repeatedly told states to test more and not get overawed by the high number of cases,” said Bhushan.“When you test aggressively cases will rise in the initial phases but once you achieve a high level of testing over a prolonged period positivity rate will eventually fall below 5 per cent. That should be the goal,” he added.At least eight states which are testing more than 140 persons per day per million have achieved COVID positivity rates of under 5 per cent. These include Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, West Bengal and Karnataka.“High testing and positivity rates have to be seen together. The purpose of high testing should be to achieve a lower than 5 per cent positivity rate gradually," said the Ministry.No community transmissionRajesh Bhushan also said there was no community transmission in India as of now and the WHO had not laid down any definition of community transmission.“We still maintain we have clusters of cases and large local outbreaks. For instance in Delhi alone the sero prevalence survey has shown the percentage of people affected ranging from 13 per cent in one district to 27 per cent in another which shows the infection is not uniformly spread.”“We still maintain there is no community transmission in India. This is an academic debate. What matters is what we do in the field to contain the disease,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/national-covid-goals-less-than-1-pc-death-rate-under-5-pc-positivity-115959

Varavara Rao was arrested two years ago by the Maharashtra Police from his house in Hyderabad and has since been in the Mumbai jail, where he developed health issues recently and was later shifted to JJ Hospital in Mumbai. He had been hallucinating and was referred to a neurologist.Last week, Rao tested positive for COVID-19 and has been reporting failing health. His daughter Pavana alleged that the government was not keeping the family informed about his health. Following media reports of the poet’s ill health, the Telangana State Committee of the CPI (Maoist) has sought his immediate release.Rao’s bail application was listed before the Bombay High Court last week where his lawyer Sandeep Pasbola told the court: “Rao’s condition is very serious, he hit his head against the hospital bed while he was at the JJ Hospital and sustained severe injuries. Besides Covid-19, he suffers from several ailments; he is hallucinating and is delirious”. However, the court did not grant him bail and will hear arguments again on July 22.On Sunday, 145 foreign scholars had issued a statement demanding the immediate release of Rao and the other activists in the Bhima Koregaon and Elgar Parishad cases. The signatories said that the poet-activist is a “long-time speaker of truth to power”, and alleged that the government has failed to bring the charges to court and start the trial, over the past two years. Cases of all accused will come up for hearing of bail plea later this week.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maoists-scholars-come-out-in-support-of-telugu-poet-varavara-115958

21-07-2020||Arun Joshi||No Amarnath Yatra this year due to Covid outbreak||Tribune News ServiceJammu, July 21The Shri Amarnath Shrine Board and the UT administration of J&K announced on Tuesday that the Amarnath pilgrimage of year 2020 has been cancelled in view of the squeeze and situation caused by the pandemic of coronavirus that has resulted in dislocation of life.An official announcement was made on Tuesday evening after the UT administration and SASB in a joint meeting conducted through video conference, chaired by Lt. Governor G C Murmu, who also is chairman of the shrine board, saying that in the given situation of the pandemic which has tested the limits of the health infrastructure, it would be “advisable to cancel the yatra” in the interests of the pilgrims too.This is for the first time in the history of the pilgrimage that dates back to 19th century, when the cave shrine was discovered by shepherds, that the yatra has been cancelled due to the pandemic, though there were short-duration disruptions because of the natural calamities or the terror attacks.In 2017, despite a major terror attack in south Kashmir, the yatra was continued as the then Governor and chairman of the SASB, N N Vohra had decided to go ahead with the pilgrimage.Amarnath shrine is nestled in high Himalayas at the height of 13,500 ft above sea level. An ice stalagmite that is revered as an icon of Lord Shiva, and reverently called as “Shivlingam” is the main attraction of the pilgrimage that also symbolises the communal harmony in Kashmir.The holy mace, better known as “Charri Mubarak” will, however, would be facilitated to reach the shrine through special arrangements made by the J&K UT administration. It may be airlifted to the shrine on August 3, the Raksha Bandhan day, that marks the conclusion of the yatra.An official release said, “It is not advisable to hold and conduct this year’s Shri Amarnathji Yatra” and announced the cancellation of the pilgrimage.The SASB and the government officials held a “threadbare discussion on the current circumstances of COVID-19 pandemic and its likely impact on the Yatra”. The meeting also discussed various rulings of the Supreme Court and High Court on the yatra.It was claimed that the that the arrangements were on track since February 2020, but due to nationwide lockdown and pandemic, State Executive Committee, J&K, has still continued to keep religious places and places of worship closed for the public. These prohibitions continue till July 31.The government admitted that “the pandemic has put the health administration system to its limit. The spike has been particularly very sharp in July. Health workers and security forces are also getting infected and the focus of entire medical, civil and police administration at the moment is on containing the local transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic. The health concerns are so serious that the strain on the health system, along with the diversion in resources to the Yatra, will be immense. This would also unnecessarily put the Yatris at risk of catching the COVID-19”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-amarnath-yatra-this-year-due-to-covid-outbreak-115952

The state government should immediately repair and beautify it."          Jairam Ashram paramadhyaksha Swami Brahmaswaroop Brahmachari and Swami Harichetnanand Maharaj complained that things are being done in a very unplannned manner in Haridwar which may lead to a big accident in the future.They advised the administration to examine the entire Har ki Pairi area from safety point of view and carry out the necessary repair work wherever required.Teerth purohit Pandit Ashutosh Sharma said the wall that collapsed had been built in 1935.

21-07-2020||Vijay Mohan||DRDO develops drone to monitor border areas||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 21The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has developed an unmanned aerial vehicle for real-time surveillance of border areas and monitoring activities in difficult terrain.  It is first expected to be deployed with Army units along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh as the stand-off with China in eastern Ladakh continues and the disengagement of troops is facing hurdles.The drone, christened ‘Bharat’, has been developed by DRDO’s Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory (TBRL), and is a further development of the drone that had been developed earlier by TBRL in response to the requirements for technologies to mitigate the COVID-19 threat.“The drone is capable of providing real-time video feed as well as still images to its operators and its controlling software has built-in artificial intelligence tools for analysis and decision-making,” a senior DRDO scientist said. "Besides the armed forces, It also has the potential for being used by the Central Armed Police Forces and law enforcement agencies," he added.The design of the drone is said to incorporate low observable features to make its detection difficult by the adversary. Projected to be among the world’s lightest and most agile and surveillance platforms, it has an operational range of a few kilometres and is meant for tactical intelligence gathering and surveillance in a localised area.Bharat has been designed entirely by TBRL, which is involved in development, production, processing and characterisation of different high-explosive compositions, fragmentation studies of warheads, captive flight testing of bombs, missiles and airborne systems and ballistics evaluation of protective systems like body armour, vehicle armour and helmets.It has also developed other products like face shields and examination enclosures for the medical fraternity and contactless sanitizer dispenser for use in the fight against COVID-19.Bharat has been ruggedised to operate in high altitude areas and in extreme climatic conditions. Its payload includes an array of sensors, including infrared and night vision equipment to operate in varied geographical environments.Advanced drones for use by local commanders in the field within their own area of responsibility have for long been on the Army’s wish list and some variants with different operational capability are already in service.The Army is also looking at employment of miniature drones to keep a watch on mountain passes during winters when high snow makes the movement of troops or manning forward outposts difficult.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/drdo-develops-drone-to-monitor-border-areas-115948

The location is very strategic. It is equidistant from the east and west”.“In case of raid at Ambala, it has to go through many layers of air defence before reaching the air base. It will give us adequate warning to be able to take all precautionary measures. We can activate all ground and air based defence systems to take care of any threat.”“We also got first of Jaguar aircrafts at Ambala which is a Deep Penetration Strike Aircraft (DPSA). It implies we have a long range which we can cover, do the job and come back at our base or land at a secondary base. So, it suited the Jaguar aircrafts and two squadrons were formed at Ambala.”“Over a period of more than 50 years, the infrastructure at Ambala is developed enough to induct any new aircraft without pumping a lot of money. The air defence systems around Ambala are also developed,” he said.“Rafale gives us longer range than Jaguars. Ambala gives us adequate depth when the range required is more, both towards the north and west. We have adequate area for air to air refueling which is not possible at forward bases,” he said.At present, Ambala has two squadrons of Jaguar and one of MIG-21 Bison.  “The second base for Rafale is planned at Hashimara (West Bengal). Pakistan is not the real enemy as far air power is concerned, but our eastern neighbour China is. When we didn’t have Rafale, we had moved three squadrons of Sukhoi in the east. With Rafale, we will have adequate number of airborne fighters and fighter bombers to look after the China threat,” he said.He added that nearby bases of Hashimara had also been beefed up.Barbora had also served as Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Eastern Air Command and then Western Air Command.The Indian Air Force is inducting Rafale aircrafts into the ‘Golden Arrows’ squadron on July 29. History of ‘Golden Arrows’After MIG-21 aircrafts were phased out, Golden Arrows was ‘number plated’ on December 31, 2011. It was resurrected on September 10, 2019, when Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa was Chief of Air Staff.Dhanoa himself had served in the ‘Golden Arrows’.  It was formed on October 1, 1951, at Ambala under the command of Flight Lieutenant DL Springett. Then it was equipped with Harvard-II B aircraft.  According to information provided by the Indian Air Force, the squadron converted fully to De Havilland Vampire by November, 1955 and by 1957, it was flying Hawker Hunter aircrafts.The squadron converted to the MIG-21 M in 1975.As far as operations were concerned, the squadron participated in Goa Liberation Campaign in December, 1961 and in 1965 operations as a reserve force.Under the command of Wing Commander N Chatrath, it took part in the Indo-Pak war of 1971 and flew close air support, counter air and fighter recce missions, getting numerous gallantry awards.In November, 1988, the squadron was presented ‘Colours’ by then President of India, R Venkataraman.Under Dhanoa, when he was Wing Commander, Golden Arrows participated actively in Operation ‘Safed Sagar’ in 1999.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ambalas-strategic-location-behind-using-it-for-induction-of-rafale-former-air-vice-chief-barbora-115947

21-07-2020||New Delhi||Govt notifies two ordinances for barrier-free farm trading||The government has notified two Ordinances which seek to provide barrier-free trade for farmers’ produce outside the notified farm mandis, and empowers farmers to enter into farming agreements with private players prior to production for sale of agri-produce.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance and the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance were promulgated on June 5, 2020. However, the Union Agriculture Ministry notified the two Ordinances on July 20.According to the notification, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance allows intra-state and inter-state trade of farmers’ produce outside the government notified mandis.Farmers are allowed to trade at any place of production, aggregation and collection centres of farmers’ produce, including farm gates, factory premises, warehouses, silos and cold storages.The Ordinance also permits electronic trading of farmers’ produce in the specified trade area. Private players, farmer producer organisations or agricultural cooperative society can establish and operate such platforms.A person operating the platform will be subject to a penalty between Rs 50,000 and Rs 10 lakh for non-compliance with e-trading provisions. In case of continuous contravention, a further penalty of up to Rs 10,000 per day may be imposed.On payment, the Ordinance clearly states that a person transacting with a farmer will be required to make payments to the farmer on the same day, or within three working days in certain conditions, for any transaction of scheduled farmers’ produce.The Ordinance, however, prohibits state governments from levying any market fee, cess or levy on farmers, traders, and electronic trading platforms.It also specifies dispute resolution mechanisms where the parties involved in a trade-related dispute may apply to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate for relief through conciliation.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance provides for farming agreements with private players prior to production for sale of agri-produce at pre-determined price, quality and period of delivery.The Ordinance also provides a framework for protection and empowerment of farmers with reference to sale and purchase of farm products. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-notifies-two-ordinances-for-barrier-free-farm-trading-115942

21-07-2020||New Delhi||NCERT adds scrapping of Article 370 to Class 12 textbook chapter, drops portion on separatist politics in JK||The NCERT has revised a chapter in its Class 12 political science textbook to drop a paragraph on separatist politics in Jammu and Kashmir and to add a brief mention of the scrapping of its special status last year.The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has revised the chapter in the textbook “Politics in India since Independence” for the academic session 2020-21.While the topic “Separatism and Beyond” has been deleted from the chapter, the scrapping of Article 370, which gave the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir special status, has been included under the topic “Regional Aspirations”.On August 5 last year, the Centre had scrapped the state’s special status and divided it into Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.“One strand of separatists who want a separate Kashmiri nation, independent of India and Pakistan. Then there are groups that want Kashmir to merge with Pakistan. Besides these, there is a third strand, which wants greater autonomy for the people of the state within the Indian union,” the deleted portion read.The chapter then talks about the President’s Rule imposed in June 2018 after the BJP withdrew its support to the Mehbooba Mufti government and towards the end, mentions the withdrawal of Article 370.The revised portion, where the chapter talks about Jammu and Kashmir, says: “Jammu and Kashmir had a special status under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. However, in spite of it, the region witnessed violence, cross-border terrorism and political instability with internal and external ramifications.”“The Article resulted in the loss of many lives, including that of innocent civilians, security personnel and militants. Besides, there was also a large-scale displacement of Kashmiri Pandits from the Kashmir valley,” it read.“On August 5, 2019, Parliament had approved a resolution abrogating special status to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution. The state was also bifurcated into two Union territories — Ladakh with no Legislative Assembly and Jammu and Kashmir with one,” the revised portion read.The revised textbook takes into account the developments that took place in Jammu and Kashmir from 2002 onward.Earlier this month, a controversy had erupted over the reduction of the syllabus by the CBSE due to the COVID-19 situation, with the Opposition alleging that chapters on India’s democracy and plurality are being “dropped” to propagate a particular ideology.But the Board had insisted it is a one-time measure for this academic year only and is not restricted to a particular subject as is being projected by some.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had notified the new syllabus for Class 9 to Class 12 for the 2020-21 academic session after rationalising up to 30 per cent of the curriculum.According to the updated curriculum, the chapters deleted from the Class 10 syllabus are those dealing with democracy and diversity, gender, religion and caste, popular struggles and movement and challenges to democracy.For Class 11, the deleted portions include the chapters on federalism, citizenship, nationalism, secularism and growth of local governments in India.Similarly, Class 12 students will not be required to study the chapters on India’s relations with its neighbours — Pakistan, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, the changing nature of India's economic development, social movements in India and demonetisation, among others.

Beginning near Madiwala, the 13 km long flyover terminates at Electronic City where several IT offices are located."Muniyappa was speeding on the flyover because the lockdown is offering him the option of empty roads. The traffic is very less so he could manage that way," told CCB Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Kuldeep Jain to IANS.Though the police could not figure out the exact day he pulled off the stunt, Jain said it could have happened in the past week itself as the city was under lockdown. "He was just trying to show off. He thought its bravery and fascinating to ride his 1,000 cc motorcycle at that mind-blowing speed," told Jain disapprovingly.The rider shot the video from what looked like a helmet-mounted camera and began recording when his motorcycle was speeding around 90 kmph.He started negotiating the traffic and increasingly hit the throttle, crossing a city bus, some auto-rickshaws, trucks, cars and other two-wheelers, as he zigzagged from left to right before getting onto the flyover.Muniyappa got onto the flyover at a speed of 140 kmph to only accelerate much higher and immediately reached a speed of 200 km and above. With no traffic over a long stretch, he reached speeds ranging between 290-299 kmph for a good amount of time to only slow down after seeing a Toyota Etios, Innova and a two-wheeler.Decelerating to just above 100 kmph, he quickly overtook the three vehicles to again race back to speeds ranging above 200 kmph as the video culminated.It was not difficult to trace the violator as Muniyappa gave himself up by uploading the video on social media. "He had uploaded the video on social media. We were able to get his Instagram handle. Based on his Instagram handle we used our cyber experts to procure his phone number and other details and we could get him," said Jain.The DCP said racing, wheeling and related traffic offences are a regular feature in Bengaluru but mostly during the night. "We conduct special checks late in the night just to bust these speeding violators during normal times," he said.

21-07-2020||Aditi Tandon||One in 4 Delhi residents is Covid affected; large population still vulnerable: Govt survey||Tribune News Service New Delhi, July 21Only one in four Delhi residents have contracted COVID-19 in six months of the outbreak of the virus.A National Centre for Disease Control surveillance of the Delhi population has shown that 23.48 per cent of the people have developed antibodies to the disease showing their past history of COVID-19 infection.The NCDC conducted sero surveillance between June 27 and July 10. Blood samples were collected from 21,387 people and the ICMR developed ELISA tests were also done to detect antibodies for the disease.Antibodies were found in only 23.48 per cent people.“Nearly six months into the epidemic, only 23.48 per cent of the people are affected in Delhi, which has several pockets of dense population. This can be attributed to the proactive efforts taken by the government to prevent the spread of the infection such as prompt lockdown, effective containment and surveillance measures, including contact tracing and tracking, as well as citizen’s compliance COVID Appropriate Behaviours,” Health Ministry said today.A downside of the survey, however, is that a large population in the national capital is still susceptible to the disease since only a very small proportion have been infected.“A significant proportion of the population is still vulnerable. Therefore, containment measures need to continue with the same rigour. Non-pharmacological interventions such as physical distancing, use of face masks and covers, hand hygiene, cough etiquette and avoidance of crowded places must be followed strictly,” the ministry said.Survey teams were formed for all 11 districts of Delhi. Blood samples were collected from selected individuals after taking written informed consent and then their sera were tested for IgG antibodies and infection using COVID KAVACH ELISA approved by the Indian Council for Medical Research.Delhi’s survey is one of the largest seroprevalence studies conducted in the country using the ELISA testing. A national survey earlier conducted had covered around 20,000 samples until April and found less than one per cent Indian population had antibodies to the COVID causing virus.A large susceptible population is a major concern going forward.Epidemiologists say as long as tenges a large susceptible pool the virus will spread and physical distancing measures will remain key protections.Antibody testing repeatedly was done over time.Sero surveillance generates important evidence for assessing the spread of the pandemic from time to time.The results of the seroprevalence study show that on an average, across Delhi, the prevalence of IgG antibodies is 23.48 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/one-in-4-delhi-residents-is-covid-affected-large-population-still-vulnerable-govt-survey-115902

Nalini said she will commit suicide if the cell of the co-prisoner was changed,” the official told PTI.“It was like blackmail. If the complainant’s cell was changed, Nalini could not extract work from her...she only threatened (to end her life) but there was no attempt,” he asserted.Nalini, in prison for over 29 years, told the jailor that she would end her life in the presence of others including the assistant jailor and prison staffers last evening, the official said.The high profile case convict’s legal adviser, P Pugazhenthi told PTI that jail officials gave “contradicting versions” which showed that they were “trying to hide something.”  Some officials said Nalini tried to “strangulate herself” using her saree during questioning, he claimed, adding others maintained that she only threatened to do so but did nothing.“We have given a representation to authorities to shift Nalini Sriharan to Chennai Puzhal prison for her safety,” he said.Besides Nalini, six others, including her husband V Sriharan alias Murugan, a Sri Lankan national, are serving life imprisonment in the assassination case.Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by an LTTE suicide bomber during an election rally at Sriperumpudur near here on May 21, 1991.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajiv-case-convict-nalini-threatens-suicide-in-jail-after-quarrel-with-another-inmate-115901
21-07-2020||New Delhi||Indian medical experts welcome Oxford trial results for COVID vaccine||Medical experts in India have hailed the results of Oxford University’s early-stage human trials for a COVID-19 vaccine, with some saying it’s the “most scientifically done” among all such exercises, while others expressing hope that the final trials will “bear fruit”.From clinicians to pathology experts, doctors in the country feel the Oxford trials have been the “most transparent” one by far.“Oxford University’s early-stage trial results have been very welcoming. Among all trials being conducted globally, this one has been the most scientifically done and seems the most reliable one,” said Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine at Apollo Hospital here.He said the plan and design of the trials and the whole logistics and demographic range of volunteers from 18 to 55 years have been “done the most scientifically” among all trials going on globally.Chatterjee said the results had raised “good hope” and it was expected the final results would be in line, but “we need to wait for that before drawing any final conclusion”.The trial data of a COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University reveals that it is safe and induces an immune response, with mild side effects in some participants, scientists announced on Monday.The preliminary results of phase I/II trial, just published in The Lancet journal, involved 1,107 healthy adults, and found that the vaccine-induced an immune response both via antibodies and the T cells of the immune system up to day 56 of the ongoing trial.Since emerging in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last year, the virus has killed over 6,06,000 people and infected more than 14,538,000 people worldwide. In India, the virus has caused deaths and infected over 11 lakh people, according to latest official figures.Executive Chairman, Dr Lal Path Labs, Dr Arvind Lal also hailed the initial results, terming it as “very positive” and “best trials conducted globally so far”.“This is such a promising trial and I am very hopeful it will go the distance. And, early-stage results will lead to good final-stage results. I am very optimistic about its final outcome and it will bear fruits,” Lal said.On the trial results he said, it has taken into account response of adult volunteers from 18 to 55 years, a broad-based age group.“Serum Institute of India is associated with the trial process, and if we develop this vaccine, it is going to really benefit India, both clinically and economically,” Lal said.Dr Mrinal Sircar, head of pulmonology at Fortis Hospital, Noida, also welcomed the results, but cautioned that “prevention is the only thing we have in hand” and people should maintain the safety norms and “not let their guards down”.“I think it’s (trials) really important. The vaccine is the only thing that will stop this pandemic. Vaccine is very important. I am looking forward to it. Once things are beyond safety trials, we can say anything. Normally, it would take years,” he said.Dr Lal said developing a vaccine through such trials is like a marathon race. “Oxford trials have crossed the first hurdle successfully, and I am positive that it will breast the tape eventually in the race,” he added.

And I can never imagine raising questions on the role played by these two communities in advancing India," Deb tweeted."I had expressed the views some people have about them. I am proud of Punjabi and Jat communities. I have lived among them for quite some time... If my statement has hurt anyone's feelings, I apologise for that," the chief minister said on Twitter.Addressing a programme at the Agartala Press Club on Sunday, Deb had said every community in India is known for its certain type and character.A video clip of the chief minister's statement had gone viral on social media."For Bengal or Bengalis, it is said that one should not challenge them when it is regarding intelligence. Bengalis are known as very intelligent and it is their identity," Deb was heard saying in the clip.Punjabis and Jats are known for their physical strength, the BJP leader had said."When we talk about the people of Punjab, we say he's a Punjabi, a Sardar. They may have less intelligence but are very strong. One can't win them over by strength but with love and affection. A large number of Jats live in Haryana. So what do people say about Jats? Jats are less intelligent but are very healthy. If one challenges a Jat, he will bring a gun from his house," he had said.Reacting to his remark, Pijush Biswas, the Congress state unit chief, said Deb should be more cautious while making a statement."His remarks are unacceptable. He is holding a very responsible post and should not make such comments. He should be careful while making a statement," Biswas told reporters.On Monday, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala had said that Deb, with his controversial remark, has insulted the "Sikh brothers" of Punjab and the Jat community of Haryana."This is the BJP's lowly mindset. Why are Khattar ji and Dushyant Chautala silent? Where are Modi ji and Naddaji? Apologize, take action," Surjewala had tweeted.Earlier, too, Chief Minister Deb had courted controversies on multiple occasions.In 2018, he said internet and satellite television existed in the time of the Mahabharata.He had questioned the crowning of Diana Hayden as "Miss World" in 1997 and alleged that international beauty pageants were a farce.Last year, he claimed that Mughals intended to destroy the cultural wonders of the state by "bombing" its arts and architectures.

His body was found hanging from the ceiling of his official residence in Churu, officials said.The move comes at a time when the Rajasthan government is facing political turmoil after Sachin Pilot’s rebellion and his subsequent sacking as Deputy Chief Minister.Sources, however, made it clear that the agency was conducting investigation in a professional manner in a case handed over to it by the state government itself.The agency had on Monday evening questioned Congress MLA Krishna Poonia for nearly three hours at her home in Jaipur, they said.The sources said people are being examined to know various aspects of the case and it does not mean that they are accused as a final picture will emerge only after completion of probe.The Rajasthan Government had handed over the probe to the CBI in the case.Bishnoi’s brother had filed a complaint with the Rajasthan police alleging he was under pressure which led him to take this drastic step, they said.Two suicide notes were recovered from Vishnoi — one addressed to his parents and the other to the Superintendent of Police of the district.In the suicide note to the SP, Vishnoi had said he was not able to bear the pressure put on him. In his suicide note, he had also said that he tried to give his best to the Rajasthan Police.A screenshot of a purported WhatsApp chat that Vishnoi had with one of his activist friends, in which the police officer talked about being trapped in dirty politics, had also gone viral.The leaders of the BJP and the BSP have alleged that the officer, who was known for his honesty and hardwork, was being pressured by Congress MLA Poonia, a charge that she has denied.Poonia represents Sadulpur constituency in Rajasthan.

In view of the above, I request you to instruct all concerned to follow the use of face/mouth cover and prevent inappropriate use of N-95 masks," DGHS Rajiv Garg said in the letter.The government had in April issued an advisory on the use of homemade protective cover for face and mouth, asking people to wear it, particularly when they step out of their residences.The advisory stressed such face covers must be washed and cleaned each day, as instructed and states that any used cotton cloth can be used to make this face cover.  The colour of the fabric does not matter but one must ensure that the fabric is washed well in boiling water for five minutes and dried well before making the face cover. Adding salt to this water is recommended, it said.It also listed the procedures of making such homemade masks, asking to ensure it fits the face well and there are no gaps on the sides.It urges people to wash hands thoroughly before wearing the face cover,  switching to another fresh one as the face cover becomes damp or humid, and never reusing it after single use without cleaning it. "Never share the face cover with anyone. Every member in a family should have separate face cover," the advisory stated.

21-07-2020||New Delhi||Aim to maintain aggressive COVID-19 testing, bring positivity rate below 5 per cent: Govt||Thirty states and Union Territories have COVID-19 positivity rate lower than that of the national average which stands at 8.07 per cent, the Centre said on Tuesday, emphasising that its ultimate aim was to maintain the aggressive testing and bring down the positivity rate to below 5 per cent.India’s COVID-19 fatality rate has dropped significantly to 2.43 per cent from 3.36 per cent on June 17 due to effective clinical management of coronavirus cases, the health ministry and asserted that the country has handled the pandemic “relatively well”.Nineteen states and UTs are performing more than 140 tests per day per million population as per the World Health Organization (WHO) guidance, Rajesh Bhushan, officer on special duty in the Union Health Ministry, said at a press briefing here.“Just doing tests is not enough, they have to be done at a level of 140 tests per day per million so that the rate of positivity reduces and comes down to 10 per cent first and then continue that level of testing so that the rate of positivity further reduces to 5 per cent or lower,” he said.“So that is the ultimate aim, to maintain this level of testing and bring positivity down to 5 per cent eventually or even lower than that,” he said.Thirty states and Union Territories have COVID-19 positivity rate lower than that of the national average which stands at 8.07 per cent, Bhushan said.States having lower positivity than the national average include Rajasthan (2.46 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (3.9 per cent), Assam (4.03 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (4.06 per cent), Andhra Pradesh (4.16 per cent), Haryana (6.47 per cent), West Bengal (6.94 per cent) and Karnataka (7.29 per cent).On some states claiming that there is community transmission happening in their areas, Bhushan said the WHO has not given any standard definition of community transmission.It permits that its member nations can, based on their own analysis of the situation, assess the spread of the disease and do its reporting which the global body shows on its website, he said.Broadly, if it is not possible to trace the transmission chain, then it means that there is community transmission, Bhushan said.“We have been telling that in our country, there are clusters of cases and there are pockets of localised transmission. That is our stand even now,” he said.Bhushan, however, asserted that it was not important what kind of transmission was happening, what was important was what action was being taken at the ground level.“We have repeatedly been telling states to focus on effective containment and surveillance, house-to-house surveys, increasing the testing and timely treatment of positive cases so that we can bring the mortality rate from 2.4 down to 1 per cent,” he elaborated.In India, the COVID-19 deaths per million population stand at 20.4 per million, which is amongst the lowest in the world, Bhushan said.“There are several countries where the deaths per million is 21 times or 33 times higher than in India. The global average stands at 77 deaths per million population,” he said.“So far, the nation has managed COVID-19 relatively well. The Government of India is cooperating with all states and UTs. All decisions are being taken based on science and evidence-based inputs and in consultation with domain knowledge experts,” Bhushan said.On the testing done in Delhi, Bhushan said on an average 9,000-9,500 tests were conducted per day in Delhi in the first week of June and Delhi’s positivity rate was 37 per cent then.At that time, it was said that lakhs of cases would come. The Centre consulted certain domain experts, who held talks with the Delhi government, and a strategy was formed and it was decided that tests have to be increased, he said.The strategy which focused on better containment, surveillance, house-to house searching, increased testing and effective management of positive cases led to the present improved situation in Delhi, he said.Asked if Delhi had passed the peak going by the sero-survey findings and the current trends in Delhi, Director of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh said that this cannot be said as yet as there is a susceptible population present and virus can infect them.NITI Aayog member VK Paul said there is a need to remain vigilant so that cases do not rise again.“Peak is also in our hands and if we have reached at this stage then we should make it even tougher for virus infection to increase,” he said.India will ensure regulatory facilitation and actively consider supplementing resources if needed for expediting the Serum Institute of India’s phase 3 trial of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by the Oxford University, Paul said. He also said that two indigenous vaccines are in Phase I and II of the human trials in the country.India recorded 37,148 COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, pushing its tally to 11,55,191, while the total number of recoveries increased to 7,24,577, according to Union health ministry data issued on 8 am Tuesday.The death toll due to the disease rose to 28,084 with 587 fatalities reported in a day, the data showed.The recovered cases among COVID-19 patients to 7,24,577, as on date, while there are 4,02,529 active cases and all are under medical supervision.The recovery rate has further improved to 62.72 per cent, the ministry said.

21-07-2020||Jaipur||HC likely to pronounce order on petition filed by Pilot, 18 other rebel Cong MLAs today||The Rajasthan High Court is likely to pronounce its order on Tuesday on a writ petition filed by Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident Congress MLAs, challenging the disqualification notices issued to them by the state assembly speaker.The petition was taken up by a bench of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Prakash Gupta on Friday and arguments were heard on Monday till evening. The hearing resumed at 10.30 am on Tuesday. The Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting is also underway.The dissident MLAs had moved the court on Friday amid the infighting in the state unit of the Congress, as Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and his now sacked deputy Pilot tussled for power.Counsel for the speaker Abhishek Singhvi on Monday argued that the petition was premature as a decision was yet to be taken on disqualifying the MLAs from the House.There is no scope for interference by a court over the show-cause notices issued by the speaker, he had said.The speaker is supreme as far as the legislative assembly is concerned and the notices have been issued within the purview of the speaker's power, Singhvi had said.A lawyer appearing for the speaker had told reporters that the chief justice asked if the speaker is bound to issue a notice on a petition seeking disqualification of such a nature without recording any reason.Singhvi had argued that there was no requirement to record reasons as it was merely a show-cause notice.The notices to the MLAs were served after the party complained to the speaker that the lawmakers had defied a whip to attend two CLP meetings last week on Monday and Tuesday.The Pilot camp, however, argues that a party whip applies only when the assembly is in session.In its complaint to the speaker, the Congress had sought action against Pilot and the other dissidents under paragraph 2(1)(a) of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution.The provision disqualifies MLAs if they "voluntarily" give up the membership of the party that they represent in the House.Pilot was sacked as the Rajasthan deputy chief minister and the president of the state Congress unit after he rebelled against Gehlot.

Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel want 15 years to clear their AGR dues, while Tata Teleservices has sought up to 10 years to pay up.A Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra made it clear to the telecom companies that they needed to treat the AGR dues calculated by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) as final even as the Centre favoured a relaxed timeline to clear the dues.It asked the DoT to submit details of insolvency proceedings of Reliance Communications, Aircel and Videocon Telecom within a week as it wanted to see if the insolvency proceedings were bona fide.“Several telcos with AGR dues of over Rs 38,000 crore are under liquidation. Need to ensure that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is not being misused to escape liabilities,” the Bench said, while posting the matter for further hearing on August 10.On June 18, the SC had asked private telecom companies to furnish their books of accounts and balance sheets of the past 10 years to prove their financial ability to clear their AGR dues.PIL seeking preservation of artefacts dismissedMeanwhile, the Supreme Court has dismissed a PIL seeking directions to protect the artefacts recovered during the levelling work for a temple construction at Ram Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya.Terming the PIL as absolutely frivolous, a Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh each on the two petitioners and threatened to order a CBI probe into the plea. It asked the petitioners to deposit the fine within a month.“Stop filing such frivolous petitions... What do you mean by this? Are you saying that there is no rule of law and the judgement of this court (in Ayodhya case) will not be followed by anyone and no one will take action?” the court asked.It imposed the fine on the petitioners after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta urged the court for the same for filing a frivolous petition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-reserves-order-on-agr-payment-row-115757

Besides, dense and high elephant grass along the western borders makes it difficult to track the movement of people.” The GPR would be very effective as this handheld system weighed not more than 5 kg and would be able to detect all kinds of mines and IEDs in different soil conditions, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bsf-to-deploy-gpr-along-pak-border-115759

He dismissed Malinga’s accusations as “baseless and vexatious”, saying he was saddened but not surprised at the charges.Exuding confidence in his “majority government”, the CM said the state Assembly would function and truth would prevail.Ashok Gehlot, CM‘He sowed discord, backstabbed’We knew he is ‘nikamma’, ‘naakaara’ and did nothing except pit one person against the other. But we did not say a thing in the larger interest of the party…. But he stabbed the party in the back.Days after waiting for Pilot and 18 other dissident MLAs to return to the party fold, Gehlot today closed the options of reconciliation by calling the former Deputy CM “useless” and saying Congress leaders knew all along of the rebel’s “incompetence”.“We knew he is ‘nikamma’, ‘naakaara’ and did nothing except pit one person against the other. But we did not say a thing in the larger interest of the party. I taught Congress leaders here how to respect the state unit president notwithstanding his age. Rajasthan is the only state where no demand was ever made to change the state chief who held the post for seven years. But he stabbed the party in the back,” Gehlot said.

New Delhi wants Beijing to fully adhere to the agreement on creating a physical buffer zone and going back from certain gray areas, before any progress can be made.US Resolution urges China to de-escalateWashington: A bipartisan group of nine Congressmen has introduced a resolution in the US House of Representatives, urging Beijing that it should work towards de-escalating the situation at the border with India through diplomatic mechanisms and not by force. PTIA fresh physical verification of the buffer zone will be made as the previous one showed a partial pullback by China, unlike what was agreed upon at the meetings of the top military commanders. The two sides had to move back 1.5 km on each side of the approximate LAC, which has not happened.Sources say a meeting of the Lieutenant General-level commanders is possible only after some movement on the ground is visible.There are at least two points where the People's Liberation Army (PLA) has not created a buffer. At PP 17-A (Gogra), the gap between the two armies is not complete. It is narrower than the ideal 1.5 km on each side.At Finger 4 on the north bank of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial lake, not much has changed. The PLA is sitting on the ridgeline of a mountain spur.Eight spurs of the Chang Chenmo range end on the north bank of the lake. Each spur or ridgeline is identified as 'finger' in military parlance. India assumes the LAC to be at Finger 8, which is to the east of Finger 4. India was patrolling till Finger 8 but the Chinese are not allowing patrols to pass now. On July 10, the PLA had moved away its boats and thinned out troops, but its troops still occupy the ridgeline. India wants the PLA to move back till Finger 8.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/beijing-dithers-on-honouring-pullback-deal-talks-hit-bump-115740

It is your duty to do so.”The CJI also asked the Solicitor General to look into the statements made by the CM, Deputy CM, saying, “If they have made certain statements and then something has followed, you should look into it.” As a lawyer for one of the petitioners said the court should not allow UP Government to choose members for the commission, the CJI said, “Are you saying a former Supreme Court Judge and a former High Court Judge are state-sponsored?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/your-duty-to-uphold-rule-of-law-sc-to-up-on-dubey-encounter-115747
