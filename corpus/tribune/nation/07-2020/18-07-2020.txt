18-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: DMC fact-finding report names Kapil Mishra, calls out Delhi Police||A fact-finding report by the Delhi Minorities Commission has named senior Bharatiya Janata Party leaders and called out the Delhi Police for its “role” and “failure to protect life and property” during the riots in northeast Delhi earlier this year. The 130-page report released by the Chairman of Delhi Minorities Commission, Zafrul Islam Khan, and submitted to the Delhi Government is highly critical of the role of BJP leaders and the police in the riots.While the Delhi Police and the BJP have trashed the report, sources in the Delhi government said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal “may consider some of the recommendations of the committee”. According to the “Report of the Fact-Finding Committee on the North-East Delhi Riots of February 2020” by the nine-member committee chaired by Supreme Court advocate MR Shamshad and comprising Haseena Hashia, Tehmina Arora, Gurminder Singh Matharu, Saleem Baig, Aditi Dutta, Tanvir Kazi, Abu Bakr Sabbaq and Devika Prasad, “even after the violence there continued to be bias against the Muslims in registration of FIRs and investigation of cases”.Along with the allegations of “inaction” by the police during and after riots, the report also points fingers at senior BJP leaders like Amit Shah and Adityanath, for “inciting” people through speeches during the Assembly elections. “There were a number of speeches by Delhi BJP leaders inciting people to violence against anti-CAA protesters,” it said. But in the “Findings of the Report” section, under the subhead “Initiation of the Violence” it specifically names BJP leader Kapil Mishra.“Violence started in different pockets almost immediately after the short speech made by BJP leader Kapil Mishra on February 23  in which he called for forcefully removing anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters at Jafrabad in northeast Delhi,” it said“He (Mishra) clearly said he and his supporters will take matters in their own hand alluding to extralegal vigilante tactics,” the report said, also stating that “the Deputy Commissioner of Police North East district, Ved Prakash Surya, was standing next to Misra when he said after that we will not listen to the police.”According to the report, “multiple testimonies collected by the committee recount reports of police inaction even as violence unfolded, or of police not reaching despite repeated calls on emergency call number”.Testimonies of affected people revealed violence was not spontaneous like a “riot” and was “planned, organised and targeted”, it said“In several areas of North East Delhi, properties owned by Muslims were looted, burnt and completely destroyed. Armed mobs chanting slogans selectively attacked Muslim individuals, houses, shops, vehicles, mosques and other properties,” it said. Mobs were heard chanting religious and provocative slogans while attacking houses, shops and vehicle and properties of the minority community, it alleged. The report also noted that even after four months of the violence, verification process for compensation to victims has not been completed in many cases. It recommended that the government should form a five-member committee, headed by a retired High Court judge, to ensure proper registration of FIRs, recording of statements of victims, chargesheet review, and probe the role of the Delhi Police, among other things. It also recommended compensation to all victims and deputing trial court advocates to render legal to them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-dmc-fact-finding-report-names-kapil-mishra-calls-out-delhi-police-114753
18-07-2020||New Delhi||Covid-19: ICMR to conduct study on effectiveness of BCG vaccine among elders||The ICMR will conduct a multi-centric study to assess whether the BCG vaccine, used against tuberculosis, can prevent the occurrence of coronavirus infection and reduce the severity of the disease and mortality among elderly individuals residing in hotspot areas.The study will be carried out in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Delhi in approximately 1,500 healthy volunteers above 60-years of age, an ICMR scientist said.Sanction has already been accorded to the trial by the ICMR’s National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT) in Chennai by the Tamil Nadu government on July 15 to study the efficacy of BCG vaccine in the elderly. The BCG-COVID trial, under the auspices of ICMR would be held in five other centres—National Institute of Occupational Health, Ahmedabad, National Institute for Research in Environmental Health in Bhopal, GS Medical College and KEM Hospital in Mumbai, National Institute for Implementation Research on Non-Communicable Diseases in Jodhpur and AIIMS, New Delhi.“As a part of this multi-centric study which will be carried out at six sites, elderly people not affected by coronavirus infection, will be given the Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine. The same BCG vaccine that is administered to newborn babies as a part of National Immunisation programme for more than 50 years in the country will be used in this study,” the ICMR scientist said.“The objective is to see if the shots can prevent the occurrence of the coronavirus infection and reduce the severity of the disease and mortality rate among the elderly individuals residing in hotspot areas,” the scientist said.There are pre-set criteria in the study that will decide on eligibility of a volunteer to participate in this study.The volunteers would be followed up closely for a period of six months post vaccination.  Those vaccinated would be followed up and if some of them get infected with COVID-19 later on, it would be assessed if the BCG vaccination stood them in good stead when compared with others of the same age group who were not vaccinated. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-icmr-to-conduct-study-on-effectiveness-of-bcg-vaccine-among-elders-114751
18-07-2020||New Delhi||SC decides a law suit that started in 1955||The snail-paced Indian judicial system is known for taking decades to bring the curtains down on a dispute.On Friday, the Supreme Court decided a case that started in the year 1955 in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, over a will and went on for 65 years at various levels of the hierarchy of courts.A Bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul dismissed appeals challenging a 2007 judgment of the Madras High Court with regard to a family dispute that revolved around a will but actually related to a partition in the Naidu family in 1932.To understand the case, it’s important to know the family tree of the Naidus. One R Venkitusamy Naidu had two sons—Lakshmiah and Rangaswami. Rangaswami was married to R Krishnammal. The couple had no children. But Lakshmiah had four sons—Bakthavatsalam, Venkatapathy, Jagannathan and Ramaswamy.After Rangaswami’s death, a ‘possession’ dispute started in 1955. Rangaswami’s widow and nephew on one side and  Lakshmiah and his sons on the other started a legal fight.  The wife claimed Rangaswami died after executing a ‘will’. But a magistrate decided in favour of Lakshmiah, holding that they were in possession. The magistrate didn’t discuss the ‘will’.A suit was filed in 1958 by Rangaswami’s widow ended in a compromise decree. Two other family members filed a suit in 1963 that resulted in another compromise decree. After Ramaswamy and Krishnammal died in 1976 and 1977, respectively, a suit was again filed for partition by A. Alagiriswami and partition was ordered by the sub-judge in Coimbatore. In 1982, Lakshmiah Naidu’s sons, widow and Ramaswamy’s daughters filed a suit for declaration of title and injunction against A Alagiriswami after he sold the property on the basis of a will by Rangaswami. The suit was tried along with a suit for partition filed by Alagiriswami in 1983.The legal heirs of Lakshmiah questioned the will on the ground that it was obtained by coercion. Their suit was decreed but the first appellate court reversed these findings. Both the courts held there was no proof of the 1932 partition.In 2007, the Madras High Court allowed the second appeal and restored the decree of the trial court. It was this HC order which was under challenge before the top court which concluded that the ‘will’ was indeed executed by R Naidu as his last will.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-decides-a-law-suit-that-started-in-1955-114750

18-07-2020||New Delhi||Child patients in Delhi exhibit Kawasaki-like syndrome, COVID link suspected||Some Delhi hospitals are treating young patients, mostly children, who have been exhibiting symptoms of Kawasaki-like syndrome and there is presumably a link with COVID-19, doctors have said.Paediatric experts at a leading hospital here said in nearly 50 per cent of these cases, patients become “more serious” than those suffering from regular Kawasaki disease.Kawasaki disease is an illness with an unknown cause that leads blood vessels to become inflamed. It affects children, mostly aged below five.“In the past few months, particularly in the last six weeks, we have received patients who exhibited Kawasaki-like syndrome. There is a presumed link of this to past COVID cases, as either some of these patients were found to be COVID-positive or with antibodies in response to the disease,” said Dr Dhiren Gupta, Senior Consultant, paediatrics department at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) here.According to him, this is part of an emerging disease called ‘multi-system inflammatory syndrome’ or the MIS, which stared in the UK and cases were also reported by the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in the US.“In India, such trends were seen first in Mumbai and now in Delhi too. In half of the cases, it is more fulminant or serious than a regular case of Kawasaki,” Dr Gupta said.He said “there is a link” with COVID-19 and that in some cases the antibodies react and cause problems.The SGRH has seen six such cases with Kawasaki-like syndrome. While four such patients got discharged, a two-year-old is in the ICU at the moment and a four-year-old in the ward.At Kalawati Saran Children’s Hospital attached to the Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC), doctors said there were five to six cases in which children treated in COVID areas and COVID suspect areas had symptoms like those of the Kawasaki disease in which the blood vessels become inflammed throughout the body.“There could be other reasons behind the ailment, but as we are facing the COVID-19 pandemic, the disease most likely is related to the novel coronavirus infection,” said N N Mathur, Medical Director of the LHMC.Doctors said the symptoms of Kawasaki syndrome are fever for 3-5 days and redness of eyes and lips.In serious cases that have been presented at hospitals, the fever could last longer, blood pressure drops, and there is change in echocardiogram patterns, they said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/child-patients-in-delhi-exhibit-kawasaki-like-syndrome-covid-link-suspected-114733
18-07-2020||New Delhi||India to stockpile oil in US vaults||In a signal of trust in Washington, India has decided to store emergency stockpiles of crude petroleum in American salt caverns. As per available information, India will be the first country to be offered petroleum storage facilities in the US.Maintaining crude stockpiles is not a new concept, but storing another country’s emergency energy supplies denotes a great degree of confidence that the country maintaining the reserve will actually return it during an emergency.India has offered its storage facilities to the UAE and Saudi Arabia while Japan, New Zealand and South Korea have an agreement to draw upon each other’s reserves in case of need.India and the US have signed a MoU to develop a strategic petroleum reserve and the two countries are in an advanced stage of discussion to store crude oil in America to increase India’s stockpile, Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan said on Friday. The MoU was signed after Pradhan co-chaired a virtual US-India Strategic Energy Partnership Ministerial with US Energy Secretary Dan BrouilletteThe US began paying renewed attention towards building up more reserves after the pandemic struck. On March 19, US President Donald Trump ordered the buying up of oil from local producers and filling up the strategic reserves to maximum capacity.With oil demand at a historic low, the US has found it a good opportunity to ask other countries to buy oil from American companies and then store them in US vaults for which they will have to pay storage charges.While the US has the largest reserves in the world, enough to meet world demand for a day, China too has massive oil reserves.In case this move fructifies, India will be in the unique position of having strong energy ties with both Russia and the US.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-stockpile-oil-in-us-vaults-114723

It is the interest of our people that must remain paramount!” she added, recounting problems currently being faced by the people in the state, including Covid crisis, locusts’ outbreak, all-time high crime against women. #RajasthanFirst pic.twitter.com/tkOKWCi2Sz  This on a day when senior Rajasthan BJP leader and MLA Kailash Meghwal said the conspiracy to topple the democratically elected government in the state through horse-trading is wrong.  In an apparent comment on his own party, which is blaming Congress internal issues for the crisis, Meghwal opposed the “ongoing buying and selling” of MLAs to oust the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government.“BJP is a party with character and morality,” the senior leader, believed to be close to the Raje camp, was quoted as saying. “There is a conspiracy to topple the government through horse-trading, which I do not believe to be right,” he said.In an earlier letter, Meghwal who has held top positions said, “The kind of environment which has been in place for the last two months to bring down the government, horse-trading is happening, allegations are being made, it is very unfortunate.” Read also: BJP questions Congress on ‘illegal’ phone-tapping in Rajasthan, demands CBI probeEditorial: Rajasthan slugfestNOUS INDICA: The attack from within (by Rajesh Ramachandran)Pilot & Co get four-day breatherThe Congress infighting has brought to fore factionalism within the Rajasthan BJP. Just like the Congress, the BJP too is faction-ridden, having more than one aspirant for the Chief Minister’s post.Hanuman Beniwal, national convener of NDA ally Rashtriya Loktantrik Party, accused Raje of trying to influence Congress MLAs close to her to save the Gehlot government. Though he is no longer with the BJP, observers say Beniwal couldn’t have made such serious allegations without the backing of the BJP’s central leadership.  Apparently despite being asked to come over to Jaipur, Raje has decided to stay away so far.

The recovery rate is now 63 per cent.”Timely, proactive, and graded strategy initiatives for effective COVID-19 management in the country, led by the Centre and implemented by the states and the Union Territories, have ensured that the actual COVID-19 caseload remained manageable, it said, adding that expansion of hospital infrastructure continuously had aided in increased recoveries.Cumulatively, 1,34,33,742 swab samples had been tested till now, of which 3,61,024 were carried out on Friday raising the number of tests per million to 9734.6, the ministry said.The Centre continues to support and supplement the efforts of the state governments by sending teams of experts to areas witnessing an increase in caseload, it said.With a surge in daily fresh COVID-19 cases in Bihar, West Bengal, Assam and Odisha, the Union health ministry has asked these states to make renewed efforts to suppress the transmission as well as to keep case fatality rate below one per cent.With these states imposing lockdowns anew, the Health Ministry emphasised that the curbs should be utilised to focus on containment, surveillance and testing in the containment and buffer zones for early detection of cases and fatality management.A central team has been deployed in Bihar to assist the state in the assessment of COVID-19 management and to provide all necessary support.The team comprising Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal, Dr S K Singh, Director, National Centre for Disease Control and Dr Neeraj Nischal, Associate Professor of Medicine at AIIMS, New Delhi, will reach Bihar tomorrow.“The focus of the containment strategy remains on the house-to-house survey, perimeter control activities, timely contact tracing, surveillance of containment and buffer zones, aided by effective clinical management of severe cases through a standard of care approach,” the Ministry said.The latest testing strategy of the Indian Council of Medical Research allows all registered medical practitioners to recommend testing. RT-PCR tests and rapid-antigen point of care tests, boosted by TruNat and CBNAAT have contributed to a surge in the number of samples tested, it said.

This came in handy for me during the lockdown," Imran added."Some people working in emergency services had saved my mobile number, which was shared in a big way during the lockdown. They started calling me to fix the tyre punctures," he said.According to him, he provides the service in a limited area as the customers sometimes refuse to pay more than the regular charges."But I earned at least Rs 500 on a daily basis during the lockdown period. I have been running the puncture repair shop since the last 10 years, but I started the mobile puncture fixing service three years as an experiment that helped me now," he said.When asked if he was not afraid of working during the pandemic, he said, "I have to go out to earn money. I follow all safety measures." PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mobile-tyre-puncture-shop-helps-man-earn-money-during-lockdown-114709

According to some figures, scammers received hundreds of transfers with over USD 100,000 worth of cryptocurrency, in what is being described as an unprecedented security breach.Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey on July 16 had tweeted that everyone at Twitter feels ‘terrible’ about the incident. He had also sought to assure users that the company would share everything it can once it has complete understanding of exactly what happened.

The matter is being probed by the additional superintendent of police and action will be taken once the report comes," Amethi Superintendent of Police Khyati Garg said.No suicide note was recovered from Safia or her daughter Gudia, she said.Garg and Amethi District Magistrate Arun Kumar said Safia (55) had a dispute with her neighbour over a drain and the two had even exchanged blows in the past.Safia and her daughter set themselves on fire outside Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's office in the state capital Friday evening, police said.The police personnel posted there swung into action when they saw the women engulfed in flames and rescued them. The two were taken to the civil hospital for treatment, they said.A video of the incident has gone viral on social media.Dr. Ashutosh Dubey, medical superintendent of Shyama Prasad Mookerji Civil Hospital, Lucknow, told PTI, "The mother has suffered 90 per cent burns and is in a serious condition. Her daughter suffered 15 per cent burns and is stable. The mother has been put on life support." Lucknow Police Commissioner Sujeet Pandey said prima facie it appears that the incident was part of a conspiracy."It is a criminal conspiracy as part of which some people instigated them (Safia and her daughter). A case has been registered against four people -- Aasma, Sultan, Kadir Khan (Amethi district president of AIMIM) and Anoop Patel (former Congress spokesperson) -- in this regard," he said.The women were told to come to Lucknow and try to set themselves on fire so that their grievances can be highlighted and the dispute resolved, he said.Pandey said, "We have evidence to show that these women went to the UP Congress office and met Anoop Patel." A reporter in Lucknow was contacted and asked to highlight the issue. The reporter has also admitted to this, he said."Anoop Patel clearly instigated them to make an effort to set themselves afire so that their matter could be heard," he said.Hitting out at the UP government, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati said the mother and her daughter were "compelled to set themselves afire" as they did not get justice from the Amethi administration. Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav said the incident should "wake up" an "insensitive government"."UP government should take this incident seriously, and deliver justice to the aggrieved. Action should also be initiated against the officers who showed laxity in this regard, so that such incidents do not happen in future," Mayawati tweeted in Hindi."Is the attempt made by two women to set themselves afire not enough to wake up a sleeping government or is it that an insensitive government and chief minister are waiting for any other major incident? Is there something known as a government in Uttar Pradesh?" SP president Akhilesh Yadav said in a tweet in Hindi.

No suicide note was found from the spot by the police.The police are investigating allegations that professional rivalry, besides clinical depression, drove the actor to suicide.Police are also trying to understand the reason behind Rajput ending his contract with YRF, the official said.Earlier, the police had recorded the statement of YRF's casting director Shanoo Sharma.The police had recorded statements of 34 persons, including Rajput's family members and close friends like actors Rhea Chakraborty and Sanjana Sanghi, in connection with the case.Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Friday dismissed the need for a CBI probe into the death case of Rajput, saying the Mumbai police are capable of handling the matter.On Thursday, Rhea Chakraborty demanded a CBI inquiry to understand what "pressures" prompted Rajput to take the extreme step of suicide.Rajput starred in films such as 'Shuddh Desi Romance', 'Raabta', 'Kedarnath' and 'Sonchiriya'. But his most prominent role came as cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the biopic, 'MS Dhoni: The Untold Story'.

It aims to provide piped and safe drinking water to all rural households of the country by 2024. "The Mission is exploring partnerships with reputed national and international agencies, including UN agencies, NGOs/CBOs, CSR organisations, trusts, foundations, etc," the Union Jal Shakti Ministry said."The government hopes that water will turn into the next people’s movement and will become everyone’s business, a transformational change for the sector which has hitherto been seen as only a public sector responsibility."Ministry officials said UNICEF, the Aga Khan Foundation and Sir Ratan Tata Trust which are well-known names in the field of livelihood and development projects, are among those identified for the proposed partnership.Things should be firmed up in a couple of months in this regard. Talks with them are afoot.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's refrain from public fora has been to make JJM a people's movement and participatory, even though its implementation was done by the government.JJM was launched in August 15, 2019 and around 85 lakh rural households were provided with tap connections by March 2020. The pace of implementation was hindered during lockdown due to the Covid pandemic.Since unlockdown, about 46 lakh tap connections have been provided so far.With regards to JJM, states were asked to undertake a revalidation exercise of baseline data, as per which there are about 19 crore rural households in the country.Out of them, more than three crore households are already provided tap connections. In 2020-21, a cumulative sum of Rs 23,500 crore has been allocated to states and UTs for implementation of JJM.Besides, in the current financial year, 50 per cent of 15th Finance Commission grants to Rural Local Bodies, totalling up to Rs 30,375 crore, have also been earmarked for water supply and sanitation.As much as 50 per cent of this amount was released to states on July 15.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-to-rope%C2%A0in-national-and-international-agencies-to-make-jal-jeevan-mission-popular-and-people-driven-114699

Many states and cities have been placed under lockdown again. Even the WHO said tht large gatherings should not be held,” Sardesai said.Besides Maharashtra, seven other states have also cancelled the final year exams, he said.Referring to the University Grant Commission (UGC)’s circular asking states to conduct the final year exams, Sardesai said it was impossible to do so amid apprehensions about the spread of infection in state like Maharashtra which has 10 lakh students.Maharashtra has 2,92,589 coronvirus positive cases, including 99,164 in Mumbai, as on July 17.Sardesai said the Yuva Sena had received requests from many students across the country to take up the cause (to cancel the examinations).He claimed that the Yuva Sena had obtained more than two lakh signatures seeking cancellation of exams during an online campaign.“Yuva Sena under leadership of Aaditya Thackeray wrote letters to the UGC and Union HRD ministry to highlight the issue but has got no response,” he added.

It is like a murderer claiming that the witness who saw him committing the murder and who informed the police, violated the privacy of the murderer by peeping into his room, when he was committing the crime.The shamelessness of this admission is also very shocking. They are not worried about the fact that they got caught red handed, they are worried about the fact that why did they get caught, was exposing their crime, legal ?” said Khera.He also attacked the BJP of blocking an important probe into the allegations of BJP’s involvement in topping the congress government in Rajasthan.“When the Rajasthan SOG proceeded to Manesar last night to collect the voice samples of the Ministers and of the MLAs who were involved in these so called audio tapes for the first time in history, the police of another state actively blocked the SOG team from collecting the voice samples and quietly, surreptitiously ensured that all the MLAs escape from the back door of the hotel,” said Khera.He said the BJP openly misused its official machinery in CM Manohar Lal Khattar led Haryana to throttle an investigation, an on ongoing investigation.“What is the reason that Sachin Pilot trusts the Haryana Police more than the Rajasthan Police, we want to know,” said Khera.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-only-grievance-why-were-they-caught-murdering-democracy-cong-114693

She also questioned whether Sushant Singh Rajput's death was a "suicide or a planned murder".Now, the actress said that "if she could not prove the claims regarding Sushant's untimely death, she'll return the honour bestowed upon her by the Indian government". "They (Mumbai Police) summoned me, and I asked them too, that I'm in Manali, that you can send somebody to take my statement, but I have not received anything after that. I am telling you, if I have said anything, which I can't testify, which I can't prove, and which is not in public domain, I will return my Padma Shri," Kangana told Republic TV. "I don't deserve it. I am not that person who will go on record (to make such statements), and everything that I have said is in public domain," she added. Kangana continued, "Tomorrow, needy outsiders like Taapsee Pannu, Swara Bhasker will get up and say that they love this industry. I am only saying if you love this industry and if you love Karan Johar, then why are you not getting work like Alia or Ananya? Their whole existence is proof of nepotism.

The Trump administration said in June it wanted “to restore a level playing field for US airlines” under the US-India Air Transport Agreement. The Indian government had banned all scheduled services and failed to approve the US carriers for charter operations, it added.The US government said in June that Air India had been operating “repatriation” charter flights between India and the United States in both directions since May 7.

Phone-tapping is not just a sensitive but a serious legal issue that requires immediate answers,” he said.Asking if the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) was followed in the process, Patra said, “Assuming that you have tapped phones, our next question would be if the SOP was followed. This not only the BJP wants to know but the people of Rajasthan as it is an issue related to privacy,” he said.Patra also wanted to know whether Gehlot, after feeling cornered, used “unconstitutional ways to save his government” and whether in Rajasthan “tapping the phones of politicians was a normal routine”.“The phones of politicians, whichever party they may belong to, are being tapped in Rajasthan as this is what we gather. A lot of unconstitutional things are happening there,” he said.Quoting SOPs for tapping phones under legal procedure, Patra said tapping could be done only by authorised agencies.Patra also asked if in that case it was not a situation of emergency in Rajasthan. “The Congress has a history of phone-tapping,” he said, recounting the incident when phones of Rashtrapati Bhavan were found bugged during its government.  Regarding a question on “BJP leader” Sanjay Jain, who has been accused of engineering the fall of the Gehlot government, Patra said he did not have to answer to “concocted and manufactured lies”.Patra also slammed the Gehlot government on the Congress MLAs “flouting” Covid SOPs at a time when Rajasthan saw the highest single-day spike on Friday.“Reality is when in 2018 the Congress government was formed we saw two factions fighting on the streets, one belonging to Sachin Pilot and the other to Ashok Gehlot. The Chief Minister himself has admitted that he was not on talking terms with his deputy, and that there was a cold war between the two. Then they say all this is being controlled by the BJP. The sin is theirs and the entire conspiracy existed within the Congress and was executed by it,” Patra said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-questions-congress-on-illegal-phone-tapping-in-rajasthan-demands-cbi-probe-114650

18-07-2020||---||India now engages China on more equal terms: Jaishankar||New Delhi, July 17External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi today clashed on social media over the direction of India’s foreign policy. It all began earlier in the day when Rahul posted a three-minute video alleging that India was courting economic and financial disaster under the current government.Jaishankar’s riposte in a series of tweets was stylish and acidic where he blamed the previous government of messing up ties with many countries in the neighbourhood.“India has been disturbed and disrupted,” Rahul said, adding that “empty words don’t suffice in the world of geopolitics.” The Congress leader alleged that while India had a transactional relationship with major powers such as the US, Russia and the European Union, it no longer shared a warm relationship with most of its neighbours.Jaishankar asserted that all of India’s major partnerships were stronger and India’s international standing higher than before. “Witness the regular summits and informal meetings with the US, Russia, Europe and Japan. India engages China on more equal terms politically,” he claimed while ending his tweet with “Ask the analysts”. This last flourish was a constant factor in the subsequent tweets where he asked Rahul to “ask the Afghan street”, “ask Bhutan households”?“We speak our mind more openly now on issues such as China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, Belt and Road Initiative and South China Sea,” said Jaishankar. Dealing with the neighbourhood, he said Rahul’s criticism of India missing out on Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka (which went to China) was misplaced as the deal was concluded in 2008 (during the UPA era). The Foreign Minister then blamed the previous government for the dip in ties with Maldives and Bhutan.He added that Afghanistan had seen several completed India-built projects.On Pakistan, the minister invited Rahul to note the difference between Balakot and Uri on the one hand and Sharm-el-Sheikh and Mumbai attacks on the other.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-now-engages-china-on-more-equal-terms-jaishankar-114383

To enhance its relevance, let us not lose this chance. Narendra Modi, Prime MinisterThe session was attended by the Norway PM and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

18-07-2020||Aditi Tandon||Pilot & Co get four-day breather||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 17Rebel Congress MLAs led by Sachin Pilot cannot be disqualified from the Rajasthan Assembly till 5.30 pm on Tuesday. The state High Court will resume hearing on Monday after rival lawyers – Harish Salve for the Pilot camp and Abhishek Singhvi for the Congress – today slogged it out in the court. The counsel for the Speaker assured the court that no order shall be passed on the notice till 5.30 pm on Tuesday.Salve questioned the constitutional validity of the disqualification notices Speaker CP Joshi issued to 19 rebel MLAs under the anti-defection law while Singhvi termed the case premature. The dissidents are saying that dissent against the CM is part of free speech and does not constitute defection, and also that the whip is valid only for proceedings in the Assembly, not at some hotel. The adjournment gives dissidents time to strategise even as the Rajasthan police today registered two cases on a Congress complaint accusing two of its MLAs and Union Minister Gajendra Shekhawat of horse-trading and a conspiracy to dislodge the Ashok Gehlot-led state government.Congress leader Randeep Surjewala cited audio-taped conversations today to allege “horse-trading” by party MLAs Bhanwarlal Sharma and Vishvendra Singh and Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, who dismissed the charges. The Congress also suspended Sharma and Singh from its primary membership.As the bitter factional war in the Rajasthan Congress played itself out on streets, strategists agreed that the legal outcome would determine the future course. All eyes are now on the court. If Pilot can ward off the disqualification threat, the Gehlot government would remain on tenterhooks faced with prospects of a trust vote. Gehlot claims he has the support of 102 MLAs in a House where 101 is the majority mark. The Congress said its doors for Pilot were still open.Tapegate: Not my voice: ShekhawatUnion Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat has rejected the Congress’ allegation based on some audio clips that he was part of a conspiracy to topple the Gehlot government. “This is not my voice.... Let there be an investigation,” the senior BJP leader told the media after the Congress demanded his arrest. PTIDrama in ManesarGurugram: The Special Operations Group (SOG) of the Rajasthan Police was stopped by Haryana cops from entering ITC Grand Bharat near Manesar. The confrontation lasted 90 minutes after which the SOG was allowed inside. The SOG team was looking for suspended MLAs Bhanwar Lal Sharma and Vishvendra Singh to interrogate them regarding an ‘unverified’ leaked audio tape in which they are heard “talking of money” to topple the Gehlot government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pilot-co-get-four-day-breather-114389
