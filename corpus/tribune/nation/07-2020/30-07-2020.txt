30-07-2020||New Delhi||Policymakers deliberating to identify groups of people to first receive COVID-19 vaccine: Officials||Policymakers are actively holding deliberations to identify groups of people who will first receive the COVID-19 vaccine when it is developed, officials said.Speaking at an international symposium on Novel Ideas in Science and Ethics of Vaccines against COVID-19 pandemic, Officer on Special Duty (OSD) in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Rajesh Bhushan said prioritising who should get the vaccine first is a topic being discussed both within and outside the government.“There is an emerging consensus that frontline workers are the people who have the best claim over who should get the vaccine first. But while that question engages us and there is no finality on the question, the issue of who will be on the priority list and who comes after frontline healthcare workers and that is if they come first then who are the people that would follow them,” he said.He said deliberations are on whether it will be the elderly or it will be people with co-morbidities or whether it will be people placed in socio-economic disadvantage whose immunity has been weakened because of prolonged exposure to poverty and malnutrition.“So, these are the questions presently engaging the policymakers within the Government of India,” he said.NITI Aayog member VK Paul, who is also part of the COVID-19 national taskforce, said policymakers were actively deliberating to prioritise the groups of people who will first receive the COVID-19 vaccine once it is developed.“India’s journey for a safe, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccine shall be driven by the best scientific and ethical principles and for that our regulatory and scientific mechanisms are already in place,” he said at the symposium.He said India’s journey to scale up and access to vaccines by all would be in full compliance with the high principles of equity and human rights.“We cannot accept a situation where the rich have the vaccine and not the poor. This is simply unacceptable. We will ensure that pathways are created. We are also working actively to prioritise the groups that should receive the vaccine before the other group and those decisions are in the active stage of being deliberated upon,” he added.Paul said India visualised its capabilities against COVID-19, including the vaccines, not just for the country and its citizens but for the world and humanity.“The Indian government values and welcomes international partnerships, technical exchange, knowledge sharing and collective discourse in this journey,” Paul said.Indian Medical Research Institute (ICMR) Director-General Balram Bhargava said once a safe and effective vaccine was developed there will be four major challenges.“One is prioritisation and fair distribution to vulnerable groups, second is logistics of vaccine rollout, including cold chain, and third is stockpiling and fourth is training people who will administer this vaccine,” he said.“In the context of these four points, India will have to play a significant role and I can assure you that it is a part India will play with great care and responsibility. It will require immense collaboration across borders keeping in mind the noblest principles of science and humanity,” he added.Underlining that the need for a vaccine is both great and urgent, Bhargava said a dilemma was that the pandemic was going at a devastating pace and to develop a vaccine one needed time and it was not only for the science part of it but ethics and the regulatory and social considerations that needed to be kept in mind.“We need to crystallise a mix and match of these ideas which may run in parallel with the right balance of the speed and safety. A balance between speed and safety has to be maintained once we crystallise novel ideas,” he said.

30-07-2020||New Delhi||Will facilitate request for ‘permanent settlement’ by Sikhs, Hindus who arrived from Afghanistan as per rules: MEA||The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Thursday said the request of members of Sikh and Hindu communities, who arrived here from Afghanistan earlier this week, for permanent settlement in India would be examined and facilitated as per existing rules and policies.MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava also said that apart from those who returned, the ministry was in touch with others who would like to return from Afghanistan and would facilitate their return.Eleven members of minority communities of Afghanistan, including a Sikh community leader who was kidnapped and later released, arrived here on Sunday after India granted them visas and facilitated their travel.Nidan Singh Sachdeva, who was released from captivity on July 18, was among those who reached Delhi on Sunday.Sachdeva, a Sikh community leader of Afghanistan, was kidnapped in Paktia province last month.Asked if those minorities who arrived from Afghanistan will be granted citizenship, Srivastava said, “I had said last week how there has been a recent spurt of attacks on minorities in Afghanistan, belonging to the Hindu and Sikh communities. I had also described how it has been done by terrorists at the behest of their external supporters.”            “Our mission in Kabul, despite the COVID situation, facilitated the visas for the return of the first group which arrived here,” Srivastava said.Their cause for permanent settlement will be examined and facilitated as per existing rules and policies, he said.Asked about the India-Nepal border issue, he said he has made India’s position clear and there was nothing to add.Srivastava also said there was no update on the Kerala gold smuggling case.Asked about Kuwait’s travel ban which includes people coming from India, he said the ban is not specific to Indian nationals and was there as part of restrictions on travel due to the COVID-19 situation.The civil aviation authorities are holding discussions to work out related arrangements at this point in time, Srivastava said.

But the Delhi government Wednesday delinked these hotels from hospitals with the situation showing signs of improvement.   On Monday, the government had allowed street hawkers to function in Delhi on a trial basis for a week from 10 am to 8 pm.“It was decided today that the street hawkers will be permitted to function in the future without any limitations on operating hours,” it stated.According to the nationwide Unlock -3 guidelines issued by the Centre, political and religious gatherings will remain prohibited.“The Delhi government has also allowed weekly Bazaars to function on a trial basis for a week with social distancing and all necessary precautionary measures,” it said.For the first time since the coronavirus lockdown came into force on March 25, the Centre has allowed opening of yoga institutes and gymnasiums from August 5 for which a separate Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) will be issued by the Health Ministry. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unlock-3-delhi-govt-allows-more-economic-activities-weekly-markets-on-trial-basis-120006

Another person missing from the political action in Rajasthan is former union minister and Jaipur Rural MP Rajyavardhan Rathore, once a blue-eyed boy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Meanwhile, those in the race, whether or not they have an Assembly seat, include Rajsamand MP Diya Kumari and union minister Arjun Meghwal. Meghwal’s promotion of ‘Bhabiji papad’, claiming that it was made from ingredients that helped to build antibodies against COVID-19, evoked much criticism and interest. There are many dark horses, such as Rajpal Singh Shekhawat and Satish Poonia, with their large network of party cadres and also believed to be close to “Nagpur”. There is also an angle concerning Hanuman Beniwal, national convener of NDA ally Rashtriya Loktantrik Party, who has been accusing Raje of trying to influence Congress MLAs close to her to save the Gehlot government.Sources say just like the Congress, the BJP too is faction-ridden with more than one aspirant for the Chief Minister’s post. Raje held her ground in 2018 against someone as powerful as Amit Shah, the then BJP president, over the selection of the state unit chief. While Shah wanted to appoint Shekhawat, he had to settle for Madan Lal Saini after stalemate lasting weeks.Can she still hope to find favour with the central leadership? This remains to be seen.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-rajasthan-plans-amid-the-long-gap-before-the-short-assembly-session-its-problem-of-plenty-and-sanghs-vichar-120005

In the present case, the UGC is concerned with final year/terminal semester examinations which will have a lasting and indelible effect on the academic credibility, career opportunities and future progress of the students.”The petitioners have highlighted the fact that the IITs and the governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Pondicherry have already cancelled final year examinations.But the UGC took exception to decisions taken by the governments of Maharashtra and Delhi not to conduct the final-year examinations due to COVID-19.The UGC said “sufficient time” had been given to conduct the examinations, with universities being given sufficient flexibility to conduct examinations via online, offline or hybrid modes.In case students were unable to appear for examinations, they would be given a chance to appear at a specially conducted examination at a later date so that they were not put to any inconvenience or disadvantage, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ugc-refuses-to-relent-on-sept-30-deadline-for-final-year-exams-119999

As a result, India agreed to withdraw its troops and dismantle the infrastructure after a meeting between Corp Commanders on June 6.According to the envoy, the Indian side committed not to go across the water mouth of Galwan Valley to patrol or raise new infrastructure. On the evening of June 15, the Indian troops broke the consensus and went across the LAC and violently attacked the Chinese soldiers leading to a physical clash.“This is a situation that no one wants to see,” he said.Implicitly acknowledging that China had suffered casualties, the envoy said any announcement of the number of deaths suffered by the PLA troops would not be “helpful to ease the situation”.Unlike the MEA spokesperson who said the process of disengagement was not complete, the Chinese envoy avoided the specifics.“What we are now doing is making joint efforts to deescalate the situation and ease the tension around border areas,” Sun said while seeking more communication and contacts between the two sides.The envoy disclosed that China had stopped exchanging maps of two of the three sectors of the LAC for over 15 years because it found that India was making exaggerated claims.“The purpose of clarification is to maintain peace and tranquillity. When we look back, we will find that if one side has unilaterally put its own perception of LAC during the negotiations that will create new disputes. That is why this process cannot move on,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/progress-made-but-disengagement-at-lac-not-complete-india-119990

He also issued a stern warning to hospitals where patients were complaining of excessive medical billing and exploitation. The strong reaction came after Anreddy Radhesh, hailing from Maheswaram mandal, Dubbacherla village took to Twitter and pointed out how due to lack of proper medical treatment and excessive billing by the private hospital he lost his father, mother and brother, all of whom were admitted to a private hospital in Hyderabad. He himself tested positive but was asymptomatic and was in home quarantine. Radhesh alleged that his family had already paid Rs 40 lakh for the three Covid-19 patients but the hospital was insisting to clear the remaining pending medical bills so that his father’s body could be released. KTR is also is Minister for Industry, Information Technology, Municipal Administration and Urban Development and very active on Twitter responded by saying, “Deeply anguished on hearing about the tragic loss of your family members. Exploitation in these times by private hospitals is deplorable and a shame. Request Health Minister Eatala Rajender to take strictest action against these irresponsible institutions (asap).”Twitterati responded by saying the state government has failed to check the exploitation by private hospitals in the times of pandemic. They wanted the government to take some concrete action, instead of making mere statements.  Another incident has come to light where a police constable said he lost his wife after five private hospitals refused to admit her and even the state-run Gandhi Hospital denied her admission. Constable Lateef, under Rachakonda police commissionerate, narrated his experience at a meeting organised to welcome 45 policemen who returned to duty after recovering from Covid.  “I was helpless when my wife was struggling for oxygen and breathed his last in front of my eyes,” the policeman said. Several instances have been reported where of people have died in the process of being shifted from one hospital to another. Some patients have also died on the road due to any help for taking them to the hospital. The Telangana High Court has issued notices to the Central and state government and others for allowing private hospital exploitation going unchecked. The court issued the notice in response to a petition claiming that the government failed to act against private hospitals charging exorbitantly from COVID-19 patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-to-act-against-negligent-hospitals-and-those-fleecing-patients-119989

Australia has announced a record boost to cyber security spending- more than Rs. 7,000 crore (AUD 1.35 billion) recruit 500 new experts,” it said.Suggesting counter measures to remain safe from this malware, the CERT-In said, “Do not download and install applications from untrusted sources and use only reputed application markets only. Always review the app details, number of downloads, user reviews and check ‘additional information section before downloading an app from play store, use device encryption or encrypt external SD card and avoid using unsecured, unknown Wi-Fi networks.”Also, when it comes to downloading banking apps one should use the official and verified version and users should make sure they have a strong AI-powered mobile antivirus installed to detect and block this kind of tricky malware, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/android-malware-blackrock-in-cyber-space-with-ability-to-steal-banking-data-cert-in-119986

This means that the rate has increased. Everyone knows who is doing the horse-trading,” he told reporters outside the Fairmont hotel where the MLA in his camp is holed up.Gehlot is trying to save his government after Sachin Pilot and 18 other Congress MLAs rebelled. The Congress has accused the BJP of being behind this “conspiracy” to topple the state government.The Chief Minister said the rebels should return to the party fold.“They won elections on Congress tickets and their first duty is to stand with the government. They don’t realise what the people are thinking about them in their constituencies, and they will come to know that later,” he said.“Why are they playing in the lap of BJP,” he asked.He said BSP chief Mayawati’s complaint about last year’s merger of six BSP MLAs with that of his party was unjustified since the entire group in the assembly switched sides.“It was not about two MLAs. All six MLAs merged, and according to their own conscience,” Gehlot said.He alleged that she was giving statements at the behest of the BJP because she was afraid of the party that is misusing the CBI, the Enforcement Directorate and the Income Tax Department against everyone.The Rajasthan High Court on Thursday issued notices to the assembly Speaker, secretary and the six MLAs over the BSP’s petition.Gehlot said the dissident Congress MLAs were at Manesar in Gurgaon and the Special Operations Group (SOG) team of the Rajasthan police is unable to reach them.“The entire country is watching this. This is the game of the BJP and people will not forgive the party,” he said.He claimed that Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat’s name had cropped up in the “conspiracy” against his government.Gehlot said the SOG had started an investigation against him in a cooperative credit society scam but the minister was yet to resign.He said that the BJP party and Union Home Minister Amit Shah should give up their “intention” of toppling the elected government and instead work on saving lives from coronavirus.“The state and the Centre should together work on this but, unfortunately, their priority is to topple governments,” he alleged.

30-07-2020||New Delhi||Herd immunity can’t be strategic choice or option in India: Health ministry||Given the size of India’s population, herd immunity “cannot be a strategic choice or option”, the health ministry said on Thursday as it urged people to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour till a vaccine is developed.At a press briefing, when asked whether India was approaching herd immunity against the coronavirus infection, Officer on Special Duty in the Health Ministry Rajesh Bhushan replied that herd immunity is a kind of indirect protection from an infectious disease like COVID-19.It happens only when a population becomes immune either through vaccination or immunity is developed through a previous infection, he said.“In a country with the size of the population like India, herd immunity cannot be a strategic choice or option. It can only be an outcome, and that too at a very high cost as it means lakhs of people will have to be infected, get hospitalised and many will die in the process,” Bhushan said.He said herd immunity can be achieved through immunisation but that is in the future.“Are we approaching herd immunity? The health ministry believes it is still far away and in the future. For now, we have to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour like wearing masks, avoiding gatherings, following hand hygiene and maintaining ‘do gaz ki doori (maintaining distance of two yards),” the OSD said.“Till a vaccine comes up, following COVID-appropriate behaviour is the social vaccine against the disease.” The officer also said phase 1 and 2 human clinical trials of two indigenously developed COVID-19 vaccine candidates have started.Bhushan also said the government has so far received 131 claims under the Rs 50 lakh COVID-19 insurance scheme for healthcare providers and payments have already been made in 20 cases.“Under the scheme, we have received 131 claims. The claims are a bit slow in coming as the families are initially in a state of shock and therefore it takes time to sign and fill up the necessary paperwork.“Out of these 131 claims, in 20 cases payments have already been made. In Sixty-four cases payment has been processed and would be made in the coming few days while 47 cases are with different state governments,” he said.The maximum number of cases are in Maharashtra, Delhi and Telangana, Bhushan said.Due to enhanced testing infrastructure, on an average 4,68,263 COVID-19 tests have been conducted daily from July 26 to 30. The recovery rate among COVID-19 patients too has increased from 7.85 per cent in April to 64.44 per cent on Thursday, the officer said.“Recoveries are now 1.9 times the number of active coronavirus cases.Bhushan further said that 21 states and Union Territories have case positivity rate less than 10 per cent, while in four it is less than five per cent. The COVID-19 positivity rate in Rajasthan is 3.5 per cent, Punjab 3.9 per cent, Madhya Pradesh 4 per cent, and Jammu and Kashmir 4.7 per cent, he said.The OSD also stressed that effective clinical management has led to a decline in COVID-19 case fatality rate from 3.33 per cent on June 18 to 2.21 per cent on July 30. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/herd-immunity-cant-be-strategic-choice-or-option-in-india-health-ministry-119982
30-07-2020||New Delhi||BCI to postpone All-India Bar Examination due to coronavirus||The Bar Council of India has resolved to postpone the All-India Bar Examination (AIBE) scheduled for August 16 due to the rising numbers of COVID-19 patients across the country and frequent lockdowns to contain its spread.The BCI, which is the regulator of legal education in the country, has also resolved to extend the date for receipt of applications from candidates till August 31.Besides, the apex bar body has been authorised by the bar leaders across the country to represent lawyers before the Supreme Court in a writ petition against the Union of India seeking financial assistance and a soft loan of Rs 3 lakh each to needy lawyers.The AIBE is a national-level exam meant to test a potential advocate who aspires to practice law. The decision was taken in a resolution adopted on July 29.“Keeping in view the present pandemic (COVID-19) situation and frequent lockdown, an increasing number of corona patients daily, the council has resolved to postpone the All-India Bar Examination to be held on August 16 and it has further resolved to extend the date of receipt of applications from candidates till August 31 (for the present),” the resolution said.In a virtual meeting between the BCI and all state bar councils’ representatives and High Court Bar Associations, it was decided that the apex bar body will represent the lawyers before the Supreme Court in a writ petition in against the Union of India seeking financial assistance and a soft loan of Rs 3 lakh each to needy lawyers.The BCI has said a huge majority of lawyers were forced to live in a miserable condition due to continuing suspension of physical court functioning, leading to loss of earning and draining out their financial resources.A bench headed by the Chief Justice SA Bobde on July 22 issued notice to the Centre on the petition, the council said.“It was unanimously resolved separately in both joint meetings of the Bar Council of India with all State Bar Councils and with High Court Bar Associations respectively, that since the aim and object of the BCI and the State Bar Councils and the High Court Bar Associations are/is one and the same, i.e. to procure financial assistance and help the needy advocates, all State Bar Councils and the participating High Court Bar Associations would authorise BCI to represent themselves before the apex court,” BCI’s chairperson Manan Kumar Mishra said.

He was speaking at a webinar organised by the Institute of Chinese Studies headed by former Indian envoy to China Ashok Kantha.Sun disagreed with the opinion of former Indian envoys to Beijing that India-China ties were at a turning point after the Galwan Valley clash.  “At this critical moment, we should handle relations cautiously and resolutely avoid the whirlpool of suspicion and confrontation. Our relations today are hard-earned and should be cherished all the more,” he observed while asking them not to jump to conclusions on the basis of “temporary differences and difficulties”.Besides reiterating the views already made by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Sun cautioned against India’s imposition of punitive measures on Chinese trade and investment. “Our economies are highly complementary, interwoven and interdependent. Forced decoupling is against the trend and will only lead to a ‘lose-lose’ outcome,” he said.India has already banned 59 Chinese apps, restricted investments from China and has already narrowed the scope of Chinese products in Government tenders.  The Chinese envoy pointed out that trade cooperation in mobiles, infrastructure, automobile manufacturing and medicine has created a large number of local jobs and made available cost effective products for Indian consumers.“It is a reflection of globalisation. Whether you want it or not, the trend is difficult to reverse. Both are deeply embedded in the global industrial supply chain. The development of economic and trade cooperation is determined by international division of labour,” said Sun.In an attempt to shift the goal posts, the envoy said the “invisible virus” rather than China is the threat for Indians and offered assistance now and in the future when the vaccine is developed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ties-with-india-fragile-need-to-avoid-confrontation-chinese-envoy-119977
30-07-2020||New Delhi||Committed to protect Kulbhushan Jadhav’s life: India||India on Thursday said it was committed to protecting the life of Indian death row convict Kulbhushan Jadhav amid reports that the Islamabad High Court has constituted a two-member bench to hear a review petition in his case.“We stand committed to protect the life of Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav,” External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at an online media briefing.He was replying to a batch of questions relating to the case including reports that Islamabad High Court has constituted a bench to hear a review petition filed by the Pakistan government in the case.“We reserve our position in the matter which includes the right to avail of further remedies,” Srivastava added.India has been attacking Pakistan for failing to provide it unhindered and unimpeded consular access to Jadhav as mandated in a judgment by the International Court of Justice.Srivastava said Pakistan had blocked all avenues for an effective remedy available for India in the case.In a unilateral move, Pakistan filed the petition in the Islamabad High Court on July 22 seeking appointment of a “legal representative” for Jadhav.However, the main parties, including the Government of India, were not consulted ahead of the filing of the application by the Ministry of Law and Justice under an ordinance which was enacted on May 20.Jadhav, a 50-year-old retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. India approached the International Court of Justice against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.Pakistan enacted an ordinance called the ‘International Court of Justice Review and Reconsideration Ordinance 2020’ on May 20 under which a petition for the review of a military court's decision can be made to Islamabad High Court through an application within 60 days of its promulgation.The Pakistan government has claimed that Jadhav refused to file a review petition or an application to reconsider the verdict.According to Pakistani media reports, Islamabad High Court on Thursday constituted a two-member bench to hear the review petition filed by the Pakistan government in Jadhav’s case.

When will the Prime Minister acknowledge his failure and the failure of his economic managers,” Chidambaram asked on Twitter.“Will the government realize that one of our major telecom companies is on the verge of collapse and the government has no plan to save the struggling telecom industry,” he asked in a tweet in Hindi.The former finance minister also asked if the government realises that the aviation industry has suffered massive losses and claimed that “each one of them will go the Air India way” unless the government steps in with a rescue plan.“Millions have lost their jobs or livelihood in the last 12 months. The collapse of two major industries — telecom and aviation — will cost many more thousand direct and indirect jobs,” he said.Chidambaram has been critical of the government’s handling of the economy, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We were also constrained for money as they had to pay rent, EMIs, electricity bills etc," said Sharma, who is also a National Vice President Powerlifting Federation of Indus (PFI, INDIA).Amid the rising cases of Covid-19, he also added that, from August 5, his team will operate the gyms under standard operating procedure (SOP) given by the government. "Gym owners' association in Delhi had submitted an SOP to the Home Ministry. Under the SOP, an overall refurbishment of gym operations has been suggested," he said.According to the experts, after the reopening of gyms - the fitness centres will follow new and strict rules such as members will have to book slots to avoid overcrowding, depending on the area of the gym—only a limited number of members to be allowed. Speaking on the preparations to stop the Covid-19 spread, Sharma said: "Not more than 15 people allowed at a time even in bigger gyms, thermal screening at the entry point, mandatory use of masks, social distancing to be maintained during floor."He also said that showers won't be operational, members will have to bring their water bottles and their will a proper sanitisation at an interval of 40 to 45 minutes.Sunil Lochab, Vice President, Delhi Gym Association and Founder of Tone Zone Gym, told IANS: "More than 5000 gym owners trainers helpers were out of a job due to shut down."

30-07-2020||New Delhi||Ex-Samata Party president Jaya Jaitly, two others get 4-year jail term for corruption in defence deal||The Delhi High Court on Thursday awarded 4-year jail term to ex-Samata Party president Jaya Jaitly and two others for corruption in a 2000-01 case related to a purported defence deal saying they “compromised the entire defence system of the country”.Special CBI judge Virender Bhat also awarded four-year jail term to Jaitly’s former party colleague Gopal Pacherwal and Major General (Rtd) SP Murgai in the case, Murgai’s advocate Vikram Panwar said.“There should be zero tolerance towards corruption in defence procurement deals as these have direct bearing upon an independence and sovereignty of our country,” the court said, adding that the crime committed by the convicts was of “highest degree”.The court, in an in a camera proceeding, imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh each on all three convicts and directed them to surrender before it till 5 pm on Thursday itself.The order was stayed by the Delhi High Court later in the day.The three accused were held guilty of corruption and criminal conspiracy in the purported purchase of hand-held thermal imagers. The case stemmed from ‘Operation Westend’ sting aired by news portal Tehelka in January 2001.The trial court said the convicts were no laymen but persons of status and means, and had not committed the crime due to any ignorance or lack of knowledge or under any duress.“On the contrary, the crime was committed by them in pursuance to a well hatched conspiracy and upon due deliberations with each other,” the court said, terming the crime as “a very serious” and “having grave ramifications so far as the defence of our country is concerned.”The convicts took money from the representative of a fictitious firm without bothering to ascertain whether the firm was actually in operation and whether the product of the said firm sought to be inducted in the Indian Army was worth it, the court observed.It noted that they chose to remain blindfolded on all vital aspects of the concerned product of the fictitious firm only with a view to get some monetary enrichment.“By their act, they compromised the entire defence system of the country. It is a crime with very wide and huge repercussion for the entire nation and thus cannot be dealt with leniently. For their petty gains, the convicts sought to assist the induction of a product of an unknown fictitious company into the Indian Army, which if done, would have made the Army immensely vulnerable and handicapped in the wake of an enemy attack. The very existence of our country would have come under threat,” the court said, adding that it was no less than an attack on the independence of our country.The convicts did not deserve any mercy, “they deserve harshest sentence”, the court said, adding that any kind of mercy would be mockery of justice and sure to excite the fury of the society at large.“The virus of corruption which has engulfed the entire fabric of our society, is becoming a major obstacle in the growth and development of our nation. In a democratic system, when the public offices and public institutions are misused for private advantage, they lose their legitimacy,” it said.The court said the corruption not only corroded the social fabric of the society but also depleted the national wealth and undermined people’s trust in the political system, in its institutions and in the public servants.The court held that all three accused, along with Surender Kumar Surekha (who later turned approver), were party to the criminal conspiracy that took place around December 2000 and January 2001 at Delhi.The court observed that while Jaitly accepted illegal gratification of Rs 2 lakh from Mathew Samuel, a representative of fictional company Westend International, Murgai received Rs 20,000.All three accused — Jaitly, Pacherwal and Murgai — were convicted of the offence of conspiracy (Section 120-B IPC read with Section 9 (Taking gratification, for exercise of personal influence with public servant) of the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act.The court held that it was “proved beyond doubt that in the meeting in the hotel room on December 25, 2000, Surekha and Murgai assured their assistance to Samuel in procuring letter of evaluation for the product of his company from the Ministry of Defence and also to arrange a meeting between him and accused Jaya Jaitly who would provide political cover to them in this regard”.Accordingly, Pacherwal arranged the said meeting for December 28, 2000. He, too, was present in the said meeting in the room of Jaitly along with Surekha, Samuel and Murgai, the court observed.The court said: “In that meeting, which took place in the official residence of the then Union Minister for Defence, George Fernandes, Samuel was introduced to Jaitly as a businessman whose company intends to enter the market of defence procurement. Samuel offered the sum of Rs 2 lakh to Jaitly, who instructed him to handover the money to Pacherwal and accordingly, the money was received by accused Pacherwal knowing that it was bribe money.”“In lieu thereof, Jaitly assured Samuel that in case the product of his company is not considered, she would intervene by making a request to “'Sahib'” (purportedly the Defence Minister George Fernandes) to send a word to the concerned officer in this regard,” the court added.

In the video, a woman is seen carrying her husband on her shoulders and walking around the village. The woman's husband had accused his wife of having an extra-marital affair with another man. A panchayat was called and it was decided that the woman will have to carry her husband on her shoulders and move around the village.  A case has been registered against seven persons on the complaint of the woman. The police said an investigation is underway and appropriate action will be taken once it concludes. No arrests have been made in the case so far. This is the second such incident in Jhabua in the past one month.

30-07-2020||Vijay Mohan||Disabled civilians with less than 10-yr service to be paid service element of pension||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 30In a major relief to civilian disability pensioners, the government has clarified that pre-2006 disabled personnel shall also be entitled to receive the “service element” of disability pension irrespective of the length of service.This would significantly enhance their pension and they would also be paid arrears for the past about 14 years.This will benefit thousands of disability pensioners of the various Central Armed Police Forces as well as organisations such as Coast Guard, General Reserve Engineering Force and Railways.Disability pension consists of two parts -- the service experience, which pertains to the length of service rendered and the disability element, which is associated with the quantum of disability. Prior to 2006, the disability pensioners receiving pension under the Central Civil Services Extraordinary Pension Rules required 10 years of qualifying service to earn the service element.In 2010, on the lines of the defence services, the minimum qualifying service for service element of disability pension was abrogated with retrospective effect from 2006. However, the disabled retirees who were released from service prior to 2006 were not paid the service element due to a grey area in the policy.In 2019, a disabled retiree from the Coast Guard, Rajesh Dahiya, approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court against denial of service element to him and he sought directions to the Department of Pension and Pensioners’ Welfare (DoPPW) from the Court for a decision on his detailed representations to the department to clarify the issue on release of service element to pre-2006 cases. The bench of Justice Harsimran Singh Sethi had then directed DoPPW to take a final decision in the matter within a period of three months. The department had later informed the petitioner that it was looking into the matter and needed some more time.The DoPPW has now issued orders to all ministries and has directed the release of service element to pre-2006 disability pensioners with less than 10 years of service with financial effect and arrears from January 1, 2006. Experts say that this would come as a boon to many CAPF personnel who were paid a meagre disability element which was not sufficient to cater to even basic needs.An officer well versed with the subject added that the minimum monthly disability pension at current rates admissible to affected retirees would now be Rs 18,000 per month.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/disabled-civilians-with-less-than-10-yr-service-to-be-paid-service-element-of-pension-119961
30-07-2020||New Delhi||Herd immunity in India may be generated only in pockets, can be short-lived: Scientists||Herd immunity against COVID-19 in India is likely to be achieved only in pockets given the many socio-economic groups in the country and may be short-lived rather than long-lasting, say scientists as sero-surveillance data from New Delhi and Mumbai raise hopes of ‘community protection' from the disease.Herd immunity occurs when a large number of people, usually 70 to 90 per cent, become immune to a contagious disease after being infected to it.But there are many grey areas clouding the issue as far as the novel coronavirus is concerned with no consensus on when herd immunity sets in. “There are no clear numbers to say at what per cent of infected population we will achieve herd immunity. Many epidemiologists believe that for SARS-CoV-2 it would be at around 60 per cent,” said Shahid Jameel, virologist and CEO of the Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance, a public charity that invests in building biomedical sciences and health research frameworks.He said different parts of the country will get closer to herd immunity at different times.A recent study published in the journal Science also found that herd immunity against COVID-19 could be achieved with fewer people being infected than previously estimated.“Herd immunity is determined primarily by how many individuals in a population are immune to a particular infection. This results in indirect immunity to others in the population who never got exposed or infected,” explained virologist Upasana Ray.“Essentially, herd immunity means that the more the number of people get infected and develop immunity, the less chance there is for others in the population to get infected,” Ray, senior scientist at CSIR-IICB, Kolkata, told PTI.Immunologist Satyajit Rath agreed that it was not known at what point of the infection herd immunity would set in.“In India, with its multitude of socio-economic groupings, herd immunity may be generated in pockets rather than uniformly across the country, and may be short-lived,”Rath, from New Delhi's National Institute of Immunology, told PTI.“And therefore, the idea of naturally generated long-lasting herd immunity may not be of much practical policy relevance for India,” he added.The debate on herd immunity intensified following sero-surveys from New Delhi and Mumbai, two of India's most populated cities where the number of COVID-19 cases surged before showing a declining trend. The sero-surveillance study in Mumbai revealed that 57 per cent of its slum population and 16 per cent of its non-slum residents in three civic wards had developed antibodies, indicating many people would already be affected by COVID-19 than the official tally suggests.“These results will be valuable to learn more about herd immunity," stated Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in a statement.Delhi's sero-survey showed that nearly 23 per cent of the people had exposure to the novel coronavirus, which has infected over 1.5 million people in the country and killed nearly 35,000.Sero-surveillance provides estimates of antibody levels against infectious diseases and is considered the gold standard for measuring population immunity due to past infection or vaccination.An antibody is a large, Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to neutralise pathogens like viruses.Rath noted that seropositivity does not necessarily indicate protective immunity, adding that there is some evidence the antibody responses may be short-lived, in which case many people may soon become 'susceptible' again.On the other hand,  he said, infected people also develop T cell immune responses which are not being measured in such surveys.T cells -- that play a central role in the immune response -- might be somewhat longer-lasting, but it is not known what their relationship with protection is.“So while my guess is that, broadly, once we get infected we are likely to be somewhat immune, at least for a few months, against re-infection, I think there are many unknowns and caveats, and we should not be jumping to easy conclusions,” Rath added.Virologist Jameel said it would be a mistake to talk of herd immunity on a national scale.“This is because conditions such as population density, virus prevalence and transmission of infection vary across the country and even within a state of a metro city,” Jameel told PTI.“For example, one cannot compare Mumbai city to Arunachal Pradesh. Even in Mumbai, one cannot compare a densely populated area such as Dharavi to South Mumbai. Herd immunity is best understood in terms of a community, locality or population group,” he explained.Herd immunity, Ray added, also depends on how Infectious the pathogen is. “So, if a virus is extremely infectious and less pathogenic, herd immunity will be achieved faster,” she said.Pathogenicity is the capacity of a virus to cause damage in a host, while infectivity is the ability of a pathogen to establish an infection.“So, the more the pathogenicity, the more time it will take for herd immunity. More the infectivity, and if it's moderate to less pathogenic, the faster shall we achieve herd immunity,” Ray said.A Spanish study published in The Lancet journal in the first week of July cast doubts over the feasibility of herd immunity as a way of tackling the pandemic.The study of over 60,000 people estimated that around just five per cent of the Spanish population has developed antibodies.“Depending upon what model you believe in, we may or may not be close to herd immunity. Another factor to consider is that people are always moving about in and out of various zones  or areas and between states,” Jameel said.

30-07-2020||Bengaluru||Bengaluru men held for posting girls' images on porn site||Two men have been held for uploading around 30 images of college girls on pornographic website xhamster, according to an official here on Thursday.Ajay Rajagopal and Vishkath were arrested under sections 66 and 67 of the Information Technology Act for uploading photographs of college girls, said Kuldeep Jain, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Central Crime Branch.Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner of Police, said the victims' photographs had been taken from their social media accounts. Eight FIRs have been registered in this case.Vishkath, a college student, used to chat with Rajagopal, 37 and unmarried, pretending to be a girl using a fake social media profile. They indulged in a dirty talk several times but had never met.Later, Vishkath started sharing images of college girls and Rajagopal would upload them on the porn website, said Jain."One motive for uploading the pictures was to harass those girls. There was no involvement of money," said Jain.The CCB has got those webpages removed from xhamster by writing to legal agencies. "All the pages have been brought down. None of the information is available now. We got the IP addresses of the accused and cracked the case in 2-3 days," he said.Both the accused were produced in the court and are in the police custody.

30-07-2020||New Delhi||Guinness World Records awards certificate to Shakuntala Devi for ‘fastest human computation’||Guinness World Records on Thursday honoured Indian math genius Shakuntala Devi with the long overdue record title for ‘fastest human computation’, four decades after she achieved the feat.The fastest human computation is 28 seconds and was achieved by Shakuntala Devi by successfully multiplying two randomly selected 13-digit numbers, at Imperial College London, UK, on June 18, 1980.The certification was received by Anupama Banerji, daughter of the late mathematician.   Banerji said she was barely 10 when her mother made the world record.“Wherever I went, all people would speak about was that record. So I knew it was a huge achievement worldwide. I remember going to the Trocadero Centre (an entertainment complex on London’s Coventry Street). They have a room there which had mummy’s picture. It was fantastic,” she told PTI in an interview.The honour comes a day before “Shakuntala Devi”, a biopic on Banerji’s mother, starts streaming on Amazon Prime Video.                                Directed by Anu Menon, the film stars Vidya Balan in the title role.Balan said she is “thrilled” that Banerji will now have the certificate to cherish forever.“While shooting for ‘Shakuntala Devi’ in London, we would meet Anupama Banerji often. In my conversations with her, I realised that the late Shakuntala Devi didn’t have an official certification from Guinness World Records - it wasn’t the norm then.“Vikram Malhotra (producer) and I were, therefore, very keen to make this happen and along with the Amazon team, we reached out to the Guinness World Records team who provided us with every support,” the actor said in a statement.Banerji said Balan has “far exceeded our expectations” in playing the role of her mother on screen.“Her performance has been nothing short of astounding. Before seeing the movie, I was a little bit nervous about a few things as you have your whole life portrayed in front of you. But they have done it with so much grace. I see that spirit and attitude in Vidya,” she added.Banerji also praised actor Sanya Malhotra, who has played her role in the film.“Seeing yourself on screen is strange, but Sanya is brilliant. She has played me probably much nicer than the real me. Her acting is fantastic.”         Craig Glenday, editor in chief, Guinness World Records said Shakuntala Devi’s astounding achievement continues to hold its place in their archives after so many years.“No one has been able to even equal, let alone break, this record which is a testament to both the exceptional power of Ms Devi’s mind and the significance of this particular mental challenge. A global celebration of the life and career of the ‘Human Computer’ is long overdue, and Guinness World Records is honoured to play its part in championing this unique individual,” added Glenday.Also starring Jisshu Sengupta and Amit Sadh, “Shakuntala Devi” is slated to be released worldwide on Friday.

The agency would investigate if anyone used Rajput’s finances for money laundering and creating illegal assets, they added.According to reports, the late actor owned two companies — Vividrage Rhealityx and Front India for World Foundation. Incidentally, besides Sushant, other directors are Chakraborty and her brother Showik in the first company. Showik also happens to be a director of the second company.The Mumbai police are already probing death of Sushant Singh Rajput (34), who was found hanging in his apartment in Mumbai’s Bandra area on June 14.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-asks-for-case-details-in-the-fir-against-actress-rhea-chakraborty-from-bihar-police-119946

30-07-2020||New Delhi||MoU ready for smog tower installation project in Delhi, Centre informs SC||The Centre informed the Supreme Court Thursday that an MoU has been prepared for the installation of smog tower at Anand Vihar in east Delhi and it will be signed by the stakeholders.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra that after Wednesday's hearing, the Centre contacted Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay and others, including the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), and the memorandum of understanding was prepared.The top court had yesterday slammed the IIT Bombay for backing out of the project and said that it would take action against the premier institute and others for violating its order.Smog tower is a structure designed as large-scale air purifier to reduce air pollution. After Mehta informed the top court about the MoU, the bench questioned him as to why its January 13 order, directing the project to be completed within three months, was not complied with."When the order says that this has to be completed within three months, then why was it not complied with?," the bench asked Mehta, who was appearing for the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.The bench, which said the MoU be placed on record, also posed queries  regarding funds for the project and the time to complete it.Mehta told the court setting up of the smog tower may take around 10 months time. When he said the technology will be procured from Minnesota in the USA, the bench questioned the delay in the project and said its orders have been violated.The court asked Mehta to file an affidavit giving all the requisite details about the project, technology and observed that it would "not tolerate" any laxity.The bench has posted the matter for hearing on August 4.The apex court had yesterday expressed shock at IIT Bombay's backing out of the smog tower project and said this was "not expected of such institutions". It had said it was "not at all happy with the state of affairs" of the project for installing the smog tower and non-compliance with its order would be "taken seriously".Mehta had yesterday informed the court that IIT Bombay has backed out of the project.In its order on January 13 this year, the top court had said that smog tower be installed at Anand Vihar and the project be completed within three months.The apex court had also directed use of anti-smog guns in Delhi and national capital region (NCR) for large construction sites, road construction stretches, mining activities, large parking sites on unpaved areas and during large public gatherings, demolition activities etc.The top court had passed these directives while hearing the matter relating to air pollution in the Delhi-NCR.In an affidavit filed recently in the apex court, the ministry and the CPCB has said that they had convened a meeting on July 27 with IIT Delhi, NEERI and NBCC Ltd to discuss whether they will be willing to take up the project.“NEERI, IIT-D (Delhi) and NBCC have agreed to take up the project,” the affidavit has said.Earlier, the ministry and CPCB had filed another affidavit in the court and claimed that the MoU was not finalised as IIT Bombay has not agreed to take responsibility of overall coordination of the project and verification of works to be carried out by Tata Projects Limited, which has been involved by IIT Bombay for construction, operation and maintenance of smog tower.It had said that funds amounting to Rs 18.52 crore have been sanctioned for the project.

30-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi airport to relocate UV sanitization tunnels to inline baggage handling system||Delhi airport will relocate ultraviolet tunnels installed outside the departure terminal to sanitize passengers' luggage amid the COVID-19 pandemic to the inline baggage handling system, its operator DIAL said on Thursday.Once the new system is put in place, passengers will not have to queue up at the departure forecourt area and go through manual loading and unloading of baggage.Before resumption of domestic passenger flights in May, the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) had installed eight UV tunnels outside the entry gates in the departure forecourt area of Terminal 3. "Flyers used to sanitize their baggage before entering the terminal to board their flight. The decision to shift these UV tunnels was taken after passenger queues were observed during peak hours," the GMR group-led DIAL said in a press statement."The DIAL has planned to relocate UV tunnels at the inline baggage handling system by the end of this month. As all departure luggage are routed through it, hence it will ensure sanitisation of all check-in baggage," it said. The flyers can directly go to the check-in counter, drop their baggage and the inline system will ensure their sanitisation automatically, the release said.All passenger flights are currently being operated from Delhi airport's Terminal 3 due to less air traffic amid the pandemic. India resumed domestic passenger flights from May 25 after a gap of two months due to the pandemic. Airlines have been allowed to operate only a maximum of 45 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights. However, occupancy rate in Indian domestic flights has been around 50-60 per cent since May 25. Earlier this month, India had formed bilateral air bubbles with countries like the UAE, the US, Germany and France that allows airlines of both the countries in the pact to operate special international charter flights under certain restrictions. Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23.The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the pandemic. All airlines in India have taken cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts, leave without pay and firings of employees in order to conserve cash.Since May 6, international charter flights have been operated by Air India under the Vande Bharat Mission to help stranded people reach their destinations. Private carriers have also operated a certain number of flights under this mission.

30-07-2020||Mumbai||2nd Sero-survey in Mumbai from Aug 10 to avow herd immunity||Buoyed by the encouraging results of the first Serological Surveillance for SARS-CoV2 Infection, the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will conduct another similar survey from August 10, a top official said here on Thursday.BMC Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani said that after the results of the first survey in early-July, which tentatively pointed to 'herd immunity', another survey will be carried out in the same BMC wards to further confirm this outcome."It will be conducted in the regions of Matunga, Sion, Wadala (F/North), Chembur, Tilak Nagar (M/West) and Dahisar, Mandapeshwar (R/North), with a similar sample size but with different people from slums and housing complexes," Kakani told IANS.The outcome of the second survey -- likely to be available by early September -- would enable the health authorities to state with confidence the developing or prevalence of 'herd immunity' in those regions, and chart out a Covid-19 combat strategy for other parts of Mumbai, he added.The country's biggest cross-sectional antibodies survey, it was conducted by the BMC along with NITI Aayog and TISS for 12-14 days in the first half of July, covering 6,936 people which threw up unanticipated results.Among other things, it pointed at women and slum dwellers leading the march towards a 'herd immunity' against Covid-19 in Mumbai - the country's worst-hit city.The survey showed that 57 per cent of those tested in the slums were exposed to and developed antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Virus, compared to merely 16 per cent in housing complexes.For the slums, the figures thrown up were 59.30 per cent women (out of 2,297 tested) and 53.20 per cent men (out of 1,937 tested), who had developed antibodies against Covid.In the housing complexes, 16.80 per cent of the women tested and 14.90 per cent of the men tested had developed the antibodies.The BMC interprets this high exposure in slums to shared common facilities like toilets, water-taps, high population density and lack of physical distancing compared to the residents in housing complexes.With the results suggesting more asymptomatic infections, this higher exposure in slums points to an extremely low death-rate in Mumbai - "as low as 0.05 to 0.10 per cent" - instead of the existing 5.5 per cent.The official explained that the presence of antibodies indicated that the person had been infected, battled it away and in the process developed a certain level of resistance to the virus.Accordingly, more people with antibodies in a community is considered a positive sign as the virus had limited scope to spread, implying success of measures like wearing masks, physical distancing, etc, in these areas.Simultaneously, even the presence of antibodies among fewer persons in the housing complexes is considered encouraging as it indicates lesser number of infectees, due to better hygiene, more physical distancing and other interventions by the BMC, the official added."These results will be valuable to learn more about 'herd immunity'. Although it is still unclear at what level of prevalence does herd immunity kicks in, findings indicate that, at least in slums, this could be attained sooner than later, if the immunity exists and persists in a significant proportion of the population," the BMC informed.The Anti-SARS-CoV2-IgG antibodies were detected using Chemiluminescence assay (CLIA) by Abbott group, in what is billed as the largest such cross-sectional survey in India.It was carried out in collaboration with Kasturba Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, ATE Chandra Foundation and IDFC Institute.The development comes a fortnight after the World Health Organisation (WHO) on July 11 acknowledged the success of Maharashtra government in combating the Covid-19 outbreak in Dharavi, the largest slum in Asia.

30-07-2020||New Delhi||India's development cooperation does not come with any conditions: Modi||India's development cooperation with other nations does not come with any conditions and is not influenced by political or commercial considerations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted on Thursday.He said India's approach to development is mainly human-centric and it wants to work for the welfare of humanity. "Our development partnerships reflect the development priorities of our partner nations," he said.The prime minister was addressing a virtual event of the inauguration of a new Supreme Court building of Mauritius.Modi and Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth jointly inaugurated the new Supreme Court building at Port Louis.The new building in Port Louis is a symbol of our cooperation and shared values, Modi said."Both India and Mauritius respect our independent judiciaries as important pillars of our democratic systems," the prime minister observed.Modi said history had taught us that in the name of development partnerships, nations were forced into "dependence partnerships". "It gave rise to colonial and imperial rule. It gave rise to global power blocks and humanity suffered," he said.India is making development partnerships that are marked by respect, diversity, care for the future, and sustainable development, he noted.For India, Modi said, the most fundamental principle in development cooperation is respecting its partners."This sharing of development lessons is our only motivation. That is why our development cooperation does not come with any conditions. It is not influenced by political or commercial considerations," the prime minister asserted.Modi observed that Mahatma Gandhi had said, "My patriotism includes the good of mankind in general. Therefore, my service to India includes the service of humanity." This, Modi said, is India's guiding philosophy."India wants to develop and India wants to help others in their own development needs," he noted. India's development partnerships are diverse, he said, adding that from commerce to culture, energy to engineering, health to housing, IT to infrastructure, sports to science, India is working with nations across the globe."If India is honoured to help in the parliament building in Afghanistan, it is also proud to be associated with the making of the Mahatma Gandhi convention centre in Niger," he said.Modi said New Delhi had been happy to help Nepal improve its health services through the construction of an emergency and trauma hospital. "And we were similarly privileged to support Sri Lanka's efforts to establish emergency ambulance services in all nine provinces," he said.India is glad that the oil pipeline project it is doing with Nepal will help ensure the availability of petroleum products, he said.Modi said India is contributing towards ensuring the availability of drinking water and sanitation in 34 islands of the Maldives. "We have tried to make cricket popular in countries as diverse as Afghanistan and Guyana by helping build stadiums and other facilities.    "We are excited to see the young Afghan cricket team trained in India emerge as a force to reckon with," he said.India is now providing similar support to develop the talent of the Maldives cricket players. He also pointed out that India is at the forefront of a major housing project in Sri Lanka. "India is not only proud to be helping your present. We consider it our privilege to help you create a better future for your youth. That is why training and skilling is such an important part of our development cooperation," he said.With Mauritius, India shares not only the waters of the Indian Ocean but also a common heritage of kinship, culture and language, the prime minister said.In his address, Prime Minister Jugnauth expressed appreciation for India's support for the project as reflective of the close ties of friendship and cooperation between the two countries. He noted that the construction of the Supreme Court Building with Indian assistance is a new milestone in the modernisation of infrastructure in Mauritius and will help make the Mauritius justice system more efficient, accessible and inclusive.In his address, peppered with sentences in Hindi, he also thanked India for the assistance rendered amid the COVID-19 pandemic.He also referred to Modi's ‘Sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas’ philosophy.According to an MEA statement issued on Tuesday, the new SC building is spread over an area of more than 4,700 sq m with over 10 floors and a built up area of around 25,000 sq m. The building flaunts a modern design and green features with focus on thermal and sound insulation and high energy efficiency.The new Supreme Court building project is one of the five projects being implemented under the Special Economic Package of USD 353 million extended by India to Mauritius in 2016.

Our team arrested him after we received information about his hideout on Tuesday," said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Rakesh Paweriya.Sharma had come to Delhi with the intention of starting afresh and got married to his distant relative who knew about his criminal background, he said.He then entered property business and was currently meditating in the sale of one Marshal House located at Connaught Place to a property dealer in Jaipur, they added.His interrogation started on Tuesday and continued till Wednesday morning and he remained very calm and cooperated with the team. In fact, he disclosed the details about his previous involvement in crime himself, the police official said.During interrogation, he also confessed to being the mastermind of more than 50 murders     He was arrested for several murder cases reported in 2002-2004 but was convicted only in only six-seven cases. His wife and children left him in 2004 after they came to know about his activities, he added.When police questioned Sharma about the media reports, he told them that he had lost count after 50 murders and it had become difficult for him to remember the exact number of the killings executed till date.Sharma received his BAMS degree from Siwan, Bihar, and he started his clinic in 1984 in Jaipur. Later in 1992, he invested Rs 11 lakh in a gas dealership scheme but was cheated and suffered a financial crisis. So in 1995, he started a fake gas agency at Chhara village in Aligarh and later got involved in criminal activities, he said.          In 1994, Sharma also got involved in an interstate kidney transplant racket which was running in Jaipur, Ballabhgarh, Gurgaon and other places. He and several other doctors were arrested in 2004 in the Gurgaon kidney racket case, the officer said.From 1994 to 2004, he claimed to have carried out more than illegal 125 kidney transplants done for which he got Rs five to seven lakh per case, he said.In 2001, he once again started a fake gas agency at Amroha but got arrested again.After closure of his fake gas agency, he went to Jaipur and ran a clinic there till 2003. During this period, he got in touch with his accomplices who used to hire taxis to Aligarh and then killed the drivers at secluded places and dumped their bodies in crocodile infested waters in Hazara Canal, Kashganj."His accomplices robbed trucks carrying LPG cylinders by killing the driver. They unloaded the trucks in his fake gas agency and then the robbed truck would be dismantled in Meerut," the DCP said.In some cases, he sold the robbed taxi to customers at Kashganj and earned Rs 20,000-25,000 for every such sale, he said.The Jaipur police have been informed about the arrest and the custody of the accused will be handed over through court, police said.

This is an event that comes once in the life of mankind. We had to give it a befitting celebration and what better place than the iconic Times Square to commemorate the ‘Ram Janma Bhoomi shilanyas' (groundbreaking ceremony).“Under Prime Minister Modi, the construction of the Ram Temple is a dream come true for Hindus all over the world. Till six years back, we never thought that this day would come soon but due to Modi's leadership, this day has come and we want to celebrate it in a befitting way,” he said, adding that on August 5, images of Lord Ram will flood Times Square.Sewhani said the Times Square commemoration is being made possible with the help and support of the community and sponsors.Modi had announced the formation of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust in February. The Trust has invited Modi to lay the foundation stone of the grand Ram Temple.

While the two ate chapatis, made of the wheat flour allegedly given by the woman, the judge's wife had eaten only rice.Tripathis younger son also vomited after eating chapatis, but his condition is stable now, she said.Later, the judge and his elder son were admitted to the local Padhar Hospital after they became seriously ill on July 23.They were shifted to a hospital in Nagpur on Saturday as their condition deteriorated, she said.Prasad said Tripathis younger son Ashish informed the police that his father, on way to Nagpur, had told him that his woman acquaintance, Sandhya Singh, gave the poison-laced wheat flour after performing a puja.The same wheat flour was used in preparing the chapatis which were consumed by the judge and his two sons, the SP said.Prasad said during investigation, it came to light that Sandhya Singh came in contact with the judge when he was posted in Chhindwara and later both became friends.The woman was not able to meet Tripathi for four months after his family came to live with him in Betul, the police officer said.Out of frustration, she conspired to kill the judges family, she said.Prasad said the woman asked the judge to give her wheat flour for performing a puja for him so that he can get "rid of all his problems".Two days later, on July 20, she returned the wheat flour to the judge, the SP said.The same wheat flour was used in making chapatis for dinner that night, she said.Prasad said the police initially arrested Sandhya Singh and her driver Sanju, who revealed the entire conspiracy.Later, the police arrested three more persons, Devilal Chandravanshi, Mubin Khan and one Kamal, on the basis of information shared by Sandhya Singh.A tantrik, Baba Ramdayal, who is also wanted in the case, is absconding, she said.

A review will be done following which the deleted chapters will be uploaded in the website,” the order read.Earlier on Wednesday, Kumar had issued a statement, saying that the decision to truncate the syllabus has not been finalised yet. He also made it clear that his department would not remove chapters unnecessarily.Former chief minister and Congress leader Siddramaiah had attacked the state government on the issue.“The government, which has failed to control the spread of coronavirus, is using it as an opportunity to push its clandestine agenda of saffronising the textbooks,” he tweeted.--PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ktaka-govt-puts-on-hold-decision-to-drop-some-chapters-from-social-science-textbooks-119889

30-07-2020||Washington||Trump says India, China and Russia don't take care of their air||US President Donald Trump has alleged that India, China and Russia do not take care of their air, while America does, noting that he withdrew from the “one-sided, energy-destroying” Paris climate accord which would have made it a “non-competitive nation”.Trump, in his address on energy and the Permian Basin in Midland, Texas on Wednesday, said that by imposing these punishing restrictions -- and beyond restrictions – “the Washington radical-left, crazy Democrats” would also send countless American jobs, factories, industries to China and to other foreign polluting states.“They want us to take care of our air, but China doesn't take care of its air. In all fairness, India doesn't take care of its air. Russia doesn't take care of its air. But we do. Not on my watch, it's not going to happen -- I can tell you that. Because as long as I'm President, we will always put America first. It's very simple,” he said.“For years and years, we put other countries first, and we now put America first. As we have seen in cities and towns across our nation, it's not just Texas oil that the radical Democrats want to destroy; they want to destroy our country,” he said.Such radical Democrats, he alleged, do not love the country in any way, shape or form.“There's no respect for the American way of life. There is no way of life ever in history that's been like the great American way of life. There is no respect, but there is by you, and there is by 95 per cent of our people. Our people love our country, and our people love our anthem and they love our flag,” he said.Trump said that under the last administration, America's energy industry was under relentless and unceasing attack.“But the day I took the oath of office, we ended the war on American energy and we stopped the far-left assault on American energy workers,” he said.Observing that he withdrew from the one-sided, energy-destroying Paris climate accord, he said this was a disaster and cost the US billions of dollars.The US in November last year formally notified the UN of its withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, a global agreement in which President Trump's predecessor Barack Obama had played a key role.Although Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the historic pact on June 1, 2017, the process began last year with the formal notification and the US will be out of the pact on November 4, 2020.“It (Paris climate accord) would have made us a non-competitive nation. We cancelled the Obama administration's job-crushing clean power plan,” he said as he listed some of the steps being taken by his administration.“For the first time in nearly 70 years, we have become a net energy exporter. And the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on the face of the Earth. To ensure we maintain this dominant position long into the future, my administration is announcing today that export authorisations for American liquefied natural gas can now be extended through the year 2050,” Trump added.India is the fourth highest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, accounting for 7 per cent of global emissions in 2017, according to the projection by the Global Carbon Project published in December, 2018.The top four emitters in 2017, which covered 58 per cent of global emissions, were China (27 per cent), the US (15 per cent), the European Union (10 per cent) and India (7 per cent), it said.

30-07-2020||London||Stolen from Rajasthan and smuggled into UK, rare Lord Shiva statue to be returned to India||A rare late ninth century stone statue of Lord Shiva, which was stolen from a temple in Rajasthan and smuggled to the UK, will be returned to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) on Thursday.The stone Nataraj/Natesha murti, in “chatura pose with jatamakuta and trinetra” and almost four-ft-tall, is a rare depiction of Lord Shiva in the Prathihara style.It was stolen in February 1998 from Ghateshwar Temple in Baroli, Rajasthan. In 2003, it came to light that the statue had been smuggled out to the UK.“When this information was received in London, the UK authorities were contacted and with their support the matter was pursued with the private collector, who was in possession of the idol in London. He voluntarily returned the idol to the Indian High Commission in the UK in 2005,” said the High Commission of India in the UK.In August 2017, a team of ASI experts visited the India House and examined the idol, which took pride of place inside the building's main lobby. The experts confirmed that it is the same statue that was stolen from Ghateshwar Temple.An official Indian government communique said that in line with the Government of India's renewed impetus to protecting India's cultural heritage and showcasing it to the world, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) along with India's law-enforcement agencies have been actively pursuing investigations and restitution of stolen and smuggled Indian antiquities.As a result, antiquities and idols have been returned to India from various countries, including the US, Australia, France and Germany.The High Commission of India (HCI) in London said it had also been playing a leading role in the successful restitutions and repatriations of India's cultural heritage.“HCI is currently working with various law-enforcement agencies to trace, seize and retrieve stolen artefacts. HCI is working on many such cases at present. We are confident that in coming days, in partnership with the ASI, Government of India, state and central authorities as well as UK law-enforcement agencies and independent experts, we will be successful in returning more items of our cultural heritage to India,” a statement said.Some examples of restitution from the UK include the Bramha-Brahmani sculpture, which was stolen from India and returned to the ASI in 2017. It has found a prominent resting place at Purana Quila Museum in New Delhi, in the gallery curated by the ASI.On August 15, 2018, a 12th century bronze statue of Bhagwan Buddha was restored to the Indian High Commission by London's Metropolitan Police and then handed over to the Indian government last year.

30-07-2020||Washington||US Congressional committee passes bill to promote Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr's legacies||A key Congressional committee on Wednesday passed a bill, written by civil rights icon John Lewis, to promote the legacies of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.Cosponsored by Indian-American Congressman Ami Bera, the Gandhi-King Exchange Act was passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The bill would establish an exchange initiative between the United States and India to study the work and legacies of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr."John Lewis was a civil rights hero not only in the United States, but across the globe. John fought for human rights, equality and justice, and democracy for all. Just like Gandhi and Dr. King, Congressman Lewis shaped the world through his actions of nonviolence, and his life story will reverberate throughout history," Bera said.The Act authorises the US State Department, in cooperation with the Indian government, to establish an annual educational forum for scholars from both countries that focuses on the legacies of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.It also seeks to develop a professional development training initiative on conflict resolution based on the principles of nonviolence; and establish a foundation to address social, environmental, and health priorities in India.In 2009, Congressman John Lewis led a Congressional delegation visit to India to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Dr King's pilgrimage to India.Inspired by his visit, Congressman Lewis created the Gandhi-King Exchange Act to seek to apply the philosophies of Gandhi and Dr King Jr to conflict resolution efforts and current policy challenges."The Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act is a fitting tribute to his incredible legacy," said Bera, who is the longest serving Indian-American member of the Congress in history."As the world's oldest and largest democracies, the US and India have long traditions of upholding these shared values championed by figures like Gandhi, King, and Congressman Lewis. But they are increasingly under threat in both countries," he said."This legislation will help ensure those values endure and remind us that by holding true to them, we embody and live up to the best of our two nations," Bera said.Noting that Gandhi and Dr King Jr were dedicated leaders fighting for social justice and social change, peace, and civil rights in their respective communities, and countries and in the world, the Bill said the use of non-violent civil disobedience is a shared tactic that has played a key role in defeating social injustice in India, the US, and in other parts of the world.The bill, among other things, asks the administrator of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to establish in cooperation with the Indian government the United States-India Gandhi-King Development Foundation.The foundation shall identify development priorities and administer and oversee competitively awarded grants to private nongovernmental entities to address such priorities in India, including health initiatives addressing tuberculosis (TB), water, sanitation, and health (WASH), and pollution and related health impacts (PHI); pollution and climate change; education; and empowerment of women.It asks the president and chief executive officer of the United States Institute of Peace to develop a training initiative known as the Gandhi-King Global Academy. It will target representatives from governments, nongovernmental organizations, civic organizations, and educational, cultural, women's, civil, and human rights groups, including religious and ethnic minorities and marginalized communities in countries with ongoing political, social, ethnic, or violent conflict.The academy would include a specific focus on the success of nonviolent movements, inclusion, and representation in conflict resolution; develop a curriculum on conflict resolution tools based on the principles of nonviolence; and make the curriculum publicly available online, in person, and through a variety of media.Asserting that Dr King Jr's effective use of Gandhi's principles was instrumental to the American civil rights movement, the bill says that there is a long history of civil and social rights movements in the United States and in India."As the relationship between the United States and India evolves, a binational foundation through which the governments of each country can work together and catalyze private investment toward development objectives would provide an ongoing, productive institution and symbol of the friendship and common ideals of the respective governments and their peoples," it said.John Lewis died on July 17 at the age of 80 and was a contemporary of fellow civil rights leader Dr Martin Luther King Jr. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-congressional-committee-passes-bill-to-promote-gandhi-martin-luther-king-jrs-legacies-119881

He was 78.Rohan Mitra, Somen’s son, broke the news on Twitter. “I have lost my father,” Rohan tweeted at 2 am.The WBPCC announced Mitra’s death on the micro-blogging site an hour later. “WBPCC president Somen Mitra has breathed his last a short while ago. As we struggle to come to terms with this immense loss, all our prayers and thoughts are with Dada’s family,” @INCWestBengal tweeted.In a condolence message, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she was deeply saddened by the death of Mitra. “I knew this experienced political leader well and enjoyed good relations with him. His death is a great loss to politics,” Banerjee said.Mamata, who was initially with the Congress, left the party after she was challenged by Mitra in the Congress’s organisational election. Mitra, however, later quit from PCC chief’s post owning responsibility for the party’s disastrous performance in the 1998 elections. He made a return as Congress president 20 years later in an unforeseen move by the Congress high command.Mitra, who won multiple times from the now-abolished Sealdah Assembly constituency, had a stint in the Lok Sabha as the TMC representative from Diamond Harbour constituency.

They are the first step to building up the IAF strength to 42 fighter jet squadrons (16-18 jets in each). The IAF currently has 31 squadrons, including five with MiG-21s, which should have been ideally decommissioned by now.The Indian forces assess a need for 42 squadrons (some 18 planes in each) to tackle a two-front war with Pakistan and China simultaneously. The remaining 31 Rafales will be delivered progressively till May 2023 or over the next 34 months. Also, 20 LCA (Light Combat Aircraft) Tejas will be inducted over the next two years, which will be added to the existing fleet of 20 Tejas fighters.Besides the Rafales and Tejas, the IAF will be looking for 230 other jets to make good the shortfall.As an immediate measure, India has gone back to its long-standing military ally Russia to order an additional 33 fighter jets. These will include 21 MiG 29, adding to the existing fleet of 59 jets. The purchase and the upgrade of the existing fleet will cost Rs 7,418 crore ($1billion approx). In addition, New Delhi is buying 12 Sukhoi 30 MKI. India has a sanction from Russia for licensed production of 272 such jets. The additional 12 fighters will meet the immediate shortages and make up for those that have crashed over the past decade.Will protect territorial integrityThe new capability must be worrying those who want to threaten our territorial integrity. —Rajnath Singh, Defence MinisterA part of the 230-jet requirement will be met by the 83 Tejas Mark1A fighters, which will come with 43 improvements over the existing Tejas. The order is expected to be placed by the end of the year, sources said.The IAF has expressed an interest to procure another 114 fighter jets under the “strategic partnership” model. In the race for this tender are the Lockheed Martin’s F-21, Boeing’s F/A-18IN, Eurofighter Typhoon, French Dassault’s Rafale, Swedish Saab’s Gripen and Russian MiG-35 and Sukhoi 35. But not much has moved on the procurement front.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rafale-home-mega-boost-for-air-power-119636
30-07-2020||Aditi Tandon||10 plus 2 goes, no rigid separation of streams||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 29The government today approved landmark reforms to school and college education to prepare Indian students for a 21st century world where critical thinking will determine the future of nations.The National Policy on Education (NPE)-2020 approved by the Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi replaces a 34-year-old policy and bids farewell to rote learning. The focus is on new curricular structures to inculcate scientific temper and mathematical thinking in students; allow multiple entry and exit across higher education levels; establish a single higher education regulator replacing UGC, AICTE and NCTE; cap fees in colleges and universities; expand school education to cover 3 to 6-year-olds; and end rigid separation of arts-science and curricular and extracurricular streams at school.A major decision also is to rename HRD Ministry as the Ministry of Education.The NPE-2020 makes school education compulsory from 3 years through “early childhood care and education” (ECCE) component for which the NCERT will draft a play-based curriculum. Children aged 3 to 6 years are currently covered by informal anganwaris under the Women and Child Development Ministry.The new policy replaces 10+2 curricular structure with 5+3+3+4 system corresponding to ages 3-8, 8-11, 11-14, and 14-18 years, respectively.“Three years of pre-primary (covering 3 to 6-year-old) will have an NCERT play- based curriculum focused on foundational literacy; classes 6 to 8 will see subject introduction with multi-disciplinary approach; in classes 9 to 12 there will be no separations between arts and sciences or curricular and extracurricular activities, vocational or academic streams, as we see today. Students can study physics with fashion designing and baking with chemistry. There will be full flexibility,” Secretary, School Education, Anita Karwal said, adding that the curriculum will be limited to essential concepts so that children have the time to think and learn. Here the curricular structure is fashioned on the western model of play-based creative learning.NPE 2020 also introduces coding and vocational courses from Grade 6 at school to ensure each student would have learnt one vocational skill by the time he leaves school. “The new school curriculum and teacher training curriculum will be drafted and the focus would be scientific temper and mathematical thinking,” Karwal said. Students will also have the option of self-assessment in a new report card scheme the NPE 2020 provides.In an ambitious goal, NPE 2020 seeks to expand access to higher education for 50 per cent of high school students by 2035 as against 26.3 pc in 2018.It allows multiple entry and exits across college through academic credit banks. This means if a student wants to opt out of college after two years of study he can do so and when he returns within a specific time to resume studies, he won’t need to repeat the previous two years.HRD is now edu ministryGreater Flexibility||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/10-plus-2-goes-no-rigid-separation-of-streams-119716

30-07-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||France cements its place as key ally||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 29Five Rafale fighter jets that landed today at Ambala do not constitute even half a squadron. But their delivery once again brings back the spotlight on France which has remained India’s trusted partner through the Cold War and beyond.Just two years after India’s Independence and a year before US President Dwight Eisenhower’s “Atoms for Peace” speech that opened the doors for multi-country civil nuclear collaboration, France and India had collaborated in a project to extract thorium from monazite sand. It was a dead-end, but it in turn led to a partnership that lasted till India conducted its first nuclear test in 1974.A Step towards stronger maritime partnership While more Rafale jets will keep arriving and some may be assembled here, the ties between French President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Narendra Modi may eventually lead to a stronger partnership in the maritime domain, especially in the Western Indian Ocean, where the Chinese threat is looming and the US is lukewarm about partnering with India.But when India conducted its second nuclear test in 1998, Russia and France were the only major powers that did not succumb this time to the Anglo-US pressure to cancel military and security exchanges.A year later, France made emergency supplies of ammunition during the Kargil War that was used by Mirage planes for accurate and debilitating strikes on Pakistani sangars on steep mountainsides. However, French military machines were doing yeoman service for the Indian armed forces much before the Mirages arrived. The Cheetah and the Chetak that feed and equip Indian soldiers in forbidding heights are also of French origin. However, military ties began just seven years after Independence. Over 100 Mystere fighter jets from France that joined the Indian Air Force were able to match the American Starfighters in dogfights during the 1965 Indo-Pak War.While more Rafale will keep arriving and some may eventually be assembled here, the close personal ties between French President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Narendra Modi may lead to a stronger partnership in the maritime domain, especially in the western Indian Ocean where the Chinese threat is looming and the US is lukewarm about partnering with India.India and France have trodden that path before. Paris had helped install two listening stations on India’s western coast. These were to be linked with similar ones in Iran and France for a comprehensive coverage of the western Indian Ocean. But the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran ended that initiative.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/france-cements-its-place-as-key-ally-119740
