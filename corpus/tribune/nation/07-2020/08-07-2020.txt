08-07-2020||Washington||China took ‚Äòincredibly aggressive action‚Äô in recent clash with India: Mike Pompeo||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday accused China of taking ‚Äúincredibly aggressive action‚Äù in a recent clash with India over a disputed section of the nuclear-armed neighbours' border, saying the incident could not be assessed in isolation.On the night of June 15, Chinese forces and Indian troops fought for hours with rods and clubs, resulting in a dramatic escalation that left 20 Indian soldiers killed, with some falling to their deaths in the freezing waters of the Galwan river in the western Himalayas.On Monday, Indian government sources said China began pulling back troops from along the border with India, after weeks of talks between senior military officials on how to ease tensions. China has yet to confirm whether it suffered casualties but the Indian deaths were the highest along the border in more than five decades."The Chinese took incredibly aggressive action and the Indians have done their best to respond to that," Pompeo said in a news conference at the State Department. "I put this in the context of General Secretary Xi Jinping and his behaviour throughout the region, throughout the world," he said."I don't think it's possibly to look at that particular instance, Chinese Communist Party aggression in isolation. You need to put it in the larger context," Pompeo said.His comments reflect the deep running tensions between Washington and Beijing, which have been at loggerheads over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak, China's actions in the former British colony of Hong Kong and a nearly two-year trade dispute between the US and China.The Chinese military on Monday was seen dismantling tents and structures at a site in the Galwan valley near to where the latest clash took place, said the Indian government sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Since I moved to Dubai a year ago, I started to feel more productive,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúDuring lockdown, I wanted to test my determination, so I started to search for something to do to keep active and do a remarkable achievement, and then decided to go for an official attempt with Guinness World Records,‚Äù he said.

08-07-2020||New Delhi||Slow credit off-take as industry awaits lockdown 3.0||The slow pace of credit off-take by the medium, small and micro enterprises suggests that this backbone of Indian manufacturing is awaiting further relaxations in labour and goods movements under lockdown 3.0 that could be expected to begin from July 15, said government sources.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sithraman has stated that as of July 4, the total amount sanctioned by public and private sector banks under the 100 per cent Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme stands at Rs 1,14 lakh crore.The scheme will run till October 31 or till the Rs 3 lakh corpus is exhausted.On surface, this amounts to a healthy sanction ratio of about 33 per cent with four months to go.¬†But it doesn‚Äôt translate into a kick-start to the economy as actual disbursement is Rs 56,091 crore or about one-sixth of the Rs 3 lakh crore.Of this, public sector banks have disbursed loans worth Rs 35,000 crore to over 13 lakh units but private banks disbursed Rs 20,515 crore to just 1.55 lakh units.This has raised apprehensions that after the government enhanced the eligibility ceiling for all types of MSMEs, private sector banks may be focusing on larger clients.A similar scenario had played out when the RBI infused the first dose of liquidity. Most of the Rs 1 lakh crore it raised by targeted long term repo operations (TLTRO) was cornered by corporates.In the next TLTRO, the RBI specifically earmarked Rs 50,000 crore for smaller financial institutions to avoid a repeat of the big boys crowding out the smaller players.Sources here said banks are also not lending to industry segments on their negative list or the ones that have no immediate revival prospects such as tourism and hospitality.As¬†¬†a result, in the immediate term, the Centre is pinning hopes on the agriculture sector and government expenditure, till the MSME sector as well as the industry gain enough confidence to run their operations at full steam, suggested the sources.NABARD has already indirectly disbursed over 75 per cent of the Rs 30,000 crore special liquidity facility to 3 crore small and marginal farmers, for their post-harvest and kharif sowing needs.The bacon will also be saved by two dozen big public sector enterprises, most of which will now be on sale. They are slated to spend Rs 1.65 lakh crore on capital expenditure which will have a downstream effect on several industrial segments as well as employment.The World Bank, which recently approved a $750 million loan for the Indian MSME sector, points to the reluctance on the part of banks to lend.‚ÄúGiven current uncertainties, lenders remain concerned about borrowers‚Äô ability to repay ‚Äì resulting in limited flow of credit even to the viable enterprises in the sector,‚Äù it said about the Indian situation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/slow-credit-off-take-as-industry-awaits-lockdown-3-0-110224

Contrary to some of the impressions being created, it is clarified that the rationalisation of syllabus up to 30 per cent has been undertaken for nearly 190 subjects for the academic session 2020-21 as a one-time measure only,‚Äù CBSE Secretary Anurag Tripathi said.The board claimed the objective of rationalisation is to reduce the exam stress of students due to the prevailing health emergency and prevent learning gaps. It asserted that no question shall be asked from the reduced syllabus in the board exams 2020-21 only.‚ÄúThe schools have also been directed to follow the alternative academic calendar prepared by NCERT for transacting the curriculum. Therefore, each of the topics that have been wrongly portrayed as deleted have been covered under alternative academic calendar which is already in force for all the affiliated schools of the board,‚Äù Tripathi said.On Tuesday, the board had notified that it rationalised by up to 30 per cent the syllabus for classes 9 to 12 for the academic year 2020-21 to reduce course load on students amid the COVID-19 crisis.Among the chapters dropped after the rationalisation exercise are lessons on democracy and diversity, demonetisation, nationalism, secularism, India‚Äôs relations with its neighbours and growth of local governments in India.

Everybody knows that CM Jagan Reddy doesn‚Äôt care for any advice, both from inside or outside,‚Äù Lokesh said.‚ÄúHe has got dozens of advisors drawing astronomical salaries from people‚Äôs treasury but none of them is ever seen being consulted by the CM on any issue. Even the coronavirus dangerous time is being like a normal disease that comes and goes. ¬†It was evident from Jagan Reddy‚Äôs paracetamol and bleaching powder comments,‚Äù Lokesh said.Andhra added 1,062 new COVID- 19 cases to its tally on Wednesday, taking total infections in the state to 22,259.

08-07-2020||Naveen S Garewal||Congress demands President Rule in Telangana||Tribune News ServiceHyderabad, July 8¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Senior Congress leader and former Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president, Ponnala Laxmaiah, has sought the immediate imposition of President‚Äôs Rule in Telangana, accusing the Chief Minister and the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government of failing to put in place a plan to contain COVID-19.‚ÄúThe Chief Minister does not care about the people and has failed to protect them from COVID-19, which is fast gripping the entire state,‚Äù said Ponnala.The Congress leader told the media that the state had left the people to fend for themselves in the absence of any concrete plan, making it a fit case for imposing President's Rule in the state.He said the Chief Minister had remained indifferent to the plight of the people even after Governor Dr Tamilisai Soundararajan, herself a medical practitioner, visited the Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) and expressed reservations about the arrangements.Ponnala said the Governor had reviewed the situation and shared her views time and again, but the government just looked the other way.Telangana has seen the fastest rise in the number of COVID-19 patients, with close to around 2000 cases every day, majority of which are from the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation.While the government has just abandoned the people and lifted all lockdown restrictions, people are taking various initiatives for their safety. Most important markets have announced voluntary closure until things improve.Telangana is perhaps one of the only states that have no restriction of movement of people in and out of the state.Ponnala said it was astonishing that the government functionaries including bureaucrats and politicians have been kept in the dark about the whereabouts of Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) for the past 11 days, leaving people guessing about the proposed safety measures to be taken, while positive cases were on the rise.‚ÄúSince KCR has deserted the people, it‚Äôs a fit case for the centre to step in and impose Presidents Rule,‚Äù he said.Lambasting the government for its ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and ‚Äúbelow than required‚Äù testing in the state, Ponnala said it‚Äôs a case of ‚ÄúNero playing the fiddle while Rome burnt‚Äù.He listed more than one reason for demanding the imposition of President's Rule stating that it starts with the mix-up in the identification of the dead at Gandhi Hospital to the atmosphere of fear and dismay across the state.‚ÄúIt is a clear case of the state being in the grip of severe uncertainty, the future looks bleak and only Presidents Rule can bring back the much-needed governance in Telangana to pull it out of the morass it currently is in,‚Äù said Ponnala.The number of COVID-19 cases has touched 27,612 in Telangana, putting it at No. 6¬†in the country.With 313 deaths and 11,012 active cases the situation in the state is alarming as there are 1,800 to 2,000 fresh cases each day.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-demands-president-rule-in-telangana-110209

Under the scheme, five kg of wheat or rice and one kg of pulses per month are being provided free of cost.‚ÄúThe Prime Minister had announced that this scheme will be extended and the same has been approved by the Cabinet today,‚Äù Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said in a media briefing.The PMGKAY has been extended for another five months till November. About 203 lakh tonnes of foodgrains and 9.70 lakh tonne of chana will be given for free in the next five months, he said.The distribution of free ration under the PMGKAY would cost Rs 1.49 lakh crore to the exchequer, he added. The estimated cost is for providing eight months of ration under the scheme.Stating that this is the most popular scheme, the minister said, ‚ÄúFor the first time since (India‚Äôs) independence, free foodgrains are being distributed for eight months. No country has such a big scheme.‚Äù¬† In a televised address to the nation on June 30, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced extension of the free ration scheme PMGKAY till the end of November 2020 to ameliorate the hardship faced by the underprivileged or poor on account of economic disruption caused by the lockdown due to COVID-19.In a statement, the government said the extension of PMGKAY is in line with the commitments of the government not to allow anybody, especially any poor family, to suffer on account of non-availability of food grains due to disruption during the next five months.Free distribution of chana will also ensure adequate availability of protein to all the above-mentioned individuals during these five months, it said.All expenses on the extended PMGKAY will be borne by the central government, it added.Free ration provided under the PMGKAY is in addition to the subsidised grains given through Public Distribution System (PDS) under the National Food Security Act.With regard to distribution of free ration to 8 crore migrant labourers, Javadekar said about 8 lakh tonne of foodgrains has been allocated for this purpose and migrants can avail their quota till August.About 5 kg foodgrains per beneficiary and 1 kg pulses per family is being distributed at free of cost to migrants who neither have centre or state ration cards under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat scheme.

08-07-2020||K V Prasad||India should recalibrate China policy, take more economic measures||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 8Advocating it is time for India to recalibrate its policy towards China, strategic and policy experts on Wednesday suggested New Delhi initiates more measures to decouple economically while seeking to work out with other countries in collectively¬†responding on the economic front.Interpreting the current development as being qualitatively different, former India‚Äôs Ambassador to China Gautam Bambawale said on the tactical front China is sending a signal it would unilaterally show what Beijing considers the Line of Actual Control and on the strategic front, India should understand where it stands in Asia and the World.‚ÄúWe have to take many more policy measures to show our displeasure with China. Policy of engagement has run out of steam in May 2020. India has to undertake a fundamental assessment and recalibrate its China policy‚Ä¶,‚ÄùAmbassador Bambawale said taking part in a webinar ‚ÄúIndia-China relations ‚Äì at an inflection point?‚Äù organised by the Institute of Chinese Studies.While stating the economic measures would have to go beyond banning 59 Chinese Apps like not allowing Chinese telecom companies to take part in the 5G trials, he said the economic decoupling steps would cause pain but a strong message ‚Äúit cannot be business as usual‚Äù needs to be sent.On his part, JNU Professor of International Politics Rajesh Rajagopalan felt since except the US, difference in power between China and other countries in the Indo-Pacific region is big. Countries facing the brunt of Chinese policies may have to work out a mechanism at least on economic front to balance it out. One or a set of countries may not be able to face the backlash from China, which could be resisted through combined efforts.In his assessment, at present India does not possess internal capacity to match the difference in power with China. Instead of accepting Beijing‚Äôs hegemony India can balance it out through other countries. More than military response, he said, countries could work to balance on political front by coordinating action in multilateral organisations or what Beijing is doing through Belt and Road Initiative.Senior analyst and China watcher Tom Miller said the choice before India is to either pursue ‚Äústrategic autonomy‚Äù or join a league of nations emerging against China. In his opinion, given the extent of Indian dependence on China for intermediate products and extent of investments economic decoupling would not be feasible. In his view, India would have to work putting its national interest over its economic interest considering that despite efforts for over a decade the balance of bilateral trade continues to grow in favour of China.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-should-recalibrate-china-policy-take-more-economic-measures-110203

08-07-2020||London||Indian banks pursue Mallya bankruptcy order in UK court||A consortium of Indian banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) are pursuing their bankruptcy order against liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya in the High Court in England, as they seek to establish that any settlement offer made by him is now ‚Äúdead in the water‚Äù.In a hearing in the insolvency division of the High Court in London on Tuesday, Justice Michael Briggs heard arguments from the banks, represented by barrister Marcia Shekerdemian, that pursuing the bankruptcy order was required as the banks were not secured creditors, as claimed by Mallya.It follows Justice Briggs‚Äô ruling back in April in the case when he had concluded that Mallya should be given time until petitions pending in India can be determined before a decision is made on a bankruptcy order in London.‚ÄúThere can be no doubt that it is appropriate to make a bankruptcy order in this case. The numerous hurdles being put up by VJM (Mallya) are without merit,‚Äù note the arguments laid out before the court on behalf of the banks.The banks‚Äô legal team argued that the assets of United Breweries Holdings Limited (UBHL), being relied on by Mallya as part of a second settlement offer, are ‚Äúunquestionably under the control of its Official Liquidator‚Äù and therefore not available to Mallya or the erstwhile management of UBHL.‚ÄúThis means that the Second Settlement Offer is effectively dead in the water as neither VJM nor his associates nor the erstwhile management have any control over UBHL‚Äôs assets, which form part of that offer,‚Äù they argued.Mallya‚Äôs legal team, led by barrister Philip Marshall, countered that the banks were secured creditors and that the petition should be dismissed.A reference was also made to the parallel extradition proceedings against Mallya, with the banks highlighting that the 64-year-old had been refused permission to appeal to the High Court on the grounds that he ‚Äúwould not receive a fair trial in India because of his political beliefs‚Äù.‚ÄúThis court should not look beyond those decisions,‚Äù it was noted.According to the UK Home Office, Mallya‚Äôs extradition to India on charges of fraud and money laundering was ordered in February 2019 but it cannot comment on an ‚Äúongoing legal case‚Äù.With all avenues of legal recourse exhausted in the UK after his permission to appeal in the UK Supreme Court was denied in May, the next steps in the extradition process remain uncertain as the UK government does not formally confirm or deny any applications made before it for asylum.The SBI-led consortium of 13 Indian banks also includes Bank of Baroda, Corporation bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt Ltd.It had initiated bankruptcy proceedings against Mallya in December 2018 as part of efforts to recoup around 1.145 billion pounds in unpaid loans.Judge Briggs has reserved his judgment on the future course of the petition following this week‚Äôs hearing and will hand down the ruling at a later date.In his April ruling, he had noted that the legal cases being pursued by Mallya in India stood a reasonable prospect of success. The banks have returned to court with an amended petition and sought the bankruptcy order to secure the money owed. ‚Äî PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-banks-pursue-mallya-bankruptcy-order-in-uk-court-110193

The architect of the Indian Constitution lived there for two decades.Current residents of ‚ÄòRajgruh‚Äô include Dr Ambedkar‚Äôs daughter-in-law and his grandsons Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi leader Prakash Ambedkar, Anandrao and Bhimrao.Prakash Ambedkar, who was in Akola when the incident took place, appealed for calm.Chief Minister Thackeray on Wednesday said he had instructed police to take strict action against the culprits.‚ÄúThe premises are not just a sacred place for Ambedkarites, but the entire society. Ambedkar preserved all his writings in this premises. This is like a pilgrimage centre for all Maharashtrians,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúThe government will not tolerate insult to Rajgruh, and I have asked the police to ensure strict action against the culprits,‚Äù the chief minister said.Condemning the incident, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said it was an act of ‚Äúanti-social elements with wicked mindset‚Äù and urged people to ensure peace and unity and not to fall prey to the ‚Äúulterior motives‚Äù of such elements.Ambedkar‚Äôs work and ideology are deep-rooted in the minds of people and none can remove the faith people have in him, Pawar further said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government came to power in 2014 and won a second mandate in 2019. "These transactions are in public domain...Our government is committed to transparency.

08-07-2020||Islamabad||Pak court rejects petitions challenging construction of first Hindu temple in Islamabad||A Pakistani court has dismissed three identical petitions challenging the construction of the first Hindu temple in the country's capital.A single bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), comprising Justice Aamer Farooq, delivered the judgment late on Tuesday, making it clear that there was no bar on the Institute of Hindu Panchayat (IHP), which was allotted the land for the construction of the temple, to build it using its own funds.Also read: Mehbooba Mufti slams Pak for stopping temple workThe court had on Monday reserved the judgment on the matter.As per plans, the Krishna temple is supposed to come up in a 20,000 sq ft plot in the capital's H-9 administrative division. The groundbreaking ceremony for the temple was performed recently by Parliamentary Secretary on Human Rights Lal Chand Malhi.The Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q), a ruling ally of the Imran Khan government, has opposed the construction of the temple, asking its coalition partner to scrap the project as it is "against the spirit of Islam".The petitioners had asked the court to annul the construction of the temple and allotment of a piece of land by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) for it in Islamabad, pleading that there was no provision for the same in the master plan of the national capital.The court rejected it saying it was up to the CDA to decide the purpose of land.¬†It also rejected the petitioners' claim that Rs 100 million was paid by the government for the construction of the temple and noted that the matter had rather been referred to the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) for opinion.The CDA last week stopped the construction of the boundary wall on the plot meant for the temple citing legal reasons.The CDA, during arguments, clarified that the plot was allotted after consultations with all departments but its construction was stopped as the builder failed to provide a detailed design.The court, in its five-page judgment, also noted that according to the CDA, the land was allotted to the IHP in 2017 for the construction of a temple, community centre and crematorium in Sector H-9 where graveyards of other minority communities already exist.The sub sector H-9/2 was designated by the authority for the purpose of allocating plots to minorities.Since the construction was put on hold, ‚Äúhence the grievance of the petitioners on the specific issue stands allayed and has become infructuous, for the time being,‚Äù the court said.

08-07-2020||Vijay Mohan||Red tape leaves IAF‚Äôs Kargil heavyweight, Mi-26, out of LAC action||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 8Over 20 years ago in India‚Äôs last border conflict, the IAF‚Äôs Mi-26 heavy-lift helicopter had played a key role in the military build-up along the Line of Control (LoC) to evict Pakistani intruders, but during the current stand-off with Chinese troops on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) they have remained on ground as the overhaul of the fleet has been delayed for years.The IAF has three Soviet-origin Mi-26s, the world‚Äôs largest helicopter, that are based with No 126 Helicopter Unit at Chandigarh, the same outfit that operates the newly inducted US-made CH-47 Chinook heavy-lift helicopter.During the 1999 Kargil conflict, that was fought between mid-May to July-end, the Mi-26s had airlifted and positioned artillery guns, including the Bofors howitzers, which were instrumental in neutralising enemy bunkers, to strategic positions. In addition, they had also ferried troops and heavy equipment to the frontline.According to IAF officers, the Mi-26 can lift up to 20 tonnes of load or accommodate 82 troops. ‚ÄúA Bofors gun that weighs 11,700 kg cannot be airlifted or tactically re-deployed by any other helicopter in a single sortie,‚Äù an IAF officer said. ‚ÄúSimilarly, there is no other alternative to rapidly position trucks, fuel bowsers, specialist vehicles, bulldozers and construction equipment in remote areas,‚Äù he added.If build-up of heavy fire support is needed in the mountains, the Chinooks will be able to airlift only the new 155 mm ultra-light howitzers, which weigh 4,200 kg and of which 25-30 are reported to be in service so far.The Chinooks, which were inducted in 2019,¬†currently make up the IAF‚Äôs vertical heavy lift component, but their payload capacity is about half that of the Mi-26 and it cannot singularly airlift heavier equipment like the Bofors or a truck. Last year, in its report on capital acquisitions by the IAF, the Comptroller and Auditor General had made some critical observations on the selection process between the Mi-26 and Chinook.In service with the IAF since 1986, the first Mi-26 was grounded in 2013, followed by the second in 2014 on expiry of their stipulated technical life. The third, though still fly-worthy, has remained non-operational since 2017, IAF sources said. They are required to be ferried to Russia for overhaul. The IAF set into motion the process to give a fresh lease of life to these grounded flying machines about four years ago but the plans remain mired in bureaucratic machinery.Ideally, the first overhauled helicopter should have been back in service about five years ago, sources said, but apparently financial issues and some observations by officials in the Ministry of Defence have held up the overhaul process.The IAF expects each helicopter to take 10-12 months for being returned to fly-worthy state. This would involve non-destructive analysis of the airframe, engine components and other systems to assess their integrity, replacement of certain parts and refurbishment of the flight deck and fuselage. The overhauled machines would be expected to continue serving for another 15-20 years.The IAF had initially projected a requirement for six Mi-26s, but four were procured from the erstwhile Soviet Union. One was lost in a freak incident at Chandigarh in 1998, when it toppled over during a storm. It was replaced by a new helicopter in October 2002. In 2010 another Mi-26 crashed near Jammu while taking off.Though expensive to maintain, the Mi-26s have performed yeoman‚Äôs service both during military operations as well as in aid to civil authorities during natural calamities. Besides air maintenance of forward posts, they have also airlifted heavy equipment and construction machinery for civilian infrastructure development projects.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/red-tape-leaves-iafs-kargil-heavyweight-mi-26-out-of-lac-action-110143

08-07-2020||Washington||Hydroxychloroquine has become politicised in US but India uses it widely: White House official||The use of hydroxychloroquine to treat coronavirus patients has become highly politicised in the US but it is used widely in India, a top White House official has said, asserting the latest research which showed that the anti-malarial drug is highly effective in the early stages of Covid-19.‚ÄúIt's the politicisation of this medicine by the mainstream media and portions of the medical community that somehow made this a battle between President (Donald) Trump and them and created this undue fear and hysteria over a drug, a medicine that has been used for over 60 years relatively safely and is regularly prescribed to pregnant women if they are going to a malaria zone,‚Äù White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy Director Peter Navarro told reporters.‚ÄúThe idea that this is a dangerous drug is just silly, but if you ask the American people based on the media's coverage of it, that is kind of the state of play right now,‚Äù he said.Navarro said a day earlier four doctors at the Detroit Hospital System filed a request for emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine. The request was for three things.‚ÄúOne, for early treatment use in a hospital setting. Number two, treatment between a doctor and his patient in an outpatient setting. Three, not just as a therapeutic but also as a possible prophylaxis for preventative use,‚Äù he said.This request to the FDA comes on the heels of the publication of their study in the Journal of Infectious Diseases last week that showed an astonishing 50 per cent reduction in the mortality rate for patients taking hydroxychloroquine, Navarro said.‚ÄúGive hydroxy a chance, and please don't contribute to hydroxy hysteria because if it's prescribed under the supervision of a doctor, the odds that it can harm you are way, way smaller than the odds that it can help you,‚Äù Navarro said.‚ÄúThis has become highly politicised, but India uses this widely for prophylaxis. There are a number of studies which point to this actually working,‚Äù Navarro said.The official said if he were to show any kind of symptoms, he would first ask his doctor whether hydroxychloroquine is appropriate. ‚ÄúAnd then I wouldn't hesitate to take it,‚Äù he said.He said if one looks at the 14-day arc of the virus from the beginning of symptoms, the first seven days are critical: when a person may have fever, dry cough, possibly a profound sense of fatigue.‚ÄúAt that point, your lungs are still intact, and the virus is not appreciably spread to the rest of your organs. Hydroxychloroquine, based on the science in articles like the one that originally appeared in 2005 in the Journal of Virology, works in a therapeutic way by raising the alkalinity of your cells which slows the replication of the virus and also can kill the virus,‚Äù he said.It also has an anti-inflammatory effect, which is why it is used for rheumatoid arthritis, and the drug can, therefore, also help manage what is called the cytokine storm, he said.

However, when the victim refused to do so, Rajni threatened her and let her dog loose on Sapna, according to the First Information Report (FIR)."On Thursday, a woman lodged a complaint where she stated that one Rajni provoked her dog to bite her when she went to ask for her dues. On her complaint, a case under sections 289 (negligent conduct with respect to animal) and 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered and the accused has been arrested," Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said.When she was screaming, Rajni asked her not to shout as the people would gather after hearing her cry.The victim was rushed to Madan Mohan Malaviya Hospital from where she was referred to Safdarjung Hospital, the FIR stated."I received 15 stiches on my face and neck. I have no idea why she refused to clear my dues," the victim said.Sapna said that she approached an NGO and MLA Somnath Bharti who helped her to submit a written complaint at Malviya Nagar police station on July 2.

An under-construction wall of the temple was demolished, though the Pakistani authorities had earlier approved the building plan for the Lord Krishna temple, of what was going to be the first temple in Islamabad.Mehbooba lashed out at the Pakistan government for this act.Mufti, whose secular credentials have often been challenged for her stand on preserving Article 370 and maintaining the Muslim-majority character of the erstwhile state of J&K, said while the opening of the Kartarpur corridor was appreciated, this move was ‚Äúregressive‚Äù.Her slamming Pakistan in public domain is significant for after the BJP had withdrawn support to her government in June 2018, she was dubbed as a sympathiser of Pakistan by her former ally.The PDP and BJP had formed the government for a little over three years, starting with March 1, 2015, first under Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and later under Mehbooba Mufti in the chair of the Chief Minister.The PDP chief continues to be under the PSA detention, though she was shifted to her residence on April 7 in the times of the peaking of coronavirus in the Kashmir valley.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mehbooba-mufti-slams-pak-for-stopping-temple-work-110040

PTIMeadows‚Äô statement of solidarity follows US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week stating that China‚Äôs ‚Äúdeadly‚Äù confrontation with India was one of the reasons for the Pentagon to reduce its defence commitments in Europe and look at countering emerging threats posed by China in the Asia-Pacific.After India, US may ban TikTokTaking a cue from India, the US is looking at banning Chinese app TikTok, said US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Pompeo said TikTok would be banned along with other Chinese apps. He had lauded India‚Äôs ban on 59 Chinese apps. TNSPompeo has also touched base with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar in private as the US seeks to position itself as a useful ally for New Delhi in its border standoff with China.India has turned down mediation offers from US President Donald Trump and instead ordered military equipment worth Rs 40,000 crore from Russia. As opposed to Russia‚Äôs approach of trying to keep India-China cooperation alive in regional fora, the US official said: ‚ÄúThe message is clear. We‚Äôre not going to stand by and let China or anyone else take the reins in terms of being the most powerful, dominant force, whether it‚Äôs in that region or over here.‚ÄùCancel Xi visit: Japan ruling partyJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe‚Äôs ruling party has adopted a resolution urging the government to cancel a visit to Japan¬†by Chinese President Xi Jinping following the implementation of a new national¬†security law for Hong Kong.

08-07-2020||New Delhi||Mistrust as only one retreat step okayed||A 3-km buffer zone between troops of India and China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh has raised fresh questions even as it is being implemented as a temporary measure.Buffer zone dynamicsA 3-km buffer zone (1.5 km by each side) is being worked out along the LAC in Galwan, Hot Springs and Pangong TsoFor now, no patrolling will be carried out by either army in the buffer zonePatrolling will be allowed to both sides after the 3-step disengagement process is complete, which may take monthsA buffer zone of 1.5 km on each side bars patrolling by troops, meaning the Indian Army for now will not patrol the areas along the LAC which it once did. According to the agreement, patrolling will be allowed only when the entire three-step disengagement process is completed, and that might take many months. By then, winter will set in and snow will make it impossible to patrol some of the routes like Patrolling Point (PP)-14, PP-15 and PP-17A.Mistrust continues to persist as the People‚Äôs Liberation Army (PLA) of China, at successive meetings conducted by Lt General-level commanders, has agreed to only the first step of pulling back troops from the friction areas along the LAC. The first step will be reviewed after two weeks. The PLA is yet to agree to a timeline for the second step, which includes pulling back the war-like stores ‚Äî long-range guns, rockets, tanks ‚Äî from the LAC. For that another round of meetings is to be conducted, meaning as of now there is no deadline for the second and third steps of the disengagement process.Some of the disputes at Galwan and the Gogra-Hot Springs area are due to fresh claims being made by China. Earlier, there was no dispute about the LAC alignment in Galwan, as India ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù the Chinese claim line proposed in 1960 by its premier Zhou Enlai. China‚Äôs claim in June on the entire Galwan valley has been debunked by India. The LAC alignment at Gogra- Hot Springs is disputed and India does not accept China‚Äôs claims. At Pangong Tso, China is exercising claim over Finger-4, while India claims several kilometres east of it till Finger- 8. The LAC was drawn at Finger-8 as per China‚Äôs own claim in 1960.An official said an ideal situation would be to have a buffer zone as per the April 2020 position. Another official recalled that the 2014 standoff at Chumur in south-eastern Ladakh had ended with a no-patrolling zone. It was created temporarily for a few weeks to reduce friction.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mistrust-as-only-one-retreat-step-okayed-109977
