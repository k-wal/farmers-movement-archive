He will get possession of the bungalow once the Congress leader vacates it,” the official said.Sources said Baluni had made a request for a change of his residence on health grounds. He was treated for cancer sometime ago.Though he has recovered, he has been advised to follow a number of precautions. His current residence was deemed not fully suitable for him, they said.The government had in November last year replaced the Special Protection Group (SPG) cover of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her children Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, with Z-plus security by the CRPF.The ministry official had said that the Congress general secretary, who is in-charge of party affairs in Uttar Pradesh, had been allotted the bungalow on February 21, 1997 as she was an SPG protectee.The Z-plus security does not entail such a facility and she has to vacate the bungalow in Lutyens’ Delhi.

It was caused by an H1N1 virus with genes of avian origin. Although there is no universal consensus regarding where the virus originated, it spread worldwide during 1918-1919,” according to the Centre for Diseases Control (CDC) in the US.A family member of the centenarian man, who did not wish to be named, said: “At his age of 106, he has defeated coronavirus, and he was a kid during the Spanish Flu. He’s a corona warrior, and he’s doing fine now.”According to experts, the situation during the Spanish Flu pandemic was very similar to the current COVID-19 situation, with directions issued on social distancing, stay-at-home orders and use of masks bring prescribed.In the US, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 6,75,000 deaths occurred in America, the CDC said.According to a World Health Organisation (WHO) report, the pandemic of 1918-1919 called the Spanish Flu was particularly virulent, and killed an estimated 40 million people worldwide.In India, the disease is believed to have been brought in by the soldiers returning from World War I conflicts.The first cases of Spanish Flu were reported in areas which are major ports of entry, such as Mumbai (then Bombay), Kolkata (Calcutta), Delhi and Chennai (Madras), where a large number of people returned from abroad.The casualty count in India from the Spanish Flu is believed to be nearly one-fifth of the entire fatalities in the world, though the statistics for mortality in India are too wide-ranging and debatable.Doctors at RGSSH were amazed to see the recovery of this centenarian patient from the novel coronavirus, even though he was highly vulnerable to the infection.“We don’t know whether he was affected by the Spanish Flu or not. We haven’t seen much documentation on the situation back then as far as Delhi is concerned, but very few hospitals were there at that time. It is amazing this 106-year-old showed the will power to survive,” a senior doctor, who monitored his situation, said.But what is more interesting is that he recovered faster than his son. So, he lived through the Spanish Flu and now survived COVID-19. Hence, he lived through two pandemics, he said.“RGSSH has treated more than 1,000 COVID-19 patients so far, and on Monday it is marking the milestone with a symbolic event where Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, his deputy Manish Sisodia and Heath Minister Satyendar Jain are slated to participate,” hospital authorities said.Delhi recorded 2,244 fresh coronavirus cases on Sunday, taking the tally in the city to 99,444, while the death toll from the disease mounted to 3,067, authorities said.The national capital, at present is the worst-hit city in the country, from the pandemic.According to the Sunday bulletin, 71,339 patients have recovered, been discharged or migrated so far.

Putting Indian lives at risk. 2. Ensuring public money is used to buy sub-standard products.”He also tagged a news report about a private firm providing substandard ventilators, procured using the PM CARES Fund.#PMCares opacity is:1. Putting Indian lives at risk.2. Ensuring public money is used to buy sub-standard products.#BJPfailsCoronaFighthttps://t.co/6lIAPH0SJL  The Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM CARES) Fund was set up in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala alleged a “scam” in the purchase of ventilators.“The ‘Ventilators’ Scam! Out of Rs 2,000 crore allocated for 50,000 ventilators, only 1,340 ventilators delivered till 23rd June. No open tendering. Inferior Quality. Purchase Price of Rs 4 Lakh instead of the quoted price of Rs 1.5 Lakh per ventilator,” he said in a tweet.The “Ventilators” Scam!1. Out of Rs2,000 CR allocated for 50,000 ventilators, only 1,340 ventilators delivered till 23rd June.2. No open tendering.3. Inferior Quality.3. Purchase Price of Rs4 Lakh instead of quoted price of Rs1.5 Lakh per ventilator.https://t.co/uHCkN9UVeU  At a virtual press conference, Congress spokesperson Gaurav Vallabh expressed concern over the rise in coronavirus infections in the country and accused the government of “wasting time” by not utilising the lockdown period to ramp up the health infrastructure.He also questioned the government why only 1,340 ventilators could be procured till June 22 whereas it had placed an order for 50,000 on March 31.He said the actual procurement is against the claim made by BJP president JP Nadda that the country would have 60,000 ventilators by June-end.Vallabh also alleged, “confusion and delay” in ordering ventilators, “financial impropriety” and lack of transparency in spending PM-CARES fund, and supply of “substandard” ventilators.With a record single-day surge of 24,850 coronavirus infections and 613 fatalities, India’s COVID-19 caseload zoomed to 6,73,165, while the death toll due to the disease climbed to 19,268 on Sunday, according to the Union Health Ministry.With this, the country has recorded over 20,000 cases of the infection for the third consecutive day.According to the Johns Hopkins University, which has been compiling COVID-19 data from all over the world, India is the fourth worst-hit nation by the pandemic after the US, Brazil and Russia and at the eighth position in terms of the death toll due to the disease.“The way the corona cases in the country are rising, it is worrisome. I pray that the peak comes soon and this country is freed from the virus,” the Congress spokesperson said.“Lockdown was a pause button and it should have been used to ramp up health infrastructure. But the government has wasted time and has indulged in mismanagement in procuring ventilators. As per the government, only 1,340 ventilators have been procured till June 22, whereas the BJP chief claimed in a virtual rally that the country will have 60,000 ventilators by June-end. Why so few ventilators have been procured in more than 2.5 months. Who is responsible?” he asked.The Congress leader also said Rs 2,000 crore was allocated from the PM-CARES fund for procuring 50,000 ventilators with each costing around Rs 4 lakh, whereas a company was supplying ventilators to the government at Rs 1.5 lakh only.“Does the PM-CARES order of 50,000 ventilators include 40,000 ordered by the government earlier. Where has the PM-CARES money gone and why is there an abnormal delay in procuring them.... Has PM-CARES opted for open tendering to ensure transparency in government procurement? The PM-CARES funds are also public funds,” he said.Alleging that substandard material and ventilators are being procured by the government from some private players, Vallabh asked: “Why the government is compromising with the health of people by bringing substandard material.”The opposition leader said in the interest of people who are struggling for their health, the government should answer the questions raised by Congress.He said neither was the government answering questions on the border tussle with China nor was it coming out with facts on the COVID-19 pandemic.“The Prime Minister and the Health Minister should reply to these questions raised by us in the interest of the health of the people of the country,” he said.

One is space policy and (the other) Space Activities Bill... both are final stages,” Sivan told PTI.Last month, the government announced a major reform in India’s space arena by allowing the private sector to carry out space activities like building rockets, satellites and providing launch services.The ISRO chairman said very soon a system would be put in place for approval that will enable these activities to happen without any hindrance.The space policy and the Space Activities Bill will help address legal issues in this strategic sector.Last month, during an online briefing, Sivan had said a new Navigation Policy is also being proposed and suitable changes in Remote Sensing Data Policy, as well as SATCOM policy, are also on the anvil.These changes are aimed at aligning these policies to an open and inclusive space sector, Sivan had said.

05-07-2020||Lucknow||UP's Most Wanted Vikas Dubey didn't figure in list of criminals||The political connections of Vikas Dubey, the main accused in the killing of eight police personnel in Kanpur on Friday, were so strong that his name did not figure in the list of top ten criminals of the district even though he has 71 criminal cases registered against his name.His name also does not figure in the STF list of over 30 top criminals of the state that was released earlier this year. Kanpur SSP Dinesh Kumar said that he had been informed that the police team was going to arrest an accused with circle officer Bilhaur heading the operation.He admitted that he was not aware of Vikas Dubey's criminal antecedents at the time of the operation which went horribly wrong and led to the death of eight policemen.Dinesh Kumar, who took over as SSP Kanpur barely a few days ago, has now ordered that all lists of criminals be updated without delay.Vikas Dubey, till Friday, was just another name in the underworld of Uttar Pradesh. His 'stature' remained largely unknown to the people of the state even though he had heinous crime registered against his name. He was a quiet operator and, therefore, did not figure in the list of known mafias of the state.Dubey, in his early fifties, hit the headlines first in 2001 when he killed BJP leader Santosh Shukla inside the Shivli police station in Kanpur. Shukla was minister of state in the UP government when he was killed. However, Dubey was later acquitted by a session court for want of evidence against him. As per the reports, even policemen had refused to testify against him in the court.Dubey is also accused of planning his cousin brother Anurag's murder while being inside Mati jail in 2018. He was one of the four accused named by Anurag's wife. After this, he chose the path of crime that would, one day, take him closer to politics.Dubey, a resident of Bikru village in Kanpur, was apparently emboldened by his acquittal, and he started off by getting together a group of youth and set up his own gang. As the cases of robbery, kidnapping, and murders mounted against him, Vikas made sure that his clout also grew in proportion.The need of local politicians to seek his help in elections brought him closer to the people in power. The local MPs and MLAs ensured that Vikas was kept in good humour because his influence would help them win elections.His political mentors ensured that he had an easy access to other politicians. He even managed to win the nagar panchayat elections in 2015. As his mentors changed loyalties and parties, so did Vikas. Dubey was frequently seen in the Vidhan Bhawan complex when the assembly would be in session. He was seen in the company of politicians, across the political spectrum.From BSP, he went to SP and was even inching closer to the BJP in recent months. A photograph of a poster in which Vikas is seen campaigning for his wife, Richa Dubey, on the Samajwadi Party banner, has been going viral on the social media. His photograph with Uttar Pradesh Law Minister Brijesh Pathak, are also announcing his proximity to the politician. According to reliable sources, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed intelligence agencies to submit a list of all politicians, police personnel, officers and others who were patronizing Vikas Dubey.The diktat comes after photographs of the gangster with various political leaders started going viral on the social media.In the past years, Dubey gradually strengthened his hold in the Bilhaur, Shivrajpur, Chaubepur, Rania areas of Kanpur. According to a source, Vikas Dubey was determined to make it big in the underworld and politics too. "He wanted to become a MLA and then an MP. He would often say that he would reach Parliament soon. He enjoyed considerable clout with local politicians and it was because of this that the police did not 'interfere' in his activities," said one who belongs to Bikru village.He said that Vikas had amassed a lot of property in the region and reportedly owned property in Lucknow and Noida too. He also had a fascination for latest weapons.His relations in the family, however, were said to be strained. His own mother has almost disowned him after Friday's incident and said that he deserved to die. His younger brother has also disowned him.A team of officials visited the Krishna Nagar residence of Vikas Dubey. His brother's family had left the house which was locked. A LDA official said: "We went to the house because the plan of the same is not approved by the LDA. We will be sending a notice to the owners and will then demolished the unauthorised construction."The state government, on Saturday, had razed the house of the gangster in Bikru village where eight police personnel had been shot dead on Friday.

05-07-2020||Hyderabad||Top Hyderabad jeweller's death from COVID-19 sends a fresh wave of panic||The death of two city jewellers from coronavirus has sent panic among their fellow jewellers and some politicians in the city.A 63-year-old diamond jeweller who had organised the party for his relatives and friends two weeks ago succumbed on Friday. One of his guests, another city jeweller, had died earlier.A hundred people, mostly jewellers from Telangana Jeweller Association but also some politicians, were part of the celebrations held despite a ban on public congregation in the wake of the coronavirus public health crisis.What’s more astounding is that health authorities said that a leading politician from the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi and some 11 other people who attended the party have since tested positive, and are undergoing treatment at different hospitals in the state.      The incident was kept a close-guarded secret, until, that is, the two jewellers.Sources in the Telangana Health Department said three days after the party, a jeweller who was among the guests developed COVID-19 symptoms and was admitted to a private hospital, where he tested positive. The host too developed coronavirus symptoms and died last week.The development has since sent authorities scrambling to track down the guests and put them under surveillance.Hyderabad has been witnessing a spurt in COVID-19 cases: the city’s infections currently stand at 22,312---about 10,487 of which are active. As of Saturday, Greater Hyderabad alone accounted for 1,572 of these cases while Telangana got 1,850 new cases.Telangana Health Minister Etela Rajender said he was dismayed at the drastic rise in COVID-19 cases, blaming the rise on people unwilling to follow precautions. “Families are hosting birthday parties, organising engagement functions, or getting together at homes to celebrate a new birth. Amidst all this it just takes one to become a super spreader, wasting the entire efforts of the government,” he said.Director of Public Health and Family Welfare, G. Srinivas Rao said many of those who have turned COVID-19 positive after attending the birthday bash were undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital, Fever Hospital, King Koti Hospital and Chest Hospital--- all four Hyderabad.This is not first time such an event has led to an administrative nightmare---just a day before, a police constable who distributed sweets after the birth of a son also tested positive, as did the 12 recipients of the sweets.Rao said: “These are the super-spreaders due to which the number of positive cases has gone up in Hyderabad. Despite so much publicity, some people just refuse to follow the rules. Birthday parties, family gatherings to celebrate a birth, or youths getting together to welcome a foreign returnee are proving to be hotspots of coronavirus spread. Asymptomatic persons attending huge gatherings like this are spreading the infection”.Meanwhile, neighbouring Andhra Pradesh too has been seeing a spurt of cases, with the state reporting 998 positive cases today. The latest update takes the cumulative tally of COVID-19 cases to 18,697, which include cases detected among returnees from other states and foreign countries.The state government said 10,043 affected persons are currently being treated in hospitals and the state recorded 14 deaths in the past 24 hours.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/top-hyderabad-jewellers-death-from-covid-19-sends-a-fresh-wave-of-panic-108918

05-07-2020||New Delhi||India, Pakistan temperatures rise over Gilgit||The war of words between India and Pakistan over Gilgit-Baltistan has heated up at a time of heightened tensions on the LAC amid calls in New Delhi to move beyond mere statements. Pakistan plans to hold elections in Gilgit-Baltistan next month, which India has opposed saying that it’s a part of India and that Islamabad must return the area.The region is also an issue of dispute with China which has built the Karakoram highway that allows Pakistan to easily access military supplies via land. The highway and Pakistani occupation of Gilgit-Baltistan denies India land access Central Asia. India, seriously viewing the impending elections, had called in a Pakistani diplomat to protest against the Pakistan Supreme Court’s order in “Gilgit-Baltistan”.Recently, National Security Advisory Board member Tilak Devasher urged New Delhi to move beyond the cosmetic exercise of including Gilgit-Baltistan in its weather bulletin. — TNSSTRATEGIC IMPORTANCEWork at Pak Hindu temple site haltedIslamabad: The authorities in Islamabad have stopped construction at the site of the first Hindu temple in the city for not having an approved building plan, according to a media report.

ICMR’s process is exactly in accordance with the globally accepted norms to fast-track the vaccine development for diseases of pandemic potential, wherein human and animal trials can continue in parallel,” ICMR said about COVAXIN, an inactivated vaccine it has developed in partnership with Bharat Biotech International Limited.“The letter by the DG-ICMR to investigators of the clinical trial sites was meant to cut unnecessary red tape without bypassing any necessary process and to speed up recruitment of participants,” said the council.“While issues raised in public domain by commentators are welcome, the best of India’s medical professionals and research scientists should not be second-guessed for their professionalism,” the council said.Meanwhile, the Covid case count on Saturday reached 6,48,315 on the back of record spike of 22,771 infections. With 442 deaths in 24 hours, the total number of fatalities reached 18,655. The government, meanwhile, revised national clinical management protocol for Covid-19, reducing the overall dose of antiviral Remdesivir to be given to moderately ill patients from six days to five days.Flights to Kolkata suspended for 2 weeksKolkata: Flights to Kolkata from six major cities, including Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, will remain suspended for two weeks in view of the spurt in Covid cases in the state.

Follow raj dharma. Late PM Pt Jawaharlal Nehru had in 1959 rejected the Chinese proposal of the LAC. That is what Pt Nehru did when India did not have a modern Army. The window to ferry material by the two road routes — via Manali and Srinagar — will shut due to snow in four months i.e. by October-end.While Zoji La (11,500 feet) on the Srinagar route may be closed for traffic by October-end or early November, the Rohtang Pass (13,000 feet) on the Manali route may see snow before that, holding back traffic. Other high passes between Rohtang and Leh may also force an early closure.Once the passes close, the only option is to fly out supplies from the logistics hub in Chandigarh. But even these flights have time restrictions. Planes have to fly out of Leh before noon as a rise in temperature coupled with rarefied oxygen affect engine performance.Apart from a full-fledged Army division (some 16,000 troops) in Ladakh, two additional divisions have been rushed in since May and these now from an arc across the 826-km LAC there.The regiments that have moved up can survive on own stocks of rations, etc. for a few weeks. They have tents besides pre-fabricated structures and other accommodations at several locations.The winter stocking for Ladakh is already under way, done by hundreds of private trucks carrying supplies from the plains. There is no shortage of food stocks or special high-altitude rations. Even the cold weather clothing can be transported as required. The troops are deployed at altitudes in excess of 14,000 feet where night temperatures can dip to minus 15°C in October-end.In New Delhi, the calculations will factor in the number of troops and their needs such as food, special clothing, shoes, etc. A decision will have to be taken by the Army within the next few weeks.The logistics support will involve procuring supplies and getting these to the troops at their place of deployment. The terrain on the Indian side is such that just to cross over from Leh to the areas of Daulat Beg Oldie, Depsang, Galwan, Pangong Tso, Hot Springs and Tangtse, the supplies will have to be carried either across Khardung La (18,300 feet) or Chang La (17,590 feet).Adequate number of snow or arctic tents can be provided to troops at higher altitudes.Meanwhile, the Indian Army today termed as “malicious and unsubstantiated” criticism in some quarters about a medical facility in a military hospital in Leh where PM Narendra Modi interacted with soldiers injured in the Galwan valley clashes on Friday. In a statement, the Army said “it is unfortunate that aspersions are being cast on how our brave armed forces are treated. The armed forces give the best possible treatment to their personnel”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/forces-stocking-up-on-winter-supplies-108633
