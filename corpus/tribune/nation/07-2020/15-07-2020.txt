15-07-2020||New Delhi||Sino-India border tensions: EU says it supports efforts to maintain dialogue channel for peaceful solution||Prime Minister Narendra Modi informed about the developments on the Sino-India border during the India-EU summit, the European Council president said on Wednesday, asserting that the 27-member bloc supports all efforts to maintain a channel of dialogue for peaceful solution.European Council President Charles Michel made the remarks after the 15th EU-India summit. While the Indian side was led by Prime Minister Modi, the European Union delegation was headed by Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen at the virtual summit.Asked at a press conference whether Chinese aggressiveness and the recent incident at the Sino-India border was discussed, Michel answered in the affirmative.“Probably you know, a few weeks ago, we had a video conference summit with Chinese authorities. The relationship between the EU and China is complex. We need to tackle different issues and topics. And indeed we are in favour of a peaceful solution,” Michel said.“Prime Minister Modi had the occasion also to inform us about the latest developments regarding this incident with China and we support all the efforts in order to maintain a channel of dialogue in order to find peaceful solutions,” he said.Indian and Chinese troops were locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for over eight weeks since May 5.The tension escalated manifold after the violent clashes in Galwan Valley in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed.However, following a series of diplomatic and military talks, the two sides began a mutual disengagement process on July 6 and withdrew troops from most of the friction points.On whether India is more strategic for the European Union than China, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said China and India were both important to the bloc, but both were very different.“If you look at the topics we have with China and with India—common interest is the fight against climate change. China and India are very important if you want to be successful in the fight against climate change,” she said.She said the EU has strong trade relations with both countries, but in very different fields.“The difference is indeed that we share with India that we are democracies. We can relate to being democracies and defending our values,” she said at the press conference.Asked if the issue of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the protests against the legislation were discussed, Michel said, “In the EU Parliament, it was an important topic in the last few months. We also had the occasion today to raise this topic with the prime minister.” “We trust the Indian institutions. We understand that the Supreme Court will have a role to play in order to assess this legislation,” he said.He said the two sides have resolved to continue a strong dialogue on the question of human rights which are important for both India and the EU.

15-07-2020||Lucknow/Kanpur||Kanpur lab technician untraced amid row over ransom; police to probe SHO, his team||A Kanpur lab technician remained untraced on Wednesday amid allegations that a Rs 30 lakh ransom was paid by his family in the presence of police.A police spokesperson said in Kanpur that a departmental inquiry was ordered against the Station House Officer, Barra, and his team who allegedly asked S Yadav’s family to arrange the money.S Yadav’s family said they did not pay any ransom, but later they claimed they did, but had to change their statement under police pressure.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also waded in, slamming the Yogi Adityanath government over law and order situation in the state.S Yadav’s family had on Monday claimed he was abducted on June 22, and they paid the ransom money, but his captors did not free him. They said they threw a bag containing the money on a railway track, as asked.However, Yadav’s sister Ruchi told reporters in Kanpur on Wednesday, “There was no money in the bag. We talked about the money as someone suggested us to do so. We were upset as my brother could not be traced. I hope police will trace him soon.”         But, later in the day, Ruchi said she made the U-turn under duress.She also named a crime branch official, who she alleged visited her home and convinced her to say that no ransom was paid.“He said ‘Ruchi your brother can be in danger if you give this statement. He (abductor) might feel belittled and could do something to your brother. What will you do then? You want your brother or this media attention!’ I agreed to him after he said so. He then recorded a video of my statement and made it viral. I said all this (that we did not pay Rs 30 lakh) under his pressure,” she claimed.Asked specifically whether there was money in the bag, she said, “Yes there was.”         She also claimed her father, cousin brother, his friends and a police team allegedly carried the money bag to hand it over.“The SSP has assured us that my brother will be found in four days,” she claimed.An FIR in the abduction case has been registered at Barra police station in Kanpur.           Superintendent of Police, South, Aprana Gupta said, “The claim of payment of Rs 30 lakh is not true. When they were asked about the source of money, they could not give satisfactory answers. As the family is disturbed, we have adopted a sympathetic attitude towards them. Police teams are working to trace the missing man.” But Ruchi said, “The day my brother returns, I will tell where we arranged the money from. The issue now is that I want my brother back.”                 A police spokesperson said in Kanpur that Circle Officer (Babupurwa), Alok Singh, has been asked to probe the role of the SHO and his team and submit a report to the SSP at the earliest.                              “If inquiry findings proved them guilty, they will be punished severely,” the spokesperson added.Alok Singh told the PTI that the inquiry has been initiated against the police personnel. “The charges would be probed properly and findings submitted to the SSP very soon.”                On Tuesday, SSP, Kanpur, Dinesh Kumar P had said, “I am taking cognisance of media report in which payment of ransom of Rs 30 lakh has come to the fore. I am talking to the aggrieved family. If anyone is wrong, they will be punished.”                              Citing the kidnapping case, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra flayed the Yogi Adityanath government over the alleged deteriorating law and order situation in Uttar Pradesh.                In a Facebook post, she claimed a young man was kidnapped by miscreants in Kanpur and his family was asked for a ransom for his release.“The family collected Rs 30 lakh by selling their house and wedding jewellery. At the behest of the police, the family handed over the bag full of money to the kidnappers and the police could neither catch the miscreants, nor their son could be freed,” she said.The family members of the kidnapped man are distraught, the Congress general secretary in-charge UP East added.“This is a case from Kanpur where such a big incident had taken place a few days ago. Now you can imagine the state of law and order in UP,” Gandhi said, referring to the gangster Vikas Dubey case.Attacking the BJP government over the issue, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav had earlier asked as to who was giving patronage to the criminals who did not even fear the police and fled with the ransom money.“It seems morality of the BJP government has also been kidnapped,” he had said in a tweet in Hindi.

15-07-2020||Patna||Legal fraternity condemns arrest of gang-rape victim in Bihar||Lawyers from across the country on Wednesday denounced the arrest of an alleged gang-rape victim in north Bihar who got booked following a ruckus inside the court premises where she had appeared to get her statement recorded before a magistrate.In a letter to the chief justice and other judges of the Patna High Court, 376 advocates voiced concern over the manner in which the 22-year-old woman and two social workers accompanying her at a court in Araria district were recently remanded in judicial custody and sent to a jail in Dalsinghsarai, about 240 km away.The letter, signatories to which include luminaries like Indira Jaisingh, Prashant Bhushan and Vrinda Grover, expressed dismay that when the victim appeared before the magistrate on July 10, the latter took her disoriented state of mind as a personal affront.According to Ashish Ranjan Jha, the secretary of Jan Jagran Shakti Sansthan, the Araria-based social organisation to which the victim’s jailed caregivers belonged, the sexual assault took place on July 6.She had gone out of her home to learn how to ride a motorcycle from an acquaintance. Four of his friends caught hold of her, while the acquaintance ran away, and raped her, as per the FIR she lodged a day later, Jha told PTI over the phone.She was spotted by workers of the Sansthan who first took her home, but noticing that her family members were unsympathetic, agreed to take her along and look after her while she fought for justice.Our workers Kalyani Badola and Tanmay Nivedita—accompanied the victim on July 10 when she appeared before the magistrate. Some misunderstanding and communication gap appears to have led to the unfortunate situation thereafter, said Jha.According to police sources, in the FIR lodged by a court staff against the trio, the victim had grown agitated upon being asked to sign a transcript of the statement and insisted that Kalyani and Nivedita be called in for a perusal of the document.Later, the social workers too approached the magistrates staff and requested that they be shown a copy of her statement which was turned down citing “legal restrictions” which led to an altercation.Miffed over the din, the magistrate is said to have directed a member of the court staff to lodge an FIR against them for contempt of court and under IPC sections for obstructing a public servant from discharge of duty.A day later, the order remanding them in judicial custody was passed and they were sent off to the Dalsinghsarai jail in Samastipur district.We sought a legal remedy today when we tried to move an application before the district court only to learn that the premises have been ordered closed for the next seven days in view of the corona outbreak, Jha lamented.Meanwhile, the lawyers in their letter alleged that while reporting the matter local dailies ended up divulging details of the victim and that no COVID test was conducted even though she was raped by several strangers.Notably, Jha said the trio was sent off to the faraway prison because of a corona protocol under which not more than a specified number of people can be kept inside a jail. The reformatory in Araria could, thus, not accommodate them.We submit that even without going into the various versions of the event that will invariably be brought before your Lordships, there is a need to infuse the incident with some sensitivity and view it from that perspective, the letter said.It was the fourth day since the incident of gang-rape. The survivor was completely distraught and disoriented and totally dependent, emotionally, on her caregivers who were also exhausted looking after her. We respectfully submit that any perceived disrespect must be viewed from this perspective, it said.Terming the judicial custody awarded to the survivor and her caregivers excessive and harsh, the letter said the former’s extremely fragile emotional state and separation from her caregivers and incarceration will have an adverse effect on her health.It has also resulted in the case pertaining to gang-rape having been put on the backburner, while all attention is focused on the alleged contempt.We pray that your Lordships intervene into the matter as it displays a complete lack of sensitivity to a victim of violent sexual crime and to her caregivers, the lawyers said.

The incident took place on Tuesday.Opposition Congress slammed the use of force and demanded action against those responsible for the incident.“The (farm) land was reserved for a government model college. Rajkumar Ahirwar (38) and his wife Savitri (35) were working on the land. Gabbu Pardi, who had encroached on the land, had given them work,” said district collector S Vishwanathan.When officials asked them to vacate the field, they protested and drank pesticide at the behest of those who had encroached on the land, he claimed.The two also refused to go to hospital so the police had to use force to take them to hospital, the collector claimed.“Their condition is now stable,” Vishwanathan added.A purported video of the incident on social media showed the police hitting the man mercilessly with batons and his wife and others trying to save him.“A Dalit couple was mercilessly beaten up by the cops.what kind of jungle raj is this?” tweeted former chief minister Kamal Nath.“If it was related to government land, it (the issue) can be legally resolved...but beating him, his wife and a kid is not justified....stern action should be taken against those responsible for it,” the Congress leader said.

15-07-2020||Beijing||Talks between Chinese, Indian militaries reached ‘progress’ on further disengagement: Beijing||China on Wednesday said the fourth commander-level talks between Indian and Chinese militaries to ease tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh have achieved “progress” on promoting “further disengagement” of the border troops to de-escalate tensions.During the course of the intense and complex negotiations between senior commanders of the two armies that lasted nearly 15 hours, the Indian delegation apprised the Chinese People’s Liberation Army about the “red lines” and conveyed that the onus was largely on China to improve the overall situation in the region, government sources said in New Delhi.When asked for an update on Tuesday’s military-level talks, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a media briefing here that both sides achieved progress for promoting further disengagement of the border troops at the Western Sector of the China-India boundary.“Chinese and Indian border troops held the fourth round of commander-level talks on July 14. Building on the common understanding reached at the previous three rounds of commander-level talks and corresponding implementation work, the two sides achieved progress in further disengagement between border troops as well as easing the situation at the western sector of the China-India boundary.“We hope that India will work with China to implement our consensus with concrete actions and jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” Hua said.The Indian delegation was led by Lt Gen Harinder Singh, the commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, while the Chinese side was headed by the commander of the South Xinjiang military region Maj Gen Liu Lin.The Lt General-level talks took place days after implementation of the first phase of the disengagement process from the friction points.The PLA has already completed pulling back troops from Gogra, Hot Springs and Galwan Valley and significantly thinned down its presence in the ridgeline of Finger Four in the Pangong Tso area in the last one week as demanded by India.The Indian and Chinese armies were locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The tension escalated after the violent clashes in Galwan Valley in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/talks-between-chinese-indian-militaries-reached-progress-on-further-disengagement-beijing-113358
15-07-2020||New Delhi||Study predicts India's population to peak to 1.6 billion in 2048||Scientists have predicted that India's population may peak to about 1.6 billion in 2048, and decline by 32 per cent to around 1.09 billion in 2100, when it is also expected to be the world's most populous country.The analysis, published in the journal The Lancet, used data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, and applied novel models to project future global, regional, and national population for 183 countries, including India, US, China, and Japan, and their mortality, fertility, and migration rates.According to the researchers, including those from the University of Washington in the US, there may be dramatic declines in working age-populations in countries such as India and China, which they said may hamper economic growth and lead to shifts in global powers.They said the world could be multipolar at the end of this century, with India, Nigeria, China, and the US the dominant powers."This will truly be a new world, one we should be preparing for today," the scientists noted.According to the study, the numbers of working-age adults in India is projected to fall from 762 million in 2017 to around 578 million in 2100, compared to that of China where numbers of workers are estimated to decline from 950 million in 2017 to 357 million in 2100.It said India might be one of the few – if only – major power in Asia to protect its working-age population over the century."It is expected to surpass China's workforce population in the mid-2020s, rising up the GDP rankings from 7th to 3rd," the scientists noted in a statement to the press.Commenting on the research, Christopher Murray from the University of Washington, who led the research, said continued global population growth through the century was no longer the most likely trajectory for the world's population."This study provides governments of all countries an opportunity to start rethinking their policies on migration, workforces and economic development to address the challenges presented by demographic change," said Murray.Citing the study's limitations, the scientists said while they used the best available data, predictions were constrained by the quantity and quality of past data.They added that past trends were not always predictive of what would happen in future, and that some factors not included in the model could change the pace of fertility, mortality, or migration.According to the scientists the COVID-19 pandemic has affected local and national health systems throughout the world, and caused over half a million deaths.However, they said the excess deaths due to the pandemic were unlikely to significantly alter longer term forecasting trends of global population.

An official statement said the decision was taken considering the security environment prevailing along the Northern Borders and the need to strengthen the Armed Forces.The statement further stated that the decision will shrink the procurement timelines and ensure placement of orders within six months and commencement of deliveries within one year.Earlier, this month the DAC had accorded approval for capital acquisitions of various platforms and equipment worth Rs 38,900 crore approximately. Focused on indigenous design and development, these approvals included acquisitions amounting to Rs 31,130 crore from the Indian industry.Also, addressing the long felt need of the Indian Air Force to increase its fighter squadrons, the DAC had also approved the proposal for procurement of 21 MIG-29 fighter aircraft and upgrade of existing 59 Mig-29 aircraft and procurement of 12 additional Su-30 MKI fighters.While the MIG 29 procurement from Russia is estimated to cost Rs 7,418 crore, the Su-30 MKI will be procured from HAL at an estimated cost of Rs 10,730 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/armed-forces-get-special-powers-for-urgent-purchases-worth-rs-300-crore-113343
15-07-2020||Vijay Mohan||Condition of 10-year service for invalid pension to soldiers done away with||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 15In a major relief to disabled armed forces personnel, the government has taken a decision to sanction ‘Invalid Pension’ to those who are discharged from service with less than 10 years of service.This also removes the existing disparity between disability benefits being given to armed forces personnel and civilian government employees.Invalid pension is granted to the Armed Forces personnel who are invalided out of service on account of disability which is accepted as neither attributable to nor aggravated (NANA) by military service.Earlier, the minimum period of qualifying service actually rendered and required for invalid pension was 10 years or more. For less than 10 years qualifying service, only an invalid gratuity was admissible but no pension was paid.The orders will benefit those personnel who were in service on or after January 4, 2019 and have been thereafter invalided out of service on account of any bodily or mental infirmity that has made them permanently incapacitated from military service as well as civilian re-employment.While armed forces personnel required at least 10-year service for grant of invalid pension, no such the condition existed for civilian employees, including members of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs).“The abrogation of the 10-year service condition is perhaps the biggest reform in disability benefits since 1947,” Maj Navdeep Singh, a Chandigarh-based lawyer dealing with service matters said. “While the service of civilian Central government employees and the pension of CAPF personnel is protected under rules, there was no such benefit for armed forces personnel,” he added.The issue of the disadvantage being faced by armed forces personnel in this regard had also come under the judicial scanner. Last year, the Punjab and Haryana High Court had put the government on notice and stayed the discharge of a visually incapacitated soldier who was being invalided out. He had contended that either his service be protected of he be given pension.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/condition-of-10-year-service-for-invalid-pension-to-soldiers-done-away-with-113340

They visited the cancer hospital at Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, for treatment. After undergoing tests, the hospital authorities asked the family to arrange Rs 2 lakh for surgery. Since the amount was too huge for the family, they set out for home to arrange the money.They boarded an RTC bus. However, en route she developed breathing problems and collapsed in the bus.After boarding the bus her pain aggravated on the way and after struggling with severe pain. Suspecting her to be COVID-infected, fellow passengers and staff dragged her out of the bus and dumped on the road. Minutes later she breathed her last on the road.Ashappa then called his son-in-law and sarpanch of Keshtapur and informed them about the incident. Finally, an auto driver agreed to shift the body to their native village. Before cremation, a COVID test was done on the body which was found to be negative.This is the second incident of this nature within a month. Earlier, a 52-year-old asthma victim died when people kept away thinking he was corona-infected. The man begged people around him to shift him to hospital, but he had died before medical personnel in Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits could arrive on the spot.There is a fresh wave of fear in the Telugu states where the cases have a spurt in the past few days. Andhra Pradesh reported 2,412 fresh cases of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, taking the total cases in the state to 35,451, while 44 deaths have been reported in the last 24 hours.Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy held a review meeting on COVID-19 preventive measures last evening and has issued instruction saying action will be initiated against hospitals who deny treatment to COVID-19 patients. He has announced a financial aid of Rs 15,000 for the last rites of COVID-19 deceased.At the same time, Telangana has tied up with few private medical colleges that have offered free COVID-19 treatment to both confirmed and suspected patients. “This initiative has been taken to ensure there is no shortage of beds in any zone of the GHMC,” said Governor of Telangana Dr Tamilisai Soundararajan on Wednesday.Under this initiative, three private medical colleges — Mamataha, Malla Reddy and Kamineni institute — have been enlisted by the Public Health Sector officials.Congress shuts party officeWith the growing number of politicians testing positive and some even dying of COVID related complications, the Congress has shut down its party office in Hyderabad. Gandhi Bhavan will remain closed for a week. TPCC secretary G. Narendra Yadav died of Covid-19 at a hospital, here on Monday, becoming the second Congress leader to succumb to Covid-19 this month. He had attended party meetings at the Gandhi Bhavan in recent days. Earlier, former chairman of the Congress minority cell in undivided Andhra Pradesh, Mohammed Sirajuddin, died at a hospital, here on July 6.The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has started sanitisation of the building, located at Nampally in the heart of the city. The Covid-19 control room had been set up by TPCC chief Uttam Kumar Reddy to help the coronavirus infected in Hyderabad.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/woman-dies-after-being-pushed-out-of-bus-on-suspicion-of-being-covid-infected-113327
15-07-2020||New Delhi||IIT Delhi launches ‘Corosure’ claimed to be world’s most affordable diagnostic kit for Covid||Claimed to be the world’s most affordable diagnostic kit for coronavirus, a low-cost test kit developed by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) here was launched on Wednesday.According to IIT officials, the base price of the RT-PCR assay developed by IIT Delhi is Rs 399. Even after adding the RNA isolation and laboratory charges, the cost per test will go up to Rs 650 and will be considerably cheaper compared to currently available kits in the market. It can deliver results within three hours.HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ launched the test kit named “Corosure” which will now be available for use at authorised testing labs.“The Corosure Kit has been developed indigenously and is much cheaper than other kits. The country requires cheap and reliable testing for the country which can help control the pandemic. The kit has received ICMR approval with the highest score and DCGI approved with a very high sensitivity and specificity,” he said at the launch.Referring it to as world’s most affordable COVID-19 diagnostic kit, the HRD Minister said the innovation is a step towards “Make in India”.IIT Delhi, which became the first academic institute to get ICMR nod for a COVID-19 testing method, gave non-exclusive open licence to 10 companies for commercialising the test, but with a price rider of R 500 for the assay needed for testing.The kit Corosure has been commercialised by Newtech Medical Devices.According to the team at IIT Delhi, the current testing methods available are “probe-based”, while the one developed by them is a “probe-free” method, which reduces the testing cost without compromising on accuracy.Using comparative sequence analyses, the IIT Delhi team identified unique regions (short stretches of RNA sequences) in the COVID-19 and SARS COV-2 genome.“These unique regions are not present in other human coronaviruses providing an opportunity to specifically detect COVID-19,” Professor Vivekanandan Perumal, lead member of the team, had said.“Primer sets, targeting unique regions in the spike protein of COVID-19, were designed and tested using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The primers designed by the group specifically bind to regions conserved in over 200 fully sequenced COVID-19 genomes. The sensitivity of this in-house assay is comparable to that of commercially available kits,” Perumal added.

All airlines in India have taken cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts, LWP and firings of employees in order to conserve cash flow.For example, GoAir has put most of its employees on compulsory LWP since April.India resumed domestic passenger flights from May 25 after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus pandemic.However, the airlines have been allowed to operate only a maximum of 45 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights. Occupancy rate in Indian domestic flights has been around 50-60 per cent since May 25.Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23.The passenger demand for air travel will contract by 49 per cent in 2020 for Indian carriers in comparison to 2019 due to COVID-19 crisis, said global airlines body IATA on Monday.

15-07-2020||Mumbai||Sheena Bora murder: Special CBI court rejects Indrani Mukerjea’s bail plea||A special CBI court here on   Wednesday rejected the interim bail plea of Indrani Mukerjea, the prime accused in the Sheena Bora murder case.Mukerjea, who is currently lodged at the Byculla women’s jail in Mumbai, filed the plea last month in which she sought temporary release, citing the risk of contracting coronavirus.However, special CBI court Judge J C Jagdale rejected her interim bail plea on Wednesday.The court earlier also rejected her four regular bail applications filed on medical grounds, while another one moved on merits of the case is still pending.In her latest plea, Mukerjea had sought temporary bail for 45 days, citing the coronavirus outbreak and her medical history.She said in view of the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra, there is no certainty when the trial or hearing for bail (on merits of case) will begin.The plea also said she has been in judicial custody ever since her arrest in August 2015, and suffering from chronic ischemic changes in her brain arteries.The application also said she suffered from blackouts time and again and has been on medication.Thus, considering her medical history and guidelines issued by the high-powered committee, the court should grant interim bail to her, the application said.Sheena Bora (24) was allegedly strangled in a car by her mother Indrani Mukerjea, her driver Shyamvar Rai and Mukerjea’s former husband Sanjeev Khanna in April 2012. Her body was burnt in a forest in neighbouring Raigad district.Khanna is a co-accused in the case.Former media baron Peter Mukerjea was also later arrested for allegedly being part of the conspiracy. He is currently out on bail, which was granted by the Bombay High Court earlier this year.His 17-year-old marriage to Indrani Mukerjea ended during the period of incarceration as the two got divorced in October last year.

He was arrested in coordination with local police,” said Superintendent of Police (Bhopal South) Sai Krishna Thota.Thota, who is heading the special investigation team which is probing the case, said a team had been sent to Srinagar and Miyan was likely to be brought here by Thursday morning.Apart from a case of rape under the Indian Penal Code and offences under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), the police also invoked the Excise Act and Wildlife Act following seizure of liquor, an antler and bones of wild animals from his flats.Sections of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act were also invoked as two of the minor girls belong to these communities, the police said.“CDs, DVDs, pen drives and hard disks containing pornographic material were seized from five properties of Miyan in Bhopal and Indore in the last two days. These also include child pornographic content,” Thota told PTI.The complainants had told the police that Miyan used to show them porn videos, he said.The seized vehicles included an Audi and a Pajero, the SP said, adding that these vehicles were used to ferry girls to Miyan’s flats.One of the flats was also found to have a dance floor and a large bar, according to police sources.“Four minor girls and a woman have filed complaints of rape against Miyan. The latest complaint was lodged by a minor girl at Koh-e-Fiza police station on Tuesday,” Thota said.During the last two days, the Bhopal administration razed a marriage hall and an apartment built illegally on government land by Miyan.On Sunday, the police booked Miyan’s accomplice Sweety Vishwakarma (21) after five girls were found roaming around in inebriated state. The girls allegedly told the authorities that Miyan had invited them to a birthday party on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday in a flat in Shahpura area.Meanwhile, the allotment of a government accommodation to Miyan has been cancelled, an official said.

15-07-2020||New Delhi||India gets its first indigenous pneumonia vaccine||India on Wednesday got its first indigenous pneumonia vaccine along with an apex drug regulator granting market approval for Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Conjugate Vaccine developed by Serum Institute of India.Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) looked at the evidence from human trials to allow the first fully indigenously developed Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Conjugate Vaccine for marketing in India.Serum Institute first obtained the approval of DCGI to conduct Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials of the vaccine.These trials have since been concluded within the country. The said company has also conducted clinical trials in another country Gambia. Thereafter, Serum Institute applied for approval and permission to manufacture this vaccine.A Health Ministry statement said the application along with the clinical trial data has been reviewed by the Office of Drug Controller General of India with the help of Special Expert Committee (SEC) for vaccines. "The Committee recommended for grant of permission of market authorization to the said vaccine. On July 14, Serum Institute of India Pune has been granted permission to manufacture domestically developed first Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Conjugate Vaccine. This is the first indigenously developed vaccine in the field of pneumonia," Ministry said.Earlier, the demand of this vaccine was met substantially by licensed importers in the country since the manufacturers were all vaccine companies based outside India.This vaccine is used for active immunization against invasive disease and pneumonia caused by “Streptococcus pneumonia” in infants. The vaccine is administered intramuscularly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-gets-its-first-indigenous-pneumonia-vaccine-113284

15-07-2020||New Delhi||Maratha reservation: SC to conduct day-to-day hearing from July 27 via video-conferencing||The Supreme Court said on Wednesday that from July 27 it would commence day-to-day hearing through video-conferencing on a batch of pleas challenging Maharashtra law granting reservation to Marathas in education and jobs.The top court, which refused to pass any interim stay order on the quota, said chances of physical court seem remote due to the persisting COVID-19 pandemic. A bench of Justices L N Rao, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhatt said that all parties should sit together and decide on modalities of hearing like who will take how much time and no one shall repeat the arguments. During the hearing, senior advocate Shyam Divan appearing for some of the petitioners, said that this type of a case needs to be heard in a physical court.“If we are constrained, then give us the earliest possible date. There is tremendous urgency in the matter. We may also need to revisit the concept of interlocutory relief,” he said, adding that there is a whole group of post graduate students who have their careers at risk.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal said that there is also an issue of 10 per cent reservation for Economically Weaker Section which too needs to be heard.The bench said that if it needs to be heard, then it would consider it.Divan pointed out that there is a huge chunk of 12 to 13 per cent reservation which has been taken away.  He said that High Court is bound by the orders of the Supreme Court and nine-judge bench of the top court had already said that quota should not exceed 50 per cent.The bench said it is listing the matter on July 27. Advocate Shivaji M Jadhav told the bench that virtual hearing is not possible looking at compilation of 1,000 of pages.The bench asked the counsel as when does he think COVID-19 will subside and regular courts will start? “Let’s start the hearings. But lawyers, please ensure that you don’t repeat yourselves,” the bench said. The Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018 was enacted to grant reservation to people of Maratha community in Maharashtra in jobs and admissions. The Bombay High Court, while upholding the law in June last year, had held that 16 per cent reservation was not justifiable and said that quota should not exceed 12 per cent in employment and 13 per cent in admissions. On July 7, some of the lawyers appearing in the matter told the bench that physical hearing was required in the case as the issue might not be adjudicated upon properly in virtual hearing through video-conferencing. The bench had then observed that physical hearing at present may not be possible and it would consider the aspect of interim relief in the matter next week. The apex court is presently hearing matter only through video-conferencing amid the COVID-19 pandemic.The top court had last month sought response from the Maharashtra Government on a separate plea of six MBBS doctors, filed through advocate Amit Anand Tiwari, seeking a direction that the state law granting 12 per cent quota to Marathas not be made applicable for admissions in the post graduate medical and dental courses for academic year 2020-2021. On February 5, the apex court had refused to stay the high court order upholding the Maharashtra law granting reservation to Marathas in education and jobs.Earlier, the top court had in July last year decided to examine the constitutional validity of the Maharashtra law, but refused to stay the high court order upholding the statute with some modifications. The high court, in its June 27, 2019, order, had said the 50-per cent cap on total reservations imposed by the Supreme Court could be exceeded in exceptional circumstances.It had also accepted Maharashtra government’s argument that the Maratha community was socially and educationally backward and it was duty-bound to take steps for its progress.The high court had said though the reservation was valid, its quantum -- 16 per cent—was not justifiable and it should be reduced to 12 per cent and 13 per cent, as recommended by the State Backward Classes Commission.One of the plea filed in the apex court had claimed that the SEBC Act breached the 50 per cent ceiling on reservation fixed by the top court in its landmark judgment in the Indira Sahwney case, also known as the ‘Mandal verdict’.The framing of the SEBC Act for Marathas was done under “political pressure” and in “full defiance” of the constitutional principles of equality and rule of law, one of the pleas have claimed.According to the 102nd amendment to the Constitution, reservation can be granted only if a particular community is named in the list prepared by the President.On November 30, 2018, the Maharashtra legislature had passed a Bill granting 16 per cent reservation to Marathas.The report submitted by the State Backward Classes Commission was based on quantifiable and contemporaneous data and was correct in classifying the Maratha community as socially and educationally backward, the high court had said in its verdict.

15-07-2020||Dubai||Children under 12 stranded in India unable to fly back alone to UAE||Children under 12 years, stranded in India due to the COVID-19 lockdown, are unable to reunite with their parents based in the UAE as multiple airlines are refusing to accept unaccompanied minors, according to a media report.Starting July 12, Indians wanting to return to the UAE have been given a 15-day window to travel back on the condition that they have valid residency permits. They also have to produce a negative COVID-19 test result.But parents of minors said they were feeling helpless as children are unable to avail of the travel opportunity despite having return permits, the Khaleej Times reported.It has been more than three months since my daughter has been stuck in India. We have GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreign Affairs) approval for her but the airlines are not accepting her booking, saying she is under 12,” Poonam Sapre, a Dubai-based mother, told the daily.Her daughter Eva Sapre, 10, is in Hyderabad and is awaiting a reunion with her parents.“She is just 10 and it has already taken an emotional toll on her. She is eager to come back and is asking me every day about her return. This is so frustrating.”Barring Emirates and Etihad, other airlines including flydubai and Air Arabia are not accepting unaccompanied minors.With India extending the travel freeze till July 31, normal flights are yet to resume and only special flights are allowed between India and the UAE under a bilateral agreement.Sapre said only flydubai is flying the Hyderabad-Dubai route, and the carrier has restrictions on minors travelling alone. “My daughter is too young to fly through indirect routes,” claims the mother.When the daily reached out to the airlines for comment, they said that such rules on unaccompanied minors were already in place even before COVID-19 travel restrictions came into effect.Another Dubai-based distressed parent, who did not want to be named, said her eight-year-old son is in Kerala and is unable to fly due to airline policies on unaccompanied minors.Faced with this eventuality, some parents are forced to fly out of the UAE so they can accompany their children on the flight back home.An Indian mother, who is currently in Mumbai, said she flew out of Dubai on Monday morning solely for the purpose of bringing back her twin daughters, aged 10.“I had no choice. Ideally, they could have travelled together, but under these circumstances, I thought it best to get them with me personally,” said the mother.

15-07-2020||---||SC refuses to entertain plea against 100 per cent domicile quota in government jobs in J&K||New Delhi, July 15The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to entertain a PIL challenging 100 pre cent domicile reservation in government jobs in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir after nullification of Article 370 of the Constitution.A Bench headed by Justice LN Rao asked petitioner Najum Ul Huda, who hails from Ladakh, to approach the Jammu and Kashmir High Court before coming to the top court.In March, the government issued the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization (Adaptation of State Laws) Order 2020 which notified changes in the Jammu and Kashmir Civil Services (Decentralization and Recruitment) Act. Section 5A of the Act stated that Level 4 posts will be reserved for domiciles.Huda challenged sections 3A, 5A, 6, 7 & 8 of the Jammu and Kashmir Civil Services (Decentralization and Recruitment) Act, 2010 on the ground that these provisions violated Articles 14, 16, 19 and 21 of the Constitution by providing for 100 per cent quota for J&K domiciled candidates.The petitioner sought to emphasise that after the nullification of Article 370, the UT was subject to all laws and the Supreme Court judgments applicable to the rest of India.Section 5A which says that only domicile of J&K shall be eligible for appointment to any post went against Article 16 (3) of the Constitution which guaranteed equal opportunity in employment.The reservations contemplated in Article 16 should not exceed 50 per cent, the petitioner submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-entertain-plea-against-100-per-cent-domicile-quota-in-government-jobs-in-jk-113267
15-07-2020||New Delhi||Actor Sonu Sood turns author with a book on his work with migrants during coronavirus||Actor Sonu Sood, who catapulted to the national spotlight for his work in helping migrants reach their homes amid the COVID-19 pandemic, will pen a book about his experience.His debut book, as-of-yet untitled, will reveal the emotional and often challenging journeys the actor undertook along with the people he helped. It will be released later this year, announced publishing house Penguin Random House India on Wednesday."... I want to thank God for making me a catalyst in helping the migrants. While my heart beats in Mumbai, after this movement I feel a part of me lives in the villages of UP, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam, Uttarakhand and various other states where I have now found new friends and made deep connections."I have decided to put these experiences, stories that are embedded in my soul forever, in a book ... I'm excited, nervous and overwhelmed, and I can't wait to connect with you through my book. I look forward to your support—and love you all," Sood said in a statement.The 46-year-old actor launched an initiative to help reunite migrant workers who were stranded in Mumbai with their families in distant corners of the country.Sood and his team rolled out a toll-free number and a WhatsApp helpline to connect with the workers and then arrange transportation for those desperate to reach their homes. Later, he arranged for food, buses, trains and even chartered flights for stranded migrants, some of whom were walking home after the lockdown was imposed earlier in March and left them jobless."The past three-and-half months have been a kind of a life-changing experience for me, living with the migrants for sixteen to eighteen hours a day and sharing the pain. When I go to see them off as they begin their journey back home, my heart is filled with joy and relief."Seeing the smiles on their faces, the tears of happiness in their eyes has been the most special experience of my life, and I pledged that I'll keep on working to send them back to their homes until the last migrant reaches his village, to his loved ones," he added.Famous antagonist in reel-life, and a true hero in real, Sood on Monday also pledged financial support to over 400 families of migrants, who died or were injured during the coronavirus lockdown.Milee Ashwarya, publisher, Ebury Publishing and Vintage Publishing, Penguin Random House, said the book will bring together the story of Sood's amazing journey - "of people who were suddenly left without security and livelihood; of hope and the feeling of oneness that binds us all together".

15-07-2020||Dantewada||Five Naxals surrender in Chhattisgarh’s Dantewada district||Five Naxals, three of them collectively carrying reward of Rs 5 lakh, have surrendered in Chhattisgarh’s Dantewada district, police said on Wednesday.Since the local police last month launched a campaign asking rebels to return to the mainstream, 58 Naxals have so far surrendered in Dantewada, Superintendent of Police Abhishek Pallava said.“On Tuesday, five cadres turned themselves in before police, saying they were disillusioned by the hollow Maoist ideology and at the same time were impressed by the local police’s Lon Varratu ((term coined in local Gondi dialect which means ‘return to your village/home’) rehabilitation campaign,” he said.Out of the five who surrendered, Jagdish alias Ratan Kawasi (30), who was carrying a reward of Rs 3 lakh on his head, was the “most dreaded one”, the official said, adding that he was active as deputy commander of Bodhghat LGOS (local guerrilla operating squad).He was allegedly involved in various Naxal attacks, including the Jhara Ghati ambush in Narayanpur district in 2007 wherein seven policemen were killed, and Mardapal attack in Kondagaon the same year in which nine policemen lost their lives, he said.Jagdish was also part of Maoists technical team and used to make muzzle loading guns, single shot guns, 12 bore guns, claymore pipe bombs, improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and other explosives, and also used to repair sophisticated rifles, Pallava said.Two other surrendered cadres, Kamlesh alias Motu Ram Poyami (22), an LGOS member, and Mani Ram Alami (24), head of Jantana Sarkar group of Maoists, were carrying rewards of Rs 1 lakh each, he said.Besides, Janmilitia members Balku Kashyap (20) and Shivnath alias Manuram Poyami (25) also surrendered.They all have been given an immediate assistance of Rs 10,000 each and will be provided facilities further as per the government’s surrender and rehabilitation policy, the police official said.Under the ‘Lon Varratu’ initiative, the police have been putting up posters and banners in the native villages of Naxals, who carry cash rewards on their head.The posters mention the names of rebels and appeal to them to join the mainstream, the official said.

15-07-2020||Surat||Support pours in for Gujarat woman cop who "took on" minister's son||Woman police constable from Surat Sunita Yadav is being hailed as a hero on social media platforms days after her strict action led to the registration of an FIR and arrest of a Gujarat minister's son for alleged violation of lockdown and curfew norms. The son of Gujarat Minister of State for Health Kumar Kanani and his two friends were arrested on Sunday for allegedly violating the lockdown and night curfew orders in Surat, a COVID-19 hotspot, a senior police official had said.The arrests of Prakash Kanani, the son of the Varachha MLA, and his two friends, came after a video of heated exchange between them and Yadav, who pulled up the trio for violations, surfaced on social media. The trio was later released on bail.Since then, Yadav is getting praised on social media for "taking on" the BJP minister's son and his friends.While some are calling her "Lady Singham" (after the tough cop in Hindi film 'Singham') and want her to lead the entire police force of Gujarat, some even suggested to give her ticket for the 2022 Assembly polls and pit her against Kumar Kanani, who represents Varachha in Surat district.Her "brave act" earned accolades from the masses as well as famous personalities with "#i_support_sunita_yadav" trending on Twitter.Swati Maliwal, Chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Women, also extended her support and tweeted the video in which Yadav can be seen talking to Kumar Kanani over phone in the presence of his son, who was later on booked for moving around during night curfew."Don't teach an honest officer how to do the duty.First teach your sons how to behave. Officers like Sunita Yadav need to come forward to rein in such stubborn people," said Maliwal in her tweet.Former IPS officer DG Vanzara seemed to havejoined this young constable's fans club, too."During my Service, I saw SPs whose Caliber was worse than that of Constables, while, I also saw Constables who would have become better SPs given the Opportunity. #i_support_sunita_yadav & appreciate Her Courage & Commitment. Violators of Law must be booked whosoever they may be," Vanzara tweeted.One Pradeep Yadav said the "lady cop" is brave "and must be protected against any political revenge."She's taking the class of the son of an MLA who violated Night Curfew Rule. #i_support_sunita_yadav," Pradeep Yadav tweeted.An unnamed user saw former IPS officer Kiran Bedi's traits in the constable."I see @thekiranbedi in this Cop. @thekiranbedi Ma'am, history repeats again, you fought against Mrs Gandhi, it is time to fight again for her. Please help her.#i_support_sunita_yadav" he wrote on Twitter.A user named Vishal Pisavadiya said the country "needs more Officers like you Mam. We are proud of you."             After Yadav hit headlines, at least five different Twitter handles with her name have emerged.While some have voluntarily declared themselves as Parody accounts, some claimed they are "authentic" ones run by Yadav.Since Yadav has maintained distance from the media, confusion still prevails about her real Twitter as well as Facebook accounts.However, people are using all these accounts to express their solidarity for her.A senior police officer from Surat on Monday said none of the Twitter accounts in the name of Yadav is actually run by her.She has confirmed to the police that she does not have a Twitter account, the officer added.Prakash Kanani and two friends were booked under IPC Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269, 270 (negligent and malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), and 144 (abettor present when offence committed), Assistant Commissioner of Police C K Patel had said on Sunday.

15-07-2020||United Nations||India set to make PDS location independent: NITI Aayog CEO at UN forum||India is set to make the Public Distribution System location independent to ensure that no one, especially the inter-state migrants, is left behind, NITI Aayog CEO has said, citing the ‘One Nation, One Card’ initiative being implemented by the government as a transformative solution in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Addressing the special event on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Acceleration Actions on the margins of 2020 High-Level Political Forum on Tuesday, Amitabh Kant said collective action through international cooperation was more relevant and important than ever before in these truly unprecedented times.He told the session that the ‘One Nation, One Card’ initiative is an example of a recent transformative solution by India presently being implemented as a response to the pandemic.“The first half of 2020 has underscored the importance of responsive and adaptive policy making, more than ever before. When challenges are dynamic and unprecedented, peer learning and knowledge exchange are of utmost significance. We are deeply committed to foster this spirit and accelerate progress on the SDG targets by not only focusing on the recovery but by building back better for long term transformation,” Kant said.The ‘One Nation, One Card’ initiative ensures right-based access to food supplies and covers over 800 million people at cost as low as three to five cents. He added that this was operationalised through beneficiary cards issued by the sub-national governments.“By leveraging the technological capacity meticulously built over the last few years, India is all set to roll out interoperability in making access to the Public Distribution System location independent,” Kant said adding that it was a “momentous step to ensure that no one is left behind, especially the inter-state migrants.”The COVID-19 pandemic had also highlighted the power of collectivised problem solving, he said.Under the ‘One Nation, One Ration Card’ initiative, eligible beneficiaries would be able to avail their entitled foodgrains under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) from any Fair Price Shop in the country using the same ration card. The Food Ministry aims to implement this facility across the country by March 2021.Kant added that “invigorated and renewed synergy” between the government and the private sector had resulted in over 4,00,000 PPEs and 2,20,000 N-95 masks being manufactured in India, every day.“In February this year, we were producing none. This aligns closely with our flagship ‘Make in India’ approach, through which we aim at becoming a globally competitive manufacturing hub,” he said.Meanwhile, India on Monday presented its second Voluntary National Review (VNR) at the High-Level Political Forum.India’s VNR report titled ‘Decade of Action: Taking SDGs from Global to Local’ highlights not only the country’s progress on the SDGs but also captures the inclusive and participatory process followed in its preparation.Kant told the session that India was aggressively expanding its renewable energy programme, increasing the renewable energy capacity by 75 per cent since 2014 and aiming to achieve the ambitious target of 450 GW by 2030.“We have made the global pledge, as part of our Nationally Determined Contributions, to have 40 per cent of cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel sources,” he said, adding that India’s renewable energy sector has become a prime destination for global investors, with a potential to attract 10 billion dollars of annual investments.In the global Ease of Doing Business rankings, India has jumped 79 places in the past five years: from 142 in 2014 to 62 in 2019.“Our structural reforms in taxation, FDI regime, and insolvency and bankruptcy have contributed to this improvement,” he said.Emphasising that 21st-century challenges need 21st-century solutions, Kant said the role of innovation is critical in designing solutions for SDG acceleration and building back better. Today, India is home to the third-largest start-up ecosystem in the world, with the third-largest number of unicorns.“We firmly believe that these disruptions in the innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem will accelerate our pace of achieving the SDGs,” he said.He also pointed out that the government’s Aspirational Districts Programme aims at accelerating transformative socio-economic improvement in 112 districts of the country with relatively greater development challenges.By improving the lives of over 165 million citizens in these districts in terms of health, education, basic infrastructure, agriculture and water, and financial inclusion and skill development, the initiative highlight the efficacy of the cooperative and competitive federalism approach to development, he said.“Sharing SDG acceleration actions and successes will be incomplete without discussing SDG localisation in India. Fostering sub-national peer-learning and competitiveness is the approach we took when we released the world's first government-led sub-national SDG Index in 2018,” he said.Kant said the SDG India Index and Dashboard, which annually ranks Indian States based on their SDG performance, had reshaped the SDG framework adoption and localisation discourse in the country. “It has resulted in sub-national entities instituting monitoring systems and preparing development strategies aligned to the goals of the 2030 Agenda, which are customised to the local and hyper-local context,” he added.

My fidelity is not to any individual or family. I remain a Gandhi-Nehruvian idealist (a vanishing breed within Congress).

The battle has just begun.”Reacting to his suspension, Jha on Tuesday wondered what “anti-party activities” he had indulged in to invite the action from the Congress.He was dropped Jha as the All India Congress Committee (AICC) spokesperson last month after he wrote a newspaper article critical of the party.He has also been critical of the way the Congress handled issues pertaining to rebel party leader Sachin Pilot, who was on Tuesday sacked as Rajasthan’s Deputy Chief Minister and the party’s state unit president.

15-07-2020||Washington||China’s aggressive actions against India give insight into how CPC thinking these days: US NSA||China’s “very aggressive” actions against India, including the brutal attack on the Indian soldiers in eastern Ladakh, and its moves in the South China Sea and Hong Kong give a “good insight” into how the ruling Communist Party of China is thinking these days, US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien has said.The Indian and Chinese armies were locked in a standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The tension escalated in the Galwan Valley on June 15 in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed during a violent face-off with Chinese soldiers.“The Chinese have been very aggressive with India,” O’Brien said on Tuesday alleging that during the recent clash they beat some of the Indians so badly they were disfigured and could not be identified.“This is a dispute between India and China, but China has shown itself for what it was. Chinese troops ambushed the Indians. They beat 20 Indians to death. They beat them so badly with clubs with nails in them and wrapped with concertina — barbed wire,” O’Brien told Fox News Radio in an interview.He was responding to a question on the recent Chinese aggressive behaviour against India in eastern Ladakh.Responding to a question on US-India bilateral relations, he said, India was a democracy and is a great friend of the United States.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President (Donald) Trump have a super relationship,” O’Brien said.“In fact, it was the last foreign trip that I took with the president before the COVID crisis hit, was to India, and we had a great reception of the Indian people there. We have a lot in common with them, we speak English, we’re democracies. We’ve got a growing, very strong relationship with India,” O'Brien said.“But China’s action towards India, just like its actions in the South China Sea, just like what it’s doing in Hong Kong, just like the bullying intimidation of Taiwan, really gives you a good insight into how the Communist Party of China is thinking these days,” he said.China claims almost all of the 1.3 million square miles the South China Sea as its sovereign territory. China has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.“It’s something to be very concerned about,” O'Brien said.On Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected “most” of China’s maritime claims in the South China Sea, the latest in the escalation between Washington and Beijing.Also read: US rejects China’s claims in South China Sea, adding to tensionsLast week, the Trump administration took action against Chinese officials for their involvement in human rights abuses in the Xinjiang region, where Uyghur Muslims and other minority groups have been detained and tortured.And two weeks ago, the administration announced visa restrictions on current and former Chinese officials who it says “were responsible for eviscerating Hong Kong’s freedoms”.The Trump administration has been openly critical of Beijing’s sweeping national security law aimed at limiting Hong Kong’s autonomy and banning literature critical of the Chinese Communist Party.Also read: Trump signs into law Hong Kong Autonomy Act, suspends special privilegesEarlier in the day, Senator Bob Menendez, a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, alleged that China is seeking to redraw the map of Asia without regard to its neighbours.“As India and China work to disengage along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), I remain deeply concerned by China's aggressive behaviour in territorial disputes,” he said.“From the 2017 Doklam standoff to the recent violence along the borders in Sikkim and Ladakh, to China’s new claims to Bhutanese territory, Beijing has all too often sought to redraw the map of Asia without regard for its neighbours,” he said.The international community must be clear that such behaviour was unacceptable, he added.Menendez, the top Democratic Senator from New Jersey, said the US-India partnership, based on their shared commitment to democracy, was vital to uphold international law, international norms and the institutions that could peacefully and diplomatically resolve disputes and aggression.“I am committed to working with the Indian government and the Indian-American community in New Jersey and throughout the United States to advance US-India cooperation,” Menendez said.

15-07-2020||Aditi Tandon||Pilot, 18 other Congress MLAs face disqualification; Rajasthan Assembly Speaker issues notices||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 15The Congress on Wednesday initiated disqualification proceedings against sacked Rajasthan deputy CM Sachin Pilot and 18 other rebel party MLAs for breach of party discipline and conspiring to dislodge the duly elected state government.Rajasthan Assembly Speaker CP Joshi has sent notices to the 19 Congress MLAs, including Pilot, who have been raising a banner of revolt against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot-led Congress dispensation in the state.The notices require MLAs to respond by July 17.AICC has decided to dissolve all the District Congress Commities and Block Congress Committees of Rajasthan Pradesh with immediate effect. The process of formation of new committees will begin soon.  The notices were issued after Congress chief Mahesh Joshi wrote to the Speaker seeking his intervention for proceeding against the rebels in accordance with the tenth schedule of the Constitution.Joshi said in his letters: “Over the last several days, attempts have been made to topple the Congress government in Rajasthan through corruption, bribery and other illegal means. The MLAs in question have been deliberately conspiring against the Congress to destabilise its government and are acting openly against party interests.”The chief also alleged in the letter that the rebel lawmakers deliberately absented themselves from the CLP meeting on July 13 and the second meet on July 14 also.“The MLAs gave interviews to select TV channels challenging the government and levelling allegations against the party and the government,” the chief whip said.He said these open challenges to party leadership is an undeniable expression of a revolt against the Congress and indicates they have voluntarily given up party membership by conspiring against the party.The Congress cited the Constitution Tenth Schedule (anti Defection) law to say the MLAs with their action attract disqualification under the tenth schedule and should be accordingly proceeded against.The Congress, through disqualification of rebels, seeks to bring down the assembly strength from the current 200 and gain an edge in the power game to save its government from any potential future threat.Ashok Gehlot claims he has the support of at least 104 MLAs. The current majority in assembly is 101.By disqualifying rebels, the Congress can make their revolt irrelevant to the number game as the assembly strength will fall by 19 MLAs and accordingly the simple majority mark will also reduce giving Gehlot breathing space.Congress dissolves all district and block committees in RajasthanThe Congress on Wednesday also dissolved all district and block committees in Rajasthan after sacking Sachin Pilot and two ministers — Vishvendra Singh and Ramesh Meena.AICC General Secretary Rajasthan Avinash Pande said all committees stand dissolved and will be formed soon.The move came after Rajasthan Assembly Speaker CP Joshi sent notices to 19 MLAs including Pilot initiating disqualification proceedings against them under the anti-defection law.Congress now seeks to rid the state organisation of Pilot’s influence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pilot-18-other-congress-mlas-face-disqualification-rajasthan-assembly-speaker-issues-notices-113227
15-07-2020||New Delhi||BJP treads cautiously as unlike Scindia, Sachin Pilot may not prove kingmaker in Rajasthan||Rebel Rajasthan Congress leader Sachin Pilot on Wednesday said he is not interested in joining the BJP even though his erstwhile colleagues like Rita Bahuguna Joshi and Jyotiraditya Scindia have advised him to do so.Technically, Pilot would be a great catch for the BJP, helping the party in furthering the perceptions against the Congress not only in Rajasthan, but the entire country.Also read: Pilot grounded, Gehlot claims majorityPilot, 18 other Congress MLAs face disqualification; Rajasthan Assembly Speaker issues noticesThe BJP, adopting a wait-and-watch policy, appears to be treading cautiously due to certain reasons. First of all, the actual number of Congress MLAs standing in support of Pilot, now that Ashok Gehlot government is still functioning, is still unclear.The Gehlot government in Rajasthan, unlike the erstwhile Kamal Nath dispensation in Madhya Pradesh, may still make it. In MP, after the exit of Scindia, it had become impossible for Nath to survive. There is no denying the political acumen of Gehlot. Besides, Scindia had a history with the BJP with his grandmother being a founder member and aunts Vasundhara Raje and Yashodhara Raje key active members currently. Pilot has no such family connections in the saffron party.However, the bigger issue appears to be the hold that senior Rajasthan BJP leader and former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has on the BJP cadre and leadership in the state.So far, Raje has not reacted on what is being read as a "Delhi-sponsored programme" in Rajasthan. She is expected to attend a party meeting in Rajasthan after which things are expected to become clear.Other senior BJP leaders from the state, Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, PP Choudhary and Om Mathur, have reacted on Pilot but with limited scope and cautiously. Raje’s hold over BJP MLAs and the state unit is well known and how she held her ground in 2018 against someone as powerful as Amit Shah, the then BJP president, over the selection of the state unit chief. Shah wanted to appoint Shekhawat but after weeks-long stalemate, a middle path was adopted in the way of Madan Lal Saini.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-treads-cautiously-as-unlike-scindia-sachin-pilot-may-not-prove-kingmaker-in-rajasthan-113226

15-07-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||India's strategic rail projects with Japan, Iran in trouble||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 14Two rail projects that are statements of diplomatic significance are in trouble and would need intervention by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said sources.The project in partnership with Japan to run the subcontinent's first bullet train is facing a cost overrun, while there is Indian apathy over funding a rail line in Iran, it is reported. The latter's significance is that it will be Afghanistan's first route to the Indian Ocean independent of Pakistan.The bullet train project has been impacted by cost overruns, especially during the first two lockdowns when Japan kept asking for relaxation in the movement of its engineers and material. The cost overrun is understood to be over $2 billion (Rs 15,000 crore), which is beyond the realm of executives from both sides to resolve."The project faces the danger of sliding into a time overrun if the issue is not considered on a priority basis," said sources. There is also the issue of delay in issuing tenders worth Rs 50,000 crore for the project after India announced the "Atmanirbhar Bharat" initiative to source more from local companies. That has necessitated reworking of calculations.The other rail project, in Iran, has seen Tehran fretting that New Delhi is yet to play a bigger role in funding and constructing a strategic transit route from Chabahar to Zahedan in Afghanistan, and from there to Sarakhs at the border with Turkmenistan.Sources said as far as the Chabahar port was concerned, Iran would always partner with India. In fact, even during the Covid pandemic, humanitarian assistance from India to Afghanistan transited via the Chabahar port, which is operated by an Indian public sector company.As is the case with Frazad-B gas field, which has been offered by Iran to India, Tehran has started expressing its impatience with Indian procrastination in investing in the railway line, a vital link in the International North-South Transit Corridor, which significantly shortens the trade routes between India and European and CIS markets.Diplomatic sources said Tehran had indicated to India that it did not want to depend solely on Beijing for the co-development of transportation routes. "Iran is determined to expand its relations with all Asian partners, China and India in particular, as two friendly countries. Such agreement is fully in line with Iran's publicly declared Look East Policy," said a diplomatic source.2016 Chabahar port agreement||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-strategic-rail-projects-with-japan-iran-in-trouble-112932

He later tweeted: “My heartfelt thanks and gratitude to all those who have come out in my support today.”The Pilot camp appeared unfazed on the surface, still claiming the support of 30 MLAs and some independents in the Assembly, where 101 is the simple majority mark. Gehlot later met Governor Kalraj Mishra to recommend the sacking of the three ministers and inform him about a potential Cabinet expansion.The CM claimed he had 104 MLAs even though the CPM and Bharatiya Tribal Party, Congress allies, said they would remain neutral till Gehlot sorted Congress’ factionalism.With Pilot yet to make his move, the Congress government appeared on the edge with independents and allies already distancing themselves. All eyes are now on Pilot who is expected to open his cards soon with sources maintaining he might float a party and get BJP’s backing or might well join the saffron fold.Gehlot should take floor test: OppnOpposition BJP demanded that CM Ashok Gehlot take a floor test to prove his government’s majority in the Assembly. Deputy Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore claimed the government would not be able to prove its majority in a floor test.BJP woos Sachin, says doors openBJP leaders said party’s ‘doors are open’ for anybody who expresses trust in its ideology. Pilot’s ‘erstwhile’ colleague Rita Bahuguna Joshi berated the Congress and advised him to ‘immediately join the BJP’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pilot-grounded-gehlot-claims-majority-113138
