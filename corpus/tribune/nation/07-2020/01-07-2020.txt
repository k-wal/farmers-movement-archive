01-07-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 tally may not reach 5.5 lakh by July end, but need to see how virus behaves in monsoon: Verma||The COVID-19 tally in the city may not reach the estimated number of 5.5 lakh cases by July end but one needs to see how the virus behaves during the monsoon, Mahesh Verma, head of a Delhi Government committee tasked with strengthening the preparedness of hospitals to battle coronavirus, said on Wednesday.Verma, however, said before making a new forecast, the number of cases should be monitored over the next couple of days.Verma is part of a five-member committee that was constituted by the Delhi Government last month for healthcare infrastructure augmentation and strengthening of overall preparedness of hospitals to battle COVID-19.The committee had said that the national capital would see one lakh cases by June end and 5.5 lakh cases by July end.Verma said based on the current scenario, it looks unlikely that Delhi will see 5.5 lakh cases by the end of July.“But now monsoon is round the corner. We do not know how the virus will behave since it is a new virus. Earlier, we would say it would go away in summer but it never went away.“Monsoon is also a season for viral diseases. We do not know whether the viral load for those diseases will compound coronavirus. Let us wait for a few days to see whether it is a temporary decline or whether there will be any surge,” he said.      According to Delhi Government’s health bulletin figures, between June 13 to 27, there were seven days on which over 3,000 cases was reported.However, after June 27, there was a decline in the number of cases reported on a single day. On June 29, 2,084 cases were reported within 24 hours. The next day, the number was 2,199.“It is only three-four days since there has been a decline. We have to keep a watch over the numbers for another couple of days and then only we can forecast. We were expecting almost one lakh cases by the end of June but we have added about 65,000 cases. A new pattern is emerging,” Verma said.Verma, who is also the vice-chancellor of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, said due to the surge, everyone became more proactive and there was increased testing, which contributed to the general management of cases.As the numbers witnessed a sharp ascend, Delhi has significantly ramped up testing, mostly after the Rapid Antigen methodology was permitted.He also said everyone, be it from the Ministry of Home Affairs to the Delhi Government to the municipalities, chipped in, which was also responsible for the results. He added the serological survey, which started last Saturday, will show some results.

01-07-2020||New Delhi||LAC stand-off: Rajnath, Army Chief to visit Ladakh to take stock of military preparedness||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh is scheduled to visit Ladakh on Friday to take stock of India’s military preparedness in the wake of a bitter border stand-off with the Chinese troops in the region, government sources said.To be accompanied by Chief of Army Staff Gen M M Naravane, it will be the Defence Minister’s first visit to Ladakh after the stand-off between the two armies began on May 5.During his visit, Singh will carry out a comprehensive review of the security situation in the region with Gen Naravane, Northern Army Commander Lt Gen Yogesh Kumar Joshi, Commander of the 14 Corps Lt Gen Harinder Singh and other senior Army officials, sources said.The visit is also aimed at boosting morale of the Army personnel engaged in the seven-week bitter border faceoff with the Chinese troops in the region, sources added.The Army Chief visited Ladakh on June 23 and 24 during which he held a series of meetings with senior Army officials and visited various forward areas in eastern Ladakh. Gen Naravane earlier visited Leh on May 22.The Indian and Chinese armies are locked in a standoff position at multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last seven weeks. The tension escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in Galwan Valley on June 15.The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details.The Defence Minister’s visit to the region comes in the midst of India significantly ramping up the number of troops and weaponry along the Line of Actual Control(LAC) in the Eastern Ladakh region.Following the Galwan valley clashes, the Army has sent thousands of additional troops to forward locations along the border besides moving in heavy weapons.The IAF has also moved air defence systems as well as a sizeable number of its frontline combat jets and attack helicopters to several key air bases.On Tuesday, the Indian and Chinese armies held the third round of Lt General-level talks during which both sides agreed on the need for an “expeditious, phased and stepwise” de-escalation as a “priority” to end the standoff.However, military sources did not give any indications of early resolution of the standoff, and said it may continue till winters.The process of disengagement along the LAC is “complex”, sources said but added that the 12-hour discussions on Tuesday reflected the commitment of both sides to reduce tensions in the region.The Tuesday talks took place on the Indian side of the LAC in Chushul sector in eastern Ladakh.The Indian delegation at the meeting was headed by 14 Corps Commander Lt Gen Singh while the Chinese side was led by the Commander of the Tibet Military District Major General Liu Lin.It was the third senior military commander level engagement to discuss issues related to disengagement at the faceoff sites along the LAC and de-escalation in the border areas.In the previous two rounds of talks, the Indian side demanded immediate withdrawal of Chinese troops from various areas in the region.Following the Galwan Valley incident, the government has given the armed forces “full freedom” to give a “befitting” response to any Chinese misadventure along the LAC, the 3,500-km de-facto border, sources said.The first round of the Lt General talks was held on June 6 during which both sides finalised an agreement to disengage gradually from all the standoff points beginning with Galwan Valley.However, the situation deteriorated following the Galwan valley clashes as the two sides significantly bolstered their deployments in most areas along the LAC.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.

01-07-2020||Kolkata||Banning Tiktok impulsive decision; substitute Indian apps needed: TMC MP Nusrat Jahan||Trinamool Congress MP Nusrat Jahan on Wednesday termed the Centre’s decision to ban 59 Chinese apps including TikTok as an “eyewash and an impulsive decision” and said the Union government should substitute them with Indian apps as the livelihood of many people are associated with these applications.Jahan, an actor-turned parliamentarian with a huge following on TikTok, said people should not suffer from this ban as they did after demonetisation.“TikTok was just like any other social media platform for me to connect with my fans and audience. If it’s in the national interest, I completely stand by the ban. But banning a few Chinese apps is just an eyewash by the Central government and an impulsive decision,” she said in a statement.Questioning the Centre on the future of those who lost their job in these companies due to the ban, the MP said, “What about the Chinese investments in companies which came out with the PM’s picture in front-page ads, post demonetisation? What was achieved through diplomacy and visits by the PM?“Also, what about the content creators who lose their monthly income to run households now? These questions remain unanswered.[sic]”The first-time parliamentarian also said that the government has to take steps to move away from Chinese supply chains without adding to inflation and putting pressure on the common man’s pockets.The Centre should come out or allow the creation of substitute apps so that livelihoods are not lost, Jahan later told reporters.“People should not suffer from this ban, just like it happened during demonetisation. The Central government should come up with a substitute plan to create Indian apps, so that people don’t lose jobs and they don’t need to depend on Chinese or any other foreign apps,” the TMC MP said.West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee had said that banning apps will not be enough, asserting that China needs to be given a befitting reply.India on Monday banned 59 apps with Chinese links, including the hugely-popular TikTok and UC Browser, saying they were prejudicial to sovereignty, integrity and security of the country.The ban came in the backdrop of a standoff along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh and the killing of 20 Indian Army personnel in a clash with Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley.

01-07-2020||New Delhi||Railways begins process to invite private players for passenger train operations||The Railways on Wednesday formally kick-started its plans to allow private entities to operate passenger trains on its network by inviting request for qualifications (RFQ) for participation on 109 pairs of routes through 151 modern trains, the national transporter said.The project would entail a private sector investment of about Rs 30,000 crore, it said.This is the first initiative for private investment for running passenger trains on the Indian Railways network. It began last year with the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) introducing the Lucknow-Delhi Tejas Express.Currently, the IRCTC operates three trains—the Kashi Mahakal Express on the Varanasi-Indore route, the Lucknow-New Delhi Tejas and the Ahmedabad-Mumbai Tejas.“The objective of this initiative is to introduce modern technology rolling stock with reduced maintenance, reduced transit time, boost job creation, provide enhanced safety, provide world-class travel experience to passengers,” the Railways said.The 109 origin-destination routes have been formed into 12 clusters across the Indian Railway network. Each train shall have a minimum of 16 coaches, it said.The Railways also said that majority of these modern trains are to be manufactured in India as ‘Make in India’ and the private entity shall be responsible for financing, procuring, operating and maintaining the trains.“Trains shall be designed for a maximum speed of 160 kmph. There would be a substantial reduction in journey time. The running time taken by a train shall be comparable to or faster than the fastest train of the Indian Railways operating in the respective route,” it said.The concession period for the project shall be 35 years and the private entity shall pay the Indian Railways fixed haulage charges, energy charges as per actual consumption and a share in gross revenue determined through a transparent bidding process, the transporter said.“These trains shall be operated by the driver and guard of Indian Railways. The operation of the trains by the private entity shall conform to the key performance indicators like punctuality, reliability, upkeep of trains etc,” the Railways said.Operation and maintenance of the passenger trains would be governed by standards and specifications, and requirements specified by Indian Railways, it said.The entire process of handing over certain routes to private players will be completed in two parts.The first started on Wednesday with invite for RFQs wherein private bidders will qualify. The second step will be Request for Proposal (RFP). The details of revenue generation and routes will be decided during the latter process.In the pre-COVID times, companies such as R K Catering, Adani Ports and MakeMyTrip and airlines, including Indigo, Vistara and SpiceJet, had shown interest in participating in operating private trains, sources said.Other players whose attention has been attracted by this are global majors like Alstom Transport, Bombardier, Siemens AG and Macquarie, they said.Aimed at offering airline-like services to train passengers, the national transporter has said that the private players, apart from fixing fares, have to also provide facilities like catering, cleaning and supply of beddings to passengers.

01-07-2020||New Delhi||Set up camps, use mobile vans to ramp up COVID testing: Centre to states||The central government asked states on Wednesday to ramp up COVID-19 testing in campaign mode, hold camps and use mobile vans to collect samples of symptomatic people from high incidence areas and check them with an antigen test.“The positive individuals should be treated as per COVID treatment regime and the negative individuals should be tested with RTPCR,” Health Secretary Preeti Sudan and ICMR chief Balram Bhargava wrote in a joint letter to state chief secretaries.Noting that “test-tract-treat” is key strategy for early COVID-19 detection and treatment, the Centre said states must augment their capacity to collect and test samples from symptomatic persons as recommended by ICMR.“It has been observed that in some states and UTs, the capacity utilization of the testing labs particularly in private sector, is grossly sub optimal. It is advised to take steps to ensure full capacity utilization of all COVID testing labs in your areas,” the letter said.In another important shift the Centre asked states to allow all doctors, including private ones, to recommend COVID-19 test. “Some states have mandated the need of a prescription from a government doctor for making an individual eligible to undergo COVID19 test. Due to pressure on government facilities this will delay matters. It is absolutely necessary at this juncture to facilitate testing by enabling all qualified medical practitioners including private ones to prescribe a COVID test to any individual fulfilling ICMR criteria,” the letter said.India’s testing capacity is three lakh samples daily, but only 2,17,931 samples were tested in the last 24 hours.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/set-up-camps-use-mobile-vans-to-ramp-up-covid-testing-centre-to-states-107212

It included social media apps Tiktok, WeChat and browser UC Browser.“There have been raging concerns on aspects relating to data security and safeguarding the privacy 130 crore Indians.

01-07-2020||Hyderabad||Secunderabad colony named after Milkha Singh||It’s strange to find a residential colony named after a Sikh in the far-away Southern city of Secunderabad, which is also an important cantonment. But the resident of the Milkha Singh Colony in the EME Centre is a place that locals are as proud as India’s Flying Sikh Milkha Singh after whom the colony is named. Recruited in the Corps of Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (EME) in 1952, much of his training started here.Not many know that Milkha Singh---the 90-year-old legend who lives in Chandigarh, where he spends his time playing golf and going for his walks---lived here from 1952 to 1960 and prepared for the 1960 Rome Olympics in the local grounds or as he says running for practice from the barracks here each morning. Singh missed the bronze medal at Rome in the 400m by a few seconds.Practice here in and around the Milkha Singh Colony later helped him win several medals and laurels in Asian Games and Commonwealth Games. The athlete acknowledges that the hard work put in here laid the foundation for his athletic career later. For practice, Milkha Singh would run up the “Ammuguda Pahad” (hill) near EME Centre carrying stone-filled bag to build up stamina, strength and muscle.It is not only here that Milkha Singh prepared for the sporting career, but he also used to run alongside a train, which ran on the metre gauge then between Bolarum and Ammuguda. Milkha Singh has told family and friends that one driver of a loco used to encourage him by motivating him not to give up and stay with the speed of the train. All this was done in Secunderabad and the people have now acknowledged his contribution to Indian athletics by naming the colony after him.Majority of the area around the EME Centre was a jungle and this made his practice tougher. Milkha Singh acknowledges the contribution of the army in his sporting career. “Had I not joined the Army, perhaps I would not have worked so hard. The Milkha Singh as you know him is the because of the Army and EME Centre”, he says.It is not only the colony, the stadium at the EME Centre is also named after him. The Stadium inside the EME Centre where he trained during 1952-53 is called the Milkha Singh Stadium.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/secunderabad-colony-named-after-milkha-singh-107210

01-07-2020||---||PM Modi quits Chinese micro-blogging platform Weibo||New Delhi, July 1Prime Minister Narendra Modi has deleted his account on Weibo – the Chinese Twitter – four days after India banned 59 mobile applications linked to China.Though the government announced the banning of apps on Saturday after reportedly weeks of discussion, the PM’s Weibo account seemed to have escaped the censor’s eye.Sources said the delay was because of the complex procedures involved in deleting a VIP account.As many as 113 posts of the Prime Minister had to be laboriously deleted one by one. The two posts that have remained carry the PM’s photo along with that of Chinese President Xi Jinping. Apparently, the app does not have the permission to easily delete photos of their President.Another reason cited for the PM’s Weibo account staying alive days after the app was banned was the inordinate delay in permission from China for the deletions.“It is incredible that security agencies did not conduct any SWOT (strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats) before permitting the PM to open an account on a foreign app. The conditions for deleting the account should have been factored in right at the outset,” said a cyberspace expert.Modi had joined Weibo in 2015 during his intense China-wooing phase and the account quickly gathered about 2.5 lakh followers, many of them Chinese attracted by the novelty of an Indian leader tweeting in Mandarin at an average rate of one tweet every month.   The PM used the account to wish Xi on his birthday every year but did not do so this time because of the Galwan Valley clash of June 15 in which 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese were killed.Meanwhile, BJP’s IT wing head Amit Malviya said Modi’s decision to quit Weibo sends out a “loud and clear” message.“Prime Minister Modi quits Chinese social media platform Weibo. The message is loud and clear. If red lines are crossed, there will be consequences... What started at the borders has now acquired multiple dimensions. And it may just be the beginning,” Malviya tweeted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-quits-chinese-micro-blogging-platform-weibo-107203

They included Maulana Masood Azhar, Hafiz Saeed, Zaki ur Rehman Lakhvi and Dawood Ibrahim. With Wednesday’s listing, the total number of people declared individual terrorists stands at 13.In an official statement the MHA said, “These individuals are involved in various acts of terrorism from across the border and from foreign soil. They have been relentless in their nefarious efforts of destabilising the country, by trying to revive militancy in Punjab through their anti-national activities and through their support to and involvement in the Khalistan Movement.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gurpatwant-singh-pannun-among-nine-designated-as-terrorists-under-uapa-107197

The allotment of Type 6B house No. 35, Lodi Estate, New Delhi, is hereby cancelled with effect from July 1. One month concessional period on the same rent up to August 1, 2020 is allowed as per rules,” the Deputy Director of Estates GP Sarkar wrote to Vadra in a letter today.The letter also said failure to vacate the house on or before August 1, 2020, would attract damages and charges and penal rent as per rules.Priyanka won’t be deterred by such notices: CongressTerming the service of house vacation notice to Priyanka as an act of vendetta, the Congress said the party won’t be cowed down by such moves and will continue to raise issues concerning people.“BJP’s hatred and sense of vendetta for Congress leaders is well known but the government has now touched new lows by serving a house vacation notice to Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. We won’t be flustered by such notices,” Congress media head Randeep Surjewala said.He said the move reflected the anxiety of PM Narendra Modi and UP CM Yogi Adityanath as Priyanka Vadra is active in UP.“Both PM and UP CM are unnerved by political activism of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. She won’t be deterred by such fruitless and wasteful exercise. She will continue to show you the mirror and to champion the cause of the people,” said Surjewala accusing the PM of earlier stripping his predecessors Manmohan Singh and HD Deve Gowda of SPG cover.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/priyanka-gandhi-asked-to-vacate-government-bungalow-by-august-1-107196

At national level it was 4.8.The fertility rate is defined as number of live births per 1,000 women.The fertility rate in Haryana in 45-49 age bracket was lower previously--3.5 in 2017, 3.3 in 2016 and 2.0 in 2015.The SRS report, published by the office of Registrar General of India annually, also evaluates fertility of women in comparison with their education standards across different age groups.In Haryana, among the literates in the age group of 45-49, the women who were educated below primary level led with 10.2 fertility rate, followed by graduates and above at 8.3 and primary educated ones at 8.2. The illiterate women had a fertility rate of 7.4 in this age group.  Otherwise, Haryana had its highest fertility rate in the age group of 25-29 at 169.1 in 2018, implying most mothers in the state bear children in this age group. It is followed by the age group of 20-24 at 118.3 and 30-34 at 91.4.Even in the age group of 40-44, Haryana reported a fertility rate of 10.6 in 2018.In the North, J&K women had a fertility rate of 6.5, Himachal Pradesh (HP) had 1.5, Punjab and Uttarakhand had reported 3.5 while Delhi had 1.7 in 45-49 age bracket.Except for Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal where fertility reached its peak in the age group 20-24, and Jammu & Kashmir where fertility reached its peak in the age group 30-34, the highest fertility in all the other bigger states and UTs was attained in the age group 25-29, says the report.Fertility, however, declined from age 30 in all, except Jammu & Kashmir where it declined from age 35.“The higher fertility rate in 45-49 age group in Haryana is due to widely available treatment for infertility and son preference which forces couple to have children till late. However, if we see the overall picture, social economic transition has forced women to compress their reproductive period. It starts late and ends early,” said Prof Aswini Kumar Nanda, who works as a health economist at the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development (CRRID), Chandigarh.  Infant mortality rate  Infant Mortality Rate (IMR), which is defined as the infant deaths (less than one year) per thousand live births, in Haryana was more than the neighbouring states in 2018.The IMR in Haryana was 30 while it was 13 in Delhi, 19 in HP, 20 in Punjab and 22 in J&K. At national level it was 32.

Hence, to have wider participation and competition, we have cancelled the EOI and are going in for open EOI,” the spokesperson said.Sources, however, said the tender was scrapped after many Indian vendors in letters to RailTel raised concerns that the specifications mentioned in the tender favoured Chinese company Hikvision, one of the world’s largest video surveillance companies which currently dominates India’s CCTV market.They said the technology—DeepInMind—which is part of the specification for the cameras and mentioned in the tender document, is a proprietary feature of Hikvision.“Specifications issued are biased to Chinese OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) i.e. Hikvision, Specs clearly mentioned DeepinMind technology which is a proprietary feature of Hikvision NVRs,” one of the letters accessed by PTI from an Indian vendor to RailTel said.“RDSO 5.0 specs for IP camera & NVR (Network video recorder) are to be followed as per the RailTel EOI (included latest corrigendum) whereas body temperature screening solution is nowhere near to general CCTV cameras in terms of functionality, this clause seems to be made to deliver undue benefit to some Chinese OEMs (original equipment manufacturer) only,” the letter stated.While the initial tender for these cameras issued on June 9 excluded a crucial specification called “black body” temperature—the ability of the cameras to accurately measure temperatures emitted by a person to say whether a person has fever or not—and the DeepInMind technology specification, they were included in the revised tender issued on June 23.The specifications for the cameras include temperature screening with facial recognition and mask detection, simultaneous temperature screening for multiple persons, detecting whether people wear masks and timely giving alarms on people without masks, identity verification and stranger alarm.“Special interface in DeepinMind NVR visually displaying all kinds of information, supporting voice broadcast upon mask and temperature status. Fast video search of target people such as people with abnormal temperature, without masks and so on. Exporting reports with ID skin- surface temperature and mask status,” the revised tender document stated.Based on deep learning technology, Hikvision AcuSense NVRs are able to analyze and classify human and vehicle targets from video streams, as well as to enable efficient video searching by target type.

It is completely safe for the last rites of a loved one to be performed by family members and for them to have a respectful burial or cremation,” says the letter in an appeal to people to see off their loved ones respectfully.The signatories cite Ministry of Health‘s March 15 guidelines on burials which state that the family may view the face of their loved one before they are cremated or buried and all religious rituals that do not require contact are allowed.“There is indeed no scientific reason why people who have lost their loved ones to COVID-19 cannot see the face of their loved one before the last rites, and there is no rational or scientific barrier for them to undertake with due safety the religious and cultural practices associated with death rites which they believe in and which will give them solace, as long as this does not involve crowding and physical contact,” said the writers of the letter noting that the process of grieving begins with this important ritualised moment of seeing the loved one off.Among other signatories to the open letter are Vikram Patel, Shah Alam Khan, Sujatha Rao, Keshav Desiraju, Vandana Prasad, Mathew Varghese, Apoorvanand, Dinesh Mohan, Vikas Bajpai, Imran Qadeer, Syeda Hameed, John Dayal, Navsharan Singh, Natasha Badhwar, Radhika Alkazi, Rita Manchanda, Tapan Bose, Armaan Alkazi and Anwar-ul-Haq.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dignified-farewell-for-covid-deceased-possible-eminent-citizens-write-open-letter-to-public-107187

The first $ 1 billion emergency support was for immediate support to India’s health sector. Another $ 1 billion was approved for cash transfers and food benefits.The latest loan will have to be paid in 19 years, including a five-year grace period.In another decision, the World Bank enhanced its support to the Namami Gange program with a $ 400 million loan to stem pollution and strengthen river basin management. This will be the Bank’s ninth year of backing pollution control in the Ganga.India has already borrowed $ 1.5 billion (about Rs 10,500 crore) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and will soon get another $ 750 million (about Rs 5,000 crore).India has also borrowed $ 2.25 billion (about Rs 17,000 crore) from two China-led multilateral banks. France and Germany too have lent a little less than Rs 5,000 crore to support the PM’s Garib Kalyan Yojna.In all, according to publicly available figures, India has borrowed almost Rs 60,000 crore from abroad to strengthen the health infrastructure, provide livelihood relief and support the MSME sector.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-impact-india-to-borrow-nearly-rs-5-000-crore-from-world-bank-to-support-vulnerable-sections-107185

This includes treatment of victims during the crucial golden hour,” the ministry said in a statement.In this regard, the Transport Ministry has written to principal secretaries and secretaries in charge of transport in all states and union territories soliciting their views on concept note of the scheme by the 10th of this month. The scheme also includes creation of a Motor Vehicle Accident Fund.“The National Health Authority being the nodal agency for PM-JAY (Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri—Jan Arogya Yojana) and having footfall across the country with over 21,000 hospitals on board has been entrusted to implement the scheme,” the statement said.The ministry further said that the scheme envisages “to provide compulsory insurance cover to all road users in the country”. The fund would be utilised for treatment of road accident victims and for payment of compensation to the injured or to the family of person losing life in hit and run cases, the statement said.The proposed modalities of the scheme have been designed in a way that they allow access to quality care at the right time for all individuals, irrespective of their capability to pay, it added.NHA’s robust IT platforms which are used for implementing PM-JAY may be leveraged to provide cashless treatment for road accident victims for treatment including the golden hour (first hour of the accident), the communication to the states said.“All road accident victims of Indian or foreign nationality will be considered eligible for the scheme as its beneficiary.

The national deadline for the project is 2024.Sources in the Ministry said all the districts in Jammu and Kashmir have been divided for attainment of complete saturation of the project in three phases.Seven districts – Ganderbal, Srinagar Shopian, Pulwama, Poonch, Reasi and Samba – had been chosen for the first phase.Doda, Udhampur, Kathua, Jammu, Kulgam, Bandipora and Budgam will attain the saturation level in Phase-2, while Ramban, Rajouri, Kishtwar, Anantnag, Baramula and Kupwara will be taken up in the last phase.The JJM, which was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the ramparts of Red Fort during Independence Day celebrations last year, is a Centrally-sponsored scheme with states chipping in with matching contribution of funds. Its objective is to provide Functional Household Tap Connection (FHTC) to each rural household of the country by 2024. The goal is to improve the lives and ensure “ease of living” of citizens by ensuring “equity and inclusiveness”, so that none is deprived of basic amenitiesThe UT has informed the Ministry that out of more than a total of 18 lakh households, nearly eight lakh had tap connections till May, 2020.It plans to provide remaining more than 10 lakh tap connections by March, 2022. Jammu and Kashmir has potential to provide about nine lakh tap connections by retro-fitting and augmentation of existing piped water supply schemes in 6500 villages.The JJM is a departure from various social sector programmes aiming for sector specific reforms. The focus of this big-ticket reform is service delivery for rural areas, rather than infrastructure creation.Its aims to provide potable water in adequate quantity (at the rate of 55 litre per person per day) and of prescribed quality to rural households on regular and long-term basis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-wants-j-k-to-speed-up-work-for-providing-piped-water-to-households-under-jal-jeevan-mission-107170

Former Delhi Congress leader and co-convict Sajjan Kumar is serving life term in Tihar Jail in Delhi.A Bench headed by Justice Indira Banerjee said he was receiving treatment in a hospital where no relative was allowed."Everything possible is being done for the treatment of the petitioner. The family has no grievance related to the treatment. There is no other specific suggestion forthcoming from the family which they wish to take. The application cannot be entertained," said the Bench which also included Justice BR Gavai.On behalf of Yadav, senior advocate R Basant submitted that the petitioner was in ICU and even in the hospital he was under custody."Two constables are posted outside his ward and no relatives are allowed to visit him," he said."If a person is in ICU or general ward, no relative can visit. Generalisations can't be made in such cases. How can we make such a rule just for him? If allowed in this case, everyone will come."I don't think we can entertain this application unless there is a specific allegation regarding the treatment being meted out to him," Justice Banerjee said dismissing Yadav's plea.Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj opposed Yadav's interim bail plea, saying if it was entertained, it will set a wrong precedent.Yadav submitted that he had already served more than 17 months in prison excluding any period covered by remission and had not been given parole at all.He said he was suffering from various ailments including diabetes, and kidney related problems.Earlier, the Supreme Court had on May 13 refused to give interim bail to  former Delhi Congress leader Sajjan Kumar who is serving life sentence in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.It had also refused to grant parole to convicts Balwan Khokhar and Mahender Yadav. While Khokhar is serving life term, Yadav has been given 10-year imprisonment by the Delhi High Court in the case.The Delhi High Court had on December 17, 2018 awarded life imprisonment to Kumar for the "remainder of his natural life" in a case relating the killing of five Sikhs in Delhi Cantonment's Raj Nagar Part-I area of southwest Delhi on November 1-2 in 1984, and burning down of a Gurudwara in Raj Nagar Part-II.Almost 3,000 people were killed, most of them in Delhi, in the anti-Sikh riots that broke out following the assassination of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1984-anti-sikh-riots-sc-dismisses-interim-bail-plea-of-convict-mahender-yadav-107164

It only wants to help Indian manufacturers to produce more,” he said.There was a bit of a controversy when following a representation that imported agriculture equipment consignments were delayed at ports Minister for Road Transports and Highways, Shipping and MSMEs Nitin Gadkari wrote to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Commerce and Industries Minister Piyush Goyal, seeking early clearance of consignments.Later Gadkari said there was “no arbitrary stopping of goods” at Indian ports and the government was initiating path-breaking reforms to help MSMEs and businesses and make the country self-reliant.He added that his concerns over stopping of goods at Indian ports were “purely context specific” and that he was among the strongest proponents of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’.According to Mahajan, the Narendra Modi government is moving in the right direction through the self-reliant India plan and the decision to hold on shipments was also correct. “There has to be 100 per cent check on all aspects if India has to reduce dependence on Chinese goods, which are not just ruining the Indian industry but are also cheating consumers by way of their inferior quality,” said Mahajan.“One part is increased dependence on Chinese goods, the second is complaints against the Chinese that they evade taxes through under-invoicing and misrepresentation,” he said.“Many times the marking/details on the cover of the shipment is different from what it actually contains. All this requires thorough investigation. Many things cannot be investigated if it is life as usual," Mahajan added.“It is not impossible to displace Chinese goods. The government has also not said it will not allow Chinese goods. It only wants to help Indian manufacturers produce more and make India self-reliant. There will be a proper policy on imports. For now, holding shipments is essential otherwise no one will know what has been happening till now,” Mahajan pointed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/for-long-term-gains-one-should-be-prepared-for-momentary-discomfort-swadeshi-jagran-manch-107163
01-07-2020||New Delhi||After apps, India to ban Chinese firms from highway projects: Gadkari||India will not allow Chinese companies to participate in highway projects, including those through joint ventures, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday amid border standoff with China.Gadakri also said the government will ensure that Chinese investors are not entertained in various sectors like Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs).The senior minister's assertions assume significance against the backdrop of border standoff between India and China in Ladakh that also saw the death of 20 Indian Army personnel last month.Amid escalating tensions, the government on Monday banned 59 apps, mostly having Chinese links, citing threats to national security."We will not give permission to joint ventures that have Chinese partners for road construction. We have taken a firm stand that if they (Chinese companies) come via joint venture in our country, we will not allow it," Gadkari told PTI in an interview.The Road Transport, Highways and MSME minister said a policy will be out soon banning Chinese firms and relaxing norms for Indian companies to expand their eligibility criteria for participation in highway projects.Currently only a few projects which were undertaken much earlier involve some Chinese partners. When asked about this, the Minister said that the new decision will be implemented in current and future tenders.With respect to existing tenders and future bids, Gadkari said rebidding would be done if there are any Chinese joint ventures."We have taken a decision to relax norms for our companies to ensure that they qualify in bidding in large projects. I have directed the Highways Secretary (Giridhar Aramane) and NHAI Chairman (SS Sandhu) to hold a meeting for relaxing technical and financial norms so that our companies can qualify to work," he said.Elaborating on the decision, Gadkari said if a contractor can qualify for a small project, he can also qualify for a large project. "Construction norms are not good so I have asked to change it. We are changing it so that we can encourage Indian companies," he added.According to him, qualification norms for projects are being rationalised to ensure Indian companies do not require to enter into pacts with foreign partners to grab projects."Even if we have to go for foreign joint venture in the areas of technology, consultancy or design, we will not allow Chinese," the Minister said.About the MSME sector, Gadkari said the effort is to enhance the capacity of local production but at the same time foreign investment is being promoted.However, he made it clear that despite decision to encourage foreign investment, Chinese investors would not be allowed."For upgradation of technology, research, consultancy and other works, we will encourage foreign investment and joint ventures in MSMEs but in case of Chinese we will not entertain them," he said.On stopping of consignments from China at Indian ports, the minister said there is "no arbitrary stopping of goods" at Indian ports and the government is initiating path-breaking reforms to help MSMEs and businesses in a bid to make the country self-reliant."It is a good step. The imports from China will be discouraged and the country will take large strides towards self-reliance," the Minister said and added that he is among the strongest proponents of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat'.Gadkari said that he had urged departments concerned to expedite clearance of consignments which were booked two to three months in advance before the situation took its present shape.After a representation from a farmers and traders' body that imported agriculture equipment consignments were delayed at ports, Gadkari in a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Commerce and Industries Minister Piyush Goyal had sought early clearance of the said consignments.There are reports that customs authorities at Chennai and Vishakhapatnam ports are conducting extra scrutiny of consignments from China.Gadkari, as per the information, did not mention the name of the country from where these equipments were imported."Indian business has the strength and skills to grow further and power our journey towards self-reliance. Under strong leadership of PM Narendra Modi, the Government of India is proactive and initiating path-breaking reforms that will help businesses and MSMEs," he said. Most of these equipments, as per the information, pertain to spraying devices for pesticide control as the same had been diverted to urban areas during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.Amid heightened border tensions with China, Indian customs officials have started physical inspection of all consignments coming from the neighbouring country specially Chennai and Vishakhapatnam ports.

01-07-2020||Arun JoshiJammu||India-China standoff: Communication gap at root of Pangong Tso’s explosive situation||Pangong Tso (lake), the flashpoint between India and China in eastern Ladakh, has reached this pass due to cumulative failure of not comprehending its strategic importance and communication gaps.Today the situation is far worse than the days when things would defuse with Indian and Chinese troops conducting aggressive drills and then backing off. The threats now are multiple, just as the shimmering multi-coloured waters of the lake.As things stand today, any trigger could spell catastrophe. The military commander-level talks, along with back channel diplomacy, have not been able to bring about the much needed thaw. This time, the standoff is more menacing because the Chinese have entrenched themselves in Chushul sector, which includes the 135 km long lake -- of which 90km is with China, while the rest is with India.Had successive governments in India paid attention to the need for regular interaction with people, soldiers, and commanders in these strategic locations, today's situation could have been avoided.In 2009, when reports of Chinese troops harassing people living close to the borderline started trickling in, then Jammu and Kashmir Governor NN Vohra undertook an extensive tour of the region and visited all strategic locations, including the Pangong lake. He travelled on boat up to the Indian boundary at Thakuing, met people living there, and enquired from them about the developing contours of the situation and the requirements for peace.During the tour, Vohra had also visited Siachen glacier, reckoned as the highest battleground of the world at heights varying from 18,000 to 21,000 feet above sea level, and spent time in Diskit and Thoise.Thoise is the airfield in Ladakh from where the IAF operates. The idea of the overnight visit was to comprehend the security challenges and identify the timely responses needed, people familiar with Vohra’s visit told The Tribune.This approach of visiting strategically important places was stopped after he left the state of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2018.Strategic assets require close monitoring by people at the helm of affairs, as sustained interaction with stakeholders is key. The moment communication channels are snapped, we have the high probablity of landing in a situation such as the one at Pangong today.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-standoff-communication-gap-at-root-of-pangong-tsos-explosive-situation-107161
01-07-2020||New Delhi||'Oxford COVID-19 vaccine safe for people with weak immunity'||Volunteers have begun participating in Brazil's first clinical trial of Oxford COVID-19 vaccine. The ChAdOx1 vaccine technology is based on an adenovirus, and it is considered very safe, even in people with a weak immune system.The vaccine being used in the Brazilian trial, on 5,000 volunteers, is similar to the one used in the UK and South Africa. The ChAdOx1 vaccine technology is based on an adenovirus, another virus, which causes mild upper respiratory tract infections. "We have removed some of the adenovirus genes, so that when we use it as a vaccine, the adenovirus can't spread through the body. That makes it very safe, even in people with a weak immune system. But because it is still a live virus, it is good at inducing a strong immune response after vaccination", said Professor Sarah Gilbert, Nuffield Department of Medicine, Oxford University. Gilbert gave a short talk while participating in an informal discussion with ambassadors of the UN member states.According to the Oxford University, many strains of adenoviruses infect humans; therefore people have developed antibodies against it. "We started with an adenovirus, which was isolated from a chimpanzee and doesn't circulate in human populations, so there is no prior immunity to it. Then we add a gene to encode one of the proteins from the pathogen that we want to vaccinate against -- for SARS-CoV-2 we use the spike protein, which covers the surface of the coronavirus," added Gilbert.The ChAdOx1 vaccine technology has been used to produce candidate vaccines against a number of pathogens including flu, chikungunya, Zika and another coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).According to Gilbert, if Oxford's vaccine is successful, others' will be as well.  Emphasizing on the Ebola experience, she added that the aim should be to produce multiple vaccines to be licensed rather than end up with a monopoly. "But it is not likely that ALL candidate vaccines now in development will be effective, and many will require more than one dose. Vaccine developers should work together to compare immune responses, and assess different vaccine platforms. Technologies, which can be manufactured in large scale and low costs should be prioritized, but they also need to be highly effective", added Gilbert.The vaccine developed at the Oxford Jenner Institute is currently on trial in the UK, where for the clinical trial over 4,000 participants have enrolled and additional enrollment of 10, 000 participants is planned. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine has been licenced to AstraZeneca.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oxford-covid-19-vaccine-safe-for-people-with-weak-immunity-107160

The discussions reflected the commitment of both sides to reduce the tensions along the LAC," said a source.

Long-distance travel for non-essential purposes will not be permitted.The order says social distancing norms, of maintaining a minimum six feet distance, shall be followed at all time.In "emergent and special" cases, the zonal Deputy Commissioner of Police is empowered to grant exemption, he said.

The two other drugs, in the so-called COVID-19 package, which Patanjali announced was registered as Ayurvedic drugs for 'Kasa and Savasa'.Earlier this June, the Trust had applied for the licences with the state authority.The Ministry letter to Ramdev reads: "The proposed three drugs—Divya Coronil tablet, Divya Shwashari Vati 540MG and Divya Shwashari Vati 350 MG should be marketed as per the scope of the licence issued by Uttarakhand Licensing Authority, Ayurvedic and Unani Services. On the package and label of these drugs no claim of cure of COVID-19 should be mentioned."The Ministry added that Patanjali Trust had initiated clinical trials for COVID-19 therapy, as per the government guideline, and the Trust could continue those trials as per the required procedure.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-allows-ramdev-to-market-patanjalis-coronil-as-immunity-booster-not-authorised-for-covid-therapy-107156

This is due to our concerted efforts," he said, asking people to follow the social distancing norms and wear masks religiously.He added, "Situation is improving in Delhi in the last few days. However, there is no room for complacency. This virus is unpredictable. We must continue our efforts with more vigour." The Chief Minister, however, hinted that the situation predicted by his government a month ago did not turn out to be accurate."We had predicted that by June 30, there will be one lakh total cases and sixty thousand active cases, but now there are only 26,000 active cases, almost one-third. With the help of people, doctor, nurses, we have now controlled the situation," he added.Last month, he had projected an exponential growth in the city's COVID cases. "We would hit one lakh cases and would require 15,000 beds by June 30," he had warned."There was fear. We have now arranged 15,000 beds in Delhi, but there are only 5,800 people admitted right now. One month ago, there were only 8,500 beds. The number of COVID-19 patients is decreasing," Kejriwal added.The 51-year-old leader further said that the recovery rate is also improving. One month ago, 38 per cent had recovered which has now improved to 68 per cent, he said.He went on to say that the daily cases have also come down. "On June 23, the city recorded 4,000 new cases and yesterday only 2,200 tested positive." Kejriwal asserted that the death rate has decreased while testing has increased drastically. "Earlier out of 100 people who were tested, 31 used to be found positive. Now, when we test 100 people, we find only 13 people positive," he added.Meanwhile, India recorded a spike of 18,653 cases in the last 24 hours, pushing the total tally of Covid-19 cases to 5,85,493, with the number of fatalities mounting to 17,400, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said on Wednesday.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/situation-improving-but-no-room-for-complacency-delhi-cm-107148

Hence, you are instructed to vacate the quarters within 30 days from the date of receipt of this notice, failing which further proceedings will be initiated for eviction", said the June 27 notice, copy of which has been made available to media.As she ceased to be a BSNL employee, Fathima was ineligible to occupy the company quarters, it said.Fathima was sacked from employment by the BSNL in May this year for her intentional act of outraging the religious feelings of devotees through social media posts.The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights had earlier sought a report from police on the video matter and said case should be registered against the woman under various sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.The activist has last week moved the Kerala High Court seeking anticipatory bail, apprehending arrest in the POCSO case.After the Supreme Court allowed women in traditionally barred age groups of 10-50 into the Sabarimala temple in September 2018, Fathima made an attempt to enter the hill shrine, but had to retreat following protests by Hindu activists and devotees.

01-07-2020||Washington||India finds a lot of support in US for banning TikTok and other Chinese apps||India's ban on 59 Chinese apps, including the popular TikTok, has been widely noted in the US, including by some prominent lawmakers, who have urged the American government to follow suit as it is believed that the short video-sharing app is a major security risk to the country.India on Monday banned 59 apps with Chinese links, including TikTok and UC Browser, saying they were prejudicial to sovereignty, integrity and security of the country.The ban, which comes in the backdrop of India's current stand-off along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh with Chinese troops, is also applicable for WeChat and Bigo Live.“India bans TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps in the wake of deadly clash,” powerful Republican Senator John Cornyn said in a tweet as he tagged a news report in The Washington Post.Republican Congressman Rick Crawford tweeted, “TikTok must go and it should have been gone yesterday.”Last week, US National Security Advisor, Robert O'Brien, had alleged that the Chinese Government is using TikTok for its own purposes.“On TikTok, a Chinese-owned social media platform with over 40 million American users, probably a lot of your kids, and younger colleagues, accounts criticising the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) and Beijing's policies are routinely removed or deleted,” O'Brien said in his public remarks.At least two bills are pending in the US Congress to ban federal government officials from using TikTok on their cell phones, reflecting such a sentiment can gain momentum in the US after India's decision.“Would that be the same Chinese TikTok that was used to tank attendance at the Tulsa Rally?” tweeted Peter Navarro, Assistant to the US President for Trade and Manufacturing Policy, as he tagged a news report from The New York Times on India's decision to ban these Chinese social media apps.Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham urged the US to do the same. “LEADING THE WAY, WHERE'S THE U.S.? India bans dozens of Chinese apps including TikTok” she said in a tweet.Author Gordon Chang said that India just banned 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok. “Why can't the US do the same?” he asked.According to Forbes, with the release of the new clipboard warning in the beta version of iOS 14, now with developers, TikTok seems to have been caught abusing the clipboard in a quite extraordinary way.“So it seems that TikTok didn't stop this invasive practice back in April as promised after all,” it said.An amendment moved to the “Moving Forward Act” in the US House of Representatives being debated this week prohibits officers of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) using the TikTok cell phone app.Republican Senator Joshua David Hawley introduced a legislation in April prohibiting federal employees from using the social media video application TikTok on government-issued devices."This is a necessary step to protect the security of the US,” he said. A similar legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Ken Buck.“It (TikTok) is owned by a Chinese company that includes Chinese Communist Party members in leadership and it is required under Chinese law to share user data with Beijing,” said Senator Hawley, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, during a recent Congressional hearing.“TikTok has admitted that it has sent user data to China. To put it bluntly, this is a major security risk for the American people,” Hawley said.“What kind of data is TikTok collecting as it runs on our phones? A heck of a lot more than you would think. Images, of course, that users post. But TikTok also collects information about the messages that you send, about the apps that you use - the other apps on your phone,” he said.“It collects the sites that you visit. It collects your search history. It collects your keystrokes. It collects your location data. It stores all of this and maybe lots, lots more. And I can tell you, as the father of two small children who already have many of their friends on social media even though they're quite young, I find this absolutely horrifying. And we know that it's a national security risk,” Howley said.According to Clyde Wallace, deputy assistant director of the Cyber Division at the FBI, where he oversees Cyber Division Operations and the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force, TikTok is one example of an application that the average citizen doesn't understand the implications of what's behind it and what data can flow from an application like that's basically controlled by a state- sponsored actor.“I think that lends into the bigger threat that China poses today in that it's a holistic society approach to the United States. It's not just the TikTok application. It's the data warehouses that store that data. Whether they be here in the United States, owned by the Chinese, or within the Chinese borders themselves where that information is stored,” Wallace said.In a statement on Tuesday, TikTok India Head Nikhil Gandhi said the company, which has some 200 million subscribers in India, has not shared any information of its users in India with any foreign government, including the Chinese government, and that it places the highest importance on user privacy and integrity.The list of Chinese apps that have been banned by India also includes Helo, Likee, CamScanner, Vigo Video, Mi Video Call - Xiaomi, Clash of Kings as well as e-commerce platforms Club Factory and Shein.

01-07-2020||Aditi Tandon||You’re a nonviolent army: Rahul Gandhi to nurses||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 1Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday interacted with four Indian nurses working in different countries including India and said they were a nonviolent army fighting the Covid-19 virus.Gandhi assured during the interaction that he would take up the issue of pending Delhi government compensation to frontline Covid warriors who have fallen to the virus.The issue was flagged by Indian nurse Vipin Krishnan, currently employed at AIIMS New Delhi, during the interaction.“Two nurses have died in Delhi, they were from South India. One X-ray technician. One retired doctor from AIIMS passed away and one serving person in the sanitation department, we lost him unfortunately. However, they are yet to receive the compensation of Rs 1 crore announced by the Delhi Government,” Krishnan, who hails from Kerala, said.Krishnan also sought Gandhi’s help for inclusion of nurses in the risk allowance category, saying nurses were fighting a bio-war like the army.“Yes you’re a nonviolent army,” Gandhi said, assuring help.The conversation involved Krishnan, Anu Ragnat, an Indian nurse from Gandhi’s Lok Sabha segment Wayanad and currently working in New Zealand, Narendra Singh, originally from Rajasthan’s Sikar and currently in Australia and Sherlylmol Puravady, an Indian nurse settled in United Kingdom.The discussion saw Ragnat hailing New Zealand for its “hard and early response to the virus”, Narendra Singh stressing on the importance of hand hygiene and Sheryl speaking of how despite working in acute medical unit in Liverpool neither she nor her colleagues caught the virus.Gandhi used the occasion to express concern that many hospitals in Delhi were not being allowed to test Covid-19, which meant many private hospitals didn’t know if the patients they were encountering had the virus.Krishnan laid out the data to highlight low testing in Delhi where cases have been surging.“On May 27, the infection rate in Delhi was 13.7%. We were doing 7000 tests per day. By June 12-13, our infection rate had crossed 30% and we are doing under 5000 tests per day. This is surprising given that our deaths and infection rates are increasing, but we have reduced testing,” Krishnan said.Krishnan also cited AIIMS Director‘s projection that a peak would arrive in mid-July. “Delhi CM has stated that they are expecting 5.5 lakh cases. We have 10,000 beds in Delhi. How will we manage?” Krishnan said.The half-an-hour long interaction also saw Sheryl laud people in the UK for being respectful to nurses. “We have dedicated shopping time for the NHS staff or the care workers. Every Thursday the government is, you know, putting it as the clapping for carers and things like that. So it is so supportive, all supermarkets are very supportive,” Sheryl said.Gandhi also asked why Indian nurses were so coveted worldwide and the answer was — they are dedicated and diligent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/youre-a-nonviolent-army-rahul-gandhi-to-nurses-107116
01-07-2020||Mumbai||HC permits minor rape victim to terminate 25-week pregnancy||The Bombay High Court has permitted a 17-year-old rape victim to terminate her 25-week pregnancy despite a report submitted by the civic-run KEM Hospital here advising against the abortion.A division bench of Justices K K Tated and Milind Jadhav gave the order on Tuesday while hearing the girl’s petition filed through her father, seeking permission to undergo medical termination of her 25-week pregnancy.As per the plea, the girl is a victim of rape and a case against the perpetrator is lodged at the Vakola police station in Mumbai.Provisions of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act do not permit a woman to terminate pregnancy, if it has crossed 20 weeks and she will have to seek the high courts permission to do so.The victim, in her plea seeking permission to undergo medical termination of pregnancy, said her mental and physical health is at risk.The court last week directed the petitioner to appear before the medical board of the KEM Hospital in Mumbai for examination and sought a report from the board.The board in its report advised against termination and said if the pregnancy is continued, a healthy baby could be delivered and the petitioner and her family could then decide if they want to care of the baby or put him/her up for adoption.The board said the petitioner should be able to take care of the baby with psychological support and counselling.The bench in its order, however, noted that in the present case the pregnancy was caused by rape and hence, there is no doubt that continuance of this pregnancy “is causing a grave injury to the mental health of the petitioner”.Therefore, the court permitted the petitioner to undergo medical termination of the pregnancy.“In case the child is born alive during the termination procedure and if the petitioner and her parents are not willing or are not in a position to take responsibility of the baby, then the state government and the agencies concerned will have to assume full responsibility of the child, the court directed. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-permits-minor-rape-victim-to-terminate-25-week-pregnancy-107115
01-07-2020||New Delhi||It’s about talent, not platform: TikTok influencers after app ban||She’s just 23, had 2.8 million followers on TikTok and was making up to Rs 30,000 a month but Niharika Jain, one of the many ‘influencers’ who found money and fame on the short form video app, is not complaining about the government banning it.After all, it is about talent and she can quite easily switch to another platform, Jain said after the government on Monday evening banned 59 apps with Chinese links, including the hugely popular TikTok, saying they were prejudicial to the sovereignty, integrity and security of the country.“We are content creators and it is our talent that makes us popular. If not on TikTok, I can use some other platform to showcase my talent,” Jain told PTI.The mass communication graduate was freelancing with various reality shows before taking a leap of faith to become a full time influencer on TikTok, posting videos about trending styles and fashion hacks.She joined the platform in August and quickly gained 2.8 million followers, making Rs 15,000-30,000 for every brand video or a campaign.    So yes, the government ban was a shock.“Posting videos on TikTok was my bread and butter, but I understand the need for this government move. I completely support Mr Narendra Modi,” the young woman said.There are several others like her.They may have found stardom and even a possible career on Tik Tok but view the government ban as just a temporary setback and say they will soon find their groove on another platform.TikTok is a short-form mobile video — dance, lip-sync, comedy — sharing platform. It is owned by ByteDance, a Beijing-based internet technology company founded in 2012.TikTok had over 200 million users in India, most of them in the 16-24 age bracket, a company insider said.        Its arrival in India in 2017 opened the doors to fame for many ordinary Indians — be it Jain or a schoolgirl from Delhi, a couple from a town in Rajasthan or a dancer from a village in Jharkhand.While these influencers are thankful for getting a platform to showcase their skills — from dance and music to fashion and food – many said the sole reason for their popularity is their talent.Faridabad-based Sukrit Jain, also 23, created content under the handle TheGreatIndianFoodie and said he is unaffected by the ban.“So what if TikTok is banned. Awesome content won’t stop coming and will never end,” the influencer said.“It’s our talent that brought us here, and I’m sure that if not on this platform, then on some other. But we will surely rise again soon,” he added.Sukrit Jain has already started expanding his content on other platforms like YouTube and Instagram.TikTok might not have been a source of income for BJP leader Sonali Phogat but she was quite a star on the platform, where she would post her dance videos. Phogat had over 280,000 followers on the platform.Phogat, who said she has been in politics “for the last 13 years” and has also done a stint as an actor, admitted that her videos on TikTok made her more accessible to the people of her home state Haryana.       “My presence on TikTok had added to the popularity of my political personality. I was able to reach out to more number of people through these videos,” she said.        But no complaints from her either.“I stand by the government’s decision because through these apps and other Chinese products, crores of rupees of Indian money goes into China. They have gained economically from us and now they are attacking our soldiers using those resources,” Phogat told PTI.         “We can always use other apps. I am also active on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, but the best thing would be to have an Indian app. Why should we depend on others when we have educated and able youth in our own country?” she asked.The move to ban Tik Tok comes in the backdrop of the current stand-off along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh with Chinese troops.        Among the other banned Chinese apps are UC Browser, Helo, Likee, CamScanner, Vigo Video, Mi Video Call – Xiaomi, and Clash of Kings.Some influencers also feel that banning Tik Tok is not much of a loss because of its “non-democratic algorithm”.Like Instagram couple Abhiraj and Niyati, who post under the handle ‘Following Love’. They never signed up on TikTok.“The platform algorithm is not democratic. Searching for a creator or following them on TikTok does not guarantee you will see their content. As against this, on other platforms, you see content from the people you choose to follow,” they said on email.Motivational speaker Mahendra Dogney with nine million followers on Tik Tok and 1.49 million YouTube said many people would be affected by the ban.“We had it good so far. My work is platform-based… I take offline seminars too. Still I wouldn’t want it to be banned,” he said.“I agree if it’s harmful to the country’s security, the issue should be resolved. But there are so many Indian creators who are literally running their households entirely through Tik Tok. Whatever they are earning is because of this platform,” he added.According to Viraj Sheth, co-founder and CEO of Monk Entertainment, a digital entertainment company, the ban will affect the marketing strategies of Indian brands, especially those in the space of fast consumer goods, targeting not just metros but also tier I and tier II cities.“A lot of brands catering to a younger target audience had started diverting 25-30 per cent of their social media spends to TikTok. They will now have to reconfigure this strategy,” he said.An Indian alternative may already be there.Amidst demands for home-grown apps, Chingari has seen an increase in the number of subscribers. Similar to TikTok, it is a short video-sharing app launched on Google Play in November 2018, and on iOS in January 2019.Besides downloading and uploading videos, the app also allows users to chat with friends, and interact with new people.The app has crossed 2.5 million downloads.“In the last few days, we have witnessed a 400 per cent growth in the subscribers of the app,” co-founder Biswatma Nayak said in a statement on Monday. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/its-about-talent-not-platform-tiktok-influencers-after-app-ban-107111
01-07-2020||United Nations||2 agricultural experts from India named by UN chief to scientific group for 2021 food summit||Two eminent agricultural experts hailing from India have been named members of an international scientific group, aimed to offer foremost scientific evidence for sustainable food systems, established by UN chief Antonio Guterres ahead of a global food summit next year.Prof Rattan Lal of Ohio State University and Dr Uma Lele of the International Association of Agricultural Economists (IAAE) are among the Scientific Group Members named by Guterres, a statement issued by the UN spokesperson said.Lal, a pre-eminent Indian-American soil scientist, was named last month as the 2020 World Food Prize Laureate for developing and mainstreaming a soil-centric approach to increasing food production that conserves natural resources and mitigates climate change.Lal serves as distinguished university professor of Soil Science and founding Director of the Carbon Management and Sequestration Centre at The Ohio State University.A native of India and citizen of the United States, Lal has in his career of over 50 years and across four continents promoted innovative soil-saving techniques that benefited the livelihoods of more than 500 million smallholder farmers, improved the food and nutritional security of more than two billion people and saved hundreds of millions of hectares of natural tropical ecosystems.Lele, the first woman to be awarded a PhD in agricultural economics by Cornell University, was elected President Elect of the International Association of Agricultural Economists in July 2018.According to Lele's profile on her website, she has five decades of experience in research, operations, policy analysis and evaluation in the World Bank, universities and international organisations.Guterres, in collaboration with the United Nations (UN) Rome-based Agencies, will convene the Food Systems Summit in 2021, as a critical contribution to the Decade of Action to deliver the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).The summit aims to raise global awareness to understand the food systems challenges that nations must solve, build a global conversation on the way in which nations produce, process and consume food and galvanise global actions and commitments to change food systems to provide safe, nutritious food for all within the planetary boundaries.As noted by the Secretary-General in the recent policy brief on the Impact of COVID-19 on food security and nutrition, investment both during and after the coronavirus crisis can accelerate movement towards food systems that are more inclusive and resilient to future pandemics and that offer better protections for all, the UN statement said.With a view to facilitating this process and its success, Guterres formed a number of support structures. A multi-stakeholder Advisory Committee will provide strategic guidance and feedback on the Summit's overall development and implementation.An independent Scientific Group will bring to bear the foremost scientific evidence, and help expand the base of shared knowledge about experiences, approaches, and tools for driving sustainable food systems.UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed will Chair the Advisory Committee, which will comprise Member State representatives as well as senior officials of relevant UN agencies, other international organisations, and individual experts across different sectors, including farmers, indigenous peoples, civil society, researchers, academics, young people and business leaders.The Scientific Group will be Chaired by Dr Joachim von Braun of Bonn University, Germany.

01-07-2020||Vijay Mohan||Home to IAF’s latest war bird, Rafale, country's oldest airbase at Ambala has an amazing history||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 1When the French-made Rafale multi-role fighter aircraft procured by India touch down at Ambala later this month, the country’s oldest airbase would have witnessed a century of amazing transformation and borne testimony to some of the most significant moments in Indian military aviation.What was initially an unpaved strip catering to flimsy biplanes of yore is now a massive sprawl gearing up to house one of the most advanced flying machines. The first batch of six Rafales out of the contracted 36, are reported to arrive at the frontline base on July 27, with a major infrastructure upgrade, including hardened shelters, hangars and maintenance facilities coming up over the past three years.“Ambala's tryst with military aviation dates back to 1919 when ‘Camp Umballa’ was created and 99 Squadron of the Royal Air Force (RAF), equipped with Bristol fighters, was located here. Ambala's next ‘avatar’ was as headquarters of the RAF India Command in 1922,” reads a plaque at the air force station. It saw several changes in its role before coming to its present designation of No. 7 Wing on August 1, 1954.In the early days aircraft such as De Havilland 9A and Bristol F2B flew out of Ambala. As air operations in India began increasing, more officers were transferred to Ambala and it was made a permanent air force base on June 18, 1938. The then Advanced Flying Training School was also based here. It was from this airbase that Spitfires and Harvards flown by Instructors took part in the fighting in the Srinagar Valley in the 1947-48 Kashmir Operations.In the pre-Independence era, Ambala has also been the home of No. 1 Squadron, the first Indian Air Force unit that had been initially raised at Karachi. After operations against tribesmen in the North Western Frontier Province, the squadron moved to Ambala in the mid-’30s. March 1939 saw one of the most significant events in the IAF, when then Flight Lieutenant (later Air Marshal) Subroto Mukerjee took over the squadron from Squadron Leader CH Smith at Ambala, becoming the first Indian officer to command a squadron. Subroto was promoted as Squadron Leader in August. He had earlier become the first Indian officer to become a flight commander. By then all three flight commanders in the squadron were Indians.Also read: Behind massive build-up at LAC is the IAF’s never-seen-before airlift capabilityImmediately after Independence, Marshal of the Indian Air Force Arjan Singh, then a Group Captain, took command of Ambala airbase. He led the first flypast over the Red Fort to mark Independence Day.In the early years after Independence, the Indian government could access the eastern frontiers only through air and it was during this time that Ambala airbase played an important role in controlling the tribal disturbances in the North East. It was then also made the centre for aerial photographic survey, a new advancement in this field which proved to be of great value later.The Flying Instructors School (FIS) was formed at Ambala on April 1, 1948, with Tigermoth aircraft, but was relocated to Tambaram near Chennai in October 1954. Later, Ambala operated Vampires, Toofanis, Mysteres and Hunters in a combat role. The airbase was attacked in 1965 by Pakistan’s B-57 bombers. However, apart from damage to a cathedral that was on one side of the airfield, no harm occurred.The only IAF squadron to have received the Param Vir Chakra, the highest gallantry award, No.18 Squadron, was based at Ambala with Gnat fighters when a detachment was moved to Srinagar for operations in 1965. Flying Officer Nirmaljit Singh Sekhon, the posthumous recipient, was part of the detachment. Under the conditions of the 1948 ceasefire agreement with Pakistan, India was not allowed to station fighter aircraft at Srinagar during peacetime and the detachment had to be rushed to Srinagar on declaration of hostilities.  In May 1999, the No. 1 Squadron, also known as Tigers, revisited their old home for undertaking serious war business. Now equipped with the Mirage-2000 the Tigers undertook electronic intelligence gathering and escort duties for aircraft flying strike missions and recce sorties. A total of 234 operational sorties were flown from Ambala as part of Operation Safed Sagar during the Kargil conflict, which included several missions at night. More recently, the Mirage 2000s are reported to have operated from Ambala during the strike across the Line of Control on terrorist camps at Balakote in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.When the IAF upgraded the MiG-21 Bis to the Bison version in the mid-2000s, No. 3 Squadron, the Cobras based at Ambala, was the first to receive them. It was also with this squadron that the IAF’s first woman combat pilot, Bhawana Kanth, flew her maiden solo sortie in a fighter aircraft from this airbase.Not many know that a part of the Old Grand Trunk Road once passed through the present area of the airfield. An ancient bridge has been renovated to its original specifications and is being maintained by the Air Force. The area is the venue of demonstrations such as sky diving and aerobatics. In February 2003, the remains of a Supermarine Spitfire were discovered by locals in a riverbed near Ambala, which was reconstructed to its original shape as a display item at the airfield.Located adjacent to the Chandigarh-Delhi Highway in the state of Haryana approximately 240 km east of the border with Pakistan, Ambala also houses two squadrons of the Anglo-French origin Jaguar deep penetration strike aircraft along with ancillary units and allied establishments.The Rafales to be based at Ambala would be inducted into No. 17 Squadron, the Golden Arrows, which earlier flew the MiG-21s and was resurrected last year after having remained “number plated” since 2011. Of the two Rafale squadrons being formed, the other would be based at Hasimara in the east.According to IAF officers, Ambala was chosen for housing Rafales in the western sector due to several factors such as depth from the border, base infrastructure and technical facilities, airspace availability for local flying and training as well as allocation of IAF assets at other airbases in the region. A team of IAF pilots and engineers have trained in France and the jets are being flown to Ambala in Haryana by the Indian pilots from Istres commune in southern France, with a stopover at Al Dhafra airbase in the UAE.HighlightsAmbala's tryst with military aviation dates back to 1919Served as HQs of the RAF India Command in 1922Spitfires and Harvards from Ambala took part in 1947-48 Kashmir OperationsFirst Indian officer to command a squadron was at AmbalaThe only IAF squadron to receive a Param Vir Chakra flew from AmbalaThe only Marshal of the Indian Air Force commanded the baseMirage 2000 aircraft operated from Ambala during Kargil conflict and Balakote strikesIAF’s first woman combat pilot made her maiden solo fighter flight from AmbalaAmbala also houses two squadrons of Jaguar attack aircraft||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/home-to-iafs-latest-war-bird-rafale-countrys-oldest-airbase%C2%A0at-ambala-has-an-amazing-history-107085
01-07-2020||Aditi Tandon||At least 70 Indian doctors have died so far while on Covid duty||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 1Lakhs of doctors continue to risk their lives daily to stand between people and the Covid-19 infection. Since the first reported case of the virus on January 30, at least 70 Indian doctors are feared dead on the frontlines of the Covid-19 battlefield where health care workers are at highest risk.Community health experts say the government must urgently launch infection control audits across hospitals to determine the scale of dangers the health care workers face during the pandemic.“It is perhaps no coincidence that 2020 is Year of the Nurse and Midwife, the World Health Day theme. Health care workers, including doctors, have faced the greatest risks in the Covid-19 pandemic. More than 2,000 health care workers have tested positive for Covid-19 in Delhi alone. An earlier ICMR report found 1,073 positive cases among health care workers till May 23. It’s time the government analysed data of infections and deaths among health care workers and conducted infection control audits,” Rajib Dasgupta of JNU’s Community Health Department says.Going by the global experience, Covid infection rate in health care workers is at least 1 per cent. The last reported Covid death of an Indian doctor was as recently as Sunday. Dr Sayeed Ahmad Ali tested positive on June 8 and died of lung collapse at a Noida hospital. Last week, 52-year-old Aseem Gupta, an anaesthetist at Delhi’s LNJP Hospital, died of the virus in the line of duty. His wife, also Covid positive, survived. Delhi alone has seen at least four serving doctors die of Covid.Delhi Medical Council (DMC) has now issued an advisory to all members to treat every patient they see as Covid positive. “Doctors in non-Covid facilities are the most vulnerable. We have asked doctors to treat every patient as Covid positive and maintain the highest level of precaution at all times. At least 70 Indian doctors have died of Covid so far. This could well be an undercount,” DMC Registrar Girish Tyagi says.Another challenge for doctors is the availability of personal protective equipment. Even AIIMS New Delhi has lost frontline staff to Covid. Former president of AIIMS Resident Doctors Association AS Malhi says the institute has adequate PPEs but that’s not the case in all hospitals.“This Doctor’s Day, we appeal to the Centre to ensure PPE stocks at each hospital and clinic,” says Malhi in a grim reminder of a Delhi mohalla clinic doctor UK Ghosh and his wife both succumbing to Covid-19 recently.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-least-70-indian-doctors-have-died-so-far-while-on-covid-duty-107081

01-07-2020||---||Rahul takes jibe at PM Modi||New Delhi, June 30 The Congress today said PM Narendra Modi’s address was much ado about nothing and could have easily been replaced with a government notification about the ongoing free ration scheme for the poor. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who before the PM’s address asked him to tell the country how and when he will throw out the Chinese from Indian territory, later posted an Urdu couplet on Twitter, taking a jibe at the PM. The couplet in question was routinely used by late Sushma Swaraj to attack the Congress-led UPA when she was the Leader of the  Opposition in Lok Sabha. “Tu idhar udhar ki naa baat kar, yeh bata ki kaafilaa kyun lutaa, mujhe rehzanon se gilaa nahi, Teri rehbari ka sawaal hai,” wrote Rahul after PM’s address. Congress spokesperson Supriya Srinate, at a press conference, later accused the PM of headline management and said he did not look the enemy in the eye. She was referring to the LAC standoff. “The PM belied our expectations. His address was much ado about nothing. It seems his top priority is Bihar polls as he referred to Chhat Puja in his speech. The hype and buildup was aimed at headline management,” she said. The Congress said its biggest expectation was that the PM would gather the courage and the will to reply to China and look it in the eye. “The PM once again shied away,” Shrinate said.  Rahul has been attacking PM Modi and his government over the India-China border standoff in eastern Ladakh, that led to the death of 20 Indian soldiers in a violent clash between the troops of the two countries on June 15.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-takes-jibe-at-pm-modi-106796

To be initially stationed at the Air Force Station, Uttarlai, the single pilot chopper will be deployed in Barmer, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Jodhpur and Nagaur.It has a pesticide carrying capacity of 250 litres (for one trip) and can cover about 25 to 50 hectares in one flight, according to an official statement.Meanwhile, an order has also been placed for five aerial spraying machines from a UK-based company, which will be placed in IAF helicopters.Along with ground equipment like sprays and vehicles, deployment of helicopters in locust control operations follows the need to strengthen air control capabilities, the government said, adding that it was for the first time that the drones were being being used in such operationsAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation’s Locust Status Update of June 27, swarms accumulating in northern Somalia are likely to migrate across the Indian Ocean to the summer breeding areas along the Indo-Pakistan border.Virtual meetings of technical officers of Southwest Asian countries (Afghanistan, India, Iran and Pakistan) are taking place on a weekly basis, the government said.

Over the past three days, India has touched base with three of its strategic partners, with France clearly acknowledging it is New Delhi’s close ally in the region.'Prabal Dosti’ initiativeIndia and Kazakhstan will have a joint peacekeeping establishment that will be built by New Delhi. The expectation is that the facility at the Kazakhstan Partnership for Peace Training Centre (KAZCENT) in Almaty will be ready in three months. The fact that the centre is located at the Kazakhstani Ministry of Defence indicates the country’s trust in India.In fact, the Kazakhstan military’s first outing on peacekeeping operations three years back was in a unique co-deployment arrangement with the Indian Army. A Kazakh Army company was integrated with an Indian Army battalion that was deployed on the Lebanon-Israel border.

National security, however, was not among the reasons for the demand for ban at that time. A statement by TikTok India gives an impression that the ban is provisional and the IT Ministry has asked the company for “clarification”. Nikhil Gandhi, TikTok’s India chief, said the company would not share information with anyone.The ban comes at an inopportune time for TikTok’s Beijing-based ByteDance, which was planning a massive ramp up of operations in India. But in a bigger blow to China, the campaign against TikTok, including by US senators, has come at a time when the app was emerging as the first example of Chinese soft power in the form of a globally successful social network.Though the Chinese Foreign Ministry withheld any more comments, its mission here said the grounds for the ban on 59 apps was “ambiguous and far-fetched, grated against the general trend of global trade and e-commerce and was not conducive to consumer interests and market competition in India”. The Chinese Embassy showed concern about the employment prospects of the Indian staff, the interests of Indian users and livelihood of creators and entrepreneur.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/grounds-for-ban-on-59-apps-ambiguous-106973

As I tried making the payment, all tickets had been booked. It was 8.03 pm then.

Healthcare workers face the greatest risk. It’s time the government analysed data and conducted infection control audits,” says Rajib Dasgupta of JNU’s Community Health Department. — TNS/PTIAnother flu strain found in ChinaBeijing: A new strain of flu that has the potential to become a pandemic has been found in China by scientists, the media reported.

01-07-2020||New Delhi||Talks on, no sign of de-escalation yet||Even as the Lt General-level Commanders of India and China were locked in yet another marathon meeting on Tuesday discussing the disengagement, the assessment on the Indian side was “to be ready for a long haul”.Military developments in the past three-four days indicate that there could be no immediate let-up along the 826-km Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh. The series of meetings have not led to anything that can be called “de-escalation” or stepping towards status quo ante as on the first week of May. The third round of meeting at Chushul was on till 10 pm.Zhao Lijian, Spokesman, Chinese Foreign Ministry‘Uphold rights of Chinese investors’The Indian Government has the responsibility to uphold the legitimate and legal rights of the international investors, including the Chinese ones.The movement of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China in the past three-four days has raised a “red flag” at New Delhi. “The present posturing could stretch till winter. Let’s see if the PLA is ready for a winter at those altitudes where the valleys are in excess of 13,000 feet and the peaks are even higher,” a senior functionary explained.The latest inputs from Indian agencies using a slew of methods, including satellite imagery, show additional structures have been built by the PLA. More war-like stores, including vehicles, tanks, guns and even cutting-edge missile regiments, of the PLA have been making their way towards the LAC. India has matched the PLA in terms of numbers and equipment.Also at the Depsang plains further north of Galwan towards the Karakoram pass, there has been a movement of additional troops in the past 10 days. The strategic airfield of Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) is less than 25 km from the Chinese posts in the Depsang sector.The past two meetings on June 6 and June 22 of Lt General-level Commanders did not yield the desired results, leading to mistrust on the Indian side.After the June 6 meeting, a deadly clash occurred on the night intervening June 15 and 16 at the Galwan valley, leading to 20 Indian troops getting killed in action while an unspecified number of PLA men got killed as well.At the second round of talks on June 22, the Commanders decided to work out the modalities on the ground to disengage troops and withdraw their heavy military equipment, including fighter jets and tanks, from the LAC.Two days after showing some signs of moving back, the PLA was back to making structures.Posturing may stretch till winter||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/talks-on-no-sign-of-de-escalation-yet-106945
01-07-2020||---||Free ration till November, no LAC mention by PM||New Delhi, June 30The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, providing free ration to 80 crore people, will be extended till November, involving Rs 90,000 crore expenditure. The scheme has been in operation for the past three months so that the poor and marginalised, suffering on account of loss of income due to Covid-19, do not remain hungry. Together with this extension, the scheme will cost Rs 1.5 lakh crore.Announcing this in a 16-minute address to the nation that had no mention of China, PM Narendra Modi said that during monsoon, activities around the farm sector increase while decreasing in other sectors. This coupled with a number of festivals between July and November added to the expenses of people. Keeping these factors in view, the scheme which entailed 5 kg wheat or rice per person and 1 kg of pulses per family every month was being extended.CongressMuch ado about nothing, says congressPrime Minister Narendra Modi’s address was much ado about nothing. It could have easily been replaced with a government notification.The announcement comes after Congress president Sonia Gandhi wrote to PM Modi on June 22, pressing for the extension of the scheme till September as unemployment was on the rise on account of the pandemic and lockdown curbs. Earlier in the day, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi suggested direct cash transfer of Rs 7,500 per month to the poor.The Prime Minister said that during the last three months, the government had given Rs 31,000 crore to 20 crore poor households through direct benefit transfer, deposited Rs 18,000 crore in bank accounts of 9 crore farmers and was spending Rs 50,000 crore on employment of workers in rural areas.The world, PM Modi said, was both surprised and amazed that India was providing free ration to 80 crore people for the last three months. The beneficiaries were over 2.5 times the population of the United States, 12 times the population of the United Kingdom and double the population of the European Union.Underscoring that the scourge of virus was around, PM Modi said people strictly followed the rules of wearing face mask, hand hygiene and social distancing during the lockdown, but were now becoming negligent. Governments, local bodies and citizens should show similar alertness by stopping and cautioning those not adhering to the rules, especially in containment zones.Mentioning the news about a PM of a country being fined for not wearing a mask in public place, he said the local administration in the country should work with similar enthusiasm. “Be it a village pradhan or the Prime Minister, no one is above law in India”. The instance PM mentioned was of Bulgarian PM Boiko Borissov, who faced Euro 150 penalty for visiting a monastery without a mask.Modi On foodgrainOn direct benefit transferOn beating Covid||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/free-ration-till-november-no-lac-mention-by-pm-106906
