Going by the numbers, it means, that post June 4, the national capital conducted nearly seven lakh tests.Testing figures have risen since June 18, when the testing began in the city using the rapid antigen kits.Delhi has 56 labs -- 22 government and 34 private—which are carrying out RT-PCR tests to detect COVID-19.Labs across the city and health experts credit the rapid antigen test for reducing the burden on RT-PCR tests, helping in quicker identification of cases and reducing the risk of spread of infection.Dr Sumit Sharma, Dean of Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, said testing has played a significant role in checking the spread of cases.“Asymptomatic patients are being detected and isolated now, and symptomatic patients are being isolated earlier than previously when testing was limited. Early treatment has reduced the infection,” he opined.Rattan Gurnani, senior manager operations and corporate, City X-Ray and Scan Clinic, said the government has been very aggressive in testing and is ensuring that tests are conducted across all the containment zones.“They have given a target to all the districts, so more the tests, better the diagnosis and quicker the isolation and results. The number of RT-PCR tests has gone down from 700-800 earlier to 400 to 500 per day,” he said.The situation is similar in other labs and facilities.At the Genestrings lab, 1,000 to 1,200 tests were being conducted on a daily basis before the rapid antigen test started, but now it has reduced to 200 tests per day.According to Chetan Kohli, COO, Seeds of Innocence and Genestrings Lab, rapid antigen tests have also helped the labs process the samples faster.“Earlier, the time taken to process the samples would be anywhere between 24 and 48 hours but now it is 24 hours,” he said.Dr Rakesh Pandit, senior Consultant and HOD, internal medicine, Akash Hospital said earlier the medical facility was conducting 90 RT-PCR tests per day, out of which 25 would test positive.Now the hospital is conducting 50 to 60 tests per day and only six or seven people are testing positive.“Earlier the labs were so overloaded. The waiting time was more and there were a limited number of facilities. Then there were constraints like one RT-PCR machine cannot do more than 100 tests. But now more people are being covered,” Pandit said.The number of rapid antigen tests being conducted on a daily basis is more than double of the RT-PCR tests.According to the health bulletin on July 24, 5,328 RT-PCR tests were conducted within 24 hours, while over 13,000 antigen tests were conducted during the same time.Talking about the advantages of the rapid antigen tests, Kohli said the results of the test come within 15-20 minutes, and people are getting easy accessibility to them owing to the government’s efforts and the presence of more than 160 centres where people can avail them free of cost.

26-07-2020||New Delhi||Lupin, Granules India recall around 9.71 lakh bottles of diabetes drug in the US market||Drug makers Lupin and Granules India are recalling close to 9.71 lakh bottles of generic diabetes drug in the US due to possibility of the affected lot containing cancer causing nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) above the acceptable intake limit.As per the latest Enforcement Report of the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), Lupin is recalling 4,92,858 bottles of Metformin Hydrochloride extended-release tablets in 500 mg and 1,000 mg strengths.On the other hand, Hyderabad-based Granules India is recalling over 4.78 lakh bottles of the drug in 750 mg strength.As per the USFDA, the companies are recalling the product due to deviation from the current good manufacturing practices (CGMP).“FDA analysis detected N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) impurity above the acceptable intake level,” it noted.The USFDA has classified it as a Class-II recall, which is initiated in a “situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote”.Lupin is recalling 1,23,912 bottles of the 500 mg Metformin Hydrochloride extended-release tablets and 3,68,946 bottles of the same drug of 1,000 mg strength.The product has been manufactured at Lupin’s USFDA approved Goa-based manufacturing plant, and is being recalled by company’s US based subsidiary.Lupin sells Metformin Hydrochloride extended-release tablets under Gluconorm SR brand in India. The recall in the US will not have an impact in the Indian market as the product sold here is manufactured at a separate facility. There are specific plants that cater to the US market.Granules India is recalling 4,78,173 bottles of the drug in the strength of 750 mg due to similar reasons.The company’s US-based arm is recalling the affected lots which have been manufactured in India.It could not be immediately ascertained if Granules India sells Metformin Hydrochloride extended-release tablets in the Indian market.Metformin Hydrochloride extended-release tablet is a prescription oral medication indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve blood glucose control in adults with type-2 diabetes mellitus.Various companies across the globe have announced similar recalls for the product after the USFDA pointed out presence of NDMA above permissible limits.FDA’s testing has shown elevated levels of NDMA in some extended release (ER) metformin formulation, but not in the immediate release (IR) formulation or in the active pharmaceutical ingredient.NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen based on results from laboratory tests. It is a known environmental contaminant and found in water and food, including meats, dairy products and vegetables.

26-07-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan Congress calls off its Monday protest in front of Raj Bhawan||The Rajasthan Congress called off its Monday protest in front of the Raj Bhawan, hours after the party gave a nationwide call for agitation to protect the Constitution and democracy.State Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasara said in a tweet, “Tomorrow, Congress workers will protest in front of Raj Bhawans as part of ‘Save Democracy-Save Constitution’ agitation call. But, in Rajasthan we will not do anything like that.”Earlier in the day, Congress leader Ajay Maken said in a show of solidarity with the Rajasthan government, led by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, and for the protection of the Constitution and democracy, Congress workers will stage protests in a “Gandhian way” in front of Raj Bhawans across the country on Monday.The Congress government in Rajasthan is facing a political crisis after a rebellion by the now sacked deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot and 18 other MLAs.Dotasara said, “We have sent a revised note of the state cabinet to the Governor and hope that he will soon give approval to call a session of the Assembly.”The Congress government says it wants to hold the session so its majority can be proved.On Friday, Governor Kalraj Mishra had sought clarifications on six points from the state government, after Congress MLAs held a five-hour dharna on the lawns of the Raj Bhawan pressing for an Assembly session.The dharna was called off, according to the Congress, after Mishra said he would abide by the Constitution and not act under any pressure.The Governor asked Gehlot to submit again, with the clarifications, his recommendation for calling a session. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-congress-calls-off-its-monday-protest-in-front-of-raj-bhawan-118251

India will forever remember the sacrifices made by its soldiers to secure the country’ borders, Nadda said while reiterating the BJP’s commitment to the welfare of Armed Forces and the Modi government’s “zero tolerance” to any intrusion.Taking an aim at the Congress, Nadda said, “scandals after scandals happened but (defence) purchase was not made. It lacked political will and acumen”. The defence sector has always been the focus of the Modi government, Nadda said, highlighting welfare steps like “one rank, one pension” and its focus on infrastructure development and acquisition of modern technology.Hailing the Armed Forces, he said Pakistan was in an “advantageous” position during the Kargil war after occupying mountain heights but Indian soldiers drew inspiration from the challenge and fought with valour and strategy to attain victory.“It was the toughest battle on highest mountains,” he said, asserting that India will remain indebted to the brave soldiers forever.Recalling the then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Nadda said he fought with Pakistan in the international arena as well and resisted any pressure. Vajpayee made it clear that India will not declare ceasefire until it secures its border by defeating Pakistan, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/defence-sector-focus-of-modi-government-says-jp-nadda-118246

26-07-2020||Vibha Sharma||Your suggestions unfounded, based on misinterpretation: Javadekar to Jairam Ramesh||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 26Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on Sunday termed as “unfounded and based on misinterpretation” the “suggestions” by Chairman of the Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change Jairam Ramesh on the contentious draft EIA notification 2020.“All your suggestions are unfounded and based on misinterpretation,” Javadekar said responding to the “strongest objections” voiced by Ramesh, who yesterday said the “proposed changes in environmental clearance process for infrastructure projects will routinely legitimise illegality and promote land grab, not development”.Writing back, Javadekar said the draft notification is kept in the public domain for comments and suggestions.“Your suggestions are noted. There are 15 more days for suggestions.I will reply to you in detail. Government will finalise after considering various suggestions. Government decisions are always open for scrutiny by Parliament and Standing Committee,” Javadekar said    In his letter to Javadekar and marked to Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu, Ramesh said “environmental regulation is not an unnecessary burden but an essential obligation for the health and welfare of our people and sustainable development”.The proposed changes are not based on audits, assessments and analyses or any research but reflected a mindset that sees environmental regulation as an unnecessary regulatory burden, the former Environment Minister said in response to the notification that aims to overhaul the environmental clearance process which has received widespread criticism from environmental experts.They are questioning various provisions, including for post-facto project clearance, doing away with the mandatory process of public consultation for a wide range of projects and increasing validity of the environment clearances.According to Ramesh, the “draft notification allows post facto approvals that go against very principle of assessment and public participation prior to environment clearance”, “has provisions that will routinely legitimise illegality” and “reduces public participation in all steps of the environment clearance process”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/your-suggestions-unfounded-based-on-misinterpretation-javadekar-to-jairam-ramesh-118241
26-07-2020||New Delhi||Suriname’s new President took oath holding Vedas, it’s a matter of pride for us: Modi||It is “a matter of pride” for all Indians that Suriname’s new President Chandrika Parasad Santokhi took the oath of office holding the Vedas and began it with Vedic hymns, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his monthly ‘Mann ki Baat’ radio address on Sunday.Santokhi, Modi said, started his oath with Vedic hymns and spoke in Sanskrit.He referred to the Vedas and concluded his oath with ‘Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti’, the prime minister observed.“Holding the Vedas in his hand he said, ‘I, Chandrika Prasad Santokhi’, and, further what did he say in his oath? He recited a hymn from the Vedas itself. He said, ‘hey Agni, fire, the god of resolve, I am taking an oath. Give me strength and capability for this. Bless me so that I keep away from untruth and move towards truth’. Truly, this, for all of us, is a matter of pride”, Modi said.The prime minister congratulated Santokhi and wished him the best on behalf of Indians for serving his nation.India has a very close relationship with Suriname, Modi said.More than a hundred years ago, people from India went there and made it their home. Today, the fourth or the fifth generation is there. Today in Suriname more than one-fourth of the people are of Indian origin.‘Sarnami’ one of the common languages there is a dialect of Bhojpuri. “We Indians feel very proud of these cultural relations,” he said.

26-07-2020||New Delhi||Orphanage caregivers share stories of being parents to parentless||“I tried my best to give them everything that a mother would. When I look back, I know I have done my part in making their lives better,” says 87-year-old Sudha (name changed) as she fondly recalls her younger days spent caring for children at an orphanage.Sudha said she always wanted to do something meaningful in her life but after her mother passed away, she found herself bogged down by familial responsibilities.Next came the pressure from her family to get married. However, instead of marrying someone and starting a family, she chose to become family for those who didn’t have one.She started working with SOS Children’s Village, Faridabad at the age of 31.“In the past 50 years, I have been a parent to around 30 children,” the proud mother told PTI on Sunday on the occasion of Parents’ Day.Sukriti Sharma, 64, who has worked with various childcare homes across the country, is another such parent.She started working with an orphanage after her mother passed away. Taking care of children was not only a way to help them but herself too.“After suddenly losing my mother, I became very depressed and wanted to help those who did not have parents. I decided to become a caregiver to orphaned children. Living my life around children gave me a bigger purpose,” she said.Having looked after around 15 children at a childcare home in Delhi over the past 20 years, Sharma said they are her real family now.“Some of these children had come from very difficult situations. It is particularly difficult to deal with older children. They remember their families and also the trauma they suffered. In that case, we first become their friends, make them feel safe and then gradually take the role of a parent,” she said.Working with childcare homes for two decades now, 53-year-old Padma Rawat has looked after 24 children, seven of whom are now married.After her family did not approve of the man she wanted to marry, Rawat decided not to marry anyone else and devote her life to caring for children who do not have anyone to look after them.“Today my family has more than 35 members with sons-in-law, daughters-in-law and grandchildren,” she said.For 67-year-old Mariam (name changed), a domestic violence survivor who has been working with orphanages for 15 years, the children have given her the love of a family.After her husband remarried and threw her out of their house, she had nowhere to go. She found shelter at a government home and trained to take care of parentless children.“After 15 years now, I am finally content. I have taken care of around 26 children who are now more than my family. I have not been in touch with anyone from my biological family. It is these children who helped me get back on my feet,” Mariam said.“We are connected not by blood but love,” she sums up.

The body bore stab marks and an FIR was lodged at the Bisrakh police station and investigation taken up, a police spokesperson said.“During the probe, evidence led the police to the deceased’s brother Deepak and he was questioned. When quizzed, Deepak confessed to stabbing his brother to death. He told the police that Bhisham would frequently consume alcohol, create ruckus at home and misbehave with women family members because of which he decided to kill his brother,” the spokesperson said.The accused has been arrested and booked under IPC 302 (murder) and related charges, the police said.Further proceedings were being carried out in the case, the police added.

26-07-2020||Kolkata||Kolkata British High Commission official briefs Queen about repatriation of Britons||Don’t blame Sanjibita Nariang for feeling a wee bit nervous before this particular video-conference. Most of us would have probably felt the same if the person at the other end was none other than the British monarch who had logged in for the virtual meeting from her office room at the Buckingham Palace in London.The Queen, however, soon put the official at ease. “One warm smile from Her Majesty made me feel comfortable and at home,” an excited Sanjibita wrote on a Facebook post on Sunday.Nariang, Regional Consular Development Officer at British Deputy High Commission in Kolkata, interacted with Queen Elizabeth II when she shared with the 94-year-old monarch her experience of helping stranded British travellers return home during India’s lockdown.  UK repatriated nearly 18,000 travellers from India on 66 charter flights, from 11 Indian cities, between April and June. The repatriation effort was the biggest globally for the UK.“Organising the repatriation flights was a huge and complex operation involving thorough planning and coordination.  We also had to obtain movement permissions during a nationwide lockdown. The main challenge was to organise transport from remote places like Meghalaya and Manipur for a road journey to Kolkata spanning 32 hours,” she told the Queen.“I used my local networks and language skills to organise a safe journey for some of the most vulnerable and elderly British nationals. The job entailed arranging transport from remote locations to Kolkata, requesting assistance from police officers to help passengers cross inter-state borders and getting hotels to open their restaurants for dinner and packing breakfast for long journeys,” Nariang informed the Queen. “It was with the support of the Indian authorities and great teamwork across the British High Commission’s Indian network that we could successfully organise this operation,” Nariang added.While appreciating the effort by the staff for the repatriation of British nationals, the Queen also showed interest in the work the UK Government is doing internationally to develop a vaccine for the COVID-19 pandemic.“Beyond the repatriation effort, the UK and India are also working together to combat the effects of Covid-19.  A vaccine---developed in the UK and manufactured in India, benefitting the whole world---is the ultimate goal,” explained Sir Philip Barton, British High Commissioner to India.The occasion also saw the Queen attending the virtual unveiling of a new portrait of her. It was the first time a painting of a member of the British royal family was unveiled in an online call. The painting will be displayed in the refurbished reception of the new Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in London.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kolkata-british-high-commission-official-briefs-queen-about-repatriation-of-britons-118236

On the direction of the municipal commissioner, the lower staff has taken 15 goats into custody for eating the sapling planted in on the road divider.Besides being confined, each goat has also been slapped with a fine of Rs 3,000 each.The incident took place at Yellandu town in Bhadradri Kothagudem district of Telangana where the municipal staff responded to the direction of Municipal Commissioner Srinivas Reddy who recently witnessed the goats damaging the saplings, planted as part of the sixth phase Haritha Haram (plantation drive) that aims to increase the green cover in the state to 33 per cent.  During the sixth phase of Haritha Haram, the state aims at planting 30 crore saplings in various parts of the state and includes the forest revival programme.  On the directions of the municipal commissioner, the concerned staff detained nine goats on Thursday and Friday and another six on Saturday.All fifteen have been confined at the municipality office, which is now providing them with the feed and water as the owners of the goats have not shown up, possible apprehending reprimand.Municipal authorities have sent out many WhatsApp messages asking the owners to come to the municipal office and get the goats released by Monday after paying penalty under the provisions of Municipality Act, 2019. Messages have been sent out saying in case the goat owners fail to turn up, the animals would be auctioned on Monday.Telangana state records one of the highest numbers of goat and sheep population in the country after the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government distributed free goats and animals to farmers as part of their support system after coming to power.There are about 1.74 crore sheep and goat in the 31 districts of Telangana which in certain districts comes to about 1200-1500 sheep and goat for every 1000 people.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mc-staff-arrests-goats-for-eating-saplings-planted-during-afforestation-drive-118232

In her case, it was Mr (Rahul) Gandhi,” Dikshit said.“Here’s an interim arrangement. Interim is a very iffy word because you know if you are interim you won’t take long term decisions for the Congress. So, it is high time we get a full time president, whoever it is,” the 55-year-old former MP said.Whether it is through “selection or election” there is no issue, he said.“We should have a full-time president, whether it is Mr. A or Mr. B or Mr. Gandhi that is not an issue at all. Party ideology and collective leadership make a party,” Dikshit said.He said initially it was thought that the CWC, the party’s highest decision making body, will come together and select a president or maybe among themselves elect one, but that has not happened.It is not a bad idea to leave it open to the All India Congress Committee (AICC), where one can also have an election to the working committee, he said.“It (appointment of full-time president) should have happened earlier. I constantly maintain that here is the place where I point towards the inability of our senior leaders (CWC members) to have risen to the challenge, got together and got this thing done,” Dikshit said.“Mr Gandhi very clearly made a statement that I am not coming back, then what were you (senior leaders) busy doing running around and not being able to decide,” he said, adding that they should have got the process done.Noting that the CWC could not agree on one name and so it decided Sonia Gandhi should become interim president, Dikshit also pointed towards Scindia and Pilot for not taking a stand then as CWC members and enable a decision either then or later, whenever the party’s top decision-making body met.“All these people (in the CWC), including the Scindias and Pilots, why couldn’t they have fought for and enabled selection or election of a new president at that time. These people can do a revolt when it comes to personal ambition, but they could not risk their careers when it came to the party,” he said.Asked if Rahul Gandhi should come back as party chief in the prevailing circumstances, Dikshit said whoever comes will do well for the Congress.“If it is Mr Gandhi, I will follow him, if it is someone else, I will follow that person. No particular fixation with any particular person. I am an AICC member, I have one vote, which if needed, will be cast on my conscience,” he asserted.Earlier this year, Dikshit, son of three-time Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, had voiced his opinion that the leadership issue must be settled and had asserted that the senior leaders must step up.His remarks come amid the crisis being faced by the party in Rajasthan with Pilot openly rebelling against the Ashok Gehlot government which comes close on the heels of Scindia toppling the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh by switching over to the BJP with MLAs supporting him.Talking about the back to back Scindia and Pilot episodes that have rocked the Congress, Dikshit said there is no such thing as the “young vs old” and these were the result of personal ambitions.“Basically it is their calculation, their self assessment and what they think they are. I don’t know about Mr Pilot, because we do not know what he is going to do. I think it is a little premature to say anything,” he said.Dikshit, however, added that both have shown all the weaknesses that political beings can have.Asked if Rahul Gandhi’s stepping down as party chief had heightened insecurities among the younger leaders in the party, he said it heightened the insecurities only of those who wanted to “climb on his tailcoat”.On why Gehlot or Kamal Nath were selected as chief ministers over their younger colleagues, he said this question should not be asked of Rahul Gandhi or anyone else, but to the party MLAs in the respective Congress legislature parties.“More MLAs are with Kamal Nath than with Scindia. More MLAs are with Gehlot than with Pilot. So it is the MLAs’ decision,” Dikshit asserted.Criticising Scindia, Dikshit said despite the royal scion losing the Lok Sabha, he was offered the post of state party chief and a nomination to the Rajya Sabha.For someone who claims to be a people’s leader, he should have accepted people’s verdict in the Lok Sabha and had the ability to remain without the trappings of power, fought for the party on the field and won back his seat for the party.“Mrs Gandhi offered him to become PCC (Pradesh Congress Committee) chief in November last year. Scindia never came back with a yes. So what did he want, we couldn’t have put him in place of Mr. (Narendra) Modi,” Dikshit quipped. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sense-of-drift-in-congress-high-time-party-gets-full-time-president-sandeep-dikshit-118223

But his most prominent role came as cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the biopic- “MS Dhoni: The Untold Story”.

They will be kept in a “Kalash”( consecrated receptacle) which will be placed near the site during the ceremony.The Kalash, as per the “Sanatan” Hindu theodicy, will bear witness to the invocation to the almighty and benign supernatural forces to cosmic invocation regarding the ceremony.Earth chunks from the “Char Dhams”, Vaishno Devi Temple, Rameshwaram, and the Ganges, Yamuna, Godavari, Krishna rivers for the Kalash are included for the Kalash.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/push-for-greater-participation-in-bhumi-pujan-for-ram-temple-118205

26-07-2020||Jaipur||Congress launches digital campaign, accuses BJP of violating democratic traditions||The Congress launched its nationwide digital campaign, “#SpeakUpForDemocracy”, on Sunday and hit out at the BJP for its “attempts to violate constitutional and democratic traditions”.Congress leaders also accused the saffron party of trying to destabilise the Rajasthan government during a health emergency.“The Congress government in Rajasthan is trying its best to control the COVID-19 pandemic, which has also been appreciated globally. At such a time, the BJP is trying to destabilise the elected government in the state,” Congress general secretary and party’s Rajasthan in-charge Avinash Pande said.State Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasara alleged that the BJP government at the Centre and the leaders of the saffron party were working to topple the Rajasthan government.“The Congress government is working effectively to battle against the pandemic. Even the prime minister has lauded its efforts. Then why is the BJP working towards bringing down the government? I want to say that democracy will win and the BJP's conspiracy will fail,” he said.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala, who is camping here with party leaders, said: “The BJP’s conspiracy to kill democracy in broad daylight in Madhya Pradesh and now in Rajasthan has been exposed.”“Is democracy a slave of the Delhi Durbar? Is the majority a puppet in Delhi’s hands? Doesn’t the rule of vote matter? If not, then raise your voice,” he added.Reacting to the allegations, state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Satish Poonia used a Hindi proverb to take a dig at the Congress — a cat going on a pilgrimage after eating 900 mice.“The Congress is responsible for the political crisis in Rajasthan. It violated democratic values and insulted the Constitution for years. Will old sins be washed away through this ‘SpeakUpForDemocracy’ hypocrisy?” he asked.The Congress government in Rajasthan, led by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, is facing a threat after Gehlot’s former deputy Sachin Pilot rebelled against the party.Eighteen other MLAs have also defied the party whip to attend CLP meetings.

26-07-2020||New Delhi||Rajasthan political crisis: Governor listening to his masters' voices, says Congress||Amid the political crisis in Rajasthan, the Congress on Sunday sought to keep up the pressure on Governor Kalraj Mishra and accused him of acting in a partisan way and listening what it dubbed as voices of his masters at the Centre."The Governors are bound to function with the aid and advice of the state government (council of ministers) but he is listening to his masters' voice, that is from the government at the Centre," party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said while addressing a press conference here.The Governor is facing a flak from the Congress for not acceding to the state government's request to convene a special Assembly session to enable Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot prove his majority on the floor of the House in the wake of rebellion by Sachin Pilot and 18 other Congress MLAs over leadership issue.The Governor maintained on Friday that no one was above the constitutional decorum.Singhvi added: "Constitutional authorities -- be it the Governors, courts or central government -- are supposed to not only know their constitutional roles and boundaries but to scrupulously follow them in letter and spirit and promote the true intent of the framers of the Constitution." The Supreme Court lawyer said that court cases pending in the Rajasthan High court and the Supreme Court on the issue have nothing to do with the convening of the Assembly session in the state."Consider the following questions which arise in that regard, qua the conduct of high persons and institutions like the Governor or the central government."Is it commonsensically conceivable that any Governor ever should refuse or delay the holding of a floor test, which truly determines who has the numbers and objections/ queries, intended to delay and postpone the floor test, and not let the cat out of the bag as to who really has the numbers?" the Congress leader said."Is the Governor and his diverse advisers who have generated such queries not aware of established jurisprudence -- from the Constituent Assembly to diverse SC judgments -- that unequivocally establish that the Governor is powerless and without jurisdiction in matters where he is advised by the state Cabinet?" The Congress spokesperson cited many legal cases in support of his contention that the government has the power to call an Assembly session, apart from debates in the Constituent Assembly.Singhvi quoted the Sarkaria commission report, saying that "the Governor should not risk determining the issue of majority support, on his own, outside the Assembly. The prudent course for him would be to cause the rival claims to be tested on the floor of the House." — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-political-crisis-governor-listening-to-his-masters-voices-says-congress-118201

He used to hurl abuses and even beat me and my wife for money. He once broke his mother's arm. I took him to a doctor also and he was under treatment. But, every now and then, he would demand money.

It’s kind of a road-map for people who are desirous of participating in the construction of the Mandir,” the seer told PTI.“We will accept donations from whoever has devotion towards and faith in Lord Ram,” he said when asked if contributions would be accepted from all communities and not limited to Hindus only.“Whoever has devotion and respect towards and faith in Lord Ram... there is nothing like they should be from this community... or they should not be from this community...that’s left for them,” the Pejawar Swamiji said.He also said Rs 10 per head and Rs 100 per household was a suggested contribution, adding, the trust would accept any amount — it could be Re one or Rs 1 crore.The trust proposed to raise additional financial requirements from corporate social responsibility funds of companies, he added.According to him, the temple construction, the ground- breaking ceremony for which is slated for next week, would cost an estimated Rs 300 crore, and another sum of around Rs 1,000 crore would be required for development of surrounding areas for temple-related activities.An extensive month-long funds mobilisation campaign would be held from around November 25, the pontiff added.

26-07-2020||Vijay Mohan||Army officers have higher stress but lower quality of life than other ranks: DRDO study||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 26While the Indian Army personnel have moderate levels of occupational stress, the levels of psychological well-being and quality of life amongst the rank and file is good, a new study undertaken by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has revealed.In the occupational hierarchy, officers were found to have highest stress levels but lowest levels of psychological well-being and quality of life, whereas junior commissioned officers (JCOs) reported the highest level of psychological well-being and quality of life followed by other non-commissioned personnel.Moderate stress levels can be due to the strenuous nature of work, role ambiguity, frequent postings, separation from families and danger/threat amongst various other reasons. The usual demands of multiple deployments exposing the personnel to regular stressful conditions have shown enormous deterioration in psychological and physical health conditions including, lower morale, more mental health problems, and more stress-related work problems, according to the researchers.“The Indian Army’s role is to protect the whole nation and not an individual or a group, by ensuring national security and national unity, by defending the nation from external aggression and internal threats, and maintaining peace and security within its borders. The great importance of this duty puts tremendous stress on army personnel. Recent media reports indicate over four times more soldiers die battling stress rather than fighting militants in North-East or Kashmir,” the study says.Undertaken by four scientists at the DRDO’s Defence Institute of Psychological Research (DIPR), New Delhi, the study was published on July 22. DIPR’s core work area is personnel selection research, organisational behaviour, stress and combat stress management, soft-skill development and the human factor in man-machine interface.The respondents for the study were 150 male personnel aged between 25 to 45 years who were posted in one of the largest training centres of the Army and have had experiences in field and counter-insurgency areas. These included 50 officers, 50 junior commissioned officers (JCO) and 50 non-commissioned ranks.Researchers found occupational stress to be negatively correlated with psychological well-being as well as with the quality of life, whereas psychological well-being and quality of life were found to be positively correlated.Analysis of descriptive statistics by researchers has shown that, in the Occupational Stress Index, the total mean is high on all three occupations (hierarchical) levels. Among all three levels, officers have reported the highest level of occupational stress, followed by JCOs. Non-commissioned personnel reported a slightly lower level of occupational stress than JCOs.“One of the reasons of the above findings might be an officer holds a position of authority and therefore has more work responsibility and management responsibility as compared to JCOs and non-commissioned personnel, leading to higher levels of stress,” the study states. “Moreover, officers are responsible for decision making, planning, and execution of various activities. In the Indian Army, JCOs have longer years of service than officers, due to which officers accord JCO’s great respect and have a great amount of influence in their welfare and morale. Hence JCO’s have lower occupational stress level than officers,” the study adds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-officers-have-higher-stress-but-lower-quality-of-life-than-other-ranks-drdo-study-118184

We hope this statement puts to rest all allegations being levelled against Subbiah," said the ABVP, the student wing of the BJP.Complainant Vijayaraghavan, a nephew of the old lady, was not available for comment.The Chennai Police on Saturday booked Subbiah on the charge of harassing the old lady by urinating outside her apartment and in other ways.The lady had also alleged that Subbiah had also harassed her over the phone, and threw garbage and used face masks outside her apartment.The police registered the case against Subbiah after DMK MP Kanimozhi came out in support of the old lady.Terming the alleged harassment "shocking", the DMK leader tweeted: "The fact that police failed to act on the complaint, made on July 11, till date is more shocking.""This has become a routine on part of the police to turn a blind eye on complaints against right-wing members. @CMOTamilNadu should immediately intervene and ensure all are treated equally before law," Kanimozhi had said.According to Vijayaraghavan, the family had two parking slots in the apartment they lived in and Subbiah had requested his aunt whether he could park his vehicle in one slot.Vijayaraghavan said his aunt agreed but said that Subbiah will have to pay a monthly rent of Rs 1,500, following which the trouble started for her.Meanwhile, in another tweet, the ABVP said: "From day one, both @subbiah_doctor and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad were stating the facts about the misunderstandings emanating from the parking issues but political vultures were indulging in slander and character assassination of Dr Subbiah Shanmugam." According to the ABVP, the Congress and its frontal wings, DMK, its leaders and the left parties connived to defame Subbiah and ABVP."They have done terrible damage to the reputation of Subbiah's family. Their slanderous campaign has posed a threat to the safety and security of Subbiah and his family," the ABVP claimed. IANSEven as the #ABVP claimed that a police complaint against its national President S. Subbiah over the harassment of an old lady has been withdrawn, the city police said on Sunday that a decision on the matter was yet to be taken.@ABVPVoicePhoto: ABVP pic.twitter.com/v6urbIbnaM||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/harassment-case-abvp-says-complaint-against-subbiah-withdrawn-not-yet-says-police-118182

Their valour continues to inspire generations," Modi tweeted, adding that he would speak more about it in his Mann Ki Baat address. The prime minister used the hashtag #CourageInKargil.Union Home Minister Amit Shah also said the country is proud of the heroes who are dedicated to protecting it and who drove away the enemy from the arduous hills of Kargil.On the 21st anniversary of the country's victory over Pakistan in the Kargil war, Shah said the "Kargil Vijay Diwas" is a symbol of India's self-respect, amazing valour and steadfast leadership."I bow to the bravehearts, who, with their indomitable courage, drove the enemy from the difficult hills of Kargil and waved the tricolour there again. The country is proud of the heroes of India who are dedicated to protecting the motherland," he said in a tweet in Hindi.

26-07-2020||Lt Gen B S Raju||Local militant recruitment is primary concern, Kashmir situation stable but sensitive, says 15 Corps Commander||Below are excerpts from the interview:What has been achieved by the repeated successes of the Army; has the last line of militants been eliminated?A: In Kashmir we are not just targeting the individual terrorist, but the ecosystem that nurtures terrorism. The recent encounters between security forces and terrorists are part of our routine counter-terrorist operations, where success has been driven by good intelligence and support from common people.The lowering of violence levels in J&K is causing frustration in Pakistan, which is visible from their public statements and social media activity. With the onset of summer, Pakistan is back with its strategy to push in more terrorists into the Kashmir valley through infiltration to sustain terror in J&K. The counter-infiltration grid is robust and effective in preventing infiltration.The success in kinetic operations to kill terrorists is being supported by the effort to target the “Over-Ground Worker” network and the eco-system that sustains terrorism. There is a “whole nation” approach to counter-terrorism, in which all elements of the government and the civil society are collaborating. We are continuously acting to reduce space for terrorists and their support structure. The success in the counter-terror operations has a deterrence effect that is showing results, especially after killing of leaders of major “tanzeems” (terror groups). Is Pakistan likely to take advantage of the India-China face-off in Ladakh and launch a Kargil-type misadventure in Kashmir, as it is pushing in armed infiltrators from its side of the LoC?A: The situation on the Ladakh border is being managed by another formation. In Kashmir, there has not been any major escalation in the situation on the Pakistan front.The increased ceasefire violations and infiltration attempts were anticipated in view of the onset of summer. We are aware of some defensive deployments done by Pakistan. The situation in the Galgit-Baltistan area is also being watched.We are also watching carefully for any attempts by Pakistan to take advantage of the situation in Ladakh. Along the LoC and in the hinterland our security grid is intact and the Indian Army is well poised to deal with any situation. How do you read the internal situation in the Valley and the local recruitment?A: The internal situation in Kashmir is stable but sensitive. Maintaining peace has been the prime goal of all security forces, working in close synergy with each other, i.e., between the Army, J&K Police, CAPFs, Intelligence agencies, and the civil administration. The people-Army connect has always been strong due to our ethical conduct and transparency in operations. It is an effort that has to continue.The adversary’s principal strategy is to instigate violence and loss of life and property in Kashmir, which starts a cycle of violence and casualties. The security forces are conscious of this strategy. In J&K, the security forces strategy is to carry out most operations based on specific intelligence and conduct those in a manner that ensures minimum use of force and steps are taken to avoid collateral damage. Damage can happen when terrorists take refuge in built-up areas and use local population as human shields. It has to be understood that this restraint has at many times allowed the terrorists to escape, or even cause casualties to own troops. It is known that Indian security forces use minimum force in counter-terror operations, unlike Pakistan which has used artillery and air bombardment in anti-terror operations within its own territories of KPK and FATA.Precautionary and pre-emptive measures taken for the safety and security of the people have been instrumental in saving lives. The occasional spurt in civilian killings is indicative of the desperation of the terrorist controllers to show action and they are resorting to hitting soft targets among Kashmiri population. We are working towards neutralising this threat also.Local terror recruitment is one of our primary concerns. Our efforts are aimed at weaning the youth away from terror. Proactive steps are being taken to identify and counsel vulnerable youth. In this we seek the help and support of civil society. New recruits have very low survivability, with some getting killed within couple of months; this is something that gives us no happiness. We are working to, first, prevent local youth from joining terror and, second, to facilitate surrender from those who have joined terror ‘tanzeems’. Even in situations when we have surrounded these terrorists, we seek surrender before action to kill them. In some cases, we have even sought help of parents and families to seek surrender. We hope the effort will get more success with our continued efforts. Is Pakistan the only factor in Kashmir?Pakistan is the principal instability factor in J&K. Pakistan has been the principal sponsor of terror in Kashmir. All flow of weapons, terrorists and narco funding originates in Pakistan. The country has single-minded focus on interference and poisoning the minds of the people of J&K. Towards this effort it has paid proxies that peddle its destructive narrative. Pakistan has also used religious radicalisation as a tool to fuel separatism. If this issue of Pakistan interference is addressed, then J&K will have the opportunity to focus on the aspirations of the local people, and work to address the daily challenges of working towards progress and development.Pakistani interference has stalled J&K’s economic and civil society activity for the past three decades. Pakistan is the principal factor that has diverted the entire focus on to the security situation. The security forces are working to ensure an environment where the administration and civil society are free to work for the good of the state.In an era of fake news and social media propaganda, J&K’s “awam” needs the support of the entire nation in this battle.Is the China-Pakistan nexus a cause for concern on our borders in Kashmir?A: I can assure you that our combat readiness for any contingency is very high. We have highly trained and well-equipped combat forces to deal with any contingencies.The China-Pakistan nexus is a national security challenge for India. The national leadership, Indian diplomacy, and its foreign policy are dealing with the challenge at a national level.In military terms, in J&K we are dealing with the Pakistan border in Kashmir. 14 Corps in the UT of Ladakh is mandated and equipped to handle the situation both on the Chinese and Pakistani front. The overall conduct under the Northern Command has plans to cater for all contingencies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/local-militant-recruitment-is-primary-concern-kashmir-situation-stable-but-sensitive-says-15-corps-commander-118165
26-07-2020||New Delhi||Mann Ki Baat: PM recalls valour of Indian soldiers in Kargil War||Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his monthly radio broadcast “Mann Ki Baat” on Sunday urged people to desist from actions, including posting comments on social media platforms, which demoralise armed forces guarding the country’s borders.He flayed Pakistan for having indulged in “mis-adventurism” in Kargil while trying to grab Indian land. It did this also to divert public attention from its internal and domestic strife, the prime minister said.Making note of the 21st anniversary of “Kargil Vijay Diwas”, which is observed today, he paid rich tributes to the soldiers who were martyred.“War is fought not only at the borders. It is fought at various levels within the country,” Modi said, adding that sometimes people forward posts which are against country’s interest on social media platforms even while knowing that their content is inappropriate.Also read: Happiest moment of my life as I receive hello from PM Modi, says KritikaIn times of external threats, every Indian has to determine his/her role to be played.He said that unity of national consciousness increases power and enthusiasm of the country’s Defence personnel at the borders, and their family members, manifold.He said India was “back-stabbed” by Pakistan at a time when it was trying to improve the relationship with it. India cannot forget the circumstances, including the betrayal, under which Kargil War happened.“It is inherent in the nature of wicked to pick up a fight with everyone without any reason,” Modi said.Pakistan’s mis-adventurism was given a befitting response, and the world witnessed the valour of India’s brave jawans, said Modi.Enemies were on the mountain heights, but came a cropper in front of the majesty and height of the’ valour and skill of Indian forces.Modi pitched for “local for vocal” under his overarching theme of “Aatm Nirbhar Bharat” campaign.Referring to coming National Handloom Day( August 7), he urged people to promote khadi and handloom products.With regards to coronavirus, he said the threat from it persists and urged for continued caution, including adhering to social distancing norms. Modi observed that the fatality rate is lower and recovery rates in COVID-related cases are higher in comparison to other countries.He also referred to the raging floods in parts of Bihar and Assam, saying they have compounded the problems faced by COVID pandemic.He expressed happiness at the dynamism and ambition shown by the country’s youth in various aspects of life.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mann-ki-baat-pm-recalls-valour-of-indian-soldiers-in-kargil-war-118164
26-07-2020||United Nations||Pakistanis head terror groups ISIL-K, AQIS, TTP; not yet blacklisted: UN report||Pakistani nationals remain at the leadership levels in terror groups such as al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant — Khorasan and Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, and many of them are yet to be blacklisted, according to a UN report.The 26th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team concerning ISIL, al-Qaida and associated individuals and entities said that in April and May, the Afghan special forces conducted a series of countrywide operations and arrested the head of the ISIL-K Aslam Farooqi (also known as Abdullah Orokzai) and his predecessor Zia ul-Haq (also known as Abu Omar Khorasani) and others.Farooqi, who hails from Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, is the mastermind behind the deadly terror attack on a prominent gurdwara in Kabul in March that killed 25 Sikhs.He is not blacklisted by the UN Security Council’s 1267 al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee. Similarly, Haq is also a Pakistani national and has not been blacklisted yet.Al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) operates under the Taliban umbrella from Afghanistan’s Nimruz, Helmand and Kandahar provinces and its current leader is Pakistan-born Osama Mahmood, who is also “not listed” under the UNSC sanctions. Mahmood succeeded Asim Umar.The report said that the group reportedly has between 150 and 200 members from Bangladesh, India, Myanmar and Pakistan and “is reportedly planning retaliation operations in the region to avenge the death of its former leader.”           The Sanctions Monitoring Team report said that the “large terrorist group present in Afghanistan” Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) is led by Amir Noor Wali Mehsud.Pakistan-born Mehsud was designated a global terrorist by the UNSC sanctions committee only this month, more than two years after he was named the TTP leader, following the death of former TTP head Maulana Fazlullah.Mehsud is supported by his deputy Qari Amjad and TTP spokesperson Mohammad Khorasani, both not listed under the UNSC sanctions.This demonstrates that the Pakistani nationals operate at leadership levels in the terror organisations and point to the terror groups’ Pakistani links.The report said that al-Qaida is covertly active in 12 Afghan provinces and its leader Aiman al-Zawahiri remains based in the country.The monitoring team estimates the total number of al-Qaida fighters in Afghanistan at between 400 and 600.The leadership maintains a close contact with the Haqqani Network. In February 2020, al-Zawahiri met with Yahya Haqqani, “the primary Haqqani Network contact with al-Qaida since mid-2009, to discuss the ongoing cooperation.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistanis-head-terror-groups-isil-k-aqis-ttp-not-yet-blacklisted-un-report-118163

The country lost more than 500 soldiers in the war.“I congratulate all Indian citizens on the occasion of Kargil Vijay Diwas. The sacrifices made by soldiers, which helped us win the Kargil war, will always be a source of inspiration for the armed forces,” Singh told reporters.Along with the defence minister, Minister of State for Defence Shripad Naik, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, Army Chief General M M Naravane, Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria and Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh also paid tributes at the Amar Jawan Jyoti at the National War Memorial.The Kargil war was declared over on July 26, 1999, after Indian soldiers pushed back the Pakistani troops, a bulk of them drawn from the neighbouring country’s Northern Light Infantry, from the captured peaks.The day is observed as “Kargil Vijay Diwas” to commemorate India’s victory in the war.The Indian and Chinese armies are locked in a bitter standoff at multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last 10 weeks. The tension escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed by the Chinese troops in a violent clash in Galwan Valley on June 15.        The Chinese side also suffered casualties, but is yet to give out the details.

Granting bail would invite the possibility of embarrassing the US in the conduct of its foreign affairs, straining its relationship with India,” Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian had told the court.On the other hand, Rana’s attorney told the court that the 26/11 accused was not a flight risk and had proposed a $1.5 million bond for his release.Rana, in his defence, has argued that the US’ decision not to extradite his co-conspirator, Headley, to India is inconsistent and bars his extradition.“While Rana has presented a robust bail package and proffered conditions which significantly mitigate the risk of flight, the court cannot find that he has negated the risk of flight and accordingly grants the Detention Request (of the government) on that basis,” said Chooljian.For someone facing conspiracy to murder and murder charges in India, the incentive to flee to avoid extradition is strong, the court said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-26-11-plotter-118038

On Friday, Congress MLAs had squatted on the lawns of the Raj Bhavan for several hours, demanding that the Governor should summon a Vidhan Sabha session.After back-to-back meetings of the Congress Legislature Party and the Cabinet, CM Gehlot reportedly asked the MLAs to get ready for a long haul. “We will petition the President and gherao the PM’s house if necessary. We must stay united. We have the majority,” he was quoted as having said. Congress sources said the Cabinet had responded to all six questions raised by the Governor, including the “justification to call a session to prove majority when the government has the majority.” The Cabinet proposal sought a session to discuss Covid-19 and political matters, including a floor test, to end the political imbroglio triggered by the rebellion of 19 Congress MLAs, including Sachin Pilot.The Congress, which held protests across districts headquarters, announced a nationwide stir outside Raj Bhavans on Monday. AICC general secretary (Organisation) KC Venugopal said, “The BJP is misusing the office of the Governor to destabilise elected governments. The Congress will hold nationwide protests outside Raj Bhavans on Monday and a virtual ‘Speak Up for Democracy’ campaign on Sunday.”On the other hand, Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Gulab Chand Kataria said the “drama which unfolded yesterday” was unfortunate as the note sent to the Governor for calling an Assembly session had no agenda. The crisis in Rajasthan precipitated after the High Court ordered status quo on Speaker CP Joshi’s disqualification notices to 19 rebel MLAs. The SC is to hear the matter tomorrow.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-cabinets-fresh-proposal-seeks-house-session-from-july-31-117988
