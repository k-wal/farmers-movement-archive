You will get to know,” the SP said.Reacting to the complaint, Mukhim said: “I will fight it out (in court).” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/police-complaint-against-meghalaya-journalist-over-fb-post-109397
06-07-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: HC asks UGC, HRD Ministry to clear stand on final year exams in all varsities||The Delhi High Court on Monday directed the UGC and Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) to clarify their stand as to whether they recommend cancellation of final year examinations in all the universities across the country due to COVID-19 pandemic situation.The high court said the stand should be made clear by Tuesday and directed that responsible officials from the Ministry of HRD and University Grants Commission (UGC) shall join the hearing on July 7.Justice Prathiba M Singh, who was conducting the hearing through video conferencing, also directed the UGC’s committee headed by professor RC Kuhad to submit its report on final guidelines to the authorities concerned by Tuesday and it shall be placed before the court.“The UGC, which is an overarching body for all the universities, ought to in fact take a decision and give its recommendations to all the universities across the country. UGC is a party in the present petition and it is admittedly considering the issues relating to final year examinations.“Thus, there should be no further delay in the UGC’s Committee submitting its report and the advisory from the UGC/ Ministry of HRD, being issued to universities in respect of conduct of final year examinations,” the high court said.The high court was hearing a petition by several students of the final year of Delhi University (DU) seeking quashing and withdrawal of the notifications of May 14, May 30 and June 27 in respect of conduction of online exams for undergraduate and postgraduate students, including students of the School of Open Learning and Non-Collegiate Women Education Board.As an alternative prayer, it also sought to direct DU to evaluate the final year students based on the previous years’ or semesters’ results in the same manner as the university has planned to promote the first and second year students.An application for impleadment has also been moved by five students from Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi University. Out of these five students, one student is from Faridabad, two from Delhi, one from Nagaland and one from Rajasthan.The high court noted that several students may have already obtained employment and may be compelled to report to their jobs and others may be scheduled to pursue post graduate studies in India and abroad.Justice Singh said administrative authorities who are in-charge of conducting examinations in universities, including the UGC and the Central government, ought to also bear in mind that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in enormous mental distress and agony to students.“There are families which are suffering medical illnesses and giving of examinations is not just a technological issue but the state of mental preparedness of the students also needs to be assessed,” the judge said.The high court said the deadlines for submission of final year transcripts in all these universities would be in August-September 2020 and a large number of states, universities and institutions have cancelled final year examinations, including Maharashtra, Orissa, Haryana, MP, Punjab, NALSAR (Hyderabad), NUJS (Kolkata), IIT Kharagpur, IIT Bombay, Calcutta University, Lucknow University, Panjab University, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam University.It said some universities and institutions have opted for conducting examinations online which have already been completed and many varsities are also awaiting UGC’s fresh guidelines.The high court, in its order, said students in most universities and institutions which have cancelled the examinations have been promoted on the basis of past performance coupled with internal assessments wherever available.Regarding the Delhi University, it said DU is a university of excellence and studying in DU is a matter of pride as it attracts the best talent from across the country.“Thus, the problems of DU students may be much more, and thus the difficulties of the large expanse of students hailing from different regions needs to be borne in mind. They cannot be judged on the basis of the facilities available in a city like Delhi or other metros,” it said.The high court directed the DU to place on record the number of students who are studying in the final year of the varsity and who are registered for the final year examinations to be conducted through the online process.DU will also give a state-wise break-up of the students and from where they have to take the examinations, preparedness of the website portal for handling of the traffic during exams, keeping in mind the recent technical glitches faced by students during the mock exams.The high court also directed the varsity to give the schedule of examinations, that is, evaluation of papers, date for announcement of results and date for issuance of transcripts.

06-07-2020||New Delhi||HRD ministry asks universities conclude final-year exams by end of September||Final-year examinations in universities will have to be conducted by September-end, the HRD Ministry announced on Monday, deferring the schedule from July in view of a spike in COVID-19 cases.However, students unable to appear in final-year exams in September will get another chance and universities will conduct special exams "as and when feasible", according to a revised guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC).The HRD ministry's decision came hours after the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued an order allowing the universities and institutions of higher education to hold final-term examination as per the COVID-19 guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.The UGC has revisited its earlier guidelines related to university examinations.In view of the safety, career progression and placements of the students and their larger interests, after consulting @HMOIndia and @MoHFW_INDIA, it has been decided that pic.twitter.com/evKTYPwnIaThe announcement has put to rest speculations that the exams for final-year students may be cancelled in view of the COVID-19 situation.In an official release earlier, the MHA said this ministry “in a letter written to Union Higher Education Secretary today permitted conduct of examinations by universities and Institutions”.It further said, “The final term examination are to be compulsorily conducted as per the UGC guidelines on examination and academic calendar for universities and as per the Standard Operative Procedure (SOP) approved by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.”States like Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh have already announced the cancellation of exams in colleges and universities in the view of COVID-19 pandemic.It may be recalled that in April, the UGC had asked the universities to conduct the final exams in July. The guidelines had also said the students of intermediate semesters should be promoted on the basis of their internal assessment and performance in the previous semester exam."The final year examinations will be conducted by the universities or institutions by the end of September in offline, online or blended mode. The students having backlog will compulsorily be evaluated by conducting examinations in offline (pen and paper) online blended (online and offline) mode as per feasibility and suitability," according to the UGC guidelines.Union HRD Minsiter Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' tweeted, "The UGC has revisited its earlier guidelines related to university examinations." The minister said it has been formulated "in view of the safety, career progression and placements of the students and their larger interests, after consulting" the home ministry and the health ministry."It is important to safeguard the principles of health, safety, fair and equal opportunity for students. At the same time, it is very crucial to ensure academic credibility, career opportunities and future progress of students globally."Academic evaluation of students is very important milestone in any education system. The performance in examinations gives confidence and satisfaction to the students and is a reflection of competence, performance and credibility that is necessary for global acceptability," the guidelines stated."In case a student of terminal semester/final year is unable to appear in the examination conducted by the university for whatsoever the reason(s) may be, he or she may be given opportunity to appear in special examinations...which may be conducted by the university as and when feasible, so that the student is not put to any inconvenience or disadvantage," it said.

06-07-2020||Sandeep Dikshit ||Doval-Wang talks: Avoiding an unnecessary Kargil-type deployment||The talks on Sunday evening between India and China’s top officials for border issues have averted what might have turned out to be a costly and back-breaking exercise for both armies to hold on to advantageous positions on the line of actual control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.The inability of India and Pakistan to make a clean break at Kargil had led to both sides extending deployments on the peaks in this sector to winter months as well with no tactical or strategic advantage accruing from the lonely vigils in virtually immovable conditions.  Although this is no justification for Chinese behaviour, the parallel to Kargil remains restricted to the problem of holding ground in extremely high altitude areas. In this particular case, the build-up happened in the full knowledge of forward troops and was mostly restricted to the Chinese side of LAC. The transgressions are at three places, none of which was held or controlled by Indian side.Both the Chinese and the Indian read-outs of the conversation between NSA Ajit Doval and State Councillor-cum-Foreign Minister Wang Yi that took place on June 5 put emphasis on a quick return to peace and tranquillity. More importantly they seem to be laying equal importance on restoring the status quo.This means that as happened with the Chinese incursion into the Galwan Valley in July 1962 – the war took place three months later – Beijing is satisfied into withdrawing on the premise that India does not pose the threat of a quick military thrust into the Valley and across the plains of Aksai Chin.Such a premise essentially involves ensuring that neither side sets up infrastructure close by that can serve as a springboard for offensive operations later on. If China continues to maintain any such indicators of infrastructure that could later pose a threat to India’s road from Daulat Beg Oldie to Shyok, India would have had to inevitably follow suit.The Doval-Wang talks may have averted that possibility. Besides being a costly exercise which also puts an excessive burden on the human spirit, an eyeball-to-eyeball situation in eastern Ladakah could have slowly metastasised into a similar force posture all along the sprawling and demarcated LAC, increasing the chances of another bloody brawl as happened at Galwan Valley on June 15.It is not known whether the restoration of status quo will also mean that India will have to curb its appetite for strengthening approaches to forward posts from the DBO-Shyok road.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doval-wang-talks-avoiding-an-unnecessary-kargil-type-deployment-109388

"In today's meeting with the Union Agriculture Minister, I requested to provide our basmati rice a GI tag as we have been demanding it from a long time." A GI tag is an indication used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to the origin. The tag conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness and plays a major role in trade, improving its prospects. GI tags are typically used for agricultural products, foodstuffs, wine and spirit drinks, handicrafts, and industrial products.  Recently Kashmiri saffron and Chak-Hao, the black rice of Manipur, were given the tag, including them in the list of around 370 geographical indications with area-specific qualities like shahi leechi of Bihar, Coorg oranges, navara rice of Kerala, Darjeeling tea and Bangalore rose onion in the agricultural produce category.Incidentally, the popular handicraft of Punjab, phulkari, also has a GI tag. Chak-Hao is a scented glutinous rice being cultivated in Manipur over centuries. It is characterised by its special aroma and is normally eaten during community feasts and also used by traditional medical practitioners as part of medicine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/madhya-pradesh-cm-seeks-gi-tag-for-mps-basmati-rice-109387

06-07-2020||Naveen S Garewal||Report attributes Vizag gas leak to multiple lapses||Tribune News ServiceHyderabad, July 6The high-level committee constituted to probe into the LG Polymers gas leak at Vizag in Andhra Pradesh that killed 14 persons on May 7 this year has found multiple inadequacies in the South Korean company's gas plant.An FIR was registered after the hazardous styrene gas leaked from the plant causing widespread panic in the area. Despite people falling sick and losing their lives due to the leak, no arrest has taken place in the case yet.In its final report submitted to Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy, the high-power committee has stated "the accident occurred due to uncontrolled styrene vapour release from the M6 tank, qualifies as a major accident as per the definition under Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals (MSIHC) rules".The 4,000-page report has blamed the management for the gas leak as no precautions were taken to check the risk of temperature in styrene tanks.The committee has said that maintaining temperatures in the gas tanks was crucial, but in the case of LG polymers, there was a serious lapse as this aspect was ignored. The report says the refrigeration pipes were replaced in December 2019, but this damaged the cooling system.The report reads that the temperature measuring device was placed at the bottom of the gas tank due to which it is impossible to know the temperature at the centre of the tank. The company ignored a warning sign in December. Further, even after the accident, LG Polymers was reckless. The factory has 36 riot points, but the siren did not ring even after the gas leak and the failure of the alarm to go off is a huge cause for concern, the report added."The temperature in the tank rose substantially. The rise in the temperature caused the styrene liquid to eventually vaporise and increase the pressure; it was a tank with small vents," the report said.The report has also suggested that the factories that contain dangerous chemicals, such as LG polymers, cannot be allowed to function in a populated area. "We think it is better to move LG Polymers to a different location," read the report.The committee, headed by Special Chief Secretary (Environment and Forests) Neerabh Kumar Prasad, includes Special CS Industry and Commerce Karikal Valaven, Visakhapatnam Collector V Vinay Chand, CP Visakhapatnam RK Meena, Director CSIR Indian Institute of Petroleum Dehradun Dr Anjan Ray, Member Secretary APCB Vivek Yadav, Director General DGFASLI Dr RK Elangovan and Regional Director CPCB Pune Bharat Kumar Sharma as members.Before submitting the report, the committee had asked citizens to pose questions over the incident and it received over 1,200 queries, 180 calls and 250 emails.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/report-attributes-vizag-gas-leak-to-multiple-lapses-109381

This led to an election loss for the Jigme Thinley government which may have crossed another South Block red line by assuring China that his country wanted an early border settlement.The constituency of the new PM Tshering Tobgay happens to be Doklam which China wants to acquire in return for land elsewhere.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/to-indias-discomfiture-china-for-border-talks-with-bhutan-109379

Instead of responding to questions asked by Rahul Gandhi, whether on coronavirus, foreign policy, economy or the border standoff, you (the BJP) respond by attacking the one who has asked the question,” he said.Asking the BJP government to target China and not Gandhi, Khera said: “China will not go back by attacking Rahul Gandhi, so attack China instead”.Khera said the government should respond responsibly and answer questions posed to it.“Your foreign policy has become a victim of event management. Governments do not run on headlines management. How long can you continue doing this?” he asked.Khera also alleged that the government had the habit of attacking the one asking hard questions, be it on the economy, the spread of the virus, migrant labourers, foreign policy or the border issue.“How long will you succeed in distractions,” he asked.Surjewala also posed several queries to the BJP chief.“Is cutting Rs 11,000 CR of ‘Dearness Pay’ of 15 Lakh Members of our Armed Forces & 26 Lakh Military Pensioners (from 1/1/2020 to 30/6/2021) Modi Govt’s way of encouragement or a Machiavellian hit job?” he tweeted4/nDear Nadda Ji,Pl answer-3.

06-07-2020||New Delhi||Resident doctors’ association writes to PM, demands separate cadre for healthcare professionals||The Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanding a separate cadre for healthcare professionals in line with the IAS and the IPS.It said the COVID-19 pandemic had once again stressed the need for improving the healthcare infrastructure in the nation beginning from the grassroots.“The creation of the Indian Medical Services (IMS) cadre has become more relevant in the times of COVID-19, whereby doctors from various specialities can devise effective strategies for controlling the epidemic and improving the overall healthcare system in the future,” the federation said.“Healthcare systems demand a thorough knowledge of the domain. Knowledge of subject specialists (doctors) in devising policies is essential for galvanising the healthcare system of the nation,” it said.The demand for a separate cadre for healthcare professionals in line with the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), Indian Police Service (IPS), etc was a long-pending one, the federation said.The Health Survey and Planning Committee (also known as Mudaliar Committee) had recommended the formation of a central health cadre in its report in 1961, it said.“The government had decided to constitute the All India Medical and Health Service way back in 1968. However, even after multiple discussions and consultations with states over the years, this cadre is yet to be brought into action on the field,” the letter read.

The voter would have to appear before a magistrate at the time of recording the vote and then subject herself to exposure again at the time of notarisation and affirmation and then go out once again to post the ballot.The TMC leader stated that the amendment would also enhance the possibility of a voter’s electoral preference getting revealed to others. This will make the voter nervous. Bakshi wrote that the postal ballot system could become highly susceptible to the coercive influence of nefarious elements, ruling party agents, government officials and could degenerate into large-scale rigging.“The amendment directly interferes with the conduct of free and fair elections, which is the bedrock of our democracy and has been enshrined as a basic feature of our constitution”, the letter stated.The TMC MP added that the amendment stipulated that officers must be physically present and attend each of the electors above 65 years while they cast their votes. This would increase expenses incurred by the public exchequer. According to Bakshi, the system of voting through postal ballots would also impose an extra cost on individual voters and discourage them from exercising the right to vote.The TMC leader wrote that about six per cent of the population of our country were aged above 65 years and their effective exclusion from the electorate would have a huge impact. The letter also noted that the amendment was permanent in nature rather than a temporary arrangement made to deal with the situation arising out of the pandemic.Bakshi also pointed out that while Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself was above 65 years of age, Chief Ministers of at least 13 states were more than 65-year-old. It would be quite ridiculous to suggest that a person above 65 years could contest in elections, carry out campaigning but cast the vote through postal ballot, stated the letter by the TMC leader.While urging the EC to revoke the amendment, TMC said that in future EC should intervene and bar the Centre from usurping the ECI’s powers. “As public representatives, we are afraid that such amendments will pose a distinct threat to our democratic way of life,” the letter stated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-opposes-postal-ballots-for-voters-above-65-years-of-age-109341

His mother requested Nehru for an inquiry into the death of her son, but Nehru did not allow it to happen. This shows Congress’ undemocratic face. No one knows how he died,” Nadda said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and top BJP leaders paid tributes to Mookerjee on his birth anniversary and contributions towards India’s development and its unity.Also read: TMC opposes postal ballots for voters above 65 years of ageNadda said Mookherjee opposed the “appeasement politics” of Jawaharlal Nehru and if today Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and Bengal are an inseparable part of India it was because of his efforts.  It is an honour to celebrate the day at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led BJP government has abrogated Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. “It is due to Syama Prasad Mookerjee that Bengal and Punjab are with India. Otherwise, they would have gone to Pakistan during Partition. He opposed the appeasement politics of Nehru but the Congress has a bad habit of stifling democratic voices.“When their ideals did not match, he resigned from Nehru’s cabinet. He questioned the reason behind special rights being given to Jammu and Kashmir through Article 370,” Nadda said also attacking the Trinamool Congress government over the “mismanagement of coronavirus cases” and “politicisation of education”.“The trend is worrisome for Bengal. We must dedicate ourselves to restore education in Bengal back to its glorious standards,” he said.Nadda said on one hand there was Mookerjee who fought for a united India, keeping his ideals and principles above anything, and on the other, there was the TMC government “clinging to power by any means”. “Criminalisation of politics has scaled new heights, now we all hear about cut money….we have to cut to size these leaders, restore the glory of Bengal and remove this government,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-remembers-syama-prasad-mookerjee-attacks-cong-tmc-109331

Both sides need to work together by utilising the existing diplomatic mechanism of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China border affairs (which did not meet for over a year till it was activated last month), it noted.The Chinese readout, while affirming the need for dialogue and forbearance to sort out difficulties on the LAC also maintained that right and wrong of what recently happened at the Galwan Valley “is very clear”.“China will continue firmly safeguarding territorial sovereignty as well as peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” Wang reportedly told Doval while obliquely commenting on the war phobia generated in the Indian media and calls to crack down on trade ties with China.“We hope India can work with China to guide public opinion in the right direction… avoid amplifying differences and complicating matters,” he said while calling for the boundary question to be placed “properly” in the overall context of bilateral relations and avoiding an escalation from differences to disputes.Both sides agreed that they would be guided by the consensus between PM Modi and Xi Jinping that a calm border was essential for the further development of bilateral relations.“Therefore, they agreed that it was necessary to ensure at the earliest complete disengagement of the troops,” said the MEA statement.It was also agreed that the two Special Representatives will continue their conversations to ensure full and enduring restoration of peace and tranquillity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doval-wang-talks-preceded-pull-back-of-troops-from-lac-109325
06-07-2020||Satara||‘Nearly extinct’ damselfly species found near Satara dam in Maharashtra||Three nature conservationists from Satara in Maharashtra claimed to have “rediscovered” a “nearly extinct” damselfly species ‘Lestes patricia’ after almost 100 years.A colony of this sub-species, christened ‘Lestes patricia taamrpatti’, was discovered by Dr Shriram Bhakare, Sunil Bhoite and Pratima Pawar-Bhoite from Umrodi Dam area, situated at the foothills of the northern Western Ghats in the district.According to the researchers, a single male specimen of Lestes patricia, endemic to the Western Ghats, was first discovered in 1922 from Kodagu (Coorg) district in Karnataka and the only specimen currently available is at Natural History Museum, London.“The discovered colony of new species closely match the specimen of the single known male of Lestes patricia from the London-based museum. However, there are stable differences between the newly found species and description of Lestes patricia,” said Bhoite.“While comparing the body structure and features of the newly found species with an existing specimen of Lestes patricia from the London-based museum, stable differences were found. That is why the sub-species from the damselfly family has been named Lestes patricia taamrpatti,” he added.Dr Bhakare, an ophthalmologist from Satara, said the reason behind adding the word ‘taamrpatti’ was because the species has a coppery red-brown uniform band bordered by black.“The likelihood the newly discovered population is, in fact, a distinct species cannot be ruled out, but cannot be confirmed until further, fresh specimens of Lestes patricia are made available from the locality in Kodagu.“Since the stable features observed in the newly discovered population preclude it from being indisputably placed under Lestes patricia, yet given the lack of comparative material, it is not possible to place it as a new species with certainty,” he added.So the newly discovered population from Maharashtra is tentatively placed as a subspecies of Lestes patricia, Bhakare informed.He said a research paper on discovery of the nearly extinct species was published in Bionotes Journal recently.The researchers said 10 specimens, comprising six males and four females, have been collected for examination.Of the 10, two male and two female specimens have been deposited with Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), while the rest will be kept at other depositories in the country for further research. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nearly-extinct-damselfly-species-found-near-satara-dam-in-maharashtra-109321

I am proud to be part of this monumental project and target to bring all my experience into play for the narration in the Hindi language,” the actor added.Menon said working on the documentary felt familiar as the pandemic has affected everyone.“It is a valiant effort. I could not have asked for a better debut as a narrator, especially in my mother tongue Tamil, and coincidentally this marks my first documentary ever. I urge everyone to watch it along with your family,” he said.The documentary, also available in English, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Bengali, will drop exclusively on the Discovery Plus app on July 16.It will also air on Discovery Channel and Discovery Channel HD on July 20.Megha Tata, managing director, South Asia, Discovery, said the documentary was a way to help Indian audiences understand deeper perspectives on the pandemic.“There’s more at work than what meets the eye as new challenges unfold every day with pandemic raging fire; our attempt is to bring it all together with a line-up of prominent experts and officials to provide a comprehensive view for our discerning audiences,” Tata added.Discovery Plus has explored stories related to the pandemic in three other documentaries – “Invisible Killer”, “Pandemic COVID-19” and “The Zoo: Covid-19 & Animals”.

06-07-2020||New Delhi||Aug 15 target for COVID-19 vaccine launch ‘unfeasible’: Indian Academy of Sciences||The Indian Academy of Sciences (IASc), a Bengaluru-based body of scientists, has said the Indian Council for Medical Research’s (ICMR) target to launch a coronavirus vaccine by August 15 is “unfeasible” and “unrealistic”.The IASc said while there was an unquestioned urgent need, vaccine development for use in humans required scientifically executed clinical trials in a phased manner.While the administrative approvals could be expedited, the “scientific processes of experimentation and data collection have a natural time span that cannot be hastened without compromising standards of scientific rigour”, the IASc said in a statement.In its statement, the IASc referred to the ICMR’s letter which states: “It is envisaged to launch the vaccine for public health use latest by August 15, 2020, after completion of all clinical trial.”The ICMR and Bharat Biotech India Limited, a private pharmaceutical company, are jointly developing the vaccine against the novel coronavirus -- SARS-CoV-2.The IASc welcomed the exciting development of a candidate vaccine and wished that the vaccine was quickly made available for public use, the statement said.“However, as a body of scientists – including many who are engaged in vaccine development – IASc strongly believes that the announced timeline is unfeasible. This timeline has raised unrealistic hope and expectations in the minds of our citizens,” it said.Aiming to launch an indigenous COVID-19 vaccine by August 15, the ICMR had written to select medical institutions and hospitals to fast-track clinical trial approvals for the vaccine candidate, COVAXIN.Experts have also cautioned against rushing the process for developing a COVID-19 vaccine and stressed that it was not in accordance with the globally accepted norms to fast-track vaccine development for diseases of pandemic potential.The IASc said: “Trials for a vaccine involve evaluation of safety (Phase 1 trial), efficacy and side effects at different dose levels (Phase 2 trial), and confirmation of safety and efficacy in thousands of healthy people (Phase 3 trial) before its release for public use.”Clinical trials for a candidate vaccine required the participation of healthy human volunteers. Therefore, many ethical and regulatory approvals needed to be obtained prior to the initiation of the trials, it added.The IASc said the immune responses usually took several weeks to develop and relevant data should not be collected earlier.“Moreover, data collected in one phase must be adequately analysed before the next phase can be initiated. If the data of any phase are unacceptable then the clinical trial is required to be immediately aborted,” it said.For example, if the data collected from Phase 1 of the clinical trial show that the vaccine is not adequately safe, then Phase 2 cannot be initiated and the candidate vaccine must be discarded.For these reasons, the Indian Academy of Sciences believes that the announced timeline was “unreasonable and without precedent”, the statement said.“The Academy strongly believes that any hasty solution that may compromise rigorous scientific processes and standards will likely have long-term adverse impacts of unforeseen magnitude on citizens of India,” it said.

The High Court of Delhi should not have entertained the application at the threshold, the observations made are hereby ordered to be expunged,” a Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra ordered.Setting aside the Delhi High Court’s order and its comments against NIA, the top court said, “It is the courts at Bombay alone having the jurisdiction, which can entertain the application.“Since the respondent (Navlakha) has been moved to Bombay, he is at liberty to apply before the competent court in Bombay,” it said.The order came on an NIA petition challenging the Delhi High Court’s order seeking records of judicial proceedings before a special court that ordered Navlakha’s shifting from Delhi to Mumbai. The high court had pulled up NIA for shifting Navlakha to Mumbai when his plea was pending before it.Navlakha (67), who surrendered before the National Investigation Agency on April 14 following the Supreme Court’s direction, was lodged in Tihar jail in Delhi. He was taken to Mumbai by train on May 26. Later, he filed a bail plea before the Delhi HC.Terming his move to approach the Delhi High Court as a “misconceived venture”, the Bench said: “In case any modification of the order dated 08.04.2020 was required, it was incumbent upon the respondent (Navlakha) to apply to this court, which he did not do”.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said at the time when Navlakha surrendered, Delhi was under lockdown and NIA later moved the Mumbai trial court and requested for issuance of production warrant.After lockdown was lifted, he was taken to Mumbai on the basis of a production warrant issued by a Mumbai court, Mehta said, adding the observations by the high court were totally uncalled for.The Supreme Court had on June 19 frowned upon the Delhi High Court for having entertained Navlakha’s bail plea. “The high court shouldn’t have heard it as we had ordered him to surrender,” it had said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhima-koregaon-sc-sets-aside-delhi-hc-order-calling-for-nia-records-in-navlakhas-case-109311

This could result in 800,000 Indians leaving Kuwait, as the Indian community constitutes the largest expat community in the country, totalling 1.45 million, the Gulf News reported, citing a Kuwaiti newspaper.The current population of Kuwait is 4.3 million, with Kuwaitis making up 1.3 million of the population, and expats accounting for 3 million.Amid a slump in oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a spike in anti-expat rhetoric as lawmakers and government officials call for reducing the number of foreigners in Kuwait.Last month, Kuwait's Prime minister Sheikh Sabah Al Khalid Al Sabah proposed reducing the number of expats from 70 per cent to 30 per cent of the population, the report said.Assembly Speaker Marzouq Al-Ghanem told Kuwait TV that he and a group of lawmakers would submit to the Assembly a comprehensive draft law calling for a gradual reduction of expats in Kuwait.Kuwait has a real problem in its population structure, in which 70 per cent are expats, the Speaker said, adding that what is more serious is that 1.3 million of the 3.35 million expats "are either illiterate or can merely read and write", the people Kuwait does not really need, the Kuwait Times reported."I understand that we recruit doctors and skilled manpower and not unskilled labourers. This is an indication that there is a distortion. Visa traders have contributed in increasing this figure,” Ghanem said.The Speaker said the draft law they intend to file will propose to impose a cap on the number of expats, whose numbers must decrease gradually by stating that this year expats will be 70 per cent, next year 65 per cent and so on, the report said.The expat quota bill will now be referred to the committee concerned for consideration. It states that the Indian expatriate community should not exceed 15 per cent of the national population, which means around 800,000 of them might be required to leave Kuwait, the Arab News reported.According to the Indian embassy in Kuwait, there are about 28,000 Indians working for the Kuwaiti Government in various jobs like nurses, engineers in national oil companies and a few as scientists.The majority of Indians (5.23 Lakh) are deployed in private sector. In addition, there are about 1.16 lakh dependents. Out of these, there are about 60,000 Indian students studying in 23 Indian schools in the country.The bill will now be transferred to the respective committee so that a comprehensive plan is created. It proposes similar quotas for other nationalities. Kuwait is a top source of remittances for India. In 2018, India received nearly USD 4.8 billion from Kuwait as remittances.Foreigners have accounted for the majority of Kuwait's Covid-19 cases as the disease spread among migrant workers living in overcrowded housing.According to latest data from Johns Hopkins University, more than 49,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported in Kuwait. Globally, more than 5 lakh people have died and over 11 million have been infected by Covid-19.

Documents were missing in the plea,” it had told Kansal.The Registry officials were working hard to make the functioning of the court smooth for lawyers and litigants, it had noted.Kansal had sought a direction to Apex Court’s Secretary-General its Registrar/officers “not to give preferences to cases filed by influential lawyers, petitioners and law firms”.“There are many petitioner/lawyers have been suffering by unequal treatment by the Registry as the cases filed by some law firms/influential lawyers are immediately listed by Registry ignoring the cases of ordinary petitioner/ lawyers,” Kansal had said.Accusing the Apex Court Registry of following a “pick and choose” policy, he had demanded a set of guidelines to stop discrimination against ordinary lawyers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-dismisses-pil-that-accused-its-registry-of-favouritism-imposes-fine-109301

06-07-2020||Ajay Banerjee||India, China start partially pulling back from Galwan Valley||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 6Twenty days after the deadly clash between Indian and Chinese troops at Galwan Valley along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), there is a minor breakthrough as both sides have started to pull back from the flashpoint.A minimum buffer zone of 3 km between the two armies was suggested and agreed upon in the series of Lieutenant General-level meeting on June 2, 22 and 30. Sources said the distance of pullback initiated on Sunday night and the honesty of the PLA in doing so would be judged after 72 hours, or by Wednesday. Around June 17 some pullback had happened and then the PLA returned to hold ground.Also read: Ladakh row: China says front-line troops taking ‘effective measures’ to disengage and ease tensionsDoval-Wang talks preceded pull-back of troops from LACDoval-Wang talks: Avoiding an unnecessary Kargil-type deploymentThere has been some movement from both sides at PP-14, the spot of the clash on the night intervening June 15-16. Both sides will verify the spots after 72 hours. War-like stores of either side remain as they were. At Gogra Hot Springs and at the north bank of Pangong Tso some vehicles of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) have moved back, hence the Indian side is stopping short of terming it as a dis-engagement for now.The pullback is being seen as a ‘baby step’ towards the restoration of status quo ante which would include pulling back men, equipment and heavy weapons to the level of April 2020. Also, this would mean allowing the Indian Army to patrol in disputed areas like east of the ‘Finger-4’, at the north of Pangong Tso, a 135 km glacial melt lake.  The PLA has been stopping Indian patrols.On the Indian side, the military is still waiting and watching as each move can be reversed by the PLA at its will. Sources said the pullback at Galwan could have been necessitated due to the heavy flow of water in the narrow valley. This is the snow-melt period in this high-altitude dry plateau. With the mountain being tree-less, the flow of snowmelt is unimpeded hence the rapid current.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-start-partially-pulling-back-from-galwan-valley-109298

The per day testing capacity is also fast growing, Sharma said.Around 2,00,000 samples have been tested on an average daily for the last 14 days, he said.India had crossed the nine million-mark on July 1.“The per day testing capacity which was around 1.5 lakh on May 25 is more than three lakh per day now,” Sharma said.Starting with one single laboratory at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune and then expanding to 100 laboratories in the beginning of the lockdown, the ICMR on June 23 validated the 1000th testing laboratory.Various steps taken by the central government have paved the way for enhanced testing for COVID-19, the health ministry had said earlier.The Centre has strongly advised states and UTs to take immediate steps to facilitate testing at the earliest by enabling all qualified medical practitioners, including private practitioners, to prescribe COVID test to any individual fulfilling the criteria for testing as per the ICMR guidelines.Reiterating that ‘Test-Track-Treat’ is the key strategy for early detection and containment of the outbreak, the Centre last week advised them to take all possible steps to ensure full capacity utilization of all COVID-19 testing laboratories.       States were also asked to facilitate testing in a big way by adoption of ‘campaign mode’ by organizing testing camps, using mobile vans etc. This shall effectively take COVID-19 tests to the people’s doorsteps in high incidence areas to collect samples of all symptomatic individuals as well as their contacts, and get those samples tested by using rapid antigen tests, the ministry had said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-tests-in-india-cross-one-crore-mark-109297

The increase in the number of containment and buffer zones was an issue.The chief concern was that most tourists would be coming via Delhi, which continues to see an alarming number of the pandemic cases.Tourism industry, which was hoping for a turnaround, feels demoralised. The hotels, restaurants, emporia have been closed since March 25. This has resulted in loss of revenue and mass unemployment of guides, photographers, taxi drivers, etc.Officials also noted that in the absence of mobility by trains and flights, not many tourists would be able to reach Agra.Meanwhile, 13 fresh cases of Covid-19 were reported till late Sunday evening, taking the tally to 1,295. The number of discharged after recovery is 1,059. The death toll stands at 90. The number of active cases is 146.

But sadly, he continues to demoralise the nation, question the valour of our armed forces and do everything that a responsible opposition leader should not do," the BJP president said.He added, "Rahul Gandhi belongs to that glorious dynastic tradition where as far as defence is concerned, committees don't matter, only commissions do. Congress has many deserving members who understand parliamentary matters but one dynasty will never let such leaders grow.

We screen all the outgoing mails, and did not see any such letter written by Kafeel. And after the lockdown began, no one has been allowed to meet the inmates. So, how did the alleged letter go out?" he asked.Kafeel, in the letter to his family, has written, "With just one attached toilet and 125-150 inmates, the smell of their sweat and urine mixed, with unbearable heat due to electricity cuts, makes life hell over here. A living hell indeed."He further wrote, "I try to read but cannot focus due to suffocation. Sometimes I feel that I might fall due to dizziness. The entire barrack seems like a fish market full of all kinds of smells. People are coughing, sneezing, farting, urinating and sweating. Some people snore, some fight, some scratch themselves." The doctor also questioned his detention. "Why am I being punished? When will I be able to see my children, my wife, my mother and my brothers and sister? When will I be able to fulfil my duties as a doctor in fighting the menace of Coronavirus?" he asked.Kafeel's brother Adeel Ahmad Khan, said that the letter was written by Kafeel on June 15 and had reached them on July 1.Adeel claimed that the letter was sent by post.Kafeel Khan was booked for his alleged inflammatory remarks at an anti-CAA protest at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) on December 13, 2019.He was arrested from Mumbai on January 29 this year and was granted bail on February 10 by a court in Aligarh.But, on February 13, the UP government invoked the National Security Act (NSA) against him, ensuring that he remains behind the bars.Kafeel Khan first hit the headlines in August 2017 when he was blamed for the deaths of 30 children due to oxygen shortage in the BRD Medical college in Gorakhpur.He remains suspended from service even though he was cleared of the charges in a departmental inquiry.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/it-is-hell-here-150-inmates-share-one-toilet-gorakhpur-doctors-letter-from-jail-stirs-controversy-109286

It garnered 184 votes out of the 192 ballots cast in the UN General Assembly.Previously, India had been elected as a non-permanent member of the powerful Security Council for the years 1950-1951, 1967-1968, 1972-1973, 1977-1978, 1984-1985, 1991-1992, and most recently in 2011-2012."India is a very important country in the world in terms of technology, in terms of people, in terms of ideas and it also has been a very strong member of many other international organisations and can bring sensitivities of those organisations to bear in discussions (at the UN and as a Security Council member)," UN General Assembly president Tijjani Muhammad-Bande told PTI in an interview.Responding to a question on expectations from India as it prepares to sit in the Security Council next year, he said India had given a great deal of support to other countries not only in its own region, but also elsewhere."So, we expect that it will bring some focus to Development Goals (SDG) issues as it will bring some focus to discussions around respect for other countries."I think its own relationship within the Commonwealth and other fora (like the) Non-Aligned Movement, the G77, you name it. It has been a very responsible player in those fora, so we expect that it will galvanise action in those areas of importance to those organisations as well,” Muhammad-Bande said last week.On a question about what role India can play, together with the UN, to promote access to affordable medicines and vaccines, particularly in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, he said India can be helpful because it has a “very strong” relationship with its neighbours.“It operates within the Commonwealth, it operates within its region. It also operates at the UN and they are a platform to give further support to the efforts of the global community,” he said.The UN official said there was a resolution of the General Assembly agreed to by all Member States to give support to the idea of availability of vaccines."Countries that are able to produce quickly the needed vaccines when developed of course have a responsibility and those who are able to provide some funding to guarantee that this happens."And then we'll have a mechanism to allow those who really need access. Even before the crisis, many countries were struggling and the situation has become extremely more difficult for many countries," he said.

So far, the investigation has revealed the bribe money was accepted by a middleman,” the prosecutor said.Shah is the managing director of a crop solution company in Ahmedabad and is facing two separate rape cases under Indian Penal Code Section 376, one of which was being investigated by Jadeja. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/woman-si-arrested-for-taking-rs-20-lakh-bribe-from-rape-accused-in-gujarat-109284

I will not tolerate sick criminals forcing innocent people into slave labour and a life of exploitation. Let this be a warning to those who are exploiting people in sweatshops. —Priti Patel, UK Home SecretaryUK Home Secretary Priti Patel described the allegations as “truly appalling” and commended the undercover investigation for its role in “uncovering such abhorrent practices”. “I will not tolerate sick criminals forcing innocent people into slave labour and a life of exploitation,” said Patel. “Let this be a warning to those who are exploiting people in sweatshops like these for their own commercial gain. This is just the start. What you are doing is illegal, it will not be tolerated and we are coming after you,” she said. Last week, the senior Cabinet minister had directed the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) to investigate modern slavery allegations in Leicester’s clothing factories after alarm was raised that they were a key source of the spike in coronavirus infections in the region, which led to England’s first localised Covid-19 lockdown for the city.“Within the last few days NCA officers, along with Leicestershire police and other partner agencies, attended a number of business premises in the Leicester area to assess concerns of modern slavery and human trafficking,” the NCA said, which is looking into the undercover reports.The newspaper’s undercover reporter spent two days at Jaswal Fashions, a factory which supplies garments to one of Britain’s fastest-growing online retailer Boohoo. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-clothing-unit-with-indian-workers-faces-slavery-probe-109256

06-07-2020||Satya Prakash||When Supreme Court’s foresight saved Sec 69A of IT Act||After banning 59 Chinese apps, India has also blocked nearly 40 websites run by Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) — a pro-Khalistan outfit declared “unlawful” under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.Both the decisions were taken under Section 69A of the Information Technology (IT) Act that empowered the government to block online content in the interest of sovereignty, integrity, defence and security of the State, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognisable offence relating to these grounds.Many of the grounds mentioned in Section 69A, including ‘public order’ and ‘sovereignty and integrity of India’, were not there in the original Constitution and were added to Article 19(2) by first and sixteenth amendments to strengthen the restriction clause.Also, it was the Supreme Court’s foresight that saved Section 69A of the IT Act that has now been used by the Centre to block SFJ websites and ban Chinese apps.In Shreya Singhal’s case (2015), apart from Section 66A, the validity of Sections 69A and 79 was also challenged. Section 66A that gave sweeping powers to the police to arrest individuals for posting annoying or offensive comments in cyber space, Section 69A and 79 empowered the government to block online content and provided for exemption from liability of intermediaries in certain cases, respectively.While declaring Section 66A unconstitutional for curtailing citizens’ right to free speech, the Supreme Court read down Section 79 and upheld the validity of Section 69A, saying the latter had several safeguards to check its misuse.Unlike the controversial Section 66A, which was abused by the police to mindlessly arrest offenders even after it was scrapped, under Section 69A only the Centre can block information on the grounds mentioned in Article 19(2) of the Constitution and the authorities are bound to give reasons in writing for their decisions.State instinctively acts to preserve and protect itself from threats posed to its existence and to ensure safety and security of its citizens. Often criticised by experts for being a “completely inadequate” law from cyber security point of view, the IT Act still retains some teeth to deal with certain exigencies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/when-supreme-courts-foresight-saved-sec-69a-of-it-act-109228

Such people are even lured by offering jobs as far as in Delhi, Mumbai and a few districts in south India.”According to the data available with the BSF headquarters here, at least five Bangladeshi nationals were apprehended by the force in less than two weeks (between June 19 and 29).The officials said all apprehended men were in the age group of 12 to 25 years and their initial interrogation revealed that touts managed their entry into India from the other side with the help of local trafficking syndicates.It is understood that the job loss due to the lockdown and less work opportunities due to the ongoing pandemic were the reasons that these gullible people got lured and trafficked across the border, the officials added.In view of these revelations along with multiple intelligence inputs, the officials said the field formations had been alerted to keep an enhanced vigil against human trafficking, as it is expected to witness a spurt owing to the loss of job opportunities and lockdown imposed in both countries to contain the spread Covid-19 infections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bsf-alerts-field-units-to-check-human-trafficking-109227

Delay could be dangerous, he said. “A quarter of deaths have occurred on the first day of hospitalisation; half of all deaths have happened by two days of hospitalisation and about 60 per cent deaths within 72 hours of hospitalisation. The first 24 to 48 hours are extremely critical. Covid patients must get hospitalised at the slightest sign of breathing difficulty and if oxygen saturation levels drop below 94 per cent,” said Paul, Chairman, Empowered Group handling India’s Covid management. Noting that India's case fatality rate of 2.8 per cent was half the world had seen, Paul said the national goal now was to bring it below one per cent.“There is no reason why we should not strive for a case fatality rate of less than 1 per cent. We have urged the medical fraternity to lower the mortality rate to less than 1 per cent. States such as Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Haryana have kept case fatality rate under 1.60 pc, while Kerala among others have shown it can be brought below 1 per cent,” said Paul.Fourteen states and UTs — Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Arunachal Pradesh, Ladakh, Sikkim, Mizoram, Nagaland, Manipur, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu — of today have case fatality rate of less than one per cent.States/UTs with fatality rate between 1 per cent and 2 per cent are Chandigarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, JK, Karnataka, Meghalaya, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Uttarakhand.Those with top death burden and case fatality rate of over 2 per cent are Gujarat, Delhi, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rrajasthan, West Bengal and UP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-aiming-to-bring-fatality-rate-under-1-niti-member-109120

The announcement of the meeting was made on Twitter by Rashtrapati Bhavan. “Prime Minister @narendramodi called on President Kovind and briefed him on the issues of national and international importance at Rashtrapati Bhavan today,” the tweet said.Read also:The meeting comes against the backdrop of PM Modi’s visit to Leh and Nimu, where he addressed the soldiers. The PM also visited the field hospital to enquire about the well-being of soldiers injured in the bloody clash with Chinese troops on the night of June 15. While it’s a standard practice for the Prime Minister to call on the President periodically to apprise him of issues, this meeting assumes significance as it comes amid the India-China standoff at Ladakh, now on for two months. Besides the Galwan clashes, China continues to mobilise troops across the LAC with India too responding in a similar manner. The movement on either side remains even as the military commanders met on three occasions to work on a plan to de-escalate.Last week, India banned 59 Chinese apps, including the popular TikTok, a move taken to hurt the Chinese in matters of economy. Also, the government is moving to stop the import of power equipment from China. Union Power Minister RK Singh made the announcement to this effect last week. As of March last year, India imported Chinese equipment worth Rs 21,000 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-standoff-pm-calls-on-president-109116
