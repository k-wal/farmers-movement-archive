31-07-2020||London||India part of Gavi's new COVID-19 global vaccine access drive||The international vaccine alliance GAVI has facilitated a new drive aimed at securing doses of COVID-19 vaccines for 92 low and middle-income countries and economies, including India, at the same time as wealthier nations.The COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC) forms part of the COVAX Facility, a mechanism hosted by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, designed to guarantee rapid, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for every country in the world.“We are facing the most severe contraction of the economy since World War Two, and this crisis will have a terrible impact on the poorest and emerging economies,” said Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Chair of the Gavi Board.“These countries will have limited resources to access future COVID-19 vaccines: it is our duty to support them. Without this support, the majority of the world's population will continue to suffer from this disease even after we've developed a tool to tackle it. We now can stop this from happening,” she said in a statement released in Geneva.The list of 92 AMC-eligible economies includes all economies with Gross National Income (GNI) per capita under USD 4,000 plus other World Bank International Development Association (IDA) eligible economies.While close to $600 million has already been raised for the AMC, the “innovative financing mechanism” requires seed funding of USD 2 billion before the end of the year to secure and guarantee doses for the 92 AMC-eligible economies. India falls under the lower-middle income category.A minimum of an additional $3.4 billion is estimated to be required to procure around one billion doses by the end of 2021.“We now have the framework in place to ensure that every economy, particularly the poorest nations, don't get left behind in the race for a COVID-19 vaccine,” said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.“This disease has spread at lightning speed across the globe, which means nobody is safe until everybody is safe. That's why we now need support and vital funding to ensure that, once a safe, effective vaccine is ready, we can work on protecting the world and not just the lucky few.Gavi will work with governments, international organisations, manufacturers and civil society organisations to ensure doses get to those who need them,” Berkley said.The 92 low and middle-income countries and economies approved by the Gavi Board will be able to access vaccines through the COVAX AMC, which will also cover at least part of the cost. The COVAX AMC was launched last month at the Global Vaccine Summit hosted virtually by the UK.At that summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pledged USD 15-million as India's contribution to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.“Our support to Gavi is not only financial. India’s huge demand brings down the global price of vaccines,” Modi said in his address to the summit.“In today’s challenging context, I want to reiterate that India stands in solidarity with the world. Our proven capacity to produce quality medicines and vaccines at low cost, our own domestic experience in rapidly expanding immunisation, and our considerable scientific research talent are all at the service of humanity,” he had said.Gavi hopes that COVAX will enable countries to have access to the world's largest and most diverse COVID-19 vaccine portfolio. This means that, even if separate bilateral deals with vaccine manufacturers exist, through the facility countries stand a far better chance of getting access to the vaccine or vaccines that prove to be most effective.The high and middle-income economies that have already submitted expressions of interest in the COVAX Facility will need now to enter into a legally binding agreement to purchase doses through the Facility. This commitment will need to be confirmed in the next month by making upfront financial contributions, enabling the Facility to enter into manufacturer agreements for future vaccine supply.The goal is by the end of 2021 to deliver two billion doses of safe, effective vaccines to all participating countries including the 92 AMC-eligible economies.Once a vaccine has been approved by regulatory agencies and/or prequalified by the WHO, the COVAX Facility will then purchase these vaccines with a goal to try and initially provide doses for an average of 20 per cent of each country’s population, focusing on healthcare workers and the most vulnerable groups.Further doses will be made available based on financing, country need, vulnerability and potential threat, and a buffer of doses will also be maintained for emergency and humanitarian use.Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, is a public-private global health partnership to increase immunisation in poor countries.

She was moved to Government Medical College Hospital in Theni on July 4, where she died two days later.After her parents took the body to Kerala, they found that she had been sexually assaulted.They filed a complaint with the police in Kerala who initiated a second post-mortem there and intimated their counterparts in Perambalur.

However, the probability of above normal rainfall (>106 per cent of LPA) is also higher than the corresponding climatological probability, India’s official forecaster addedCurrently, the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) as well as the atmospheric conditions over equatorial Pacific Ocean indicate cold ENSO neutral conditions.Latest forecasts indicate that SSTs over the region are likely to cool further. However, ENSO neutral conditions are likely to continue during the remaining part of the monsoon seasonIn addition to ENSO conditions over Pacific, other factors such as the Indian Ocean Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) also have some influence on Indian monsoon.Currently, neutral IOD conditions are prevailing over equatorial Indian Ocean, which are likely to turn to negative IOD conditions during the coming months.The rainfall over the country as a whole during August is likely to be 97± 9 per cent of the LPA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/monsoon-likely-to-be-normal-in-second-half-of-rainfall-season-imd-120412

The Finance Ministry is actively engaged with RBI on this. In principle, the idea that there may be a restructuring required is well taken.”Sitharaman claimed that “every step” being announced and taken was taken after exhaustive consultations with the stakeholders and within the government.“We have taken these steps to ensure that the impact is felt on the ground,” she said.Addressing the concerns raised by the FICCI members on the difficulties faced by the MSMEs in taking loans under the Emergency Credit Guarantee Scheme, Sitharaman said banks could not refuse credit to MSMEs covered under the emergency credit facility.“If refused, such instances must be reported. I will look into it,” she assured industrialists, according to a Finance Ministry news release. In a meeting with bankers on July 29, Prime Minister Modi had asked them to introspect and take a relook at their practices to ensure stable credit growth.“Banks should not treat all proposals with the same yardstick and need to distinguish and identify bankable proposals and to ensure that they get access to funding on their merit and don’t suffer in the name of past NPAs,” said Modi, according to a PMO news release.On the FICCI suggestion for the creation of a Development Finance Institution — which the Government also favours — the Finance Minister said work in this direction was going on.“What shape it will take, we will know shortly,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.The Finance Ministry is working with the RBI on the demand of the hospitality sector for extension of the moratorium, or restructuring.“I fully understand the requirements of the hospitality sector on the extension of the moratorium, or restructuring. We are working with RBI on this,” the Finance Minister said.FICCI President Sangita Reddy appreciated the government’s proactive approach in dealing with the situation.“While the green shoots of recovery are being seen, sustaining this improvement in the operational parameters of businesses will require continuous support from the government. The support is particularly needed in the realm of strengthening market demand and to boost demand,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-rbi-move-to-restructure-corporate-loans-sitharaman-120399

Everything is n cannot be about agreeing to ur leader, but about being courages to voice ur opinion bravely as a citizen ..  As speculation mounted that the actor could quit Congress and join its arch-rival BJP following her welcoming NEP 2020, Sundar clarified “I am not moving” to the saffron party.“NewEducationPolicy2020 A welcome move,” she said on Twitter on Thursday along with a ‘thumbs up’ image, much to the surprise of many of her followers, who are used to her critical comments against the ruling NDA on various issues.#NewEducationPolicy2020 A welcome move. 👍  “My stand on #NEP2020 differs from my party n I apologise to @RahulGandhi ji for that, but I rather speak the fact than be a head-nodding robot or a puppet. Everything is n cannot be about agreeing to ur leader, but about being courageous to voice ur opinion bravely as a citizen,” she said in another tweet.With her welcoming the NEP 2020, speculations were abuzz of her possibly joining the BJP, which she dismissed outright.“I am not moving to BJP. My opinion might be different from my party, but I am an individual with a thinking mind of my own. Yes, #NEP2020 is flayed n flawed at some places but I still feel we can look at the change with positivity,” she said.The Centre’s NEP 2020 announced on Wednesday has sweeping reforms such as teaching in the mother tongue or regional language up to Class 5, lowering the stakes of board exams, allowing foreign universities to set up campuses in India and a single regulator for higher education institutions, except for law and medical colleges.Former HRD minister and senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor had welcomed it but feared it may make education unaffordable for the poor as it showcases a tendency towards “centralisation, high aspiration and low feasibility” with an assumption that the challenge will be met by the private sector.Tharoor had also said that the NEP glossed over the desperate need for qualified and trained teachers in schools, of whom there was a critical shortage.Placing the burden of pre-primary education on over- stretched, under-funded and under-equipped anganwadis is “disastrous”, he had said.Responding to Sundar’s statement, TNCC President KS Alagiri said the Congress was the “world’s biggest democratic political party”.“We can speak any controversial subject within the party forum. It will be welcomed. If we speak in a public forum it is called indiscipline. Indiscipline comes from frustration. Yoga is the best medicine to cure,” he said in a series of tweets on Friday.With her tweet supporting the Centre’s education reforms becoming a subject of discussion, Sundar on Friday said: “One tweet.. One line.. and I see the storm.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-national-spokesperson-welcomes-nep-apologises-to-rahul-gandhi-for-her-differing-stand-120392
31-07-2020||New Delhi||Envoys of Australia and China clash on Twitter over sovereignty claims in South China Sea||The envoys of Australia and China on Friday clashed on Twitter over sovereignty claims in South China Sea.It began with China’s Ambassador to India Sun Weidong tweeting that Australian High Commissioner to India Barry O’ Farrell was disregarding facts in his comments on South China Sea and that China’s claims were based on UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas).O’ Farrell thanked Sun for his comments and hoped that if UNCLOS was the benchmark for settling disputes, China would follow the 2016 South China Sea Arbitral Award which is final and binding under international law.He also wanted China to generally refrain from actions that unilaterally alter the status quo.South China Sea, however, may not have been the only issue that had troubled the Chinese envoy.On Thursday, when Sun was explaining his country’s position on the Galwan Valley clashes at a conference, O’ Farrell met External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and released a statement on which he also dwelt on the LAC tensions.The Chinese envoy avoided commenting on O’ Farrell’s part of the statement that said Australia opposed any attempt to unilaterally alter the status quo at the line of actual control (LAC), as that will increase tension and the risk of instability.Sun trained his fire on the South China Sea part of the statement by the Australian High Commissioner since Canberra has recently spoken on the issue twice.On July 23, Australia lodged a note with the UN Secretary General refuting China’s maritime claims in the South China Sea.More recently, the joint statement released after the Australia-US Two plus Two (Defence and Foreign Ministers of both countries) used identical words for the 2016 decision of the Arbitral Tribunal – “it is final and binding on both parties”.  The joint statement had also said the Indo-Pacific is the focus of the US-Australia Alliance and that the US and Australia are working side-by-side, including with ASEAN, India, Japan, Korea and Five Eyes partners to strengthen alliances and partnerships.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/envoys-of-australia-and-china-clash-on-twitter-over-sovereignty-claims-in-south-china-sea-120389
31-07-2020||Noida (UP)||105-year-old Afghan woman beats COVID-19, discharged from UP hospital||A 105-year-old woman from Afghanistan was discharged from a hospital in Greater Noida on Friday after recovering from COVID-19 in a fortnight, officials said.Rabia Ahmed was admitted to a private hospital, Sharda Hospital, on July 16 in a “life-threatening condition” after getting infected with the novel coronavirus and spent a week on a ventilator, they said.She had tested positive for the infection at a private hospital in Noida after which she was brought to Sharda Hospital, a dedicated COVID-19 facility. She was tested again on Thursday and the result came out to be negative, paving the way for her discharge on Friday ahead of the Islamic festival of Bakrid, hospital officials said.Ahmed, who hails from Kabul in Afghanistan, had come to visit her grandchildren who are living in Noida earlier this year, but eventually got stuck in the lockdown, they said.“When the patient was brought, she had a fever, severe breathlessness and pneumonia. She was also suffering from Alzheimer’s. She was unable to identify any relatives also when she was admitted here,” Dr Ashutosh Niranjan, the medical superintendent of Sharda Hospital, said.“She had urinal infection and her ECG was also abnormal. The patient was in a critical state and immediately shifted on ventilator support. She was suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),” Niranjan said.The treatment started in compliance with the protocols laid by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) and the hospital’s own norms for COVID-19, he said.“Her condition started improving after ventilator support for seven days. She was given a diet with high-level protein. After this, she was taken off ventilator support and the woman even started recognizing the health care staff who were attending her in the ICU,” Niranjan said.“Now her condition is much better. She is also eating properly. She was discharged from the hospital on Friday after the report of her COVID-19 test done on Thursday came negative,” the senior doctor said.The woman’s grandson, Ahmad Fawad, who came to take her back from the hospital on Friday, said: “Before Bakrid, the hospital has given my family a gift for a lifetime.

31-07-2020||Patna||Bihar govt says it will oppose Rhea Chakraborty’s plea in SC||The Bihar Government said on Friday that it will oppose a petition filed by actor Rhea Chakraborty in the Supreme Court, challenging the jurisdiction of the Patna police in lodging an FIR in connection with the suicide of Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput and starting an investigation.Advocate General Lalit Kishore said the state will be represented before the apex court by former Attorney General of India Mukul Rohatgi.While we have made no prayer for being included as a party to the case filed by Chakraborty, we will oppose her petition since she has challenged the jurisdiction of the state of Bihar,” Kishore said.He asserted that the matter fell very much within the jurisdiction of the state as the FIR was lodged on the basis of a complaint filed by Rajput’s father who resides in Patna.There have been many instances of cases being registered away from the site of an incident if links to the offence happen to be in the other place,” the advocate general said.He also scoffed at Chakrabortys contention that all cases in the matter be shifted to Mumbai and pointed out that the police in the western metropolis had not even lodged an FIR”.“It is the Patna Police which lodged the first FIR in the matter. I wonder how the Mumbai Police intends to investigate a matter without registering a proper case,” he said.In his complaint, the actor’s father KK Singh accused Chakraborty, who is said to have been in a relationship with Rajput, of having used his son’s standing in Bollywood to promote her own career, trying to drive a wedge between him and his family, getting him fed with medicines for mental illness with the help of conniving doctors and blackmailing him with threats of making his medical history public to tarnish his reputation.The bereaved father also alleged that at least Rs 15 crore was withdrawn from his son’s bank account to which Chakraborty and her family members had gained access to and that barely a week before Rajput hung himself to death at his Bandra residence, the actor had visited his house and stole his laptop, ATM card and other important documents.On reports of non-cooperation from the Mumbai Police to a four-member police team from Patna which is in the metropolis to probe the matter, the advocate general said, “If it is so, it is very unfortunate. It is normal practice for law enforcers to cooperate with visiting police teams from other states.”Kishore said everyone in the country is bound by the Constitution to abide by an order that has been passed by the Supreme Court when he was asked whether the Bihar Government would find it agreeable if the apex court directs for clubbing all the cases and moving these to Mumbai or orders a CBI inquiry.The Maharashtra home minister has expressed his own opinion in the matter. Let us wait for a few days. The apex court will come out with its order which will lend clarity,” Kishor said.Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh has opposed the no need for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inquiry into Rajput’s death and said the Mumbai Polices probe was sufficient.

31-07-2020||Hyderabad||This Hyderabadi finally passes Class 10 after 33 years thanks to COVID-19 pandemic||While the coronavirus pandemic has caused immense suffering and pain across the world, it has come as a "blessing" for a Hyderabad resident who finally passed his Class 10 examination after failing in repeated attempts during the last 33 years.Mohammed Nooruddin, 51, is elated at clearing Class 10 as the Telangana government has promoted all the students without conducting the exams due to the pandemic.It was in 1987 that Nooruddin, a student of the Anjuman Boys High School in Musheerabad area, had first appeared in Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exam. While he cleared all the papers, English proved to be a hurdle."Since I studied in the Urdu medium, English was the biggest weakness. I wrote the exam every year but could not secure 35 marks (out of 100) required to pass the paper. I was narrowly missing this as I was scoring 32 or 33 marks but I decided not to give up," Nooruddin told IANS.This year, the going was tougher for him as he had missed the last date to pay the fee to appear in the exams as a regular candidate and had to apply in the open category. This time, he had to write all six papers again."I was working hard. My daughter who has done B. Com with English as a medium of instruction, was helping me," said Nooruddin, a father of four including a mentally challenged son.However, the exams could not be conducted due to the Covid-19 situation and the government decided to treat all the candidates as passed. He is happy that he has finally passed the SSC but feels that this should have happened long ago.He recalled that those days, clearing the SSC was a must to secure any job in railways, police or other departments. "I was desperate to clear the exam but somehow it did not happen," said Nooruddin, who has been working as a security guard since 1990 at the same school where he studied and currently draws a monthly salary of Rs 8,000.He admitted after marriage in 1994, he was reluctant to write the exam. "Some people used to pass comments but I always ignored them and every year, I tried to give my best."Nooruddin said he wrote and passed the 'Fazil' exam equivalent to Intermediate (10+2) conducted by Idara-e-Adabiyat-e-Urdu or the Institute of Urdu Literature in 1994. He also completed a couple of courses at Jamia Nizamia, a leading Islamic seminary.He also runs an Arabic madarsa in Attapur area, providing education to children from poor families.

31-07-2020||New Delhi||'Students should prepare for the exam': Solicitor General tells Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Friday refused to pass any interim order on a batch of petitions seeking cancellation of final year/semester examinations in September and asked the Centre to clear the stand of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on the issue.The UGC told the court that nobody should remain under the impression that since the Supreme Court is examining this issue, the final year /semester examination will be stayed. The bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan asked the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) also to spell out its stand on UGC's July 6 circular in this regard.Advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava, representing the petitioners, urged the top court to issue an interim order for students in flood-hit Assam and Bihar, but it refused to oblige him.Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta made it clear that students should prepare themselves for the final year examinations. "Nobody should be under the impression that they cannot prepare. Students should prepare for the exam," Mehta said.Terming the UGC's decision as a result of non-application of mind, senior advocate AM Singhvi, representing one of the petitioners, sought to highlight the fact that the number of COVID-19 cases in India touched 16 lakh. "Heavens will not fall if exams are cancelled", he added.As Singhvi said UGC reversed its initial guidelines issued in April, the Bench said, "UGC can always revisit its guidelines.""This revisiting was arbitrary," said Singhvi highlighting lack basic IT infrastructure for conducting online examinations. He opposed the option of holding another examination at a later date, saying it would create chaos.Refusing to relent on the September 30 deadline for conducting a final year of universities and colleges, the University Grants Commission (UGC) had on Thursday told the Supreme Court that the decision was taken "after due deliberation by taking into account and balancing all relevant factors."In an affidavit filed in the top court, UGC said its circular was issued to "protect the academic future of students", while keeping in mind their "health and safety".The affidavit has been filed in response to petitions challenging the UGC's July 6 circular for allegedly being arbitrary as it mandated conducting examinations during COVID19 pandemic.The petitioners wanted the UGC to follow the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) which has decided to hold examinations at a later date for students not satisfied with their marks given on the basis of internal assessment.However, the UGC said: "The nature of examinations conducted by CBSE, ICSE or ICAI…are very different from those that are the subject matter of the UGC Guidelines. In the present case, the UGC is concerned with final year/terminal semester examinations which will have a lasting and indelible effect on the academic credibility, career opportunities and future progress of the students."The petitioners have highlighted the fact that IITs and governments of Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Pondicherry have already cancelled final year examinations.But UGC took exception to decisions taken by governments of Maharashtra and Delhi not to conduct final year examinations due to COVID19. It said "sufficient time" has been given to conduct the examinations and universities have been given sufficient flexibility to conduct examinations via online, offline or hybrid modes.In case students were unable to appear for examinations, they would be given a chance to appear at a specially conducted examination at a later date so that they were not put to any inconvenience or disadvantage, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/students-should-prepare-for-the-exam-solicitor-general-tells-supreme-court-120363
31-07-2020||New Delhi||In poll-bound Bihar, parties fight over response to Sushant Singh Rajput’s death||Actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death is turning into a big political issue among political parties, including NDA allies, in Bihar, where elections are due later this year.NDA ally LJP on Friday questioned why CM and JD-U leader Nitish Kumar was silent and had not yet talked to his Maharashtra counterpart Uddhav Thackeray for a CBI probe into Rajput's death.LJP even questioned the motives of minister Maheshwar Hazari, who on Friday made shocking claims regarding Rajput’s “girlfriend” Rhea Chakraborty and demanded an investigation by the top central agency.Senior LJP leader Sanjay Paswan asked the Bihar Minister whether his demand for CBI probe is just for getting “published in newspapers” as his party president Chirag Paswan had not demanded such an investigation but had also talked to Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray.Hazari called Chakraborty a “contract killer” as well as a “venomous snake woman”.Hazari was also quoted as saying: “Looks like this is a part of a big game. Sushant was killed and a huge gang is involved in it, therefore a proper detailed investigation must be done.”She has been named in the FIR filed by the late Bollywood actor’s father in Patna.Reacting to the Bihar minister’s demand, Paswan said Maheswari should not just concentrate on getting his name published in newspapers but also ask the CM to take the lead in the matter. He took strong objection to the way the minister appeared before the press after remaining ‘gayab (missing)’ for 45 days.“JD-U leader and Bihar minister Hazari says there should be a CBI probe in the death of Sushant Singh Rajput,” Paswan said.“He should tell why Nitish Kumar has not talked about this to his Maharashtra counterpart Uddhav Thackeray.“Our president Chirag Paswan has been regularly making the demand that Nitish Kumar should talk to Maharashtra CM.  Chirag Paswan has himself talked to Maharashtra CM twice on the issue“However, there has been no movement in this direction by the Bihar CM. Giving statements that there should be a CBI probe appears to be aimed at getting published in newspapers and publicity“I would ask the minister that if he can meet the CM or talk to him on phone, he should inform him about the suggestion by Chirag Pawan in order to get Sushant Singh justice,” said Paswan, who is also the vice president of the LJP.Notably, not just LJP and Paswan, but the RJD also has been at the forefront of the issue related to Rajput, who belongs to Bihar.BJP leaders, including former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis, have also been critical of the Mumbai police in the probe regarding the death of Rajput.LJP patriarch and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said there had been a confrontation between the two states and no FIR had yet been registered yet in Maharashtra.“Chirag (Paswan) had spoken to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray that there should be a CBI probe. All political leaders are demanding for it. It (the case related to the death of Sushant Singh Rajput) should be handed over to the CBI,” said the senior leader from Bihar and a member of the Narendra Modi Cabinet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/in-poll-bound-bihar-parties-fight-over-response-to-sushant-singh-rajputs-death-120361

A student of Class 9 at Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya at Anand Vihar in Delhi, Riyaz originally belongs to Madhubani district of Bihar, President Press Secretary Ajay Kumar Singh said.His parents, two sisters and a brother, live in Madhubani, while Riyaz stays in a rented accommodation in Maharajpur, Ghaziabad. To supplement his father’s paltry income as a cook, the boy, in his free time, works in an eatery in Ghaziabad as a dishwasher.The bicycle delivered to Riyaz today, a day before Eid-al-Adha, comes as Eidi in true spirit of the festival that is marked by gifts given by elders to youngers.Riyaz is a student of Class 9 at Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Delhi and works as a dishwasher in an eatery in Ghaziabad  Riyaz’s passion is cycling, and he practises hard after studies and work. In 2017, he won the bronze medal in the Delhi State Cycling Championship. He went on to participate in a school games event in Guwahati, according to the District Magistrate, Ghaziabad, and achieved the fourth rank at the national level.Enthused by his achievements so far, the boy has raised the bar and has been taking professional training from a coach, Pramod Sharma.Riyaz regularly trains at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium in Delhi. He, however, had to depend on a borrowed sports cycle for his practice, and all that the budding champion wanted was a cycle of his own. His wish has finally been granted on the occasion of the Eid. The President came to know of Riyaz’s story of struggle through reports in the media.Complimenting Riyaz for his achievements defying all odds, President Kovind wished him very best in the life and said that his story should serve as worthy of emulation for the country’s youth who must come forward for nation-building by dint of their dedication, hard work, courage and honesty.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/president-kovind-gives-eidi-to-budding-cyclist-120352

Now the focus is on recovery. What is the hurry to go back? Should we go back at all? That world was a horrible world. It was creating global warming. Why do we have to go back to that world, a world with global warming, to a world where Artificial Intelligence is taking away jobs? Going back will be suicidal. COVID has given us an opportunity to think anew. This is the time to take outrageously bold decisions, not to quietly go back to where we were,” Yunus said in the conversation.The leading micro credit finance specialist who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh to lend collateral free loans to the poor entrepreneurs, Yunus said financial systems worldwide are designed in wrong ways.“COVID has revealed the weaknesses now. Poor people are all over. We knew they existed but suddenly we saw millions of migrants on the highway. We have to recognise these people. The economy does not recognise them. If we can finance them they will move up the ladder. We are engaged with the formal sector. When we gave micro credit to women they showed how much capacity they have. The whole world has accepted micro credit,” said Yunus advocating a new economic system where governments finance the poor to create a life in villages.He said we follow the western model of economics even when we have tremendous capacity to make things happen.“In the western model, urban economy is the hub and rural economy is the supplier of labour. Why can't we build an autonomous economy? Yunus asked saying today we have the technology, infrastructure and communications to ensure thriving economies in villages.Why can't we create an economy where people work where they live? he asked stressing the need to trust micro entrepreneurs.Grameen Bank, he said, is the sole bank in the world which is lawyer free and which gives collateral free loans to the poor and the money comes back with interest. He said this becomes possible when people trust each other and their capacities.To an intervention by Gandhi that a micro credit system for women he created in UP was destroyed by the BJP government, Yunus said, “If people enjoy what you are doing it would be a temporary disruption. It will spring back at other places with a bigger force. Good ideas are indestructible.”Yunus said COVID has given the world a chance to reflect how big, bold decisions can be taken. "We have a choice whether we go back to that terrible world which is going to destroy itself anyway or we go someplace else and build a new world where there will be no global warming, no wealth concentration, no unemployment," he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/suicidal-to-go-back-to-old-economic-order-mohd-yunus-tells-rahul-gandhi-120347

He said that many states have complied with the directions but some of them like Maharashtra, Punjab, Tripura and Karnataka have not paid salaries to the doctors and healthcare workers on time.Senior Advocate KV Vishwanathan, appearing for petitioner Arushi Jain, said the high risk and low risk classification made by the Centre has no basis and the government advisory of June 18 after the top court's order has no rationale basis.  He said that there is still non-payment of salaries to healthcare workers.The Bench was hearing a plea of Dr Arushi Jain, a private doctor, questioning the Centre's May 15 decision that 14-day quarantine was not mandatory for doctors.The top court also took note of an application filed by United Resident Doctors Association (URDA) through advocates Mithu Jain, Mohit Paul and Arnav Vidyarthi that salaries of doctors are being deducted for the period of compulsory quarantine treating it as leave period. To this, Mehta conceded that "the said period can't be treated as leave" and said that he would take necessary instructions on the issue. He said the Central government will take steps to ensure that the salaries of doctors and healthcare workers is paid on time.The top court posted the matter for further hearing on August 10. On June 17, the top court had directed the Centre to issue orders in 24 hours to all states and union territories for payment of salaries to doctors and healthcare workers as also for providing suitable quarantine facilities for those who are directly engaged in treatment of COVID-19 patients.It had said, “The Central Government shall issue appropriate direction to the Chief Secretary of the states/union territories to ensure that the orders are faithfully complied with, violation of which may be treated as an offence under the Disaster Management Act read with the Indian Penal Code."Dr Jain had also alleged in her plea that frontline healthcare workers engaged in the fight against COVID-19 are not being paid salaries or their wages are being cut or delayed.The Centre had earlier told the top court that the May 15 circular on Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) will also be modified, doing away the clause for non-mandatory quarantine for healthcare workers engaged in COVID-19 duty, and they will not be denied the quarantine.On June 12, the top court had observed, “In war, you do not make soldiers unhappy. Travel an extra mile and channel some extra money to address their grievances”. It had said that the courts should not be involved in the issue of non-payment of salary to healthcare workers and the government should settle the issue.

31-07-2020||Washington||China's aggression in Ladakh, claims for real estate in Bhutan shows its intentions: Pompeo||China's recent aggression in India's eastern Ladakh and claims for the real estate in Bhutan are indicative of its intentions, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said, asserting that Beijing under President Xi Jinping is testing the world to see if anyone is going to stand up to its threats and bullying.Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a bitter standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated last month following the Galwan Valley clashes in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed.China recently staked claim over the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary in Bhutan at the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Council and opposed funding to the project.Pompeo, during a Congressional hearing on Thursday, told the members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that “the actions are entirely consistent with what they have been signalling to the world for decades, you might even argue since 1989, but certainly since General Secretary Xi came to power”.The Secretary of State said China had the desire to expand its power and reach."They talk about bringing socialism with Chinese characteristics to the world. Claims that they have now made for real estate in Bhutan, the incursion that took place in India, these are indicative of Chinese intentions, and they are testing, they are probing the world to see if we are going to stand up to their threats and their bullying,” Pompeo said.“I am more confident than I was even a year ago that the world is prepared to do that. There's a lot more work to do, and we need to be serious about it,” said the top American diplomat.In his testimony, Pompeo told lawmakers that India had banned 106 Chinese applications that threatened its citizens' privacy and security."Our diplomatic efforts are working and momentum is building to mitigate the threats that the Chinese Communist Party presents. All 10 ASEAN nations have insisted that the South China Sea disputes be settled on the basis of international law, including UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea). Japan led the G-7's condemnation of China's national security law targeting Hong Kong,” he said.The European Union condemned the law too and also declared China a systemic rival to us, he said.At the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Secretary General Stoltenberg has called to make China a greater part of that alliance's focus.“We led a multilateral effort to ensure that the United Nations World Intellectual Property Organisation elected a director from a country that cared about intellectual property."Our QUAD (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) -- the US, Australia, India and Japan -- has been reinvigorated. We've worked hard at this. Our diplomats have done wonderful work. I'm very proud of the progress we are making. In addition to these multilateral efforts, Department of Justice is cracking down on Chinese intellectual property threats," he said.The US has sanctioned Chinese leaders for their treatment of Uyghur minorities in Xinjiang province, imposed export controls on companies that supported, and warned US businesses against using slave labour in their supply chains, he said.The US has terminated special treatment agreements with Hong Kong in response to the Communist Party of China's actions to deny freedom to the people of Hong Kong, he said.“We closed our consulate in Houston because it was a den of spies,” Pompeo added.

31-07-2020||New Delhi||HC grants anticipatory bail to former DMC chairman in sedition case||The Delhi High Court Friday granted anticipatory bail to former Delhi Minorities Commission (DMC) Chairman Zafarul Islam Khan in a sedition case as he was not required for further investigation by the police.Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri, who conducted the hearing through video conferencing, granted the relief to the 72-year-old and asked him to join the investigation as and when required.Khan's tenure in the commission ended recently."The petitioner (Khan) is admitted to anticipatory bail on furnishing of a personal bond of Rs 50,000 and one surety of the like amount in the event of arrest," the judge said while dictating the order.The court was informed by advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for Khan, that he has already submitted his laptop with the police and joined the investigation a number of times.Prosecutor M P Singh said he has instructions from the police that Khan is no longer required for further investigation.The high court, while granting pre-arrest bail to Khan, asked him to cooperate in the investigation and in case of change in address, inform the investigating officer.He was also asked not to leave Delhi without prior intimation to the police.The court was hearing a plea by Khan seeking anticipatory bail in the sedition case lodged against him, citing his age, health issues and risk of contracting COVID-19.The court had earlier granted him interim relief, asking the police not to take any coercive measure against him till July 31.On April 28, Khan had published, through his official page on social media, a post that allegedly had seditious and hateful comments.On May 2, based on a complaint, Delhi Police Special Cell lodged an FIR against Khan under sections 124A and 153A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for the alleged offences of sedition and promoting feelings of hatred between different groups on the grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence and language.Khan sought anticipatory bail on the ground that he is a public servant and a senior citizen aged 72 years, who suffers from heart disease and hypertension and is highly susceptible to COVID-19 infection which can have fatal consequences for a person of his age and health condition.“In these circumstances there is an urgent need to grant him protection from arrest and coercive action in a frivolous and untenable case, in order to safeguard his liberty as the failure to do so will have irreversible consequences on his right to life,” said the petition filed through advocates Vrinda Grover, Ratna Appnender and Soutik Banerjee.The plea has sought direction to the police that in the event of his arrest, he be immediately released on bail and that no coercive measures be taken against him. It also sought direction that Khan's laptop and mobile should not be seized.The plea claimed that no offence has been committed by Khan and the FIR has been registered with a mala fide intention to harass and intimidate him.It said the FIR against him was "misconceived, being made on a misrepresentation of facts and an erroneous, untenable reading of the law”.Khan claimed in the plea that his social media post was falsely reported, distorted and sensationalised out of context by certain sections of the media to embarrass him and to tarnish his stellar work that he has been doing as Chairman of the commission.“Alarmed that his social media post was being maliciously and knowingly distorted and false meanings and motives attributed to his words, the petitioner (Khan) responded through his social media posts dated April 29, 2020, and further on May 1, 2020, the petitioner elaborated on his original tweet and clarified the distortions and misrepresentations by sections of the media,” the plea said.It said that despite the clarifications, a “communal and politically motivated misinformation campaign was orchestrated” against Khan to undermine the good work done by him over 20 years.After almost a week since registration of the FIR, Khan was not served with any legal notice for interrogation and on the evening of May 6, when he was settling down for Iftaar, a police team came to his residence and orally asked him to accompany them to the Cyber Cell Police Station, it said.

31-07-2020||Jaisalmer/Jaipur/New Delhi||Over 50 Gehlot camp MLAs moved to Jaisalmer in chartered flights, others to follow||Over 50 Congress MLAs in the Ashok Gehlot fold, who were camping at a hotel on the Jaipur-Delhi Highway amid the ongoing political crisis in Rajasthan, were on Friday shifted to Jaisalmer in three chartered flights.Transport Minister Pratap Singh said in Jaipur the MLAs are being shifted to Jaisalmer so that they remain united.He said the chief minister’s strategy is that not a single MLA is poached.The three chartered flights carrying the MLAs took off from here and landed at Jaisalmer, a distance of more than 550 km from Jaipur by road. The MLAs were taken to hotel Suryagarh in bus and other vehicles amid tight security.“We are going to Jaisalmer for a change,” Congress MLA Prashant Bairwa said at the Jaipur airport.The remaining MLAs in the Gehlot camp are also being moved to Jaisalmer.The decision to move the MLAs came a day after Gehlot indicated he will seek a confidence vote when the assembly convenes on August 14 and claimed the money offered to the MLAs to switch sides had increased sharply ahead of the session. The chief minister said the rebels who have not accepted money should return to the party.The MLAs have been staying at the Jaipur hotel since July 13 after Sachin Pilot and 18 other Congress legislators rebelled against the government, triggering a political crisis.Rajasthan Cong chief whip moves SC against HC orderRajasthan Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi on Friday moved the Supreme Court against High Court order of July 24 asking the assembly speaker to defer disqualification proceeding against sacked deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot and 18 MLAs.The chief whip has moved the top court two days after the assembly speaker CP Joshi filed the appeal against the July 24 Rajasthan High Court order.The plea filed through advocate Varun Chopra said that the High Court order is “ex-facie unconstitutional, illegal and in the teeth of the law laid down by this court in 1992 verdict in the case of Kihoto Hollohon”.The 1992 judgement had held that the speaker has the authority to decide the disqualification proceedings and judicial intervention in the process is “not permissible”.

This was his seventh such meeting."The Indian American community is an important stakeholder, in our relationship with the United States," he said."We look forward to your ideas and suggestions on how we can leverage our strengths, for the transformation of India, and for strengthening India-US partnership. We would like to see you play, a more active role, in India's economic development and recovery, in the post-COVID scenario, as we look forward to seizing the opportunities, from the shifting supply chains," he said.The Ambassador thanked the community members for their active support to stranded Indians."This has helped in supplementing the Embassy's outreach to stranded Indians and students, during the COVID-19 pandemic. By helping with medical advice, prescriptions, helplines, provision of temporary accommodation and provision of even groceries, in some cases, you have helped us meet the challenges. I am aware that several of you contribute, to local and community organisations in India, and we welcome your engagement with India's development," he said.Based on feedback from the community, the government has relaxed the travel restrictions, on OCI card-holders with specific categories, being allowed to travel on the Vande Bharat flights.

You occupy important positions in various walks of life, including business, academia, research medicine, IT, management and real estate.

31-07-2020||New Delhi||SC refuses to pass interim order on pleas for stay of final year exams, asks MHA to clear stand||The Supreme Court on Friday refused to pass any interim order on a batch of petitions seeking cancellation of final year/semester examinations in September amid the COVID-19 pandemic and asked the Centre to clear the stand of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on the issue.The UGC told the top court that nobody should remain under the impression that since the Supreme Court was examining this issue, the final year /semester examinations would be stayed.A bench head by Justice Ashok Bhushan, which conducted the hearing through video conferencing, said that it was not passing any orders on the issue and posted the matters for further hearing on August 10.The bench, also comprising Justices R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah, was informed by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre and the UGC, that he would apprise the court about MHA’s stand on the issue.Mehta said they were only concerned with final year exams and of over 800 universities in the country, 209 have completed the examinations.He said around 390 universities were in the process of conducting the examinations.“Let nobody remain under the impression that since this court is examining this, it will be stayed. Let students continue with their studies,” Mehta said.To this, the bench said: “We are not passing any such order.”The bench also asked counsel for Maharashtra to place before it the June 19 order of the state disaster management committee passed in this regard.“Let the decision (of state disaster management committee of Maharashtra) be brought on record,” the bench said.The top court said all affidavits be filed by August 7.At the fag end of the hearing, advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava, appearing for some of the petitioners, raised the issue of the plight of students in the flood-affected areas of Assam and Bihar.“This is not a case for interim order today,” the bench said, adding: “On August 10, we will hear it.”On Thursday, the UGC justified its decision directing all universities and institutions to hold final year/semester examinations in September saying it was done to protect the academic future of students across the country.The University Grants Commission (UGC) had filed a 50-page affidavit on a batch of petitions, including the one filed by Shiv Sena’s youth wing ‘Yuva Sena’, which have challenged its guidelines issued on July 6 for holding the exams in September amidst the persisting COVID-19 pandemic.It said that in June this year, considering the evolving situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, it requested the expert committee to revisit the April 29 guidelines, by which it had asked the Universities and Institutions to hold final year examinations in July 2020.The expert committee submitted a report recommending that terminal semester/final year examinations should be conducted by universities/ institutions by the end of September 2020 in offline (pen and paper)/online/ blended (online + offline) mode, the UGC said.It added that this report of the expert committee was deliberated and approved by the UGC in its emergent meeting held on July 6, since the conduct of the final year/terminal examination is a time-sensitive issue.The UGC said it has issued such guidelines to “protect the academic future of students across the country which will be irreparably damaged if their final year/terminal semester examinations are not held, while also keeping in mind their health and safety”.Assailing the decisions of some states such as Maharashtra and Delhi of cancelling the final year examinations, the commission said that such decisions directly affect the standards of higher education and will be an encroachment on the legislative field of coordinating and determining the standards of higher education that is exclusively reserved for Parliament under Schedule VII of the Constitution.“Therefore, the decisions of certain State Governments (Maharashtra and Delhi) to either cancel the terminal semester/final year examinations for UG/PG students and/or to graduate such students and confer degrees without appearing for the final year/terminal semester examinations is plainly contrary to the UGC's guidelines,” it said.The UGC justified the revised guidelines issued on July 6 and said that it adequately takes into account the evolving situation of the COVID-19 pandemic because it provided sufficient time till the end of September 2020 to conduct the final year/terminal semester examinations after following the prescribed protocols and procedures relating to COVID-19.“It gives sufficient flexibility to universities/ institutions to conduct such examinations online, offline (pen and paper) or blended (online + offline) mode and provide for an examination through a special chance for students who “for whatsoever the reason(s) may be” are unable to appear for the examination conducted by a university/institution by end of September 2020,” the UGC said.It said the universities/institutions might conduct such special examinations as and when feasible so that the students concerned are not put to any inconvenience or disadvantage.On July 27, the top court had asked the UGC to file a consolidated reply to the batch of petitions challenging its revised guidelines to conduct final year examinations by September 30 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

31-07-2020||Washington||India, China and Russia don’t care for their air, says Trump||US President Donald Trump has alleged that India, China and Russia do not take care of their air, while America does, noting that he withdrew from the “one-sided and energy-destroying” Paris climate accord, which would have made it a “non-competitive nation”.Trump, in his address on energy and the Permian Basin in Midland, Texas, on Wednesday, said by imposing these punishing restrictions — and beyond restrictions — “the Washington radical-left, crazy Democrats” would also send countless American jobs, factories and industries to China and to other foreign polluting states.“They want us to take care of our air, but China doesn’t take care of its air. In all fairness, India doesn’t take care of its air. Russia doesn’t take care of its air. But we do. Not on my watch, it’s not going to happen — I can tell you that. Because as long as I’m President, we will always put America first. It’s very simple,” he said.“For years and years, we put other countries first, and we now put America first. As we have seen in cities and towns across our nation, it’s not just Texas oil that the radical Democrats want to destroy; they want to destroy our country,” he said.Such radical Democrats, he alleged, do not love the country in any way, shape or form.“There’s no respect for the American way of life. There is no way of life ever in history that’s been like the great American way of life. There is no respect, but there is by you, and there is by 95 per cent of our people. Our people love our country, and our people love our anthem and they love our flag,” he said.Trump said under the last administration, America’s energy industry was under relentless and unceasing attack. “But the day I took the oath of office, we ended the war on American energy and we stopped the far-left assault on American energy workers,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-and-russia-dont-care-for-their-air-says-trump-120124
31-07-2020||New Delhi||Army commanders to meet again over LAC||More than two weeks after their last meeting and a deadlocked de-escalation process, Lt General-level commanders of India and China are slated to meet again.This, even as both sides are taking no chances to let down their guard militarily along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh.India is mentally ready for a long haul that includes setting up pre-fabricated facilities for housing additional troops that have been rushed in to face the Chinese. Special Indian Air Force flights and helicopters are being pressed into service to carry these pre-fabricated structures.A meeting of the commanders was held on July 15. It lasted 15 hours. The two sides have met four times since June 6. A meeting was proposed between July 28 and 30, but the plan did not fructify.A senior functionary said fresh dates for the meeting were being worked out. The aim would be to remind the Chinese that the agreed upon de-escalation schedule must be honoured.The Tribune was the first to report in its edition dated July 21 that China was dithering on honouring the deal to pull back troops, weapons and equipment.Since then, India has made it clear that it wants the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China to fully adhere to the agreement on creating a physical buffer zone along the LAC and going back from some specific areas, before any progress could be made. China, despite agreeing to it, has not vacated the area east of Finger-4 on the north bank of Pangong Tso. There are issues of Chinese build-up in the Depsang area, but the prime concern is the Pangong Tso area. The PLA has pulled back its boats from the waters in front of Finger-4, but its troops on ground remain.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-commanders-to-meet-again-over-lac-120027
31-07-2020||New Delhi||Ladakh disengagement not yet complete: MEA||India today said more meetings at the military level were needed because the process of disengagement of Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) had not been completed.“We expect that the Chinese side will sincerely work with us for complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquillity in border areas at the earliest,” Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at a virtual briefing.Speaking minutes after the Chinese Ambassador to India Sun Weidong again accused Indian troops of breaking an understanding between military commanders not to transgress the LAC in the Galwan valley, Srivastava said there had been some progress towards disengagement, but the process had not been completed.The Chinese envoy said Indian troops had been making roads, bridges and infrastructure in the Galwan valley area since April. Following representations from China, India agreed to withdraw its troops and dismantle the infrastructure. On June 15 evening, Indian troops crossed the LAC and attacked Chinese soldiers, leading to a physical clash. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ladakh-disengagement-not-yet-complete-mea-120028
