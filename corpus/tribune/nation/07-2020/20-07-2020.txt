But his most prominent role came as cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the biopic, ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story’.

20-07-2020||New Delhi||First five Rafale jets likely to be inducted by July-end: IAF||The first batch of five Rafale fighter jets is likely to be inducted into the Indian Air Force (IAF) on July 29, according to an official statement.It said the final induction ceremony will take place in second half of August.“The first batch of five Indian Air Force Rafale is likely to arrive in India by end of July. The aircraft will be inducted at Air Force Station Ambala on July 29 subject to weather,” the IAF said.“IAF aircrew and ground crew have undergone comprehensive training on the aircraft, including its highly advanced weapons systems and are fully operational now. Post arrival, efforts will focus on operationalisation of the aircraft at the earliest,” the IAF said.Official sources said the Rafale jets are likely to be deployed in the Ladakh sector as part of the IAF’s efforts to enhance its operational capabilities along the Line of Actual Control with China in view of the border row with the country.In a separate statement, the IAF said the top commanders of the force will take stock of the current operational scenario and deployments at a three-day conference here beginning Wednesday.“The plan of action for operational capability enhancement of the IAF in the next decade will also be discussed,” it said.Officials said arrival of the Rafale jets will further strengthen the IAF’s combat capabilities.India had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 for procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of around Rs 58,000 crore.The aircraft is capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA’s Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile and Scalp cruise missile will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.Meteor is the next generation of BVR air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) designed to revolutionise air-to-air combat. The weapon has been developed by MBDA to combat common threats facing the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Sweden.It is powered by a unique rocket-ramjet motor that gives it far more engine power for much longer than any other missile, said an official.Besides the missile systems, the Rafale jets will come with various India-specific modifications, including Israeli helmet-mounted displays, radar warning receivers, low-band jammers, 10-hour flight data recording, infra-red search and tracking systems among others.The IAF has already completed preparations, including readying required infrastructure and training of pilots, to welcome the fighter aircraft.The second squadron of Rafale will be stationed at Hasimara base in West Bengal. The IAF spent around Rs 400 crore to develop required infrastructure like shelters, hangars and maintenance facilities at the two bases.Out of 36 Rafale jets, 30 will be fighter jets and six will be trainers. The trainer jets will be twin-seater and they will have almost all the features of the fighter jets. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-five-rafale-jets-likely-to-be-inducted-by-july-end-iaf-115532

They must replicate what the Delhi government did,” Singh said.Hitting back at Singh, Delhi BJP General-Secretary Rajesh Bhatia said that AAP is “running away” from its responsibilities in Delhi.“First a man died in waterlogging in the city on Sunday. When we questioned them, they said the Kejriwal government was busy handling coronavirus, so it could not pay attention to desilting of drains.“Now, they are saying there is community spread, if it is so what were they doing to stop it. The thing is COVID situation had gone out of Delhi government’s hands and was brought under control by Union Home Minister Amit Shah,” Bhatia said.Singh also said admitting that there is a community spread of the virus would require testing to be done on a large scale.“In terms of testing if you compare, India is far behind. In the US, 1,47,000 tests are conducted per million while in Russia over 1 lakh tests are done per million,” he said.“Meanwhile in India, just 9,000-10,000 tests per million are being conducted. It means enough tests are not being conducted and the country is being run on the formula of ‘no testing-no cases and no FIR-no crime’. Two states of UP and Bihar are the biggest examples in this respect where testing is being carried out just for namesake,” he said.

20-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi seems to have hit Covid-19 peak: AIIMS director Guleria||Delhi seems to have hit the COVID-19 peak with the number of daily cases declining significantly, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said on Monday, but cautioned against any lowering of guard.He also said cases are increasing in certain states and they will reach a peak later, but there is not much evidence of community transmission of COVID-19 at the national level. “However, there are hotspots even in cities where there is a spike of cases, and it is likely that local transmission is happening in those areas that is why containment zones need aggressive action,” he said.Asked if COVID-19 cases in India have hit the peak, Guleria said, “My feeling is that certain areas have hit their peak. Delhi seems to have done so because the cases have declined significantly. But certain areas are yet to reach their peak. Cases are increasing in certain states. They will reach a peak later,” he said.Some states in the South, Ahmedabad in Gujarat and the central part of Mumbai also seem to be showing a decline, he said.“But then having hit the peak does not mean that you have to let your guard down. In many cities outside India, especially in the US, when people felt the peak is over and started not following social distancing and not wearing masks, there has been a spike of cases,” he said, underlining that even if number of cases come down, infection control and containment measures along with other dos and don’ts have to be followed to sustain that trend.Reaching a peak is a sign that the curve of the number of infections is flattening and the number of cases are coming down.The Health ministry has reiterated on several occasions that there is no community transmission of COVID-19 in the country.At a press briefing on July 9, Rajesh Bhushan, Officer on Special Duty in the Union Health Ministry, had said India has not reached the stage of community transmission.“In some geographical areas, there have been localised outbreaks. We should not forget that in our country, 49 districts alone account for 80 per cent of COVID-19 cases.“In a country of more than 733 districts, if 49 districts account for 80 per cent cases, then it is not justified to talk about community transmission,” he had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-seems-to-have-hit-covid-19-peak-aiims-director-guleria-115528

Dorjay, who was appointed as the chief of the party’s Ladakh unit in March resigned to protest the “failure” of the UT administration to evacuate Ladakhi passengers, patients, pilgrims and students stranded at various places in the country. In what was seen as a huge embarrassment for the saffron party, Dorjay, in his resignation letter, claimed the administration in Ladakh was “insensitive” about the condition of those stranded. He also alleged that “the UT administration has rendered autonomous hill councils of Leh and Kargil ineffective by not allowing them to function as per the council Act. Ladakhis have sacrificed a lot to achieve the autonomous status for the two districts”. A day after another leader, Tsering Gyalpo, resigned from the basic membership of the party in support of the Dorjey. Sources in the BJP say the appointment of 34-year-old Namgyal, who earned praise from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for his maiden speech in the Lok Sabha, is well suited for the post in the sensitive UT in the current situation and circumstances. Meanwhile Patil, a third-term MP from Navsari, replaced Jitendrabhai Vaghani as the Gujarat party chief. Patil used technology to push development works in his constituency and is someone considered close to PM Modi.  Ge also coordinates development works in PM’s Lok Sabha constituency Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-appoints-new-heads-of-ladakh-gujarat-units-115482

He offered me money to join the BJP, but I refused, saying I will not join the saffron party,” Malinga told reporters here.He did not disclose the amount that he was allegedly offered to join the saffron party. Asked if it was between Rs 30 crore and Rs 35 crore, Malinga said he was offered the “going rate”.He said he would not join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) even after resigning as an MLA.“How will I face the people of my area? What will I tell them?” he asked.The former Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA from Badi, along with five other legislators of the Mayawati-led party, was inducted into the Congress in September last year. The lawmakers had handed over affidavits to state Assembly Speaker CP Joshi to merge the legislative party with the Congress.Replying to a question on why did he not raise the issue when he was offered money, Malinga said he had alerted Gehlot ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls that a conspiracy was going on to topple his government.He said efforts to topple the government were going on from December last year.Malinga said he did not give any audio clip to the Chief Minister, claiming that he does not even know how to record an audio.The MLA said he is ready to appear before any investigating agency.

Who recorded it and where did the SOG get it from. Investigation should be carried out to find out if these tapes are genuine or not.”            His remarks indicated that he is unlikely to join the probe amid a raging political controversy over the audio clips.The Congress has alleged that the BJP leader’s voice figure in them, a charge refuted by him.The BJP has called these clips “manufactured” and demanded a CBI probe, questioning if the state police tapped phones of politicians in violation of rules.The FIR registered by Rajasthan Police mentions details of alleged conversations of rebel Congress MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma with Gajendra Singh and a third man, named Sanjay Jain. The police has arrested Jain.The Congress claims Gajendra Singh, the name mentioned in the FIR, is a reference to Union minister Shekhawat.Rajasthan plunged into a political crisis after Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot’s deputy Sachin Pilot rebelled. The Congress later removed Pilot as the deputy chief minister and also as the party’s state unit head. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shekhawat-questions-audio-tapes-authenticity-after-rajasthan-police-seeks-his-voice-sample-115476
20-07-2020||New Delhi||One dynasty trying to destroy Prime Minister Modi: BJP chief JP Nadda||Hitting out at Rahul Gandhi for criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP chief J P Nadda on Monday said that the Congress leader tries to politicise foreign policy issues by making statements that are “weak on facts” and “strong on mudslinging”.He also said that for years, one dynasty is trying to destroy the prime minister.The BJP chief’s reaction came after Gandhi, in a sharper attack on Modi, said the LAC standoff in Ladakh is not simply a border dispute but a design by China to attack his image as a “56-inch strongman”.“In recent years, be it Doklam or the present, Rahul Gandhi Ji prefers briefings from the Chinese instead of believing India’s armed forces. Why does one dynasty want a weak India and a strong China? Many leaders in the Congress also disapprove of one dynasty’s shenanigans!” Nadda tweeted.For years, one dynasty has been trying to destroy PM @narendramodi.Sadly for them, PM Modi’s connect with 130 crore Indians is deep-rooted. He lives and works for them. Those who want to destroy him will end up only further destroying their own party.  Dubbing the latest video of Gandhi on the Ladakh stand-off issue as a failed attempt to relaunch himself, Nadda said, as usual, the Gandhi scion is “weak on facts” and “strong on mudslinging”.Also read: LAC dispute Chinese design to attack PM’s 'chhappan inch' image: Rahul“Attempts to politicise defence and foreign policy matters shows one dynasty’s desperation to wash their past sins of 1962 and weaken India,” he said in series of tweets.Nadda alleged that since the 1950s, China has made “strategic investments in one dynasty that has given them rich dividends.” The BJP chief said as a result of that China captured land during the Congress-led UPA tenure.“For years, one dynasty has been trying to destroy the PM,” Nadda said while hitting back at Gandhi for his criticism of Modi.Underlining that Prime Minister Modi’s connect with 130 crore Indians is deep-rooted, Nadda said Modi lives and works for the people and “those who want to destroy him will end up only further destroying their own party”. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/one-dynasty-trying-to-destroy-prime-minister-modi-bjp-chief-jp-nadda-115472

20-07-2020||Washington||US lawmakers introduce resolution urging China to de-escalate border tension with India||Voicing concern over the recent Chinese military aggression against India, a bipartisan group of nine influential Congressmen have introduced a resolution in the US House of Representatives, urging Beijing that it should work towards de-escalating the situation at the border through existing diplomatic mechanisms and not by force.The troops of India and China are locked in a standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated last month following the Galwan Valley clashes that left 20 Indian Army personnel dead.Led by Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, other co-sponsors of the Congressional resolution are Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna and lawmakers Frank Pallone, Tom Suozzi, Ted Yoho, George Holding, Sheila Jackson-Lee, Haley Stevens and Steve Chabot.In the months leading up to June 15, along the Line of Actual Control, the Chinese military reportedly amassed 5,000 soldiers; and is trying to redraw long-standing settled boundaries through the use of force and aggression, the Congressional resolution says.Noting that India and China have reached an agreement to de-escalate and disengage along the Line of Actual Control, the resolution says that on June 15, at least 20 Indian soldiers and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers were killed in skirmishes following a weeks-long standoff in Eastern Ladakh, which is the de facto border between the two countries.“The Government of the People’s Republic of China should work toward de-escalating the situation along the Line of Actual Control with India through existing diplomatic mechanisms and not through force,” the Congressional resolution said.It is the sense of the Congress that there is significant concern about the continued military aggression by China along its border with India and in other parts of the world, including with Bhutan, in the South China Sea, and with the Senkaku Islands, as their aggressive posture toward Hong Kong and Taiwan.The resolution comes days after the House of Representatives Caucus on India and Indian-Americans in a letter to India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, said that over the last few months, the Chinese authorities have been acting with impunity and have attempted to transgress on the LAC, which resulted in diplomatic discussions to implement a process for de-escalation along the LAC on July 6.It was led by Congressmen Holding and Brad Sherman and signed by seven other lawmakers.“It is my hope that they scale back on their excessive weaponry and infrastructure at the Line of Actual Control and uphold both their longstanding and new founded agreements with India,” said the lawmakers who offered their condolences to the families of the fallen soldiers.“We are disappointed that China has been acting in contradiction to their agreements with India, in their attempt to change the status quo and challenge Indian troops at the border,” the letter said.Last week, Senator Bob Menendez, Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said US-India partnership, based on their shared commitment to democracy, is vital to uphold international law, international norms and the institutions that can peacefully and diplomatically resolve disputes and aggression.“As India and China work to disengage along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), I remain deeply concerned by China’s aggressive behaviour in territorial disputes,” Menendez said.“From the 2017 Doklam standoff, to the recent violence along the borders in Sikkim and Ladakh, to China’s new claims to Bhutanese territory, Beijing has all too often sought to redraw the map of Asia without regard for its neighbours,” he said.Top Republican Senator Marco Rubio also recently called on India’s Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu to express his solidarity with the people of India as they firmly confront unwarranted and lawless armed aggression by the Communist Party of China.“India has made it clear, they will not be bullied by Beijing,” he said.Senator Tom Cotton too slammed China of its aggression against India.    “China has resumed its submarine intrusions in the Japanese contiguous zones and picked deadly fights with India at high altitude,” he said.“Just go around the horn. You started in India, where, high up in the Himalayas, China has essentially invaded India, an ally of ours. And they have killed 20 Indian soldiers,” Cotton told Fox News in a recent interview. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-lawmakers-introduce-resolution-urging-china-to-de-escalate-border-tension-with-india-115460

The discussions have covered the entire range of issues related to management of COVID-19 patients, the Health ministry said. "Some of the important issues that have been stressed upon are the need for rational use of 'Investigational Therapies' like Remdesevir, convalescent plasma and Tocilizumab. The treating teams have discussed current indications and possible harm due to their indiscriminate use and the need to limit social-media pressure based prescriptions," it said. The ministry said the use of proning, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and ventilator settings for advanced disease have also been a common discussion point. "The role of various testing strategies in diagnosing COVID-19 has also been an important topic of shared learning. Issues such as the need for repeat testing, admission and discharge criteria, management of post discharge symptoms, and return to work have been addressed," it added. Some of the other common concerns have been the methods of communication with patients, screening of health-care workers, managing new-onset diabetes, uncommon presentations such as stroke, diarrhoea and myocardial infarction etc, it said. "The team from AIIMS, New Delhi was able to act as a bridge for new knowledge from one group to the other at each VC, apart from advising from its own experience and the extensive literature reviews done by the domain experts," the statement said.

It is your duty to do so.” Also read: Gangster Vikas Dubey died of 'haemorrhage, shock', says post-mortem reportThe CJI also asked the Solicitor General to look into the statements made by the Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister, saying, “If they have made certain statements and then something has followed, you should look into it.”“We are appalled by the fact that this person (Dubey) was enlarged on bail despite having so many cases against him. This is a failure of the system that somebody who had so many crimes in his name was let out and he committed this crime (killing of eight cops),” the CJI said.The top court sought a report from the UP Government on the orders passed in Dubey’s cases.“It’s not only one incident that is at stake. What is at stake is the whole system,” the CJI said.As a lawyer for one of the petitioners said the court should not to allow UP government to choose members for the commission, the CJI said, “Are you saying a former Supreme Court Judge and a former High Court Judge are state sponsored?”“I’m not saying that,” the counsel said.“That’s what you are implying. This attitude of slinging mud at every one must stop some time,” said the CJI.Earlier, Mehta submitted the investigation into the matter was going on as per the law. Referring to the killing of eight policemen by Dubey and his associates, Mehta said not only was Dubey a history-sheeter, but he had also demonstrated his capability to shoot at police just a few days back before he died.“You don’t have to tell us who Vikas Dubey was. There are close to 50 cases against him,” said the CJI.The Bench sought to draw a distinction between Dubey’s case and the Hyderabad encounter of December 2019, where four rape accused were killed by Telengana Police.“There is a difference in who was killed here and in Hyderabad case where the rape accused didn’t have any arms. But you as a state government, you are responsible to maintain rule of law. It requires arrests, trial and sentencing,” the Bench said.On behalf of UP DGP, senior counsel Harish Salve said this kind of judicial inquiry would demoralise the police force. Even policemen have fundamental right, he submitted.“Strengthen the rule of law and police force won’t ever be demoralised,” the CJI said.Amid speculations over killing of Dubey in a police encounter while being taken to Kanpur from Ujjain on July 10, the UP Police have asserted that it was a genuine encounter.The Supreme Court is seized of a batch of petitions, including those filed by PUCL, advocate Ghanshyam Upadhyay and suspended Police Inspector KK Sharma who is accused of giving a tip-off to the gangster.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vikas-dubey-encounter-sc-wants-probe-panel-to-be-led-by-ex-top-court-judge-115456

20-07-2020||Mumbai||Bringing down elected govt with money is treachery: Sena||Phone tapping is an assault on personal freedom and bringing down a democratically-elected government using money amounts to “treachery”, the Shiv Sena said on Monday referring to the Rajasthan political crisis.It needs to be decided which one of this is a bigger crime, an editorial in Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said, claiming the Rajasthan telephone tapping episode has exposed many.It said a lot of revelation will come to the fore in case someone hears secretly the conversations among Congress leaders and those (conversations) reach party leader Rahul Gandhi’s ears, and claimed some people are hell-bent to not let the Wayanad MP work properly.This, in effect, hurts the entire opposition, the Shiv Sena said.Its comments came in the wake of the Centre seeking a report from Rajasthan chief secretary on allegations of phone tapping after two audio clips of conversations purportedly regarding a conspiracy to topple the states Congress government emerged.The FIR registered by Rajasthan Polices Anti- Corruption Bureau mentions details of conversations of (Congress rebel MLA) Bhanwarlal Sharma with Gajendra Singh (Congress claims it is a reference to Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat) and a third man called Sanjay Jain.The BJP on Saturday asked if the Congress government in the state resorted to unconstitutional methods to tap the phones of politicians, and demanded a CBI probe into what it called a saga of illegalities and concocted lies.Rajasthan plunged into a political crisis after Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot’s deputy Sachin Pilot rebelled. The Congress later removed Pilot as the deputy chief minister and also as the party’s state unit head.“Phone tapping is an offence and assault on personal freedom. It is treachery to bring down a democratically- elected government using money. Hence, it needs to be decided which one is a bigger crime, the Shiv Sena said.“The deal which was on between the BJP and Sachin Pilot was to the extreme of exchanging money. That means it was decided that the Rajasthan government would be brought down by offering money and purchasing majority engaging in horse-trading,” it alleged.“Chief Minister Gehlot exposed that Sachin Pilots rebellion against injustice was a lie (not genuine) and for that, brought to light the phone conversation between Pilot and BJP leaders. It is shocking and equally sensational,” it further said.“The central powers pressure and money was used to bring down the Gehlot government,” the Shiv Sena charged, adding that the Congress foiled it.It further said phone tapping is an assault on one’s personal freedom and the Centre ordering a probe into the episode was right.“Now the question is what was the emergency in the country or the state that led to the Gehlot government hearing the conversations? Activities were on in Rajasthan to bring down a majority government and MLAs were being bought at increasing prices, the Shiv Sena alleged.Pilots rebellion was driven more by money than morality. This is nothing but corruption and the Gehlot government has registered an offence against Union minister Shekhawat based on evidence, it said.The BJP is not ready to speak about the serious offences and allegations against Shekhawat, it further said.Why those who are seeking President’s rule in Rajasthan have not made Shekhawat resign? First, make Shekhawat resign, atone for poaching of MLAs and then point a finger towards the Gehlot government, the Shiv Sena said.It said phone tapping is not limited to Rajasthan only.Allegations are being made about shadows of invisible Emergency hovering over the country, it said.“Games are being played these days to debilitate opponents politically, socially and mentally by dislodging them from their governments (in the states), it claimed.The Shiv Sena, which formed government in Maharashtra with the NCP and Congress last year, alleged that the dramatic events, unfolding before the Maha Vikas Aghadi regime was established in the state, were tinged with phone tapping of leaders of the three parties.It also said disputes within the Congress are unending and are raked up by certain people as if to not let Rahul Gandhi succeed.The Congress lost power in Madhya Pradesh out of such disputes, while the Rajasthan government has been saved for the moment, the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.The Rajasthan phone tapping episode has exposed many.But a lot of revelation will come to the fore if someone hears secretly conversation among Congress leaders and takes it (conversation) to Gandhi. Some people have been hell-bent on not letting Gandhi work properly.

20-07-2020||New Delhi||LAC dispute Chinese design to attack PM’s 'chhappan inch' image: Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday said the LAC standoff in Ladakh was not merely a border issue but a Chinese attempt to undermine Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “chhappan inch image”.In another video attacking the government for the Chinese intrusions into India, Gandhi said, “LAC standoff is not simply a border issue. It is a border issue designed to put pressure on the Prime Minister of India. And they (China) are thinking of putting pressure in a very particular way. And what they are doing, is that they are attacking his image. They understand that in order for Mr Narendra Modi to be an effective politician; in order for Mr Narendra Modi to survive as a politician, he has to protect the idea of ‘Chhapan Inch’."Also read: One dynasty trying to destroy Prime Minister Modi: BJP chief JP NaddaGandhi said the “real idea” behind the Chinese aggression is to tell PM Modi that if he did not do what they say, they will destroy the idea of Mr Modi as a strong leader.“Now the question is, how will Mr Narendra Modi react. Will he take them on? Will he take on the challenge and say absolutely not, I’m the Prime Minister of India. I do not care about my image, I’m going to take you on. Or will he succumb to them?“ asked Gandhi.PM fabricated a fake strongman image to come to power. It was his biggest strength.It is now India’s biggest weakness. pic.twitter.com/ifAplkFpVv  He alleged that so far the Prime Minister has succumbed.“The worry I have is, the Chinese are sitting in our territory today and the Prime Minister has said publicly that they are not, which to me tells me that he is worried about his image and he is defending his image. And if he allows the Chinese to understand that they can manipulate him because of his image, the Indian Prime Minister will no longer be worth anything for India,” Gandhi said.The former Congress president also said Chinese don’t do anything without thinking about it strategically.“In their mind, they have mapped out the world and they are trying to shape the world. That’s the scale of what they are doing. That’s what Gwadar is, that is what Belt and Road is. It is a restructuring of the planet. So when you’re thinking about the Chinese you have to understand that, that’s the level at which they are thinking,” Congress leader said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-dispute-chinese-design-to-attack-pms-chhappan-inch-image-rahul-115433

20-07-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan crisis: Court battle resumes, Speaker’s counsel says rebels’ petition ‘premature’||The Rajasthan High Court on Monday resumed hearing a petition filed by Sachin Pilot and 18 other dissident Congress MLAs, challenging the disqualification notices issued to them by the assembly Speaker.Abhishek Manu Singhvi, counsel for the Speaker, argued that the petition was premature as a decision was yet to be taken on disqualifying the MLAs from the House.           He said there was no scope for interference by a court over the show cause notices issued by the Speaker.The pilot camp moved court on Friday amid the infighting in the state unit of the Congress, as Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and his now sacked deputy Sachin Pilot tussled for power.The petition was taken up a by a Bench of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Prakash Gupta. On Friday, the court heard arguments by the dissidents’ advocate Harish Salve.The proceedings resumed on Monday morning and continued after a lunch break.The notices to the MLAs were served after their party complained to the Speaker that they had defied a whip to attend two Congress Legislature Party meetings last week.The Pilot camp, however, argues that a party whip applies only when the Assembly is in session.In its complaint to the Speaker, the Congress had sought action against Pilot and the other dissidents under paragraph 2(1) (a) of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.The provision disqualifies MLAs if they “voluntarily give up” the membership of the party that they represent in the House.Pilot was sacked as the Rajasthan deputy chief minister and the president of the state Congress unit after he rebelled against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.Speaker CP Joshi has given the rebel MLAs up to 5.30 pm to reply to disqualification notices, which the dissident camp wants the court to quash.

Naidu said he had held several rounds of discussions with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on enabling the meetings of the parliamentary committees and the monsoon session.  “Given the social-distancing norms, the logistics of seating of MPs required detailed deliberation and planning.

Rhetoric and tweets do not change the ground reality. Neighbourhood first has been a priority of India's foreign policy, but sadly derailed by a cavalier approach,” Sharma said, adding that India and Nepal shared a relationship based on trust, friendship and mutual respect, and the present drift and tension are a matter of national concern.‘Tweets don’t change ground reality’Amused by Foreign Minister S Jaishankar’s defence of a directionless foreign policy. Rhetoric and tweets do not change ground reality. Neighbourhood first has been a priority of India’s foreign policy but sadly derailed by a cavalier approach—Anand Sharma, senior Ccongress leader"The Foreign Minister cannot have the luxury of denial but should answer for the failures. Foreign policy must have gravitas and depth. Engagements with strategic partners demand seriousness and cannot be trivialised and reduced to event management. You may create illusions by your optics, but history will judge you by outcomes,” Sharma said after Jaishankar had rebutted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on the latter's claims that India’s relations with the world were flailing.Hitting back, Sharma today said Jaishankar's reference to Mumbai terror attack was oddly out of place."India's response was robust and mobilisation of international support exposed and isolated Pakistan. Why use Balakote, Uri and every brave action of Indian armed forces for partisan propaganda? Every Indian is proud of them. Do I have to remind that the Indian Army, Air Force and Navy existed before May 2014 and their heroics and valour respected globally? The Army belongs to the nation and fights under the tricolour.

We (Democratic party) lost (presidential elections in) Pennsylvania by 42,000 votes. In Wisconsin there are 37,000 Indian-Americans. We lost Wisconsin by 21,000 votes in 2016,” said the head of the Democratic party.“The Indian-American vote, the AAPI (Asian-American and Pacific Islanders) vote more broadly, can be an absolute difference-maker (in the 2020 presidential elections),” Perez said at a virtual event “An Electorate Coming of Age: Indian Americans for Biden”, jointly hosted by the South Asians for Biden along with AAPI Victory Fund and Indian-American Impact Fund.“We are hustling to the finishing line… 108 days till the weekend.

20-07-2020||BY Satya Prakash||Should secular state control Hindu temples?||The Supreme Court’s verdict upholding the Shebait rights of the Travancore royal family in the administration of Shree Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Kerala has been welcomed by many as it limits the state’s role in control and management of a prominent Hindu temple.Shree Padmanabhaswamy Temple made headlines in 2011 after a court-appointed panel found jewellery, idols, weapons, utensils, coins and other items worth Rs one lakh crore in five of its vaults. But the mysterious vault-B (Kallara B) — believed to be protected by cobras — wasn’t opened. It was vault-B that generated wider public interest in the case due to the widely held belief that it doesn’t augur well for those who dare open it.A Bench of Justice UU Lalit and Justice Indu Malhotra left it to the discretion of the advisory committee and administrative committee — set up to oversee the temple’s administration — to consider whether Kallara B is to be opened for the purpose of inventorisation.But the verdict doesn’t address the core issue of government control of Hindu temples alone in a secular state. Should a secular state control a religious institution? If yes, then why should it control only Hindu temples?Articles 25 and 26 together provide a constitutional framework to deal with the relationship between religion and state. Article 25 — which guarantees fundamental right to religion — authorises the state to make laws to regulate or restrict economic, financial, political or other secular activities associated with religious practices as also for social welfare and reform. Article 26 confers on every religious denomination or any section thereof a fundamental right to its religious affairs.Even if one presumes that there is mismanagement of a particular temple, can the state be allowed to take over the temple management permanently?Secularism is all about separating the state from religion. While some European countries are constitutionally Christian in nature, India, a declared secular state, controls Hindu religious institutions. This contradiction needs to be resolved as it goes against the idea of secularism, which has been declared a basic feature of the Indian Constitution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/should-secular-state-control-hindu-temples-115229
20-07-2020||Bhartesh Singh Thakur||FIRs under Section 399, 402 nailing dacoity plotters show a pattern||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, July 19Sandeep, a resident of Raipur Rani in Panchkula, was framed along with five others under Sections 399 and 402 of the IPC for making preparation to commit a dacoity in 2015 and had to face a trial for one year.The police had claimed that they had overheard them planning the dacoity, which a Panchkula court declared “was not possible” as the accused were sitting in a dargah room. All got acquitted.“We all didn’t even know each other. We were picked up from different places,” Sandeep said, who is a construction labourer.Most of the FIRs filed under Section 399 and 402 for “making preparation for dacoity” across Haryana usually show the same pattern: police personnel overhearing the accused’s dacoity plan. The trial courts have also consistently declared that the “overhearing of dacoity plan” was “unbelievable”.An RTI response in Ambala reveals that four cases were decided between 2016 and 2019, and all 23 accused were acquitted. In all cases, the police acted on “secret information” about the accused planning to commit dacoity. And, strangely, in three of the four cases, their timing was so perfect that when they reached the spot where the plot was being hatched they overheard the accused assigning duties for the dacoity. Notably, the accused were armed in all cases, but they didn’t resist the arrest.In similar occurrences (of the police overhearing the dacoity plan) in Fatehabad, two cases ended in acquittal of 11 accused from 2016 to 2019. In Rewari from 2016 to 2019, 10 cases involving 44 accused ended in acquittals.Same reason for acquittalsOn the police overhearing the dacoity plan, a trial court in Ambala in a judgment of July 19, 2016, commented: “It was not possible that the accused kept on talking about the same incident since the time the informant heard them and till the time police officials came to the spot.”A Fatehabad court also gave the same reason in its judgment dated March 30, 2017: “…ASI Charan Singh stated that they went to the disclosed place after 20 minutes of receiving the information and it is highly improbable that even at that time the accused were planning to loot the passengers.”Former ADGP Haryana Police Rajbir Deswal said, “Under this Section, the common practice with the police is to fix incorrigible people for crime prevention.”in most cases, cops ‘overhear the plot’Most FIRs under Sections 399 and 402, IPC, (plotting dacoity) across Haryana usually show the same pattern: cops overhearing the dacoity plan of the accused.Verdicts term police claims ‘unbelievable’Most trial courts have consistently declared that the “overhearing of dacoity plan was unbelievable”.Comprise fraction of total dacoities: DGP“The cases under Sections 399 and 402 have come down from 28 in 2018 to 16 in 2019. These are not even one-tenth of the dacoity cases. The acquittals are high as these incidents take place in the night and it is difficult to have independent witnesses,” says Haryana DGP Manoj Yadava||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/firs-under-section-399-402-nailing-dacoity-plotters-show-a-pattern-115231

The project will entail a private sector investment of about Rs 30,000 crore.As part of the plan for private trains, the Railways has planned to introduce 12 trains in 2022-23, 45 in 2023-2024, 50 in 2025-26 and 44 more in the next fiscal, taking the total number of trains to 151 by the end of financial year 2026-2027.The request for qualification (RFQ), which was floated on July 8, is likely to be finalised by November, the financial bids will be opened by March 2021 and selection of bidders will be done by April 31, 2021, according to a timeline for the introduction of private passenger trains prepared by the Railways.Bidders quoting the highest share in gross revenue would be awarded the project, officials said.“We have worked out a plan by which we hope to begin private train operations. Tenders will be finalised by March 2021 and trains will operate from March, 2023,” a senior official said.The Railways has said 70 per cent of the private trains will be manufactured in India which will be designed for a maximum speed of 160 kmph.

20-07-2020||---||Congress mulls Rajasthan House session to checkmate rebels||New Delhi, July 19Ahead of the crucial court hearing tomorrow on Sachin Pilot and 18 other rebels’ petitions challenging the disqualification notices issued to them by the Rajasthan Speaker, the Congress today hinted at the possibility of convening a short Assembly session in the state this week.“We have absolute majority in the Rajasthan Assembly. We have 109 MLAs in a House of 200,” Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said when asked if the party’s government in Rajasthan had the numbers should there be a floor test.‘CM gehlot to take call on floor test’The decision on when and how the floor test will happen will be taken by CM Ashok Gehlot and the government. It is the CM’s discretion. —Ajay Maken, Congress leaderThe Congress leader did not deny a plan to call an Assembly session in the state while saying that it was the prerogative of the state Cabinet to convene the session.Surjewala, however, claimed “absolute majority in the state”. The quick convening of the Rajasthan Assembly session could well be Congress’s strategy to checkmate Pilot, whose rebellion has unsettled the government led by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot. Gehlot yesterday met Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra, although the Governor House clarified that the meeting was in respect of the state’s fight against Covid-19.The Assembly session plan is part of the Congress strategy should Pilot and 18 other rebel Congress MLAs manage a reprieve from the state High Court. The rebel camp is demanding that the disqualification notices issued to them under the anti-defection law should be quashed.109 MLAs with us: SurjewalaWe have absolute majority in the Rajasthan Assembly. We have 109 MLAs in a House of 200. The BJP leaders are now scared of a trust vote.— —Randeep Surjewala, CongressThe Speaker’s notices followed a Congress complaint that Pilot and Co. had “voluntarily given up the party’s membership” by defying its whip to attend two CLP meetings.Should the court grant relief to the rebels, the Congress, in an Assembly session, could issue a fresh whip calling for a floor test to prove the government’s strength in the House and secure itself for the next six months.“The Rajasthan government is well within its rights to call an Assembly session, issue a fresh whip to MLAs and even take a floor test. In such a case, all MLAs, including rebels, would have to honour the whip. If they do not, they can attract disqualification for defying the whip. Such an action would be independent of the matter before the Rajasthan High Court,” former Law Secretary PK Malhotra told The Tribune today.Shekhawat must go over tapegate: CongThe Congress demanded the resignation of Gajendra Shekhawat from the Union Cabinet, saying he has no authority to continue when he is heard on audio clips that suggest a BJP conspiracy to topple the govt in Rajasthan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-mulls-rajasthan-house-session-to-checkmate-rebels-115234

These will replace the existing door frame metal detectors and hand-held scanners, besides pat-down searches of passengers to detect metallic objects, officials say.Officials in the AAI said even as the process to procure the device started well before the Covid outbreak, it had now been sped up, as physical scanning of passengers to detect metallic objects had been minimised to avoid infection.They said the tender to procure 198 body scanners for 63 airports had been issued and three companies had put in their technical bids. “Once they pass the technical criteria, they will be asked for financial bids and the lowest bidder will be awarded the contract,” they added.“Passengers will have to remove their jackets, thick clothing, shoes, belts as well as all metallic items before entering into the body scanner of an airport. A mannequin-like image will be generated by the machine and if there is a yellow spot on the screen, it will mean that the area on the body may need further screening. Once the body scanners are installed at the airports, pat-down searches will not be required for passengers,” the officials said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aai-to-procure-full-body-scanners-for-63-airports-115226

20-07-2020||Washington||If elected, Biden will help India get UNSC permanent seat: Aide||Democratic presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden, if elected to power in the November elections, will help shape international bodies like the United Nations so that India gets a permanent seat on the Security Council, a former top American diplomat has said.With Delhi on terrorHe (Biden) will work together with India... against cross-border terrorism and stand with it when its neighbours try to change the status quo. —Richard Verma, US ex-EnvoyIndia has been pushing for reforms in the United Nations, including the Security Council, stating that its composition doesn’t reflect the current realities and is not representative enough.“There’s no question that under his (Biden) leadership, he would help shape international institutions like the UN to give India a (permanent) seat on the Security Council, he would fulfil its (India) status as a major defence partner,” former US Ambassador to India Richard Verma said on Saturday.The UNSC has 15 members, including five permanent members — the US, the UK, France, Russia and China. China is the only permanent member of the UNSC which is opposed to India’s inclusion into the powerful grouping. Half of the 10 non-permanent members are elected every year for a two-year term. India, along with Mexico and Ireland, has been recently elected a non-permanent member for a two-year term starting January 1, 2021.Verma said, “He (Biden) would work together with India to keep our citizens collectively safe. That means standing up against cross-border terrorism and standing with India when its neighbours attempt to change the status quo.” “There’s no question president Biden would build a more inclusive, tolerant just and fair administration that would take US-India relations to new heights,” Verma said.He urged the Indian-American community to make Biden’s dream of making India and the US the two closest nations in the world a reality. Verma, an Indian-American who was US ambassador to India from 2014 to 2017, joined three other prominent Indian-Americans to make a strong pitch for the small but highly influential community to support and vote for Biden in the US presidential elections.The 77-year-old former US vice-president is set to be formally nominated by the Democratic Party in August. He will challenge 74-year-old incumbent President Donald Trump, a Republican in the November 3 presidential elections. Verma, Biden Unity Task Force Economic Policy adviser Sonal Shah, former US surgeon general Vivek Murthy and Centre for American Progress Action Fund CEO Neera Tanden in their address to a virtual event claimed that over the past several decades, Biden had a proven track record of being the best friend of Indians and Indian-Americans. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-elected-biden-will-help-india-get-unsc-permanent-seat-aide-115247
