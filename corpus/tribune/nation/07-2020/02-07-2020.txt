BJP is engaged in vendetta politics - 1st they scaled down security of Gandhi family and now her house,” he wrote on Twitter.“How many non-MP BJP leaders are staying in bigger Government bungalows in New Delhi,” the Congress leader asked.Singhvi said the classification of threat perception of neither Priyanka Gandhi nor Rahul Gandhi has been changed and it remains category “Z”. So was the case of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and former prime ministers Manmohan Singh and HD Deve Gowda, he added.“Their threat perception remains the same. Only thing is that the protecting agency has been changed from the SPG. So this is the trickery, the treachery, the manipulative approach, which need to be exposed,” he said.“Without changing the threat perception, you have simply, by law, changed away and taken away and reclassified them as non-SPG protectees. The threat perception has not changed, the protection agency has changed merely by a stroke of the pen,” he added.The Congress leader said without changing the threat perception, Priyanka Gandhi had become a non-SPG protectee, by virtue of which she lost her house.“This is the trick which has to be understood. They are not saying that the threat perception is less, so is that not a travesty, is that not a seriously manipulated bungle?” he asked.Singhvi said Priyanka Gandhi would not succumb to such actions but this showed that those in power in Uttar Pradesh were unnerved at her persistence, fearlessness, crusading for political matters of the common man.Asked to comment on reports that Priyanka Gandhi may actually shift to Lucknow, he said the core issue was the “machination of the government with treachery and trickery”.“What steps she takes, she has full rights to and she will take appropriate steps. I can assure you that she is not going to succumb. Obviously, the powers in Uttar Pradesh are unnerved at her persistence, fearless, crusading for political matters of the common man,” Singhvi said.He said Priyanka Gandhi was raising relevant issues every day and that was the reason behind this kind of “pettiness”.“I think they have misjudged the person completely and they have misjudged the Congress party,” he said.On a question related to the ED probe against Patel, Singhvi said: “Frustration and political vendetta are writ large. It has a traceable direct link to the prime minister and the home minister and the Gujarat connection of the Congress and Ahmed Patel.”He said it was clear that the “slap on the face of illegal, reprehensible, manipulative activities” in the Rajya Sabha polls in Gujarat had not yet been digested by the BJP’s national and state leadership.“They have not been able to digest that they are not to browbeat the Congress and Ahmed Patel or other functionaries to silence them, to cow them down. The tools and instruments of operation available with every government are being blatantly misused to harass, but, more importantly, to digress and divert, which is the two major Ds on the mind of the government since it has no answer to pressing issues like China, coronavirus mismanagement, the pitiable condition of the economy, unemployment and these silly so-called privatisation moves like the Railways,” Singhvi said.All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary, KC Venugopal said the eviction notice to Priyanka Gandhi emanated from the BJP’s “deep hatred” of the Nehru-Gandhi family and “vindictive and vendetta-driven” politics towards the Congress.With the sole purpose of “political vengeance”, the government had removed the SPG from the protective duties of Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra last year, he said.“The recent decision to send a notice to Priyanka Gandhi to vacate her official residence is only in continuation of this nefarious design to put their lives at risk,” Venugopal said in a statement.He said neither the Congress nor the Nehru-Gandhi family can be silenced by such “cheap pettiness and threats”.

02-07-2020||New Delhi||Tablighi Jamaat congregation: Visa cancellation, blacklisting orders passed on case-to-case basis, Centre tells SC||Separate orders were passed on a case-to-case basis for cancellation of visas and blacklisting of 2,765 foreign nationals for their alleged involvement in Tablighi Jamaat activities here, the Centre told the Supreme Court on Thursday.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta asserted that grant of visa was not an enforceable right, let alone a fundamental right, and the blacklisted foreigners were being prosecuted under Foreigners Act.“Grant of visa is a sovereign function of the State across the world and if they have committed an offence, these foreigners have to be tried. No foreign Tablighi Jamaat member has been deported as criminal proceedings are pending against them,” Mehta told a Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar.Mehta’s assertions came after senior advocate CU Singh said on behalf of petitioner foreign nationals from 35 countries that if there was any violation of visa norms, they can be deported to their parent country.Around 1,500 one-liner emails were sent to them regarding visa cancellations and no show cause notices were issued to them for blacklisting from travel to India for 10 years, the petitioners’ counsel submitted.Posting the matter for hearing on July 10, the top court asked the petitioners to file their responses to the government’s affidavit.The banned foreign nationals can challenge individual orders before high courts and were free to make representations to the Centre, it said.In an affidavit filed in response to petitions challenging cancellation of visas of foreigners and their blacklisting, the Centre said 2,679 visas were cancelled, 2,765 foreign nationals were blacklisted and 205 FIRs lodged against them in 11 states.It said 1,905 look out notices were issued against those absconding and nine of the visa cancellations related to Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card holders while 86 were Nepali nationals who didn’t need visa to enter India.The Centre said 227 of the Tablighi Jamaat members left India before blacklisting and other actions were taken.“En masse blacklisting of the aforesaid more than 2500 foreigners of about 40 different nationalities, currently in India, without affording any opportunity to prima facie defend themselves, is an egregious and blatant violation of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution,” the petitioners contended.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tablighi-jamaat-congregation-visa-cancellation-blacklisting-orders-passed-on-case-to-case-basis-centre-tells-sc-107655

The world’s largest software and Internet applications companies are present in India. We will continue to welcome foreign investments in India, but this will have to be in accordance with the rules and regulatory framework,” he said.India has adopted a three-pronged non-military strategy to hit back at China’s forward movement at several points on the LAC and the killing of 20 Indian soldiers. It has taken a strong position on South China Sea, slowed down consignments from China and has joined hands with allies to target China at global forums.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/eastern-ladakh-standoff-chinese-side-says-progress-made-india-for-quick-end-to-build-up-107648

Government’s MyGov portal will be used for the challenge and any Indian student can participate along with professionals and researchers from across the world.Track 1 launched on Thursday will deal with drug design. Track 2 will deal with designing and optimising new tools and algorithms which will have an impact on expediting the process of in-silico drug discovery and third track called “moon shot” allows for working on problems which are ‘out of the box’ in nature.Harsh Vardhan said, “We need to establish the culture of computational drug discovery in our country. In this initiative, MHRD’s innovation cell and AICTE will focus on identifying potential drug molecules through the hackathon while CSIR will take these identified molecules forward for synthesis and laboratory testing for efficacy, toxicity, sensitivity and specificity.”“The objective is to identify drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2 by in-silico drug discovery through the hackathon and follow up by chemical synthesis and biological testing,” he said.  The government said while it pursued clinical trials of few repurposed drugs for Covid-19 it was important to find other suitable repurposed drugs and specific new drugs against Covid-19.K Vijay Raghavan, Principal Scientific Adviser to the government, and Chairman of the hackathon organising committee said that the challenge would help India establish a new model to expedite drug discovery process.“It will have three phases of three months each and the whole exercise is projected to be completed by April-May 2021. At the end of each phase, successful teams will be rewarded. The lead compounds identified at the end of phase 3 will be taken forward for experimental level at CSIR and other interested organisations,” said Raghavan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-launches-drug-discovery-hackathon-to-develop-anti-covid-drug-107640
02-07-2020||New Delhi||CPI(M) opposes privatisation of Railways; takes dig at PM Modi’s pitch of self-reliance||The CPI(M) on Thursday opposed Centre’s decision to privatise Indian Railways, saying it would jeopardise country’s interest including its “Aatma Nirbhar” campaign.Taking a dig at the decision, it said that contrary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pitch for country’s “self-reliance”, the privatisation will roll up to “self-subservience”.“This is the first time that this is happening in independent India. The private sector utilising the network established over centuries with all the required infrastructure will run passenger trains making super profits,” the CPI(M) stated.The party’s Polit Bureau considered the privatisation issue and concluded it would jeopardise country’s overall interest, including the economy as Railways was the lifeline of the country and catered to broad spectrum of lives of people.The government has bitten the bullet by plunging for privatisation including the running of passenger trains by private investors over the Indian Railways network.The issue was also a subject of debate for long in a bid to reform and modernise the public transporter.The CPI(M) though feels that the Indian Railways remains the most important network uniting the country and providing public transportation for crores of our people.The livelihood of crores of our people is dependent on the Railways. Hence the privatisation undermines the basis of India’s self-reliant economy, it said.“Contrary to the claim that this will boost job generation, past experience has shown that such privatisation results in a huge job loss creating insecurity for crores of employees of the Indian Railways.”“Prime Minister Modi refuses to learn from international experience of how such privatisation of public transport has imposed unprecedented difficulties and burdens on the people,” the CPIM) said.The party asked the government to rescind its decision, and underlined that the Indian Railways is a public service. Its character cannot be undermined, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cpim-opposes-privatisation-of-railways-takes-dig-at-pm-modis-pitch-of-self-reliance-107632

These changes would need detailed design and can be done only in units with elaborate manufacturing facilities,” the affidavit stated.Moreover, isolation or quarantine facilities in coaches are temporary arrangements until the Railways begin regular operations and the modifications made were reversible, it added.As per the affidavit, train coaches cannot be reused for regular passenger services if major structural changes were carried out.A division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice MS Karnik noted that presently, the situation was not such that conversion of coaches into ICUs is warranted.The court in its order also expressed its satisfaction with the changes made by the Railways in coaches used as quarantine or isolation facilities.The Railways in its affidavit further stated that the Central Railway had converted 482 non-air-conditioned coaches on 24 rakes into makeshift isolation centres in Maharashtra.The middle seat in a regular non-AC coach has been removed and a toilet at the end of a coach has been turned into a bathroom.Similarly, the Western Railway has converted 410 non- AC coaches on 18 rakes into quarantine facilities.These rakes were stationed at key junctions between Mumbai and Bhavnagar in Gujarat, it was stated.

02-07-2020||New Delhi||India in talks with US, Canada, European and Gulf countries on establishing air travel bubbles: AAI||India is in talks with the US and Canada and the countries in European and Gulf regions on establishing individual bilateral bubbles which will allow airlines of each country in the pact to operate international flights, said Arvind Singh, Chairman, Airports Authority of India (AAI), on Thursday.The Ministry of Civil Aviation (MOCA), on June 23, had said India was considering establishing “individual bilateral bubbles’ with the US, the UK, Germany and France.Singh said: “This morning, I took a brief from the key point person (from the MOCA) who is negotiating with the countries, and he said that we are in constant touch. We are working on a consensus to restart the international flights. This is going to be through air bubbles.”“Talks are mainly going on between India and the US, India and Canada, India and Europe and India and the Gulf countries to start flights in these bubbles,” he said at a webinar called “Reposing the faith in flying” organised by the GMR group.Scheduled international passenger flights remain suspended in India since March 23 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Singh said the MOCA official has informed him that the discussion with the countries is at a “very advanced” level and the effort is to restart international flights at the earliest.“I am sure there would be a positive outcome of the talks with the US, Canada and with the Gulf countries and the negotiations are going on,” he noted.The EU has presently banned the flights from India as the number of COVID-19 cases was rising in the country, Singh said.Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had, on June 20, said the government would start thinking on the resumption of scheduled international passenger flights in mid-July when it expected the domestic air traffic to reach 50 to 55 per cent of the levels before COVID-19.After nearly two months of suspension to combat the virus outbreak, the government resumed scheduled domestic passenger flights on May 25.However, it had then allowed the airlines to operate the maximum of 33 per cent of their pre-COVID flights. The MOCA increased the limits on June 26 from 33 per cent to 45 per cent.The MOCA, on June 23, had said: “As we contemplate further opening up in response to demands, we are looking at the prospect of establishing individual bilateral bubbles, India-US, India-France, India-Germany, India-UK. These are all destinations where demand for travel has not diminished. Final decisions pursuant to negotiations are expected to be taken soon.”“We have received requests from authorities in several countries including the US, France, Germany among others requesting that their air carriers be allowed to participate in the transportation of passengers along the line being conducted by Air India under Vande Bharat Mission. These requests are being examined,” it added.Air India started international chartered flights under the Vande Bharat Mission from May 6 to help people stranded due to the pandemic reach their destinations.The MOCA’s June 23 statement had come after the US Department of Transport (DOT), on June 22, said it appeared that Air India might be using its passenger repatriation charter flights as a way of circumventing the government of India-imposed prohibition of all scheduled international services.“We are taking this action (of allowing only those Air India flights from July 22 that have DOT's approval) because the Government of India has impaired the operating rights of the US carriers and has engaged in discriminatory and restrictive practices with respect to the US carrier services to and from India,” the DOT had said.

02-07-2020||New Delhi||28 new ministers join Shivraj Chouhan Cabinet; Jyotiraditya Scindia camp wins big||Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday expanded his Cabinet, inducting 28 new ministers, including “12 loyalists” of Jyotiraditya Scindia, whose high-profile exit from the Congress in March marked the end of the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government in the state.The new ministers include 20 Cabinet rank and eight ministers of state. Chouhan, who took oath as the CM for a record fourth term before the COVID-19 lockdown, led a single-man Cabinet till April 21 when five ministers, including two former Congress MLAs close to Scindia (Tulsi Silawat and Govind Singh Rajput) were inducted.Incidentally, those inducted from the Scindia camp today are not MLAs as they had resigned from the Assembly in March and will now be contesting the by-polls.Sources say this is the first time in the political history of the state that so many non-members have been inducted in the council of ministers.   At present there are 24 vacancies in the 230-member MP Assembly.The sources say Chouhan, who tried hard to convince the central leadership and also camped for two days in the capital to make his point, had to ultimately drop the names of those he was pushing.In fact his statement “manthan se toh amrit hi nikalta hai, vish toh Shiv pee jaatein hain (Only nectar is produced when there is a churning as Lord Shiv drinks the poison)” is seen as an admission of his position in the tug of war with Scindia demanding his pound of flesh.In fact, power corridors of MP are buzzing with speculations of “scaling down” of the Chouhan’ persona and angry BJP hopefuls, who will now not be given a ticket in the upcoming bypolls.This and the “weakening” of Chouhan’s position was something on which Kamal Nath also took a swipe, saying, “I feel very sad at not finding many able, dedicated and senior BJP MLAs in today’s Cabinet expansion.”Sources say several senior BJP leaders are upset over the new power equations and structure in the state and also the plans to shift them to the party organisation.Some have openly cautioned against the perils of ignoring the “real cadre” of the party at the cost of outsiders.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/28-new-ministers-join-shivraj-chouhan-cabinet-jyotiraditya-scindia-camp-wins-big-107625

That was the first time Naidu came to Andhra Pradesh after the lockdown.It is expected that the government would restrict the TDP move to have a pro- Amaravati protest as announced.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chandrababu-naidu-to-launch-protest-for-revival-of-amravati-capital-project-107624

02-07-2020||Lucknow||Asked to vacate government bungalow in Delhi, Priyanka Gandhi set to shift to Lucknow||The government order asking Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to vacate a Delhi bungalow is set to speed up her shifting base to Lucknow, where party veteran Sheila Kaul’s house was renovated months back for her, according to politicians here.“Work has started in the house today. It has been almost six months since the renovation was done and it is being spruced up further to suit her,” party legislator Deepak Singh said here on Thursday.Uttar Pradesh Congress spokesperson Lalan Kumar indicated that the decision was made even before she got the notice to vacate the government bungalow in Delhi.“Priyanka Gandhi is in-charge of the state and it was decided six months ago that she had to shift her base to Lucknow,” the Congress media cell convenor said.Also read: Eviction notice to Priyanka: Congress accuses govt of ‘trickery, treachery’“The Kaul house has been renovated as per her requirements and she had also stayed there for three days in the past,” he added.The Centre on Wednesday asked Priyanka Gandhi to vacate her bungalow in Lutyens’ Delhi within a month, following the withdrawal of the Special Protection Group (SPG) cover for her.“Even if she had not been served notice, she would have shifted her base to Lucknow. She would be staying in Uttar Pradesh for 20 to 22 days a month. It was decided six months ago,” Lalan Kumar said.He said it was also decided that the Congress general secretary would undertake extensive tours of the state, making the state capital her base.Last year, during her Lucknow visit on October 2 to participate in the Gandhi Jayanti march, Priyanka Gandhi visited the house and spent some time there.The house is lying vacant at present with no one from the Kaul family using it.Sheila Kaul, who died in 2015, was the sister-in-law of India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. She had been a Union Minister and Delhi’s Chief Minister.Her house is located on the Gokhle Marg in Lucknow, about three kilometres from the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee headquarters.When Priyanka Gandhi was appointed Congress general secretary in-charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the then party president Rahul Gandhi had said his sister has been given the responsibility as part of a long-term plan.“She hasn’t been sent there for four months, she has been sent there with a larger plan. We will not only defeat the BJP in 2019 but also win the 2022 elections,” he said, referring to the next assembly elections.The Centre in November replaced the SPG cover for Congress president Sonia Gandhi and her children Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra with Z-plus security by the CRPF.This arrangement does allow her to retain any government accommodation and she has to vacate the 35, Lodhi Estate bungalow, officials said.According to a notice issued by the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, she has to vacate the bungalow by August 1, failing which “it will attract damage charges/penal rent as per rules”.

India says it was forced to turn down Pakistan’s offer to open the Corridor at a short two-day’s notice on health and technical grounds. The Covid epidemic was still raging and with the season of heavy rain approaching, Pakistan had still not constructed a bridge over an estuary of the Ravi River which could get flooded and leave the pilgrims stranded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-cannot-shift-blame-on-india-for-its-domestic-problems-mea-107617

02-07-2020||New Delhi||Private train operations likely by April 2023; ticket fares to be competitive with airfares: Railways||Private train operations in the country will begin by April 2023, and the ticket fares in these trains will be competitive with airfares on similar routes, the Railways said Thursday.Addressing a press conference online, Railway Board chairman VK Yadav said private players in passenger train operations would mean a quantum jump in technology and coaches that run at higher speeds.The improvement in technology would also mean that the coaches that now required maintenance after running 4,000 km, would need maintenance after every 40,000 km, that was either once or twice a month, the Railway Board chairman said.Also read: Govt snatching lifeline of poor: Rahul on Rlys inviting pvt players for train operationsHis statement came a day after the Railways formally kick-started its plans to allow private entities to operate passenger trains on its network by inviting request for qualifications (RFQ) for participation on 109 pairs of routes through 151 modern trains.Allaying fears that the Railways network was being handed over to private parties, Yadav told the Thursday press conference that private participation in passenger train operations would only be five per cent of the existing 2,800 Mail/ Express trains over the IR.“Train sets have to be brought by private operators and maintained by them. Private train operations are likely to begin by April 2023, all coaches will be procured under the Make in India policy. Fares in private trains will be competitive and prices on other modes of transport like airlines, buses will have to be kept in mind,” he said.He also said that the introduction of private players would also mean that trains would be available on-demand and that passenger waitlist would decrease.Yadav said the private operators would also pay fixed haulage charges for the path, stations, access to railway infrastructure and charges for electricity consumed.It will also share revenue with Indian Railways through competitive bidding.The private entity has to ensure 95 per cent punctuality and record not more than one failure per lakh kilometre of travel.“If any performance indicators are not met by private players in passenger train operations they will be penalised,” said Yadav.He also said there would be a power meter in every locomotive and the private operators would pay for the actual amount of energy consumed. This, Yadav said, would encourage them to keep their energy consumption low.“Through this, the common man will get better trains, better technology and at a low cost. The Indian Railways will continue to run 95 per cent of the trains,” he said.

02-07-2020|| Mumbai||Army officer finishes one of world's toughest cycle races||For Lt Col Bharat Pannu, celebration after pedaling over 4,000 km on an indoor trainer to complete the Race Across America (RAAM) meant sleeping once again like normal people.In cycling circles RAAM is considered to be one of the toughest races. The coronavirus outbreak this year forced the organisers to hold it 'virtually', where cyclists from across the world competed against each other on indoor trainers.Unlike the more famous Tour de France which unfolds in stages, the clock is always ticking in RAAM, and a cyclist has to ration the sleep hours to finish the race in allotted time.In normal RAAM cyclists are up against elements as they ride across the United States: desert heat, cold mountain passes, unpredictable winds.In virtual race these were missing, but there were many other challenges, and the lack of experience of cycling for long hours indoors made it more difficult, said Col Pannu who finished the race on Sunday evening, after 12 days."In outdoor, you tend to swing your body more by coming out of the seat often. No such luxuries are available indoors because the cycle frame is mounted on a stand," he told PTI while driving back to his base of Army aviation wing in Bengaluru from Pune where he raced.`Team Pannu' (every cyclist in RAAM has a support team) initially could not get his nutrition right. He was supposed to consume 250-300 calories in liquid form per hour, but on the third day they realized that Col Pannu had lost 4 kgs, which meant he was losing calories faster than he was consuming.It forced them to double his intake to 450-500 calories per hour by including solid food."Our trainer set-up was in the drawing room, and I was continuously wolfing down omelets, daliya and khichdi prepared in the kitchen next door," he said, thanking his seven-member crew who slept for only five hours a day.He took his first sleep break—of just 90 minutes—after cycling for 38 hours. During the 12 days of race, he had only 11 sleep breaks of 90 or 180 minutes.In the room where he raced, there were five screens including one showing simulated race route, fans to keep him cool and cameras to record his movements round the clock.During the 12 days of racing, he was completely disconnected from the outside world. It was only after finishing the race that he learnt about 20 Indian soldiers dying in eastern Ladakh during a clash with Chinese troops.According to Col Pannu, he stood third among 22 riders at the end of the race. Before him, only three Indian riders had finished the race in its over three-decade history.Col Pannu had planned to participate in the last year's RAAM, but he suffered a fracture during a practice ride in the US before the race and had to drop out."This success is unbelievable and I owe it to my dedicated team which has been with me for four years," Col Pannu, who also raised money for underprivileged children through the race, said.With the "vacation" over, he will be joining duty from Friday. The immediate priority, he says, is to recover from exhaustion. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-officer-finishes-one-of-worlds-toughest-cycle-races-107599

02-07-2020||---||Defence Council approves acquisition of fighter aircraft, missiles worth Rs 38,900 cr||Chandigarh, July 2The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) in its meeting held on Thursday, under the chairmanship of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, accorded approval for capital acquisitions of various platforms and equipment worth Rs 38,900 crore approximately.Focused on indigenous design and development, these approvals include acquisitions amounting to Rs 31,130 crore from the Indian industry. The equipment is to be manufactured in India involving Indian defence industry with participation of several MSMEs as prime tier vendors, read an official statement. The indigenous content in some of these projects is up to 80 per cent of the project cost.A large number of these projects have been made possible due to transfer of technology by the DRDO to the indigenous industry. These include Pinaka ammunitions, BMP armament upgrades and software defined radios for the Army, besides long range land attack cruise missile systems and Astra missiles for Navy and Air Force. The cost of these design and development proposals is in the range of Rs 20,400 core, the statement added.Acquisition of new/additional missile systems will add to the fire power of the three Services. While acquisition of Pinaka missile systems will enable raising additional regiments over and above the ones already inducted, addition of long range land attack missile systems having a firing range of 1,000 km to the existing arsenal will bolster the attack capabilities of the Navy and the Air Force. Similarly, induction of Astra missiles having beyond visual range capability will serve as a force multiplier and immensely add to the strike capability of the Navy and Air Force, read the statement.Further, addressing the long felt need of the Indian Air Force to increase its fighter squadrons, the DAC also approved the proposal for procurement of 21 MIG-29 fighter aircraft and upgrade of existing 59 Mig-29 aircraft and procurement of 12 additional Su-30 MKI fighters.While the MIG 29 procurement from Russia is estimated to cost Rs 7,418 crore, the Su-30 MKI will be procured from HAL at an estimated cost of Rs 10,730 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/defence-council-approves-acquisition-of-fighter-aircraft-missiles-worth-rs-38-900-cr-107586

Various steps taken by the Central government have paved the way for enhanced testing for COVID-19,” the ministry said.Through a significant step announced by the Central government on Wednesday, COVID-19 testing can now be done on the prescription of any registered practitioner, and not exclusively of a government doctor.The Centre has strongly advised states and Union Territories to take immediate steps to facilitate testing at the earliest by enabling all qualified medical practitioners, including private ones, to prescribe COVID-19 test to any individual fulfilling the criteria for testing as per ICMR guidelines.Reiterating that ‘Test-Track-Treat’ is the key strategy for early detection and containment of the outbreak, the Centre on Wednesday advised them to take all possible steps to ensure full capacity utilization of all COVID-19 testing laboratories. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-crosses-nine-million-covid-19-tests-107577

02-07-2020||New Delhi July 2||An urban forest cultivated with Miyawaki method in Delhi's heart||Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar inaugurated an urban forest with 12,000 seedlings on Thursday which would serve as a role model for offices in Delhi. Planting 59 indigenous species besides the CAG office, near the ITO, the project was initiated in October 2019.    A full-fledged forest will be there in another two-and-a-half-years or so, said officials.  "This could help in reducing the temperature by almost 14 degrees, and could increase the moisture by more than 40 per cent", said the Minister.  "Urban forests are the lungs of cities, acting as oxygen bank and carbon sink", said the Minister.The Miyawaki method of forest creation has been used to create the urban forest in the heart of the National Capital.  The technique was pioneered by Japanese botanist, Akira Miyawaki, and is believed to ensure 10 times faster plant growth, which results in plantation, that is 30 times denser than usual.According to experts, this process involves planting dozens of native species in the same area, which becomes maintenance-free after the first three years.Today inaugurated a unique Urban Forest at the Office of the CAG of India. Urban forests are the lungs of cities, acting as an oxygen bank and carbon sink.@moefcc pic.twitter.com/49zuhdA2OR  Over the years, the Air Quality Index (AQI) of Delhi has become an increasing cause of concern.Further, the ITO crossing of New Delhi has recorded particularly high air pollution levels. In response to these developments and keeping in view its community responsibilities, the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India which is located at Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg has taken steps to establish the Urban Forest in the Office Park. Keeping in view the limited area, local material was adopted to enable intensive afforestation, according to officials.The forest is made up of trees which are native to the area and are three-dimensional, multi-layered communities having 30 times the surface area of the greenery of single-layered lawns, and have more than 30 times the ability to protect against natural disasters and to conserve the environment.With minimal maintenance, including watering and de-weeding, the urban forest will be self-sustainable by October 2021.The Urban forest has an ecosystem which can restore habitat for birds, bees, butterflies and microfauna. These are essential for pollination of crops and fruits and to help maintain a balanced ecosystem. A dense forest ecosystem has been created in an area that is little over 1 acre in size.The multi-layered forest has shrubs, small to medium-size trees and tall trees carefully arranged as peripheral and core plant communities. Some of the rare native species planted here include Anogeissus pendula (Dhonk), Diospyros cordifolia (Bistendu), Ehretia laevis (chamrod), Wrightia tinctoria (Doodhi), Mitragyna parvifolia (Kaim), Butea monosperma (Palash), Prosopis cineraria (Khejri), Clerodendrum phlomidis(Arni), Grewia asiatica (Falsa), Phoenix sylvestris (Khajoor) and Helicteres isora (Marodphali).The species selected are part of Delhi’s potential natural vegetation and are best suited to the region’s terrain, climate and soil. The urban forest sends out an action-oriented message of bringing back lost environmental protection forests.In-depth field surveys of potential natural vegetation, well planned native species’ propagation and restoration projects like these are the need of the hour. The office of the CAG of India believes that initiatives like these will help us move towards a state of better ecological balance, especially in cities.It is a small yet significant contribution to Delhi’s ecosystem, one that could inspire people to reclaim and restore their natural surroundings.Recently, on the occasion of World Environment Day, the government announced the implementation of the Nagar van scheme to develop 200 Urban Forests across the country in next five years with a renewed focus on people’s participation and collaboration between Forest Department, Municipal bodies, NGOs, Corporates and local citizens.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/an-urban-forest-cultivated-with-miyawaki-method-in-delhis-heart-107567

According to data placed by MHA in Parliament earlier this year, these forces are facing a shortage of 2,695 GOs.The combined shortage of subordinate officers and other ranks is said to be close to one lakh. The total sanctioned strength of these six forces is 1,005 lakh out of which about three per cent are women.Some countries allow transgenders to openly serve in the military or the police though without any special exceptions.The United States had allowed transgenders to serve in the armed forces for a few years by has recently banned them. While some studies in the west have suggested that there may not be any medical concerns with transgenders serving in the forces, the issues involved are social, cultural, emotive and behavioural.In India, transgenders, known by various names and attired in female clothing, have been part of the society since times immemorial and have figured in mythology and ancient literature as well as in contemporary history and erstwhile royal households.In the present day, many of them live on the fringes of society, often in poverty and ostracised because of their gender identity. Most make a living by singing and dancing or by begging and prostitution.In 2014, a landmark judgement by the Supreme Court recognised transgender people as the third gender and ordered the government to provide transgender people with key amenities as well as quotas in jobs and education in line with other minorities.The government has already moved to recruit transgenders in various departments and also enabled their identity in electoral ballots.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-mulls-recruiting-transgenders-as-officers-in-paramilitary-forces-107564

02-07-2020||Kolkata||Banning Chinese apps is ‘digital strike’ by India: Ravi Shankar Prasad||Calling the ban on Chinese apps a "digital strike", Union Minister Communications Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday said India is wants peace, but if someone casts an evil eye, the country is capable of giving a befitting reply.Hailing the "strong" leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he asserted, if our country has lost 20 soldiers, the toll is double on the Chinese side."Now you can hear about only two 'Cs' - Coronaviris and China. We believe in peace and solve problems through discussion, but if somebody casts an evil eye on India, we will give a befitting reply...if our 20 jawans have sacrificed their lives, then the toll is double on the Chinese side."You all must have noticed that they have not come out with any figure," Prasad, also the Union electronics and information technology minister, said addressing a virtual rally for the people of Bengal.Recalling how India had responded after terror attacks in the recent past, Prasad, said, You all must remember how we had retaliated after Uri and Pulwama (terror strikes). When our PM is saying that the sacrifice of our jawans won't go in vain, it has a meaning. Our government has the will to deliver."Insisting that India carried out a "digital strike" to protect the data of countrymen, Prasad sought to know why the TMC was opposing the ban on Chinese apps."We are witnessing a strange trend in Bengal; the ruling TMC had earlier asked why we were not banning the apps, now they want to know why we are banning the apps. This is strange, why can't they stand with the government at the time of crisis," he said.Trinamool Congress MP Nusrat Jahan had on Wednesday termed the Centre's decision to ban 59 Chinese apps including TikTok an "eyewash and an impulsive decision", and said the Union government should substitute them with Indian apps as the livelihood of many people associated with these applications had been affected.He also attacked the CPI-M over its "silence" on the Sino-Indian border confrontation."I am surprised why the CPI-M has not criticised China. Is it the same CPI-M that it was in 1962?" he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/banning-chinese-apps-is-digital-strike-by-india-ravi-shankar-prasad-107558

02-07-2020||New Delhi||UN civil war ceasefire resolution not applicable to Kashmir, Maoist-hit areas||India’s partner countries in the UN Security Council stymied an attempt to mention India in a condolence message about the Karachi stock exchange, but were unable to place China and WHO at the centre of a resolution calling for a ceasefire in some civil wars which will not be applicable to counter-insurgency operations in Kashmir and Central India.The two developments--a resolution on ceasefire/ WHO and a statement on Karachi--have seen a tug of war between the US and other countries.Germany’s UN Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, the UNSC president for July, said the UNSC’s ceasefire resolution was “a sign for hope for all people currently living in conflict zones around the world”. It does not apply to military operations against Al-Qaida, ISIS and other UN-proscribed terror outfits such as Lashkar-eTaiba and Jaish-e-Mohamed.The diplomatic support by the US to India, which essentially amounted to a one-day delay in issuing the statement on Karachi, follows a string of statements from Washington in India’s tensions with China.Both US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have stated that they see China as the aggressor on the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Pompeo has also backed India’s banning of 59 apps that follows the US blocking Huawei and ZTE from availing of universal social obligation funds. For the first time, the White House and the State Department have pointedly included Sino-Indian border tensions in their checklist of aggressive Beijing behavior at a number of vectors around China’s periphery.This is the second time partner countries from the West have stood by India. After the Pulwama attack, Pakistan was not directly blamed but there was specific mention of Jaish-e-Mohamed in the UNSC statement condemning the attack. This indirectly indicted Pakistan, which has sheltered the terror group’s top leadership.The UNSC resolution proposed by China on the Karachi terror attacks was in fact muddied by Islamabad itself when Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi followed by Prime Minister Imran Khan pointed accusing fingers across the border. The political nature of the accusations led India’s partners US, followed by Germany, to seek a delay in using the statement to allow things to cool. South Block has interpreted this as a victory.The resolution on the Karachi attack did not indict any organisation though Pakistan has claimed that Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) is responsible. But it did condemn the attack in the "strongest terms" and as in the case of the Pulwama attack, it "underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice".In line with the accusations made by Pakistan PM and Foreign Minister, Pakistan is also trying to get three Indians who were working in projects in Afghanistan listed as international terrorists. The attempt to list one of them fell flat after no concrete evidence was submitted to the sanctions committee and that of other three could also meet a similar fate. India on the other hand not only got Jaish-e-Mohamed banned but also persuaded the UNSC to list its chief Masood Azhar as an international terrorist.A more bitter battle to name the WHO in the UNSC’s first resolution on Covid, however, was unsuccessful. Led by the US since early April, its allies in UNSC did not have enough firepower to hold the WHO accountable. Such wording would have indirectly indicted China since Trump was accusing WHO of parroting Beijing’s line. Co-sponsors France and Tunisia along with Russia managed to avoid the word "transparency" or "WHO" as was sought by the US.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/un-civil-war-ceasefire-resolution-not-applicable-to-kashmir-maoist-hit-areas-107550

But he refused to issue a death certificate saying that it was a COVID-19 case and advised the family members to contact the Amherst Street police station, under which the area falls, he said.The police directed the family to contact the local councillor.  "But there too we did not receive any help and we were asked to get in touch with the state health department,” he said."We even made several calls to the helpline given to us by a person when we called up the health department but nobody responded," another family member said.Unable to conduct the last rites, the desperate family members contacted a number of mortuaries but they too refused to keep the body after hearing of the circumstances of the man's death. The family members then managed to procure a freezer to preserve the body till the last rites."We made several calls to the local councillor and the state health department but no one helped us. Calls were not answered. That's why decided to keep his body at home inside a freezer," the family member said.The test results on Tuesday night confirmed COVID-19."In fact even after getting the test reports we kept on calling the state health department but there was no response. On Wednesday morning, we got calls from the health department and told them everything," he said.Within an hour, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) employees reached the apartment and took away the body for cremation, the family member said."His body will be cremated as per the ICMR guidelines for COVID-19 deaths," a senior KMC official said.

The upcoming election is the most important poll of a lifetime and that the country is currently engaged in a battle for its soul, he claimed.Biden also slammed President Donald Trump and his administration over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic.“Trump ignored warnings from the very beginning, refused to prepare and failed to protect the country. Not just now but throughout his presidency, undermining the very core pillars of ours, what I would argue, moral and economic strength.“I really do believe that our country is crying out for leadership and maybe even more important, some healing. Today, we have an enormous opportunity not only to rebuild but to build back better than before. To build a better future. That’s what America does,” he added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-elected-bolstering-ties-with-natural-partner-india-will-be-high-priority-joe-biden-107542

And these actions only confirm the true nature of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)."She said Trump was closely monitoring the situation with India and China and added, "Both India and China have expressed a desire to deescalate and we support a peaceful resolution of the current situation." Asked about India's decision to ban TikTok and 58 other Chinese phone apps, she referred to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's statement earlier in the day.He called the apps potential "appendages of the CCP's surveillance state" and welcomed India's decision to ban them."India's 'clean app' approach will boost India's sovereignty, will also boost India's integrity and national security as the Indian government itself has stated," he added.China is building up troops along the LAC, where a clash without firearms between Indian troops and China's Peoples Liberation Army resulted in the deaths of at least 20 Indian Army personnel including a colonel.China has refused to say how many of its personnel were killed.India's Lieutenant General Harinder Singh and China's Major General Liu Lin met on Tuesday at the LAC in an effort to defuse the situation.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trump-sees-chinese-aggression-in-ladakh-as-sign-of-its-true-nature-107538

Besides, the government has not said it will not allow any Chinese imports. It only wants to help Indian manufacturers to produce more,” SJM national co-convener Ashwani Mahajan said.There was a controversy when Minister for Road Transports and Highways, Shipping and MSMEs Nitin Gadkari wrote to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Commerce and Industries Minister Piyush Goyal seeking early clearance of consignments of agriculture equipment from China.Later, Gadkari said there was “no arbitrary stopping of goods” at the ports and the government was initiating path-breaking reforms to help MSMEs and make the country self-reliant. He also said his concerns over stopping of goods at Indian ports were “purely context specific” and that he was among the strongest proponents of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’.Mahajan said the decision to hold on shipments was also correct. “There has to be 100 per cent check on all aspects if India has to reduce dependence on Chinese goods, which are not just ruining the Indian industry but are also cheating consumers by way of their inferior quality.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-wing-traders-to-gain-from-ban-on-chinese-goods-107391

Journalists have reported of public officials and bystanders performing the last rites of individuals with family members unwilling to do so for fear of the infection,” signatories said, adding that during the pandemic, science must guide people in negotiating the difficult boundary between public and individual safety and misapprehension and stigma.“It is completely safe for the last rites of a loved one to be performed by family members and for them to have a respectful burial or cremation,” said the appeal. It cited the Ministry of Health‘s March 15 guidelines on burials which say that families may view the faces of loved ones before cremating or burying them and all rituals that do not require contact are allowed.Signatories to the letter include leading personalities from different walks of life, including art, theatre and public health — Vikram Patel, Shah Alam Khan, Sujatha Rao, Keshav Desiraju, Vandana Prasad, Mathew Varghese, Apoorvanand, Dinesh Mohan, Vikas Bajpai, Imran Qadeer, Syeda Hameed, John Dayal, Navsharan Singh, Natasha Badhwar, Radhika Alkazi, Rita Manchanda, Tapan Bose, Armaan Alkazi and Anwar ul Haq.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/citizens-seek-dignified-farewell-for-deceased-107439

We won’t be flustered by such notices,” Congress media head Randeep Surjewala said. TNSIn an order today, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs said the cancellation had been ordered consequent upon the withdrawal of Special Protection Group cover to Priyanka and the related grant of Z plus security cover by the Home Ministry.The government had in November 2019 withdrawn the SPG cover from Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi and said they would now be protected by the CRPF.Revoke orders, Capt urges CentreChandigarh: Taking strong exception to the Centre’s orders on Priyanka’s bungalow, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh has urged the Union Government to withdraw the cancellation orders in the interest of her security and safety.

Earlier two attempts to de-escalate did not work out, rather fresh military deployment was carried out by either side by adding troops and equipment like tanks, guns, radars, UAVs and fighter jets.Rajnath, Naravane to visit Ladakh tomorrowNew Delhi: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh is scheduled to visit Ladakh on Friday to take stock of India’s military preparedness, sources said. To be accompanied by Chief of Army Staff Gen MM Naravane, it will be the defence minister’s first visit to Ladakh after the recent standoff. PTISources in New Delhi said the meeting of the Lt General-level commanders at Chushul on Tuesday had ended late at night. “Both sides emphasised the need for an expeditious, phased and step-wise de-escalation as a priority,” the source said.More meetings are expected both at the military and at the diplomatic level in future to arrive at mutually agreeable solution and to ensure peace and tranquillity along the LAC as per bilateral agreements and protocols, authorities in New Delhi said.A source explained the need for “more meetings”, saying China is adamant on denying Indian troops patrolling rights east of ‘Finger 4’ in the north of Pangong Tso. Similar issues persist at a few other spots. The Area east of ‘Finger 4’ is also claimed by India and its troops regularly patrolled the area.Earlier two similar attempts to resolve the standoff after the June 6 and June 22 meetings had come a cropper. On the night intervening June 15 and June 16, troops of both sides were involved in a deadly clash. After the June 22 meeting, there was a decision to maintain a physical distance of at least 3 km between troops, but that was disregarded.Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian at Wednesday’s press briefing in Beijing said: “The two sides continue working towards implementing the consensus reached at the two earlier rounds of commander-level talks and made progress in effective measures by frontline troops to disengage and de-escalate the situation. China welcomes that. We hope the Indian side will work with the Chinese side, keep up close communication through military and diplomatic channels, and ease the situation and reduce the temperature along the border.”Global Times, the mouthpiece of the Communist Party in China, put the onus on “both sides” to respect historical facts and accommodate each other’s core concerns. In New Delhi, sources said Tuesday’s talks were in line with the agreement between External Affairs Minister and his Chinese counterpart during their conversation on June 17.

On the package and the label of these drugs, no claim about cure of Covid-19 should be mentioned.”The ministry, however, said Patanjali had initiated clinical trials for potential Covid-19 therapy as per government guidelines and the trust could continue with those trials as per procedure.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nod-to-patanjalis-coronil-not-a-drug-for-covid-107288

The Centre also asked states to allow all doctors, including private ones, to recommend the Covid-19 test. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ramp-up-testing-deploy-mobile-vans-states-told-107289
02-07-2020||New Delhi||Rahul appreciates role of nurses, says you’re a non-violent army||On Doctor’s Day, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday engaged four Indian nurses from across the world, including India, hailing them as a non-violent army fighting Covid-19 virus.Governments are trying to “manage the perception” about coronavirus infections and give a sense that the problem is not as bad as it is, Rahul asserted that it was important to accept the problem and fight it.Part of his ongoing video interactions, today’s conversation involved four Indian nurses — Anu Ragnat from Rahul’s Lok Sabha segment Wayanad and currently in New Zealand, Narendra Singh from Rajasthan and now in Australia, Vipin Krishnan from Kerala employed at AIIMS, New Delhi, and Sherlylmol Puravady from the UK.After Krishnan flagged some cases of pending Delhi Government compensation to doctors, who have died of Covid, Rahul assured help.“Two nurses have died in Delhi. One X-ray technician has died. One retired doctor from AIIMS passed away and also one sanitation staffer. They are yet to receive the compensation of Rs 1 crore announced by the Delhi Government,” Krishnan said, seeking Rahul’s help for nurses’ inclusion under the risk allowance category, citing the biowar the Army of nurses was fighting.“You’re a non-violent army,” Rahul said. Ragnat hailed New Zealand for “hard and early response to Covid” while Narendra Singh stressed hand hygiene for safety. Rahul spoke of how many Delhi hospitals were not being allowed to test Covid-19 rendering doctors vulnerable at which Krishnan added that “on May 27 when the infection rate in Delhi was 13.7 per cent, 7,000 tests a day were being done and by June 12 when the infection rate had crossed 30 per cent, under 5,000 tests a day were being conducted”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-appreciates-role-of-nurses-says-youre-a-non-violent-army-107386
