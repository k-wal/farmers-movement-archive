It has similarities to five-a-side football.The infected doctor is undergoing treatment for COVID-19 at ZMC, health department officials said.The state government served a show cause notice to the doctor during the day seeking clarification on why he stepped outside at a time when he should maintain self isolation, official sources said.Ruatfela alleged that the doctor was dealing with COVID-19 patients and sample collection before he tested positive, adding he was waiting for his swab test result.She demanded legal action against the doctor for “acting in unscrupulously manner to spread the deadly virus and endangering the safety of others”.She also claimed that the administration of the two hospitals allowed their staff to organise sports events despite curfew and thus disrespected the government order.However, Grace Nursing Home and Research Centre, managing director Johny Zahmingthat denied that the sports event was organised by the administration.He said that staffers of the two hospitals held a friendly match on their own and invited the doctor as he had once worked at the research centre.

23-07-2020||New Delhi||Air India pilots' union writes to Puri over pay cut, flags ‘potential disastrous psychological impact'||Air India's cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts and compulsory leave without pay (LWP) scheme could have "potentially disastrous psychological impact" on some employees, a leading pilots' union of the airline said on Thursday.Moreover, more than 60 Air India pilots have tested COVID-19 positive till date, the Executive Pilots Association (EPA) told Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri in a letter.Air India on Wednesday announced upto 50 per cent reduction in monthly allowances of its employees, who have a gross monthly salary of more than Rs 25,000."We shudder to think of the kind of desperate and extreme acts that could be triggered off because of the prevailing situation – as has been repeatedly proven many times in the past," the EPA said on Thursday.                           "Our association is...extremely concerned about the potentially disastrous psychological impact that the massive forced pay cuts and Compulsory LWP scheme may create on some employees," it added.The EPA termed the cuts in monthly allowances of pilots as "discriminatory, disproportionate and arbitrary".In another step to rationalise staff costs, the airline issued an internal order on July 14 asking its departmental heads and regional directors to identify employees, based on various factors like efficiency, health and redundancy, who will be sent on compulsory leave without pay (LWP) for up to five years.Moreover, the carrier said employees can voluntarily opt for the LWP scheme too.The EPA said the "adverse" policy decisions taken by Air India "pose an extremely serious and plausible threat to flight and public safety".It also said: "As of date, at least 60 plus pilots have been tested COVID-positive. Furthermore, unlike other wars, the enemy has accompanied the warriors home to affect their family members with devastating effect." At least one pilot has lost a family member to COVID-19 and those of many others have been infected, the EPA said."With a steady rise in cases, the situation can only get worse from now on," it added.Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in India since March 23. However, Air India has been operating a significant number of special flights to and from countries around the world under the Vande Bharat Mission to help stranded people reach their destinations.The aviation sector has been significantly impacted due to the travel restrictions imposed in India and other countries in view of the coronavirus pandemic.All airlines in India have taken cost-cutting measures such as pay cuts, LWP and firing of employees in order to conserve cash.On Monday, India's largest airline IndiGo had announced it would lay off 10 per cent of its workforce due to the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic.However, Air India announced on Thursday that none of its employees will be laid off.India resumed domestic passenger flights from May 25 after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus pandemic.However, the airlines have been allowed to operate only a maximum of 45 per cent of their pre-COVID domestic flights. Occupancy rate in Indian domestic flights has been around just 50-60 per cent since May 25.

23-07-2020||New Delhi||India has fantastic 'vaccine capability'; will be crucial in COVID-19 fight: UK envoy||India has a fantastic "vaccine capability" and it would play a crucial role in the partnerships the UK is building on COVID-19 vaccine development and manufacturing, the new British High Commissioner said on Thursday.British High Commissioner Philip Barton also said India is "really important" to the UK in meeting the COVID-19 challenges and getting through the pandemic."Clearly India has a fantastic vaccine capability, in particular the Serum Institute. We have entered into a number of agreements and most notable one is with AstraZeneca," he said during a virtual media briefing.Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer by volume, has partnered with biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to manufacture the experimental COVID-19 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford.Noting that the initial results of the Oxford University's early-stage human trials for a COVID-19 vaccine were encouraging, Barton, however, said, "We need to be cautious. We don't know if it is going to work. Oxford is well placed, but it is not there yet."     "The latest reports of the results of the Oxford University vaccine candidate are encouraging and, of course, as you all know, it will be manufactured here in India by the Serum Institute."I think that really illustrates our partnership in the health sector -- for the benefit of both our countries, but also more broadly for the world in general as we try to cope with and get beyond the pandemic," Barton said.He said putting health cooperation at the heart of the Indo-UK partnership was his top priority."We're all in this (fight against the pandemic) together. It is partnerships and working together that is going to get us through it. And India is really important to the UK in that regard," Barton said.It was crucial in giving permissions for the export of paracetamol when supplies were running very low in the UK and also in allowing supplies of PPEs, he said."It is going to be crucial in the future in the partnership we are building  on things like vaccines. Prime Minister Narendra Modi participated in the global vaccines summit in June that we hosted and made a financial commitment alongside many other countries to the vaccine alliance which we hope will provide a vaccine that will be made available globally to every one and see us through this crisis," the British envoy said.He said the Indo-UK health partnership goes beyond that and has a wider  research element to it."The UK is now India's second biggest research partner. We will be putting in 400 million pounds into research partnership next year," Barton said.

23-07-2020||Jerusalem||India, Israel join hands to develop rapid testing for Covid-19 in under 30 seconds||Merging Israel’s technological expertise with India’s mass production capabilities, experts from the two countries have joined hands to develop rapid testing for COVID-19 in under 30 seconds.Israel will soon send a high-level research delegation to India to conduct a series of “final stages of testing” as part of the joint effort to develop the rapid testing kits for COVID-19.A high-ranking team from the Directorate of Defence Research and Development (DDR&D), in the Ministry of Defense, which has been working with India’s DRDO to develop rapid testing for COVID-19 in under 30 seconds, is to leave from Tel Aviv to New Delhi on a special flight in a few days, Israel’s Ministry of Defence said in a statement on Thursday.Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) and Ministry of Health are also involved in this unprecedented cooperation between the two countries which aims at “merging Israeli technology with Indian development and production capabilities to allow a swift resumption of normal life alongside the virus”.The DDR&D team will conduct a series of “final stages of testing” to determine the effectiveness of a number of rapid diagnostic solutions with their Indian counterparts.Since the start of the pandemic, the DDR&D has tested dozens of diagnostic technologies. Some of them have matured and passed initial trials in Israel, however in order to complete testing and prove their effectiveness, these must be tested on a wide range of patients, IMoD said.The four tech systems that will be tested are -- voice test, breathalyzer test based on terra-hertz waves, isothermal test, and polyamino acids test.“What they all have in common is the ability to detect the presence of the virus in the body quickly -- usually within minutes. Developing diagnostic capabilities is a goal for the State of Israel and of many additional countries around the world. It is the most effective way to cut off ‘chains of infection’, prevent prolonged quarantine and enable the reopening of the global economy,” the statement said.“We hope that the research and development led by the DDR&D together with our excellent industries and academic institutions, will lead to a breakthrough that will change the way we diagnose and fight the virus, while giving the boost necessary to ‘restart’ our economy,” Defense Minister Benny Gantz said.Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi noted that this cooperation provides a unique opportunity for scientific and technological cooperation that can assist Israel, India and the world in coping both with the pandemic and with the economic crisis that came with it.The cooperation between Israel and India will enable the delegation and its Indian counterparts, to collect tens of thousands of samples in just 10 days, and analyse them using computer systems based on artificial intelligence. This massive sampling will shorten processes and advance the approval of effective technology. All tests will be validated using PCR tests.“The cooperation between India and Israel on COVID-19 is a good example of harnessing the scientific and technological strengths that the two countries have for larger, common good. It will also further deepen our strategic ties,” India’s Ambassador Sanjeev Singla told PTI.The flight will be carrying some breakthrough emerging Israeli technologies for combatting COVID-19, which have been donated by the Israeli foreign ministry and the private sector, in order to bolster India’s response to the virus outbreak.The plane will also deliver mechanical ventilators which were given special permission by Israel for export to India.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu have held three telephonic conversations since the outbreak of the pandemic and promised mutual assistance in dealing with the virus, committing to joint technological and scientific research between the countries.The Israeli media widely reported that Modi lifted a ban on the export of Hydroxychloroquine at Netanyahu’s request.“The past few years have cemented the strategic relations between India and Israel and have included two historical visits of the Prime Ministers in Israel and in India,” a press statement from the ministry of defence said.“India seeks to integrate advanced technologies in its hospitals as they prepare to treat massive waves of COVID-19 patients on an Indian scale. The Israeli companies chosen by the MFA, MOD and Israel Defence Forces to be sent to India are potentially given unique access to one of the largest economies in the world to provide monitoring and treatment technologies while significantly reducing contact between the patients and the medical staff,” it said.“By opening the door to India’s market with its development and production capabilities, these Israeli technologies can be mass produced at a lower cost and could in future be jointly exported to third countries,” it said.“The COVID-19 pandemic is a global challenge, so it is only right that the solution be a global scientific cooperation between countries. India and Israel’s military R&D cooperation is well known for its success. I have no doubt the same will be seen in the private sector joined by brilliant scientific minds from both countries to introduce a breakthrough in swift and simple testing procedures,” said Nati Keller, an infectious diseases specialist from Sheba Medical Center, who is leading the medical side of the delegation. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-israel-join-hands-to-develop-rapid-testing-for-covid-19-in-under-30-seconds-117019

Being negative or taking stress is not the answer to any problem. I have shared my experience as a teacher and how COVID-19 caused a huge disruption in the field of education - both for students and teachers,” he told PTI.Among others, philanthropist Dr Frank F Islam, British singer Annabel Leventon, music director and composer Bappi Lahiri and scientist Dr Shah Kamranur Rahman have also shared their observations and anecdotes in the book.Kumar further said that he has launched an initiative—‘Mathematics for fun’ - on Twitter to connect with the children, and the response to it has been “overwhelming”.“I gave one interesting problem and asked students to send in their answers. The response was overwhelming, something I had not imagined. Not only students, but math lovers from across the world started interacting with me.“It turned out to be a learning experience for me as well. That was a big confidence booster. From the next day, it became a part of my routine. I post math problems for the students and wait for their replies,” he added.

India had carried out an air strike at a terror camp in Pakistan, days after the Pulwama attack.Shewale has now demanded investigations by the Enforcement Directorate and the National Investigation Agency on the Bollywood celebrities who had participated in the events organised by Siddiqui and his two accomplices. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/one-pakistani-2-indian-origin-persons-in-us-blacklisted-for-anti-india-activities-116993

They urged the general public to be very cautious over the next four to five weeks.“The virus is in the community and all of us are doing our best to contain it. The state government is pulling out all stops to prevent the virus from spreading. The general public must be very cautious in the next four to five weeks. Masks, handwashing and physical distancing in every aspect of life is mandatory,” Director of Public Health, Dr G Srinivas Rao said in Hyderabad today.Telangana has touched 49,259 COVID-19 positive cases with 438 deaths so far. But to ensure that there is no shortage in the health care system, the state has made it mandatory for all Post Graduate (PG) medical students of 2018-18 batch to have one-year compulsory government services in Government medical colleges in Telangana.Doctors have announced that the COVID-19 infections have started to increase in towns and districts of Telangana, which is quite worrisome.Director of Medical Education Dr K Ramesh Reddy has issued instructions to principals of various Medical Colleges to relieve the PG medicos with instructions to report before concerned Superintendents of Government Hospitals. Already, the PG medical students of 2017-18 batch have been allotted Government medical colleges where they have to report for COVID-19 duty.Neighbouring Andhra Pradesh has stepped up COVID-19 testing and has performed 1.4 million tests so far from which 64,713 positive cases have been reported and the state has seen 823 deaths.In the last 24 hours, Andhra Pradesh has seen 61 death and highest till date positive cases, numbering 7,998. The average increase in COVID positive cases in both the Telugu states is around 2,000 each, every day.

23-07-2020||New Delhi||Liquor not an essential thing, says SC; dismisses plea for counter sale in Mumbai||“Liquor is not an essential thing”, the Supreme Court said on Thursday and dismissed an appeal by Maharashtra Wine Merchants Association (MWMA) against the Bombay High Court order refusing to direct the state to allow over-the-counter sale of liquor in Mumbai. A bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah said: “The High Court has already permitted the petitioner to represent the matter to the Municipal Corporation. We see no reason to entertain this special leave petition. The special leave petition is dismissed.” Advocate Charanjeet Chanderpal, appearing for the MWMA, said a representation was made to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as directed by the high court but it has not responded as yet. He urged the top court to fix a time frame on BMC or municipal commission for deciding the representation of the Association. The counsel said that online sale of liquor has many problems and chances of sale spurious liquor are very high while over-the-counter sale of liquor would prevent such products being sold. “Liquor is not an essential thing. We are not inclined to entertain this plea,” the bench said. On May 29, the high court had refused to quash the BMC’s order prohibiting over-the-counter sale of liquor in the city, stating that it was the civic body’s policy decision to do so amid the COVID-19 pandemic.It had refused to quash a notification issued by the civic body on May 22, prohibiting over-the-counter sale of liquor and permitting the use of e-commerce platforms for home delivery of alcohol. The MWMA in the high court had sought a direction to the state government to permit sale of liquor at wine shops in Mumbai, which is a COVID-19 red zone. The petition had contended that in cities like Pune and Nashik, where the COVID-19 situation was similar to Mumbai, regular counter sale of retail liquor was being permitted.The MWMA had contended that the system of online orders and home delivery of liquor was fraught with difficulties and could have an adverse social impact and was also not safe.The high court, however, said it would be appropriate for the petition to be placed before the city municipal commissioner as a representation.The municipal commissioner will be able to take an appropriate decision after considering all the factors, the court had said. “This decision is in the nature of policy. Such a decision entails evaluation of various competing factors. The situation may differ from place to place. The relevant factors can also undergo a change with passage of time,” the court had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/liquor-not-an-essential-thing-says-sc-dismisses-plea-for-counter-sale-in-mumbai-116983
23-07-2020||New Delhi||EC defers by-polls for one Lok Sabha, 7 Assembly seats||The Election Commission has deferred by-elections for one Lok Sabha and seven Assembly seats due to “some extraordinary circumstances peculiar to these constituencies”.The poll panel will meet on Friday to discuss scheduling of these by-elections.The states where the by-polls have been deferred are Valmiki Nagar Lok Sabha seat in Bihar, two assembly seats each in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh, and one each in Assam, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala.Most of these seats fell vacant due to the death of sitting members.A senior Election Commission (EC) official said the COVID-19 pandemic and the flood situation were two reasons behind the decision.As per the electoral law, EC has to hold bye-elections within 180 days (six months) of a seat falling vacant, pointed out another official.The six-month deadline to hold by-elections in these eight seats was ending on different dates in July, August and September, respectively.When the EC assessed the situation, it found that it was difficult to adhere to the six-month deadline in these seats, and approached the Union Law Ministry to defer the polls, said the official.Under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, in certain cases, the EC, in consultation with the Central Government (the Union Law Ministry), certifies that it is difficult to hold the by-election within the six-month period.Using this provision, the poll panel issued a certificate on July 22 to defer the elections on these eight seats.In a statement on Thursday, the Commission said that “this matter of timing, etc. of by-elections is also slotted for discussion in the Election Commission meeting to be held tomorrow (Friday)”.The statement added that in all, by-elections were due for 56 Assembly constituencies and one Lok Sabha seat.However, a letter written by one of its senior officers to the Law Ministry regarding the eight by-polls was "causing some confusion", the EC said and clarified that it was only "in respect of eight constituencies regarding which a reference to Ministry of Law and Justice was made ... due to some extraordinary circumstances peculiar to these constituencies".Out of 57 by-elections, the Commission has already taken a decision to hold remaining by-election as per provisions and the deferring of eight by-elections was only up to September 7, 2020, the statement said.The remaining 49 by-polls are due after September 7.

The wet and dry solid waste bags to be tied securely in leak-proof bags, sprayed with sodium hypo-chlorite solution and hand over to authorised waste collector. Yellow coloured bags should not be used for collecting general solid waste. Compostable bags should be used for collecting wet-waste,” it said.It has also directed that isolation wards, including temporary healthcare facilities like rail coaches, must keep separate colour coded bins to maintain segregation of waste and use a dedicated bin to collect and store COVID-19 waste and keep it separately, use double layered bags for collection of COVID-19 waste and disinfect all bins/containers every day.From COVID-19 isolation wards, used PPEs such as goggles, face-shield, splash proof apron, plastic coveralls, hazmat suits, nitrile gloves must be collected into a red bag, it said.“Collect used masks (including triple layer mask, N95 mask etc.), head cover/cap, shoe-cover, disposable linen gown, non-plastic or semi-plastic coverall in yellow bags. Used masks, tissues and toiletries, of COVID-19 patient shall become biomedical waste and shall be segregated in yellow bag,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/households-to-cut-and-store-waste-masks-gloves-for-72-hours-before-disposing-of-cpcb-116980

There was some cash, driver's license, Aadhaar card and an ATM card in the wallet of the victim.

The testing capacity has been increased to around 4 lakh per day,” scientist and media coordinator at ICMR Lokesh Sharma said.“While the total number of recovered cases has jumped to 7,82,606, there has been appreciable growth in the recovery rate, which stands at 63.18 per cent,” the ministry said.This accomplishment can be attributed to the central government-led COVID-19 management strategies, it said.Sustained efforts by the Centre, states and union territories (UTs) are resulting in more effective containment, aggressive testing, and prompt and efficient clinical treatment strategies.These are guided by the teams of domain experts in the Ministry of Health such as the Joint Monitoring Group (JMG) and ably complemented by the technical experts at AIIMS-New Delhi, centres of excellence in various states and UTs, ICMR and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).The Union Government continues to coordinate with the efforts of the states and UTs by sending central teams of experts to areas witnessing increase in caseload and hand-holding of COVID hospitals in states through the tele-consultation programme led by AIIMS, New Delhi, the ministry said.“These combined efforts have resulted in Case Fatality Rate being managed at low levels. It is 2.41 per cent, as on date, and steadily declining,” it said.This has also helped in reducing the actual caseload of COVID-19 cases which remains confined to 4,26,167 active patients only.With the highest-ever single-day spike of 45,720 cases, India’s COVID-19 tally crossed the 12-lakh mark on Thursday, while the death toll mounted to 29,861 with a record 1,129 fatalities reported in 24 hours, according to the updated data at 8 am. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/29-557-patients-recuperate-from-covid-in-24-hours-highest-single-day-recovery-so-far-116967

SSC officers – men or women – join for a period of 10 or 14 years following which an option is given if they want to be permanent commission officers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mod-allows-permanent-commission-to-women-officers-in-8-more-branches-in-army-116960
23-07-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Conducting exams in varsities in MCQ format not feasible alternative, say academics||Conducting exams in universities in Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) format in view of COVID-19 pandemic is not a feasible alternative as it cannot test students’ analytical skills and students pursuing subjects such as literature will be at a disadvantage, academicians have pointed out.The concerns by academics come against the backdrop of the Delhi High Court asking the University Grants Commission (UGC) to clarify if final year examinations of the universities be conducted based on MCQs, open choices, assignments and presentations, instead of long-form exams.The UGC officials, however, maintained that over 6,000 universities in the country have already conducted exams for final year students or are planning to conduct them.Earlier this month, the UGC in its revised guidelines directed the higher education institutions that final year examinations be conducted in September 2020, instead of July 2020, as per its guidelines announced in April.Punjab, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Delhi have announced reservations against the plan, citing the COVID-19 situation.Rajesh Jha, a political science professor and executive council member of DU, said: “Our students are not prepared for a new format of exams. They have been taught to analyse things and will be caught unprepared for any new format. All of a sudden you cannot impose a system. You need to test it before implementing it. Coronavirus time cannot be used for experimentation.”Pankaj Garg, a professor at Rajdhani College, said: “The format of exams decide how students are taught. For MCQs and even for open book exams, the students have to be taught in a certain way but in Delhi University, students have not been taught in a way that they can take exams in such a format.”“Plus, problems are multiplying — coronavirus cases are on the rise and students in Assam and Bihar are also facing issues due to floods. Internet connectivity is already an issue and the flood situation has complicated the connectivity situation, so even if the MCQ format exams happen they will happen in an online format which will not be feasible for students,” he said.Saikat Ghosh, an English professor at the Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur Khalsa College and Academic Council member, said: “The way the subjects and the syllabus have been designed, we teach those subjects even at the undergraduate level in a fair amount of detail and we encourage students to show analytical skills. Analytical skills cannot be tested through the MCQ format, which favours information.”“It is not feasible for the way in which students have been taught or even the content of the syllabus. In literature, the MCQ format, it's not going to work. The alternative to open book exam is not MCQ,” Ghosh said.The Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA) has called a meeting on Thursday to discuss the issue.“There is a DUTA meeting scheduled later in the day on the issue. Even if MCQs will happen, they will happen online and we are against the conduct of online examinations,” said a DUTA member requesting anonymity.According to a senior UGC official: “The guidelines have not stated that the exams have to be conducted right away, the exams have to be concluded by September end. States can devise a calendar whenever it is feasible to conduct exams in this timeline. Also, the exams can be conducted either online, offline or in blended mode. Totally doing away with exams is not a feasible situation.”Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16, when the Centre announced a nationwide classroom shutdown as one of the measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.The lockdown was announced on March 24 and it came into effect the next day. While the government has eased several restrictions, schools and colleges continue to remain closed.

23-07-2020||Vibha Sharma||Petition challenging disqualification proceedings: ‘Breather’ till Monday; prolonged stand-off may help BJP and Pilot||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 23As things stand today, rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot appears to have got a breather till Monday. Political observers say a more prolonged stand-off in Rajasthan will help the BJP and Pilot, even though the two sides claim to be independent in the ongoing political war in the state.The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to restrain the Rajasthan High Court from delivering its verdict on rebel Congress MLAs’ petition challenging disqualification proceedings initiated against them by Rajasthan Assembly Speaker CP Joshi.However, the Apex Court also made it clear that the high court’s judgment will be subject to the outcome of proceedings before it.Observers say a breather till Monday may prove to be an advantage for the BJP and Pilot. Even though the rebel Congress leader claims he is not joining the BJP, sources say the saffron strategy in Rajasthan now depends upon Pilot’s ability to save what he has and wean away some more MLAs from the Gehlot camp.The saffron party is hoping that the former Deputy Chief Minister gets more time to engineer defections and help it form the government, provided he joins the BJP which he claims he is not.If Pilot does shift to the saffron side, they can together claim 96 MLAs in the 200-member House, including 72 MLAs from the BJP, 18 Congress’ rebels, three of Hanuman Beniwal’s RLP and three Independents. Once MLAs of the Gehlot camp move out of the hotel they are lodged, many things can happen on the floor of the House.The Gehlot camp may have the edge for now but the situation might change in favour of the BJP if the situation gets prolonged. And this despite senior BJP leader and former CM Vasundhra Raje “not playing” the way her party would like her too in Rajasthan.The observers say Raje is one reason why the BJP has not been able to move as smoothly in Rajasthan as in MP and Karnataka.Unlike his “erstwhile” colleague Jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh, Pilot appears to be not inclined in joining the BJP though sources say he is “in touch”.Another difference is that unlike Kamal Nath in Madhya Pradesh, who was chasing those who had already made up their mind to leave the Congress and join the BJP, Gehlot is concentrating on protecting his flock.But it remains to be seen how long the Gehlot camp manages to hold on against the added “pressure” from agencies like the Enforcement Directorate and the Income Tax.After a rather smooth take-over in Madhya Pradesh and earlier in Karnataka, perhaps the BJP had expected a similar situation in Rajasthan but clearly Gehlot was a step ahead.If Pilot and his MLAs are disqualified, the House strength will come down to 181, making 91 the halfway mark and easier for Gehlot to survive longer.Nineteen rebel Congress MLAs have challenged the validity of Speaker CP Joshi’s decision to issue show-cause notices to them under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution, i.e., anti-defection law.The rebel Congress MLAs contended that a party whip applied only during the Assembly session.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/petition-challenging-disqualification-proceedings-breather-till-monday-prolonged-stand-off-may-help-bjp-and-pilot-116948

If you deal with them from a position of strength, you can work with them you can get what you need and it can be actually done. But if they sense weakness then you had it,” Gandhi said.He also said PM’s vision could not be a substitute for a national vision.PM is 100% focused on building his own image. India’s captured institutions are all busy doing this task.One man’s image is not a substitute for a national vision. pic.twitter.com/8L1KSzXpiJ“It is because there is no clear cut vision going forward.

An FIR was registered on August 23, 2019.Shekhawat was not mentioned in the charge sheet filed by the SOG in connection with the case. Later, a magistrate's court also rejected an application to include him in the charge sheet.The applicants then approached the additional district judge's court, which issued directions that their complaint should also be probed.In their application to the magistrate's court, complainants Gulam Singh and Laboo Singh claimed that a money trail mentioned in the FIR led to companies allegedly linked to the minister.But the SOG did not investigate the role of the minister or the companies, the two Barmer residents alleged.The complainants alleged that the SOG deliberately protected the minister and some others who did not figure in the charge sheet filed by it.

23-07-2020||New Delhi||SC refuses to restrain Rajasthan HC from passing Friday order on rebel Cong MLAs’ plea||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to restrain the Rajasthan High Court from delivering its verdict on rebel Congress MLAs’ petition challenging the disqualification proceedings initiated against them by state Assembly Speaker CP Joshi.Nineteen rebel Congress MLAs, including sacked Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, have challenged the validity of Speaker CP Joshi’s decision to issue show-cause notices to them under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution i.e. the anti-defection law.Also read: Petition challenging disqualification proceedings: ‘Breather’ till Monday; prolonged stand-off my help BJP and Pilot“Let the high court deliver the verdict tomorrow,” a Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra said.However, the top court made it clear that the high court’s judgment will be subject to the outcome of the proceedings before it.Noting that there was a large question of the functioning of the democracy, the Bench said it will further hear the matter on July 27.The top court is seized of Rajasthan Speaker CP Joshi’s petition challenging the state high court’s decision to defer its decision, on rebel Congress MLAs’ petition, to July 24.The Bench told senior advocate Kapil Sibal, representing the Speaker, that it intended to adjourn his plea as it was a “serious matter” which required a “prolonged hearing”.It didn’t agree to Sibal’s demand to stay further proceedings in Rajasthan HC until the matter is decided by the Supreme Court.Sibal contended that no judicial authority could go into whether an MLA will be disqualified for not attending party meetings outside the  House.“Speaker will decide disqualification petition and then only it can be challenged,” he said.“Nobody can say what Speaker will decide tomorrow,” the Bench commented.On behalf of the rebel Congress MLAs, senior advocates Harish Salve and Mukul Rohatgi submitted that the Speaker had twice agreed to defer disqualification proceedings when the matter was pending in the high court.“He can wait for the next 24 hours,” Rohatgi said.During the hearing, the Bench raised the issue of intra-party democracy.“This is not a simple matter and these MLAs are elected representatives... Voice of dissent in democracy cannot be shut down,” the Bench said, adding, “We are trying to find out whether this process (disqualification) was permissible or not.”Sibal responded by saying, “These MLAs had gone to Haryana, stayed at a hotel and gave TV bytes that they want floor test.”The Rajasthan political crisis reached the Supreme Court on Wednesday with the speaker challenging the high court’s order “directing” him to postpone till July 24 the disqualification proceedings against 19 rebel Congress MLAs.In his petition, Joshi urged the top court to set aside the high court’s order, contending it was “bad in law” and “a direct affront to the powers  of the Legislature and the Speaker envisaged under the Constitution.”Contending that the disqualification process was a part of the assembly proceedings, Joshi said the high court could not have asked him to defer it till Friday, particularly because he had already extended twice the deadline to receive replies of rebel Congress MLAs.The disqualification proceedings under anti-defection law i.e. paragraph 2(1)(a) of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution was initiated against the 19 MLAs after the Congress Legislature Party complained to the Speaker that they had defied a whip to attend two meetings last week.The rebel Congress MLAs contended that a party whip applied only during the assembly session.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-restrain-rajasthan-hc-from-passing-friday-order-on-rebel-cong-mlas-plea-116911
23-07-2020||Hyderabad||Lockdown lessons: Students don teachers’ role for classmates in Telangana||At a time when there are no clear-cut guidelines on conducting online classes in Telangana, students of the state social and tribal welfare residential educational institutions have turned teachers for their classmates.According to RS Praveen Kumar, secretary, Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (TSWREIS) and Telangana Tribal Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (TTWREIS), the initiative — Village Learning Circles — is being implemented to promote continuity of studies while schools remain closed due to COVID-19 induced lockdown without any certainty over the start of the academic year.He said though the idea was meant for students of the TSWREIS and the TTWREIS, children of other schools are also participating in the VLC.“The VLCs are being operated from homes, panchayat offices, churches, schools, religious places and other makeshift learning centres in villages. Students with good communication and teaching skills take up the role of teachers and impart learning to their younger schoolmates and peers in his or her village,” Praveen Kumar told PTI.“All students are asked to use hand sanitizer, wear face masks and maintain a physical distance of minimum six feet among themselves,” the official was quick to add.Under each VLC, five to ten students will be taken while pupils from Class 6 to degree-level with good communication and teaching skills, who have competency in a particular subject, were entrusted with teaching responsibilities, he said.The timetable will be prepared in such a way that there will be two to three hours of teaching schedule per day.Teachers will regularly guide and mentor ‘student teachers’ in pedagogical methods to be followed considering different categories of a pupil and their learning abilities.“As of now, as many as 8,000 VLCs under TSWREIS with 40,000 students and about 2000 VLCs for TTWREIS with 16,000 students have been formed. The target is to form 50,000 VLCs for both societies,” an official involved in the initiative said.Teachers of both the societies would periodically monitor the activities of the assigned VLCs besides providing video-based learning material to the centres, Praveen Kumar said.The VLC concept will also help ensure that students are engaged in academic activities who otherwise will be compelled to take up labour activities in some villages and tribal areas, according to social activists.

23-07-2020||Mathura||The story behind the 'Royal Encounter' in Rajasthan||Since the incident took place almost ten years before internet arrived in India and even before Google became a part of our lives, the story of Raja Maan Singh, the royal scion of Bharatpur in Rajasthan, remains largely unknown to people.The incident was pushed back into the spotlight this week when eleven policemen were sentenced to life imprisonment by a district court in Mathura for killing Raja Maan Singh, in a staged "encounter" 35 years ago.The Mathura district and sessions court also imposed fines of Rs 10,000 on each of the accused.According to reports, Raja Maan Singh, a seven-time independent MLA from Deeg, was contesting the election in 1985 as an independent.Some Congress workers had torn up his posters and also the flag of his royal estate.Maan Singh, who had never lost an election after Independence, was enraged and crashed his jeep into the helicopter of the then Rajasthan chief minister, Shiv Charan Mathur.Mathur was in Bharatpur to campaign for retired bureaucrat Vijendra Singh, who was fielded by the Congress party against Raja Maan Singh. This was on February 20, 1985.A case was lodged against the Raja at the Deeg police station and the following day, when he was on his way to his constituency Deeg for an election rally, he was shot dead by police personnel who had blocked the road following a curfew order.Two other men - Sumer Singh and Hari Singh - had also lost their lives in the alleged encounter.Raja Maan Singh was an extremely popular leader in his constituency and thousands turned up to attend his cremation.In the course of the hearings -- the case moved from Rajasthan to UP in 1990 after Singh's family approached the Supreme Court about the possible influence Congress could wield over the proceedings. More than 200 witnesses were produced in the case.Initially probed by the local police, the case was later handed over to the CBI for investigation and its trial was shifted to Mathura on the Supreme Court orders.The defence lawyer, Nand Kishore Upamanyu, had sought minimum sentence for the cops. They were all retired, suffering from multiple ailments, and had not got promotions, pay revisions because they had been suspended, he argued."All of them were found guilty under Section 149 (unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object) of the IPC. Hence, the minimum sentence should be awarded," he told the court.The accused are all over 60 now -- former DSP Kan Singh Bhati is 82.The sum collected from the convicted police personnel as fine will be used to pay compensations of Rs 2,000 each to four persons injured in the clash between police and Singh, the day he was killed.Another Rs 30,000 will go to each relative of those who died - Singh and his two associates, Thakur Hari Singh and Thakur Sumer Singh."Justice has been served," said Singh's daughter Krishnendra Kaur Deepa, a former minister in Rajasthan, told local reporters."Though we have got delayed justice, I am happy that guilty persons have ultimately been convicted," she said.Deepa, a member of the Bharatpur royal family, is a multiple-term member of the Rajasthan Assembly.Deepa and her husband, Vijay, were among family members who attended the proceedings, the last in 35 years of a legal battle fought out in Rajasthan and then UP.Vijay was with Singh the day he was shot after he had driven his vehicle straight into then Rajasthan Chief Minister's helicopter.—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/the-story-behind-the-royal-encounter-in-rajasthan-116900

The tremors ranged from 4.2 to 5.5 in magnitude. Champhai was the hardest-hit district.Champhai district Deputy Commissioner Maria CT Zuali told PTI that makeshift tents were set up at several villages by people and the district administration provided tarpaulins, water barrels, solar lamps and first-aid kits to them.She said biscuits and sorazo (food supplements) were also provided to old people.According to the Deputy Commissioner, at least 20 earthquakes have hit Champhai district in a month.She said more than 16 villages had been affected by the earthquakes and over 170 houses, including churches and community halls were damaged.At Dungtlang, one of the worst-hit villages in Champhai district, at least five makeshift camps had been set up, Dungltang Young Mizo Association (YMA) Assistant Secretary John Zothanmawia Fanai said.On Monday, the government sent three teams of doctors that consisted of psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and medical specialists to the quake-hit areas to assist the people, who developed mental trauma following the quakes.The teams are currently touring affected villages in Champhai district.Dr C Lalhrekima, a psychiatrist in a government hospital, leading one of the teams, told PTI that many people have anxiety due to frequent earthquakes.“We are giving counselling to the panic-stricken people apart from giving medical care,” he said.The state government on Tuesday sent Geology and Mineral Resource Department Joint Secretary H Lalbiakkima, who is also a geologist, to Champhai district to study and assess the cause of earthquakes.According to Zuali, some geologists from Mizoram University (MZU) will also visit quake-hit villages in Champhai district.Earlier in June, Chief Minister Zoramthanga had asked the Centre to send expert seismologists or geophysicists to assess the ground situation and the exact cause of the earthquakes.

23-07-2020||Washington||US maintains ‘tremendous cooperation’ with India on Chinese border aggression: Amb Juster||The Trump administration has maintained close contact and “tremendous cooperation” with India on the latest Chinese border aggression, America’s top envoy in New Delhi has said, asserting that the last six months have been unprecedented in terms of the bilateral relationship.The troops of India and China have been locked in a standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated last month following the Galwan Valley clashes that left 20 Indian Army personnel dead.“For now, (we are) watching the issues on the Northern border of India in which China has raised disputes throughout the Western sector, but also in the central and East. Throughout all of this, we’ve had very close contact with our Indian counterparts and quite frankly, tremendous cooperation,” US Ambassador to India Ken Juster said on Wednesday in his address to the virtual India Ideas’ Summit organised by the US India Business Council.The ambassador’s remarks came two days after US Defence Secretary Mark Esper described the Chinese military’s aggressive activities in the region as “destabilising”.Esper also said the US was “very closely” monitoring the situation between India and China along the Line of Actual Control.“We have seen post the (India) visit of the President several further conversations between the President and the Prime Minister. The Secretary (of State) has spoken on numerous occasions with (External Affairs) Minister Jaishankar. I think it’s really solidified their relationship,” Juster said.Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun had spoken not just with Foreign Secretary Harshvardhan Shringla but also with a range of counterparts in the Indo Pacific region, he said.Juster said there had been a host of ministerial-level interactions between the two countries, including the one between Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.“The two countries also had a strategic energy partnership meeting. It is showing the breadth and the depth of the issues that the two countries work on together,” he said, adding: “I think because of the intensity of the last six months, we’ve really had a new level of comfort in dealing with each other, a degree of trust and respect to get things done.”“I remember, issues we had and repatriation flights, where we had to get cooperation, not just from the Home Ministry and the Ministry of External Affairs but also at the local levels with state officials and with police officers. It shows the importance of these individual relationships” he said.Through all of this and the intensity of the last six months and the range of emotions from an incredibly successful presidential visit to dealing with lockdown and all the urgent issues that came out of that, “we’ve really transformed a strategic partnership into a comprehensive global strategic partnership,” Juster said.“As Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said recently, what may be the most important partnership of the 21st century. So that’s really what I think the last six months have done to solidify this relationship,” the top American diplomat said.

23-07-2020||Washington||US will work with India, Japan and South Korea to tackle threat from China: Senator Warner||The US will work with countries like India, Japan, and South Korea to tackle the threat of Chinese surveillance, a top American Senator, who has made a Congressional legislation to make New Delhi a strategic defence partner of Washington on a permanent basis, has said.Democratic Senator Mark Warner, Chairman of Senate Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, in an interaction with members of the US India Security Council said China had emerged as a major problem for the US companies doing businesses in that country and intellectual theft was a big concern.Warner, who is also co-chair of the Senate India Caucus, said he had sponsored an amendment to the National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA) to make India a strategic defence partner on a permanent basis.Expressing grave concerns over Chinese surveillance on every aspect of the organisations doing business with Beijing, Warner said the US would work with countries like India, Japan, and South Korea to tackle the threat from China.Eminent Indian-American Ramesh Kapur, from the US India Security Council, said that in view of the present scenario it would make better sense to shift all manufacturing back to America.He said in areas where there were issues of cost due to labour and other issues, it would make sense to shift the manufacturing to India for all US companies which are at present in China.Bharat Barai from Chicago said many medium- and small-scale electronic companies in the US and India had suffered due to unfair trade practices of China. He also offered the Senator his services in arranging a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, according to a statement.Koty Krishna said he did a lot of business with China earlier and was always worried about getting back his money and is glad that he had moved out of that country.Krishna Srinivasa said it was time for the US and India to forge a long-lasting defence partnership that would sustain for at least 40-50 years and requested the senator to pursue the defence partnership with his friends in the senate like Senator Robert Menendez and others.Nar Koppula told Senator Warner that the Indian-American community had always helped him in his elections and would continue to do so and asked him to be favourable to a stronger US-India partnership.Rajendar Dichpally expressed concerns over the Chinese aggression against India and warned that Beijing's attitude would not be limited to the South Asian and Pacific regions, asserting that it would expand its ambitions and would be a threat to the US in the future due to its vast ambitions."All the members agreed that it is absolutely necessary to rein in China with partnerships with other friendly countries," said the statement issued by US India Security Council.

When the need arose, we stepped up and supplied COVID-related medicines, and medical equipment to over 100 countries, including the United States,” he said.Adressing the summit, immediately after Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered his keynote speech, Sandhu said there had been expanded collaboration between India and the US in areas such as health, vaccine development, science and technology and innovation.“We are learning from each other's best practices. I firmly believe technology will play in an important role, in the Covid and post-Covid world. Already, it is providing innovative solutions to work, education, business, health care and even diplomacy. The free and open exchange of ideas and information has been one of the biggest strengths of our partnership,” he said.Noting that India has undertaken a series of structural reforms to attract investment, and improve the ease-of-doing business in India, Sandhu said that recent investments announced by American companies, including Google, Facebook and others reflected the confidence of foreign investors in the  economy. Observing that today India is one of the fastest digitizing countries, he said the reforms and initiatives undertaken by the government had facilitated creation of infrastructure in the sector, which had led to improved digital connectivity, achieved near universal coverage of telecom services and made available adequate spectrum for a range of activities.This is also an area where there has been long-standing cooperation between India and the United States. The potential for deepening is immense and sky is the limit, Sandhu said.The need for faster internet, smart city plants, industrial automation, connected devices make it imperative for India to adopt 5G. Moving beyond connectivity services, 5G even provide solutions for consumers and industry, the ambassador said.Sandhu said the global economy would see major restructuring of supply chains in the future.With the recent disruption and risks, security management of supply chains had become a priority, he said, adding that India had been a reliable partner to many countries, including the United States during the current pandemic.“As global MNCs, including US companies look for relocating and diversifying their supply chains, we welcome them to invest in India,” Sandhu said.

The India-US ties, she said, had strong institutional undergirding which should stand good. Other areas include maritime cooperation with friends and democracies in the region.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prepare-white-paper-on-china-strategy-ex-foreign-secretary-rao-116837
