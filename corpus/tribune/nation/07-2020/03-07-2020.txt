The Congress Rajya Sabha member also recalled that before hunting became illegal, he used to hunt tigers with late Madhavrao Scindia, Jyotiraditya's father."After Indira Gandhi introduced the Wildlife Conservation Act, I now capture tigers only in my camera," the Congress veteran added."You know the character of tiger, in the forest, only one tiger lives," Singh tweeted in Hindi.The line `Tiger abhi zinda hai' -- inspired by a Salman Khan film -- was first used in state politics by Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan after the BJP lost power in Madhya Pradesh in 2018.The cabinet expansion saw induction of 28 ministers, including nearly a dozen Scindia supporters who quit the Congress in March.The war of words between Scindia on one hand and Singh and Nath on the other comes ahead of bypolls to 24 Assembly seats.Singh also responded to Scindia's remark in another tweet in Hindi: "Time is very powerful. You never know how many BJP tigers came to life with this expansion of cabinet. Just watch."Elsewhere, Kamal Nath took a dig at Scindia over the `tiger' remark.Speaking at a function in Ratlam district, Nath asked, "Which tiger is alive, paper tiger or a circus one?"Some people say they are tigers. I am not even a tiger, but I am also not a paper tiger. Now the people of the state will decide who is who," he added.Meanwhile, Scindia along with Chief Minister Chouhan targeted Kamal Nath over the way the Congress government handled the coronavirus pandemic.When the coronavirus outbreak started, then chief minister Nath was busy holding meeting for organizing International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) awards in the state, Chouhan alleged.“Nath did not hold any meeting on COVID-19 but had a meeting in Indore on IIFA Awards," the Chief Minister alleged while addressing BJP workers on completion of 100 days his government."Today coronavirus infection rate in MP is the lowest in the country," the BJP leader claimed. Scindia also took potshots at Nath over the issue."I want to ask him, how many hospitals Nath visited? How many poor people he met? How many tours he conducted?...the fact is when coronavirus knocked on the state's door, Nath was holding a meeting for IIFA at Indore," he said."In the last 14 days of his government, he was busy issuing appointment orders than dealing with coronavirus," Scindia alleged and praised Chouhan for taking adequate measures to deal with the crisis.

03-07-2020||New Delhi||Rapid tests commence outside containment zones in Delhi; city’s tally crosses 94k mark||Authorities in Delhi on Friday started the process of conducting antigen tests outside the COVID-19 containment zones, a move that will ramp up testing in the national capital as its coronavirus tally reached 94,695.According to a health bulletin, 2,520 fresh cases were reported in the city on Friday, while with 59 fatalities the death toll reached 2,923.                 On June 23, the national capital had reported the highest single-day spike till date of 3,947 cases. However, in the last six days, the number of fresh cases has oscillated, not showing a particular trend in figures.The number of cases reported from June 28 to July 1 are -- 2,889 cases (on June 28); 2,084 (June 29); 2,199 (June 30); and 2,442 (July 1), with a steady rise in death figures.The bulletin said 24,165 tests were conducted on a single day. Of these, 10,577 were done through RT-PCR while the rest were Rapid Antigen tests.The authorities started conducting rapid antigen tests outside the 445 containment zones of the national capital, the official said.The Delhi Government has given the task to every district magistrate in the city to conduct 2,000 rapid antigen tests every day in their respective areas.On Friday, South Delhi, West Delhi, East Delhi and Shahdara were among the districts where the administration started the process of conducting antigen tests outside containment zones, an official said.The official said around 25 to 30 teams have been constituted in each district to conduct more antigen tests.With 2,000 rapid antigen tests per day, the testing exercise will be scaled up significantly with 22,000 tests conducted every day across the 11 districts in Delhi.Delhi Government had earlier said it has procured six lakh rapid antigen test kits for screening COVID-19 infected persons.The kits, called Standard Q COVID-19 Ag detection, have been developed by South Korean company S D Biosensor. The testing method involves looking for antibodies which are produced when the body is exposed to a pathogen.If a person has antibodies associated with novel coronavirus, it means the person is either COVID-19 positive or has recovered.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research, suspected individuals who test negative for COVID-19 in the rapid-antigen test should undergo an RT-PCR test to rule out the infection.Positive test results should be considered as true positive and do not need reconfirmation by RT-PCR test, it said.In a related development, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal met the family members of Dr Aseem Gupta who died fighting COVID-19 and handed over a cheque of Rs 1 crore as ex-gratia to them.The chief minister termed late Gupta as a “people’s doctor” and said it was the duty of the government to support the families of those who have sacrificed their lives for others.“Met with the family of Late Dr Aseem Gupta ji who lost his life to Corona. We cannot do anything to bring back the ‘People’s Doctor’, but it is our duty to support families of those who lay down their lives for us. An ex-gratia of Rs 1 crore was given to the family today,” Kejriwal tweeted.Gupta, a consultant anaesthesiologist at the state-run LNJP hospital, had contracted COVID-19 while on duty. He tested positive on June 6 when he had mild symptoms and was shifted to a quarantine facility. His symptoms aggravated on June 7 and he was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the LNJP hospital. Later, he succumbed to the virus at Max Smart Hospital in Saket in south Delhi.Another COVID-warrior, Dharamvir Singh, a sub-inspector with the Delhi Police, died of coronavirus on Friday.He was admitted to the Kailash Super Speciality Hospital in Noida on June 13 for a bypass surgery, a senior police officer said.Earlier this week, a 49-year-old Delhi Police Inspector posted with the Special Cell died of COVID-19 in South Delhi’s Max hospital.Eleven Delhi Police personnel have died due to COVID-19 so far. Around 2,000 have so far tested positive for the virus, out of which 1,300 personnel have recovered.

03-07-2020||New Delhi||Why PM didn’t name China, again, asks Chidambaram||Former Union Minister P Chidambaram on Friday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not naming China as an "aggressor" while speaking in Leh during the day, wondering aloud if he had done otherwise in his telephonic talks with US and Russian presidents."For the third time in a week, the PM did not name China as the aggressor. Why? What is the purpose of talking about an unnamed 'enemy' to the people of India and the jawans in Ladakh?" the senior Congress leader tweeted.He said that the country wants to know if Modi named China as the intruder or not while talking to Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.The Congress leader also alleged government silence on satellite images "showing Chinese troops occupying key positions in places hitherto considered as undisputed Indian territory"."The PM has still not answered our questions about where the violent clashes took place on June 15 between Chinese and Indian troops and if the Chinese have intruded Indian territory at several points," the former Union Minister said.Amid ongoing border tension with China in eastern Ladakh, Modi paid a visit to Leh and forward locations this morning to review the security situation on the ground. - IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-pm-didnt-name-china-again-asks-chidambaram-108126
03-07-2020||New Delhi||HC comes to aid of JNU student & wife; asks varsity to let them stay in hostel||The Delhi High Court on Friday came to the aid of a couple, one of them a student of JNU, whose marriage was opposed by khap panchayat and had nowhere else to stay except the varsity hostel, by asking the university to make a concession in the instant case.“It is a humanitarian issue. It is a question of temporary shelter,” Justice Najmi Waziri said to the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) which relented and agreed to let the couple stay at the hostel room allotted to the student—Deepak Kumar.Central government standing counsel Monika Arora said in court that in the peculiar circumstances of the case, where the khap panchayat was opposed to the couple’s marriage, the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic and they having no place else to stay, they can stay in the hostel room allotted to the petitioner.In view of the statement by the lawyer for JNU, the petitioner’s counsel—Abhik Chimni—agreed not to press the petition, which had also challenged the varsity’s June 8 circular which said the university would remain closed for the time being and directed students to return to their homes.The high court while disposing of the petition, filed through advocates Deval Singh and Om Narayan, made it clear that the order was not to be treated as a precedent and the concession was made in respect of the peculiar circumstances in the instant case.According to the petition, Kumar is pursuing Ph.D (Law) from the Centre for the Study of Law and Governance (CSLG), JNU and has been residing at Subansir (Mahanadi) Hostel, meant for married students, with his wife since 2015.The plea said that Kumar and his wife were at OP Jindal University in Sonipat, Haryana, in connection with his field work and could not return to the hostel due to the lockdown.After unlock-1 came into operation, he wrote to JNU seeking permission for the couple to return to the varsity, but received no response and therefore, he moved the high court, the petition said.

03-07-2020||Kathmandu||Nepal's ruling communist party's Standing Committee to meet on Saturday to decide Oli's fate||The future of Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli will be decided at a crucial Standing Committee meeting of the ruling communist party on Saturday, party sources said on Friday, amidst growing demand for his resignation.The meeting of the Nepal Communist Party's 45-member Standing Committee, the most powerful body of the party, on Thursday has been put off as the top brass of the party failed to forge consensus on the resignation of Prime Minister Oli.Top NCP leaders on Tuesday demanded Prime Minister Oli's resignation, saying his recent anti-India remarks were "neither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate." "The Prime Minister's remarks that India was conspiring to remove him were neither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate," party's executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' had said.Prime Minister Oli, 68, on Sunday claimed that there have been various kinds of activities in the "embassies and hotels" to remove him from power. He said some Nepalese leaders were also involved in the game in the aftermath of his government's move to update the country's political map by incorporating three strategically key Indian territories—Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura.Accusing the southern neighbour and leaders of his own party by the Prime Minister was not appropriate, a senior leader of the party quoted Prachanda as saying during the Standing Committee meeting on Tuesday.Prachanda has time and again spoken about the lack of coordination between the government and the party, and he was pressing for a one-man one position system to be followed by the NCP.The differences between the two factions of the NCP—one led by Oli and the other led by Prachanda—intensified after the prime minister unilaterally decided to prorogue the budget session of Parliament on Thursday.  Prachanda called the crucial meeting of the party's Standing Committee for Saturday that could decide the future of the Prime Minister, sources said.During Saturday's Standing Committee meeting, the two sides will work out some mechanism under which the party and the government both will have to follow a sort of protocol, so that the differences are patched up, said Standing Committee member Ganesh Shah. Prime Minister Oli has been running the government unilaterally, and he is also not allowing the executive chairman of the Party Prachanda to operate on his own, he opined.Both Prime Minister Oli and former Prime Minister Prachanda are chairmen of the ruling party.Now the Prime Minister has the option—either he should give up the party's chair or the post of the prime minister following the one-man-one position principle, said Bishnu Rijal, central committee member of the NCP and the party's deputy chief of foreign affairs. "I think a compromise will be worked out between the two sides to patch up the differences so that the crisis will be over after Saturday's meeting."  During Tuesday's Standing Committee meeting, Prachanda, and former Prime Ministers Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhalanath Khanal asked Oli to resign from the post for making controversial remarks, running the government without consulting with the party and failing to deliver to the people.  They have also asked Oli to produce evidence to prove his remarks. Oli has been cornered in the ruling party as the majority of the senior leaders are with Prachanda. Oli has the support of only 15 members in the Standing Committee. According to a senior Cabinet member, Oli prorogued Parliament to re-introduce a controversial bill that allows splitting a party.The bill was withdrawn from Parliament after ruling party Lawmakers opposed it a couple of months ago. The bill allows any political group to officially break the party with the support of 40 per cent of either House of Representatives members or Central Executive Committee members.  Some party insiders are speculating that Oli might opt for breaking up the party to save his government. The ruling NCP has 174 seats in the 275-member House of Representatives.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Oli and Prachanda are currently holding a one-to-one meeting at the PM's residence at Baluwatar to sort out their difference, a senior Cabinet member said. They are trying to patch up differences by addressing each other's concern, he said.

Although rare, it is one of the most common causes of transfusion-related death, say experts.TRALI can occur rapidly after a blood transfusion and is often associated with the receipt of plasma or platelet products, they said."So, either woman with pregnancy history are not eligible to donate (if not tested), or we need to test the plasma for HLA antibodies to determine if they are present," the doctor said, adding, if found present, the plasma should not be used.While the guidelines issued by Delhi government on plasma donation clearly says women who have ever been pregnant are not eligible to donate, there is no mention of doing prior screening in case of such women.However, as per the Recommendations for Investigational COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma published on the website of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the US government, "female donors who have not been pregnant, or female donors who have been tested since their most recent pregnancy and results interpreted as negative for HLA antibodies" are eligible to donate.A person who has recently recovered from COVID-19, usually develops antibodies against SARS CoV 2 virus and then this is collected and transferred to a sick patient through plasma.Each person can donate 250-500 ml of plasma. The first dosage of 250 ml is given to the recipient, and if needed second dosage of 250 ml after 24 hours can be given.    On first day of the starting of the 'plasma bank' in Delhi, ten people had donated plasma.

Now, India and Italy would have to work out the blood-money. They can move PCA in case of any disagreement.New Delhi had alleged that the two Italian marines aboard the Italian commercial oil tanker killed the Indian fishermen.The Supreme Court had in 2014 stayed the criminal proceedings against the two Italian marines before a Special Court at Kollam in Kerala. In 2015, it halted all the proceedings before all courts in India in view of an ITLOS order calling upon India and Italy to suspend all criminal proceedings against the two marines.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/italian-marines-case-centre-accepts-international-tribunals-award-urges-sc-to-close-the-case-108092

03-07-2020||Tuticorin (TN)||Inspector held in Santhakulam case tried all tricks in the book to escape||Shifting locations and changing vehicles, Sathankulam Inspector of Police Sridhar played hide-and-seek with CB-CID sleuths for days before being arrested in the sensational case of custodial torture and murder of a father-son duo in this southern district in Tamil Nadu.In the end, the relentless pursuit and meticulous planning by the specialised Crime Branch-CID personnel, who were helped by local police, outwitted the suspended inspector who had been on the run after sensing that he was in trouble, a police official privy to the probe said.“He did not have any intention to surrender before authorities though he claimed that it was his idea,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.P Jeyaraj and his son Bennicks, who used to run a mobile phone shop, were allegedly beaten all night with sticks by policemen at the Sathankulam station under Inspector Sridhar’s command. They died the next day in a hospital on June 23, triggering a nation-wide outrage and calls for strong action against the police personnel.Amid initial charges of cover-up, the CB-CID police took over the probe on Wednesday on the direction of the Madras High Court and arrested Sridhar, two sub-inspectors and a head-constable based on preliminary investigations and slapped murder charges.Sridhar started shifting his location days ago after it became clear that he would be arrested in the case following his suspension, the official told PTI.Although the inspector had sent word that he would make himself available to the authorities for questioning, he did not turn up, the official said. He then became evasive and shifted locations often, changing vehicles to travel from one place to another. A wireless message, meanwhile, asking police personnel manning district border checkposts to be on guard to spot the accused went viral on the social media.The photographs of the police personnel were shared with those manning the checkposts, the official said.Though they could nab the others, several teams of the CB-CID in addition to local police units here and neighbouring districts could not spot Sridhar despite efforts. It later emerged that he had successfully given police the slip in several locations, including Kayathar in this district.After shuttling between one place to another, Sridhar finally reached neighbouring Tirunelveli on Wednesday with the alleged support of a political personality.Based on intelligence inputs that he was leaving Tirunelveli in a “specific car,” to an undisclosed location, his vehicle was intercepted early on Thursday at Gangaikondan checkpost on the highway towards Madurai.“We tracked him, followed his car and managed to detain him at Gangaikondan and he was brought to Tuticorin,” the official added.Following questioning, Sridhar was arrested and later produced before the Chief Judicial Magistriate court here, which remanded him to judicial custody. Three other policemen have also been remanded to judicial custody.Meanwhile, a senior CB-CID official scotched speculation that constable Muthuraj, also wanted in the case, has “come forward to be an approver” in the case.The official told PTI that the claim was not true, adding that efforts were afoot to apprehend him.“We will arrest Muthuraj soon,” he said.A petition would be filed in a court here to take all the accused into police custody “in a couple of days,” to take forward the investigation, he said.Jeyaraj and his son Bennicks were arrested on June 19 for alleged violation of prohibitory orders in force due to COVID-19 lockdown by keeping their mobile phone shop beyond the allowed time.After being remanded to judicial custody by a magistrate next day, the two were lodged in the Kovilpatti sub-jail.  They were admitted at a government hospital in Kovilpatti by jail authorities on June 22 and died in the space of a few hours.Their family has alleged that the two were severely beaten up in the police station, which was later coroborated by a woman head constable who told a magisterial probe that the other personnel kept thrashing the father and son throughout  the night.In the backdrop of outrage against their deaths following alleged police brutality, Chief Minister K Palaniswami had on June 28 announced a CBI probe.However, pending the central agency taking over the case, the Madras High Court directed the CB-CID to step in, fearing that evidence could be tampered with or removed.

03-07-2020||New Delhi||Rajya Sabha exploring session, MPs to be in the precincts to partake virtually||The Rajya Sabha is working on a model of holding its session where members could take part though virtual participation but being physically present in the precincts of Parliament.The MPs who cannot be accommodated inside the House, on account of physical distancing norm, can take part in the proceedings either from the Central Hall or the Balayogi Auditorium in the Library Building.The proposed plan came up for discussion as Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu held meeting with Secretariat officials today amid repeated demands from opposition MPs to convene Parliament to discuss both COVID-19 and the situation in Ladakh region.  Given the capacity constraints of existing NIC infrastructure this hybrid model is under consideration.“The broad position that emerged was to enable seating of members of Rajya Sabha in the chamber and the galleries of the House in conformity with the norm of physical distancing and to enable virtual participation of other members from either the Central Hall or Balayogi Auditorium in the Parliament House premises,” sources in the Rajya Sabha said.The chairman suggested that effort shall be to enable participation of the members in the proceedings from within the House to the extent possible through appropriate planning. The House including all galleries, except media, can accommodate 127 members.Officials are to draw plans to seat MPs based on strength of various parties in the House or any other efficacious criteria.The officials are to submit a detailed action report including logistics for consideration early next week, the sources said.The Budget session of Parliament was truncated on March 23 and the next session is to be held within six months. The Monsoon session of Parliament is usually held during July-August each year for about four weeks.Several countries have devised methods to hold Parliament session since April with hybrid model of physical plus virtual in the United Kingdom in place.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajya-sabha-exploring-session-mps-to-be-in-the-precincts-to-partake-virtually-108082

At the same time, he exhorted corporates to improve their cyber awareness in order not to be caught napping by malevolent hackers.National Cyber Security Coordinator Rajesh Pant said on Friday that the country has all the capabilities to handle cyber security issues and the workforce manning them has an edge over other countries.Lt. Gen (retd) Pant’s remarks come against the backdrop of Chinese hackers attempting to debilitate India’s digital services as a spillover of tensions on the border.Addressing a webinar on ‘Cyber Crime Management during Covid’ organised by FICCI, he said, “Our systems are well in place and more importantly, the people who are handling the cyber security in our country, have an edge along with the software which is key in this.’’Highlighting the urgency of cyber audits in various companies, Lt Gen Pant said that companies have to play an important role in ensuring that cyber security audits are not just mere a tick-box activity.“All companies are expected to have a cyber audit done. The audit is done by an empanelled auditor and we have many auditors empanelled in India as on today. A lot of companies focus on minimum audits but more needs to be done. I urge all enterprises to get their cyber audits done, it’s for your own good,” he added.Lt Gen Pant further stressed upon increasing awareness regarding cyber security. “The human being is the weakest link in the cyber security chain; so whatever you do, human beings become very important. Training, good cyber hygiene and good social engineering practices are essential,” he added.Rahul Chaudhry who heads FICCI’s Homeland Security Committee described cyber security as a “hygiene issue’’ at the individual level. “It is an individual’s social responsibility to get cyber aware. We need to educate everyone about cyber hygiene, at the school level and even at the workplace,’’ he acknowledged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/can-handle-all-hacking-threats-cyber-security-chief-108069

Significantly, PM Modi had initiated a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday during which both sides had resolved to strengthen their bilateral partnership.Though US Defence Secretary Mark Esper twice called Rajnath Singh in a gesture of solidarity and the French Defence Minister Florence Parly had condoled the deaths of soldiers in the Galwan valley, India’s first port of call for solidarity and military hardware after the June 15 Galwan Valley clash has been Russia.Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Friday briefed Japanese Ambassador Satoshi Suzuki on the situation along the LAC. “Japan also hopes for peaceful resolution through dialogue. Japan opposes any unilateral attempt to change the status quo,’’ Suzuki observed after the briefing.South Block has also provided its version of the tensions on the LAC to envoys from EU, US, France, Germany and Russia.While India-China tensions continued, Moscow had initiated a meeting of RIC Foreign Ministers. In continuation with this dual track policy, Russia on Thursday initiated a virtual meeting of sherpas from the five BRICS countries –Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa–in which Secretary in MEA Sanjay Bhattacharya participated.On the bilateral front, Russia said it did not set any limits. “”There is an expression ‘the sky’s the limit’.  For Russia and India the sky is not the limit,’’ Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov said in an interview with TASS news agency.Russia found itself in the ideal position to play the role of ice-breaker as it has mutually-exclusive defence and energy ties with both China and India. During the epidemic, as against China-baiting by the West, Moscow saw Beijing as the first victim of Covid rather than the initiator.Touching on the existing problems in the Indian-Chinese relations, Morgulov said the border dispute was “undeniable’’ but it does not interfere with trilateral cooperation.Interestingly, the Russian media is rounding off its reports on the LAC tensions by citing Indian figures for the fatalities — 20 Indian soldiers killed and 76 wounded while 45 Chinese soldiers killed or wounded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/south-block-briefs-envoys-of-major-nations-on-lac-tensions-108067

A missing report was filed by his father on June 19. The father already suspected the hand of two men—Viplav and Rahul—in his son's disappearance."During the course of the investigation the suspect Rahul with whom Sajid was last seen, was interrogated and involvement of another man—Chaman was established."Later, both Rahul and Chaman were interrogated, and they confessed that they killed Sajid in the jungle in Mandi Valley and left his body there. They murdered him by bludgeoning his head with stones after getting him intoxicated," said DCP South Atul Thakur.According to police, they stated that Viplav's mother had a quarrel with Sajid's mother before lockdown and that is why they killed him."Both the accused were arrested and with their help, the remains of Sajid's body was recovered from the jungle around a kilometre deep into the forested area near the Faridabad border," said the officer. Sajid too had some criminal cases registered against him. His motorcycle has been recovered from PS Sitarganj.This has also led the police to another murder by Viplav, who has been arrested in the other murder case in Sitarganj town of Udham Singh Nagar district in Uttarakhand. In that case, Viplav had allegedly abducted one person (his relative Sushant) from Sangam Vihar and murdered him there.The reason for that murder was apparently Sushant's use of foul language about Viplav's friend. Viplav has been found to be involved in a kidnapping and murder case as a juvenile also.

However, reservation for OBC candidates under All India Quota is restricted to central Institutions. As per the data compiled by the All India Federation of Other Backward Classes, since 2017, OBC candidates lost over 11,000 seats, in All India Quota, due to non-implementation of OBC reservations in State/UT Medical education institutions,” Gandhi said in the letter to PM. Gandhi said the 93rd Constitutional Amendment envisages special provisions for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes in admission to educational institutions, including private educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the State, other than the minority educational institutions and denial of reservations to OBCs in state medical institutions in All India Quota, being administered by GOI, violates the very objective of the Constitutional Amendment and is a barrier to access medical education for deserving OBC candidates.“In the interest of equity and social justice, I strongly urge the Union Government to extend reservation for OBC candidates in All India Quota of medical and dental seats, even in the State/UT Medical education institutions,” she said in her letter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/denial-of-obc-quota-in-neet-admissions-violates-93rd-constitutional-amendment-sonia-says-to-pm-108046
03-07-2020||New Delhi||Indian video-sharing apps surge in popularity on TikTok ban||Indian tech and entertainment firms are looking to capitalise on sudden opportunities arising from a government ban on Chinese owned apps, including the wildly popular TikTok, with one rival video app saying it had added 22 million users in 48 hours.India, this week, outlawed 59 Chinese-owned apps including TikTok and Tencent’s WeChat, in what was described as a “digital strike” against China by the country’s Technology Minister.The move followed a confrontation between India and China at Galwan Valley, which left 20 Indian soldiers dead.With 200 million Indians users, TikTok, which features a simple user interface, background music options and various special effects, was a burgeoning force in the nation’s social media scene and the ban left its fans scrambling for options.Roposo, an Indian video-sharing social media app similar to TikTok that been around since 2014, saw its user base jump by 22 million in the two days after India banned the Chinese apps, company’s founder Mayank Bhangadia told Reuters.“In the last few days, I’ve slept for a total of five hours and it is the same for our entire team,” Bhangadia said.“The load is so much and we’re just ensuring that the experience is as smooth as possible.”Roposo’s downloads on Google’s Android now total over 80 million and Bhangadia expects to reach 100 million in just a few days. Before the ban, Roposo had roughly 50 million installs on Android devices, which account for a bulk of India’s nearly 500 million smartphones.Based in the southern Indian tech hub of Bengaluru, the company has just 200 staff now but is planning to hire as many as 10,000 people over the next two years and may take the app global, Bhangadia said.Other home-grown TikTok alternatives such as Chingari and Mitron are also finding favour with users, with many taking to social media to echo Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for “atma nirbhar” India.MyGov, the Central Government’s citizen engagement website, last month created its account on Roposo.“We have to create our own ecosystem, every country has done this, this is our atma nirbhar programme,” said a government minister.New players are also jumping into the fray.“Mumbai-based Zee Entertainment Enterprises is set to launch an ad-supported, short-video platform, HiPi, in the next two months,” Rajneel Kumar, product head for its digital unit Zee5, said.He hoped that former TikTok users would “find a home within Hipi to be able to continue to enjoy the content they enjoyed”.

Of them, 26 persons belonged to eight districts in Bihar, where around 92 persons and 11 persons were killed by lightning strikes on June 25 and June 30, respectively.According to meteorologists, violent thunderstorms are common in the region during the season.“Dry winds from Northwest interact with moist winds from the Bay of Bengal, leading to instability of atmosphere and development of intense thunderstorms. The only way to deal with the natural calamity peculiar to the area is precaution,” says Mahesh Palawat from Skymet.Meanwhile, due to high convergence of strong moist winds from the Arabian Sea along the west coast and cyclonic circulation over south Gujarat and neighbourhood, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated heavy to very heavy falls are most likely to continue over Gujarat, Konkan and Goa, Madhya Maharashtra and coastal Karnataka over the next five days.A cyclonic circulation also lay over east Uttar Pradesh and neighbourhood while a north-south trough is running till east Vidarbha. This is most likely to cause fairly widespread to widespread rainfall/thundershower with isolated heavy to very heavy falls over Central and adjoining east India during the next five days, the IMD said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rains-over-northwest-till-july-6-imd-also-warns-of-lightning-over-bihar-108043

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra came out in Patel's support and alleged that sending the ED to harass the senior party leader in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic shows the "perversion" of this government's priorities."Thousands are dying, our health workers are desperate for supportive measures, the economy is facing an unprecedented crisis, the Chinese are entering our territory, our soldiers are being killed, and this is what the Government is busy spending time on," she said in a tweet."They say crisis unveils the true nature of people, it appears the saying applies to governments as well," Priyanka added.Sending the ED to harass @ahmedpatel ji in the middle of the COVID pandemic shows the perversion of this government’s priorities.Thousands are dying, our health workers are desperate for supportive measures, the economy is facing an unprecedented crisis, the Chinese are.. 1/2  The ED investigators questioned Patel at his residence for about 10 hours on Thursday during the third round of his grilling in connection with the probe into the Sandesara brothers' bank fraud and money-laundering case."This is political vendetta and harassment against me and my family and I do not know under whose pressure they (investigators) are working," Patel had said after his questioning.The agency had earlier questioned the 70-year-old Congress leader in two separate sessions, clocking about 17 hours in total, on June 27 and 30.He was allowed to be quizzed at home by the agency after the Congress' Rajya Sabha MP from Gujarat refused to visit the ED office, citing the prevailing COVID-19 guidelines that discourage senior citizens from going out.Officials said Patel's statement was being recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).He is being questioned on his alleged links with the Sandesara brothers, the promoters of the Vadodara-based Sterling Biotech pharmaceutical company, and dealings of his family members with them.The agency, last year, had questioned Patel's son Faisal and son-in-law Irfan Ahmed Siddiqui in connection with the case and recorded their statements.The Sandesaras are also facing separate probes by the CBI and the Income Tax department for their alleged nexus with some high-profile politicians and charges of corruption and tax evasion respectively.

03-07-2020||New Delhi||NCW received 2,043 complaints of crimes against women in June, highest in 8 months||The NCW received 2,043 complaints of crimes committed against women in June, the highest in the last eight months.According to the National Commission for Women (NCW) data, 452 complaints of domestic violence were received in June alone.Of the 2,043, 603 complaints related to mental and emotional abuse and were filed under the 'right to live with dignity' clause.The number of complaints received in June have been highest since September last year when 2,379 complaints were received, the data showed.NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma attributed the rise in complaints to the increased activity of the Commission on social media platforms."The complaints have increased because we are very active on social media now and we are registering cases from Twitter and other social media platforms too. We have a WhatsApp number for reporting cases which was not in place earlier. People know that we are helping and that's why they have more faith in us," said Sharma.The second highest number of complaints were received under the clause of ''Protection of Women against Domestic Violence'', the data showed.Sharma similarly attributed the increase in domestic violence complaints to the active presence of NCW on social media."Same is with the cases of domestic violence. We advertised on Doordarshan at prime time to make women aware of the ways in which they could reach us and also started our emergency WhatsApp helpline number which is an easy way for women to reach out to us. This is the reason why numbers have increased," she said.There were 252 complaints of harassment of married women and dowry harassment followed by 194 complaints of outraging modesty of women and molestation, the data showed.The NCW data showed that 113 complaints of police apathy towards women and 100 complaints of cybercrime were received by the commission.As many as 78 complaints of rape and attempt to rape were received, while 38 complaints of sexual harassment were received in June, the data showed.According to the data, 27 complaints of dowry deaths and 45 complaints under the clause 'Right to exercise choice in marriage or Honour Crimes' were also received by the Commission.Sharma encouraged women to reach out to the NCW whenever they wanted. "The NCW is working for the wellbeing and empowerment of women so they can reach us anytime, any day," she added.In May, 1,500 complaints were received by the NCW, while in April 800 complaints were received and in March 1,347 complaints were received. In February, 1,424 complaints were received while in January 1,462 complaints were received, the data showed.In December, 1,402 complaints were received while in November 1,642 and in October 1,885 complaints were received by the NCW.

03-07-2020||New Delhi||Lockdown helped achieve 95% National Clean Air Programme targets in 74 days||Clampdown on non-essential activities during Covid-19 pandemic led to a significant decline in air pollution levels across India.The unprecedented lockdown helped achieve 95 per cent of National Clean Air Programme targets for 2024 in just 74 days in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai, according to a CarbonCopy and Respirer Living Sciences analysis of CPCB AQI data.The analysis is part of the NCAP tracker project that monitors implementation of the programme across 122 non-attainment cities.As part of the project, researchers analysed average air quality during four lockdown phases as well as concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3) and Benzene during individual phases in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru, according to a statement.Between March 25 and June 8, restrictions imposed on human-induced sources of air pollution not only resulted in clean air but also allowed researchers to conduct studies tracking base levels in the four cities affected by poor air quality.The drastic drop in pollution levels in the period teaches lessons on management that need to be incorporated to achieve clean air targets. Levels can be brought down dramatically if India focuses its energy towards a green recovery model which is less emission-intensive, researchers say.Notified in January 2019, NCAP seeks to reduce particulate matter by 20-30% by 2024.The data was sourced from air quality monitors of state pollution control boards recognised as official data used by the NCAP.According to Ronak Sutaria from the Respirer Living Sciences, all four cities analysed managed to better their 2024 NCAP target by around 30%, with Kolkata bettering their target by over 50 per cent.“This period is a marker for policymakers on how they can achieve what has been planned for in the coming four years, in a relatively shorter period.”Experts also say that the lockdown allowed them to understand background pollution levels.Four of the eight primary polluting sources, such as construction and industrial activity, brick kilns and vehicles, were completely closed, during the period.Between March 25 and June 8, power demand plummeted by 19.9% y-o-y due to the decline in industrial activity. Coal-fired thermal power plants are one of the key sources of air pollution in India. However, sources like household emissions, open burning, diesel generators and dust remained.Dr Sagnik Dey from IIT-D says the lockdown presented an opportunity to understand background pollution levels in India, which will be present even in the best-case scenario.“PM2.5 levels ranged between 20-49 μg/m3 in the 4 major Indian cities during the lockdown, which means that in the best case scenario we cannot go below that”.The WHO guideline for clean air level is 10 μg/m3.The tracker analysed PM2.5 and PM10 levels in 2017, 2018 and 2019 to demonstrate the effectiveness of NCAP in bringing down pollution, taking levels in 2017 as the base year.While Kolkata witnessed an approximate 24% improvement in PM levels in 2019 in comparison to 2018, Mumbai averaged at 16%, Bengaluru at 19.8% and Delhi at 6.4% but fell short of the NCAP targets.While Delhi’s PM 2.5 annual average level in 2019 was 109.2 µg/m3 the NCAP target was 70.9 µg/m3, meaning the city needed to achieve a reduction of 35% to meet it. Similarly, Mumbai, Kolkata and Bengaluru also fell short of their respective NCAP targets in 2019.Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends says bringing all economic activity to a halt brought about gains in air quality which have otherwise been envisaged as part of the next five years.“Lessons from the lockdown make it clear that city action plans need to be much more comprehensive in strategy and approach to air pollution management,” she says.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-helped-achieve-95-national-clean-air-programme-targets-in-74-days-108032

03-07-2020||New York||Men more likely to be seen as ‘brilliant’ than women: Study||Men are more likely to be seen as 'brilliant' than women, say researchers in a new study measuring global perceptions linked to gender.The study, published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, found that these stereotyped views are an instance of implicit bias, which is when associations are automatically activated in our minds."Stereotypes that portray brilliance as a male trait are likely to hold women back across a wide range of prestigious careers," said study lead author Daniel Storage from the University of Denver in the US."Understanding the prevalence and magnitude of this gender-brilliance stereotype can inform future efforts to increase gender equity in career outcomes," said study senior author Andrei Cimpian from the New York University in the US.Previous work by Cimpian and his colleagues has suggested that women are underrepresented in careers where success is perceived to depend on high levels of intellectual ability (e.g., brilliance, genius), including those in science and technology.Less understood are the factors that explain this phenomenon. To address this, the current study explored the potential impact of stereotypes.In a series of five experiments, the research team surveyed more than 3,000 people from over 78 countries including US women and men as well as US girls and boys between the ages of 9 and 10.To find out more about gender perceptions of brilliance, the researchers adopted an indirect way of measuring the stereotype - namely, a tool called the Implicit Association Test (IAT).IAT measures the degree of overlap between concepts (e.g., brilliant and male) without explicitly asking participants whether or not they hold stereotyped views.The researchers consistently found evidence for an implicit stereotype associating brilliance with men more than with women.The magnitude of this stereotype was striking as well – for example, it was similar in strength to the implicit stereotype that associates men more than women with careers (and women more than men with the family), which was identified in earlier work.The team also gauged explicit stereotypes, directly asking participants whether they believed that men are more brilliant than women.In marked contrast to the implicit stereotyping measures, participants reported disagreeing with this idea – and, in one study, explicitly associated the quality of being "super smart" with women more than with men.The finding is consistent with previous scholarship showing that people are unlikely to admit to stereotyping, reinforcing the importance of measuring such perceptions through more subtle means.

03-07-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Health Ministry issues revised home isolation guidelines||With a large number of people showing no symptoms testing positive for COVID-19, the Union Health Ministry has revised home isolation guidelines to include asymptomatic positive patients in the list of mild or pre-symptomatic COVID-19 infection cases.However, the immuno-compromised patients (included HIV, transplant recipients, cancer therapy) are not eligible for home isolation, state the revised guidelines released on Thursday.Elderly patients aged above 60 years and those with co-morbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, chronic lung/liver/kidney disease and cerebrovascular disease among others shall only be allowed home isolation after proper evaluation by the treating medical officer.Patients under home isolation will stand discharged after 10 days of onset of symptoms and no fever for three days, the guidelines stated.“Thereafter, the patient will be advised to isolate at home and self-monitor their health for a further seven days. There is no need for testing after the home isolation period is over,” the ‘Revised Guidelines for Home Isolation of Very mild/pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic COVID-19 cases’ stated.According to the document, asymptomatic patients like the ones who are pre-symptomatic and have very mild symptoms can opt for home isolation if they have the requisite self-isolation facility at their residence so as to avoid contact with other family members.The guidelines come against India’s rising COVID-19 tally to 6,04,641 on Thursday, with a single-day increase of 19,148 cases, just five days after it crossed the 5 lakh-mark. The death toll due to the disease rose to 17,834 with 434 new fatalities, according to Health Ministry data updated at 8 am.According to the guidelines, a caregiver should be available to provide care on a 24x7 basis and a communication link between the caregiver and a hospital is a prerequisite for the entire duration of home isolation.Besides, the guidelines reiterated that the caregiver and all close contacts of such cases should take hydroxychloroquine as a preventive medication as per the protocol and as prescribed by the treating medical officer.Besides, it called for downloading the Arogya Setu mobile application and that it should remain active at all times (through Bluetooth and wi-fi).Patients should monitor their health and regularly inform the health status to the district surveillance officer, who will facilitate further follow up by the surveillance teams.The patient also has to give an undertaking stating that being diagnosed as a confirmed/suspect case of COVID-19, he/she hereby voluntarily undertakes to maintain strict self-isolation at all times for the prescribed period, the guidelines said.Immediate medical attention must be sought if serious signs or symptoms, including difficulty in breathing, dip in oxygen saturation, persistent pain/pressure in the chest, mental confusion or inability to arouse, slurred speech/seizures, weakness or numbness in any limb or face and developing bluish discolourations of lips/face, it stated.As per the guidelines, the states and districts should monitor all such cases and that the health status of those under home isolation should be monitored by the field staff/surveillance teams through personal visits along with a dedicated call centre to follow up on the patients on a daily basis.The clinical status (body temperature, pulse rate and oxygen saturation) of each case should be recorded by the field staff/call centre.The field staff would guide the patient on measuring these parameters and provide the instructions (for patients and their caregivers), they said.Besides, details about patients under home isolation should also be updated on COVID-19 portal and facility app (with DSO as a user).The mechanism to shift a patient in case of violation or need for treatment has to be established and implemented.All family members and close contacts shall be monitored and tested as per protocol by the field staff. These discharge guidelines shall be strictly adhered to along with an issuance of a fitness certificate by the field team, as per the guidelines.

03-07-2020||Washington||China’s CPC acting ‘aggressively’ in neighbourhood, essentially ‘invaded’ India: Top US Senator||The ruling Communist Party of China is acting “aggressively” in its neighbourhood and it essentially “invaded” India, killing 20 of its soldiers, a top American Senator has said.In the last several weeks, more than a dozen US lawmakers have spoken against the Chinese aggression against India and have come out in support of New Delhi.“All across the periphery, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is acting aggressively. It’s essentially invaded India and killed 20 Indian soldiers,” Senator Tom Cotton said on the Senate floor on Thursday.In the South China Sea, it has attacked or otherwise threatened developments from Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines. It has increasingly encroached on Taiwanese and Japanese airspace, the Republican Senator said.China claims nearly all of the South China Sea, though Taiwan, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam all claim parts of it.Also read: China under Xi stepped up ‘aggressive’ foreign policy towards India: Congressional commission reportIn Hong Kong, the newly-imposed security law proves most clearly that the Chinese Communist Party will not abide by its commitments whether to its own people or to foreign nations, Cotton said.“There were actions this week (wherein) Beijing effectively torn up the joint declaration it made with Britain to govern the peaceful handover of Hong Kong as cynically as China has broken its commitment to the United States, to the World Health Organisation, the World Trade Organisation and others,” said the top American Senator.Senator Mitch McConnell, during his speech on the Senate Floor, in support of the National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA) 2021 alleged that China was engaged in the international provocation.An amendment to the NDAA 2021 moved by Senator Cory Gardner this week supports India against the Chinese aggression in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh and says the two countries should work toward de-escalating the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The expansion and aggression of the People’s Republic of China in and around disputed territories, such as the LAC, the South China Sea, the Senkaku Islands, is of significant concern, says the amendment.International provocation of China has only stepped up “during this pandemic - which they helped worsen - against Taiwan, against India, against the Philippines, and so on,” McConnell said on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi in a statement on Thursday said the aggression must be met with clear American resolve to stand by India and its other allies in the region.“We must work to de-escalate these tensions while sending a clear message to China that their belligerence will not be tolerated,” Krishnamoorthi said.“India is one of our closest friends, and it is vital that we stand with India in the face of the Chinese government's border aggression,” he said.“The Chinese government is taking advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to throw elbows at its neighbours in what's becoming a growing pattern of aggression,” he added.The Indian and Chinese armies are locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last several weeks, and the tension escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in the Galwan Valley on June 15.The two sides are holding diplomatic and military-level talks to ease the situation along the LAC.

03-07-2020||Mumbai||Cloth used by Sushant to hang self to undergo ‘tensile’ test||Investigators will subject the cloth allegedly used by actor Sushant Singh Rajput to hang himself to “tensile strength” analysis to determine whether it can bear the weight similar to that of the filmstar, as part of the probe into his death, an official said on Friday.Rajput (34) was found hanging at his suburban Bandra residence on June 14.According to the investigators, the actor ended his life by hanging himself from the ceiling using a green coloured nightgown made of cotton.No suicide note was found from the spot, the police had said then.Besides viscera from the actor’s body, the police also sent the gown for chemical and forensic analysis at the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in suburban Kalina, he said.It would take at least three more days to get the final forensic report, the official said.To ascertain the exact cause of death, forensic experts will check pattern of ligature marks around the actor’s neck and also determine the strength of the gown with the help of “tensile strength” analysis, he said.The tensile strength test would technically establish whether the cloth can bear around 80kg, the weight of the actor, he said.The test will help determine if there was any foul play, the official said.Tensile strength is the maximum load that a material can support without fracture when being stretched.Viscera analysis will help in checking whether there were any traces of chemical, poisonous or narcotics substance in his body, the official said.“Usually, it takes eight to ten working days to get s report from the FSL in regular cases. But since this case is sensitive, experts are taking more precautions to avoid any kind of error in their analysis,” the official said.The forensic report of the actor’s mobile phone is also awaited, he said.Recently, the police received the final post-mortem report of the actor from Cooper Hospital, which mentioned the cause of the death as “asphyxia due to hanging”.

03-07-2020||Washington||China under Xi stepped up ‘aggressive’ foreign policy towards India: Congressional commission report||China under President Xi Jinping has stepped up its “aggressive” foreign policy towards India and “resisted” efforts to clarify the Line of Actual Control that prevented a lasting peace from being realised, according to a report released by a US Congress appointed commission.The Army of India and China have been locked in a bitter standoff at multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the past seven weeks and the tension escalated after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in the Galwan Valley on June 15.“Under General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Xi Jinping, Beijing has stepped up its aggressive foreign policy towards New Delhi. Since 2013, China has engaged in five major altercations with India along the Line of Actual Control (LAC),” said a brief issued by US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.Also read: Modi reaches Ladakh to assess border situation with China“Beijing and New Delhi have signed a series of agreements and committed to confidence-building measures to stabilise their border, but China has resisted efforts to clarify the LAC, preventing a lasting peace from being realised,” said the report and was prepared at the request of the Commission to support its deliberations.Authored by Will Green, a Policy Analyst on the Security and Foreign Affairs Team at the Commission, the report says the Chinese government is particularly fearful of India’s growing relationship with the United States and its allies and partners.Also read: China’s CPC acting ‘aggressively’ in neighbourhood, essentially ‘invaded’ India: top US Senator“The latest border clash is part of a broader pattern in which Beijing seeks to warn New Delhi against aligning with Washington,” it said.After Xi assumed power in 2012, there was a significant increase in clashes, despite the fact that he met Prime Minister Narendra Modi several times and Beijing and New Delhi have agreed to a series of confidence-building mechanisms designed to mitigate tensions.Prior to 2013, the last major border clash was in 1987. The 1950s and 1960s were a particularly tense period, culminating in 1962 with a war that left thousands of soldiers were killed on both sides, according to the records of China’s People's Liberation Army, the report said.“The 2020 skirmish is in line with Beijing’s increasingly assertive foreign policy. The clash came as Beijing was aggressively pressing its other expansive sovereignty claims in the Indo-Pacific region, such as over Taiwan and in the South and East China Seas,” it said.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. Beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are vital to global trade.China claims almost all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims over the area.Several weeks before the clash in the Galwan Valley, Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe called on Beijing to “use fighting to promote stability” as the country’s external security environment worsened, a potential indication of China's intent to proactively initiate military tensions with its neighbours to project an image of strength, the report said.

03-07-2020||Interview by Sushil Manav||When coronavirus vaccine will be available, at what price: Adar Poonawalla, CEO, Serum Institute of India, explains||Covid-19, or SARS CoV-2, caused by coronavirus has thrown an unprecedented public health challenge before the world. With cases and deaths increasing by the day and no immediate solution in sight, people are eagerly looking forward to the much talked about ‘herd immunity’, which public health experts believe can save people from infection.‘Herd immunity’ can be obtained in two ways: with a large number of population getting infected, which is fraught with the risk of a huge number of deaths, or by vaccination of people against the virus.Though over a hundred vaccine candidates are in the field, ever since Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, has announced that the Covid-19 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford will hit the Indian markets by October this year, millions of people across the country are looking forward to this vaccine.At the beginning of June, AzstraZeneca and Serum Institute of India (SII) had reached a licensing agreement to supply 1 billion doses of the Oxford University vaccine candidate against Covid-19 to middle and low-income countries, including India.To begin with, by this yearend both companies had committed to provide 400 million doses.The Tribune reporter Sushil Manav spoke to Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the Serum Institute of India, about the vaccine, its possible launch time, the results of trials so far, among other issues. Excerpts: Your company said last month that the vaccine will be available in the market by October. Are you still sure that people will get the first vaccine for coronavirus by October?Based on the ongoing clinical trials, we are expecting the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine to be available towards the end of this year.Some scientists have said that any coronavirus vaccine is at least a year away.Usually it takes about 4-5 years to develop a vaccine. Currently there are more than 100 vaccine candidates at different stages of trials. Each will take their own time, and as I said, we are hoping that the AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine will be available towards the end of the year.The Oxford University vaccine has completed Phase-I of human trials. When can we expect the results of those trials?The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine has already progressed to the Phase-III trials stage, and based on the results we are expecting to mass produce the vaccine soon.Also read: India eyes August 15 launch of first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine: ICMRHow sure are you about favourable results of Phase-I trials?Thus far, the vaccine has shown positive results in the on-going trials. We are optimistic that it will be an efficacious and effective vaccine for Covid-19. We will conduct these trials in India as well.What is the production capacity of the Serum institute of India? How many vaccines per month are to be produced in the coming months?Our facility is well-equipped with state-of-the-art technology and is ready to manufacture the Covid-19 vaccine. We plan to start production in nearly two months and have invested more than $100 million in this facility to meet the demand.In terms of the production of vaccines, we will start making a few million of doses, and stockpile at a personal risk. Furthermore, as per our deal with AstraZeneca, we will start making 1 billion doses for India and other low- and middle-income countries. India has a vast population of 130 crore, and most would be in a hurry to be vaccinated. Would you be able to cater to the huge demand?Over the past 50 years, SII has built significant capability in vaccine manufacturing and supply in India as well globally. We have partnered with various institutions to manufacture their respective Covid-19 vaccine candidate. And in addition all our facilities are equipped with state-of-the-art technology to meet the vaccine's demand domestically and globally.Oxford University said in April that the vaccine would be made available on a not-for-profit basis. Can we expect the cost of vaccines to be within the reach of common people?It is too early to comment on the price of the vaccine at this point. Once the development of the vaccine commences, we will be able to take a decision in the coming months. However, we are certain that it will be affordable, and hopefully will be procured and distributed by governments without charge.Another manufacturer, Bharat Biotech, has announced indigenous vaccines and is in the process of starting Phase-I trials. Will your vaccine come ahead of theirs? International and national health authorities, and institutions across the world are coming together to develop a vaccine against Covid-19. While all of us are in a race against time, there is no contention amongst companies. Whosoever makes and develops the vaccine will need multiple partners to manufacture the vaccine. I hope that whichever company develops the vaccine does not hide behind patents and makes it available based on royalties or a commercial understanding to manufacturers across the world to make billions of dosages at a fast pace.   Do you think you have taken a risk by betting on an unproven vaccine?Since, we are not a listed company, we are not accountable to investors in terms of profits and returns. So we took the decision to manufacture at our own personal risk.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/when-coronavirus-vaccine-will-be-available-at-what-price-adar-poonawalla-ceo-serum-institute-of-india-explains-107991

Promises made to the people were not fulfilled. They will give a befitting reply to the government of corruption in the bypoll. —Jyotiraditya Scindia, BJP leaderChouhan, who took oath as the Chief Minister for a record fourth term before the Covid-19 lockdown, led a single-man Cabinet till April 21 when five ministers, including two former Congress MLAs close to Scindia (Tulsi Silawat and Govind Singh Rajput) were inducted.Those inducted from the Scindia camp are not MLAs as they had resigned from the Assembly in March and will now be contesting the bypoll. Sources say this is the first time in the political history of the state that so many non-members have been inducted in the council of ministers. At present, there are 24 vacancies in the 230-member MP Assembly.The sources say Chouhan, who tried hard to convince the Central leadership and also camped for two days in the Capital to make his point, had to ultimately drop the names of those he was pushing for. His statement “manthan se toh amrit hi nikalta hai, vish toh Shiv pee jaatein hain” is seen as an admission of his position in the tug of war with Scindia demanding his pound of flesh.Power corridors of MP are buzzing with speculations of “scaling down” of Chouhan’s persona and angry BJP hopefuls, who will not be given ticket in the upcoming bypoll.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/12-from-scindia-camp-get-berth-in-chouhans-expanded-cabinet-107946

India has also rejected Qureshi’s claim that Islamabad wants to open the Kartarpur Corridor but India was making attempts to disrupt the law and order situation in Pakistan. India says it was forced to turn down Pakistan’s offer on health and technical grounds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dont-blame-us-for-karachi-attack-mea-107948
03-07-2020||Kanpur||8 UP Police personnel killed, 7 injured in encounter with criminals in Kanpur||Eight Uttar Pradesh Police personnel, including a Deputy Superintendent of Police, were killed and seven others injured in an encounter with criminals in Kanpur, officials said on Friday.In a separate encounter, police killed two criminals during a combing operation.Also read: Know gangster Vikas Dubey, the man behind killing 8 policemen in KanpurThe Inspector General of Police, Kanpur, Mohit Agarwal said: “Two persons identified as Prem Prakash Pandey and Atul Dubey were killed in a separate encounter in Nivada village and a pistol, which was taken away by criminals from policemen in the earlier encounter, was recovered.”The first encounter took place when a police team was approaching to arrest Vikas Dubey, a history-sheeter facing 60 criminal cases, in Dikru village under the Chaubeypur police station on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday, police said.As the police team was about to reach the hideout of the dreaded criminal, a hail of bullets was showered on them from a building rooftop, leaving Deputy Superintendent of Police Devendra Mishra, three sub-inspectors and four constables dead, the officials said.Giving details of the incident, Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police HC Awasthi said the notorious criminal might have got an inkling of the impending raid.Dubey’s henchmen put up massive roadblocks to prevent the police personnel from proceeding towards their hideout. As the police team was caught unawares, the criminals fired at them from a building rooftop leading to the deaths, Awasthi said.On getting information about the incident, Additional DG (Law and Order), IG (Kanpur) and the SSP of Kanpur rushed to the spot, where a forensic team has started investigations.Interacting with media persons, IG STF Amitabh Yash claimed that an automatic 30 spring rifle, which was seized from Dubey’s possession during his arrest by the STF in Lucknow in 2017, was used in the Friday’s attack on policemen.The automatic rifle was released in someone’s favour by a Lucknow court, he added.“We will investigate under which circumstances the automatic rifle was released in someone’s else favour,” Yash said.Dubey, who was carrying a cash reward of Rs 25,000 on his head, was arrested by the STF from Krishna Nagar in 2017. The STF had seized an automatic 30 spring rifle and a number of cartridges from Dubey’s possession.The state police chief said seven policemen were also injured in these encounters and they have been rushed to a hospital.A combing operation is on and the entire area had been sealed, he said.Sources said Dubey had allegedly killed Santosh Shukla, an MoS-rank BJP leader, inside a police station in 2001.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath paid tributes to the slain policemen and conveyed his heartfelt condolences to their family members. According to a government spokesperson, the Chief Minister directed the police chief to take stringent action against the culprits and collect the detailed report from the spot immediately.Besides Deputy SP Devendra Mishra, who was posted as Circle Officer in Bilhaur, others killed in the encounter include Sub-Inspector Mahesh Chandra Yadav, Sub-Inspector Anup Kumar Singh, Sub-Inspector Nebu Lal, constables Jitendra Pal, Sultan Singh, Bablu Kumar and Rahul Kumar.The Opposition parties in Uttar Pradesh, including the Congress, the BSP and the Samajwadi Party, on Friday, lashed out at the Yogi Adityanath government, saying no one was safe in the state.Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra took to Twitter to condole the deaths of the police personnel.“Eight policemen were martyred while they went to nab criminals. I pay my condolence to the family of the martyrs. In UP, law and order has become very bad and criminals have no fear. From common man to policemen, no one is safe,” she said.कानपुर की भयावह घटना की खबर आई ही थी कि प्रयागराज में एक परिवार के चार लोगों की हत्या कर दी गई। गाजियाबाद में पिता-पुत्री की हत्या कर दी गई।उप्र में अपराधियों का इस तरह हावी हो जाना असामान्य है। इस #जंगलराज को देखते हुए जवाबदेही तो फिक्स करनी ही होगी।https://t.co/GYt6FmEDkK  “The responsibility of law and order is with the chief minister.

The family of those who died should be given financial help and a job should be given to one member of their family. This is the demand of the BSP,” the former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister said in a tweet.

After initial human trials so far, the vaccine has been considered safe even for people with a weak immune system.SII and AstraZeneca had reached a licensing agreement last month to supply one billion doses of the vaccine candidate to middle and low-income countries, including India. Oxford University had in April claimed that the vaccine would be made available on a not-for-profit basis. On the likely cost, the CEO said, “Once the development of the vaccine commences, we will be able to take a decision. However, we are certain that it will be affordable and hopefully will be procured and distributed by governments without charge.” He claimed that his company’s facility was “well-equipped to manufacture the vaccine. We plan to start production in nearly two months and have invested more than $100 million on this facility”.On the indigenous vaccine project announced by Bharat Biotech, Poonawalla said, “International and national health authorities and institutions are coming together to develop a vaccine. While all of us are in a race against time, there is no contention among companies. Whosoever makes and develops the vaccine will need multiple partners to manufacture it. I hope that whichever company develops the vaccine does not hide behind patents and makes it available based on royalties or a commercial understanding to as many manufacturers so as to make billions of dosages at a fast pace.” Asked whether it was a big risk betting on an unproven vaccine, Poonawalla said since his was not a listed company, he was not accountable to investors in terms of profit and returns. “So, we took the decision to manufacture at our own personal risk.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oxford-vaccine-by-yr-end-partner-firm-107843

No foreign Tablighi Jamaat member has been deported as criminal proceedings are pending against them,” Mehta told a Bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar.Mehta’s assertions came after senior advocate CU Singh said on behalf of petitioner foreign nationals from 35 countries that if there was any violation of visa norms, they can be deported to their parent country.Around 1,500 one-liner e-mails were sent to them regarding visa cancellations and no show-cause notices were issued to them for blacklisting from travel to India for 10 years, the petitioners’ counsel submitted.Posting the matter for hearing on July 10, the top court asked the petitioners to file their responses to the government’s affidavit. The banned foreign nationals can challenge individual orders before high courts and were free to make representations to the Centre, it said.In an affidavit filed in response to petitions challenging cancellation of visas of foreigners and their blacklisting, the Centre said 2,679 visas were cancelled, 2,765 foreign nationals were blacklisted and 205 FIRs lodged against them in 11 states.It said 1,905 lookout notices were issued against those absconding and nine of the visa cancellations related to Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card holders while 86 were Nepali nationals who didn’t need visa to enter India. The Centre said 227 of the Tablighi Jamaat left India before blacklisting and other actions were taken.“En masse blacklisting of the aforesaid more than 2500 foreigners of about 40 different nationalities, currently in India, without affording any opportunity to prima facie defend themselves, is an egregious and blatant violation of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution,” the petitioners contended.2,679 visas cancelled, 205 FIRs filedIn an affidavit filed in response to petitions challenging cancellation of visas of foreigners and their blacklisting, the Centre said 2,679 visas were cancelled, 2,765 foreign nationals were blacklisted and 205 FIRs lodged against them in 11 states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/orders-to-blacklist-jamaatis-on-case-to-case-basis-sc-informed-107849

India and Italy will now have to mutually agree on the blood-money and can approach the PCA in case of disagreement.It also agreed with the Italian argument that the two marines should be tried in Italy and asked the Indian authorities to close the criminal case against them. Advocate Mukul Rohatgi appeared for Italy to secure the passage of marines from India.The incident occurred in 2012 while Italian marines were on duty on the merchant ship as part of an anti-piracy posse due to rampant hijacking of ships by Somalian pirates. They had fired on a fishing boat off the coast of Kerala, fearing that pirates were trying to attack the merchant vessel.It remained unexplained why Italian military personnel did not know they were hundreds of kms away from piracy-prone areas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/marines-trial-in-italy-compensation-for-indian-fishermens-families-107646
