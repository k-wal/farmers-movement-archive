It added that as there have been several myths and references about Lord Ram and the places associated with him, the PM was “simply highlighting the importance of further studies and research of the vast cultural geography the Ramayana represents to obtain facts about Shri Ram, Ramayana and the various places linked to this rich civilisation.”The statement also reminded that the PMs of Nepal and India launched the Ramayana Circuit two years back, of which Janakpur-Ayodhya Passenger Bus Service is an important component. “These facts signify the bond of time-honoured cultural affinity between our two countries and peoples,” added the statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-clarifies-pm-olis-ayodhya-statement-112896

The Congress came back from a wretched 21 seats to 100. We just gave him a performance bonus. We are so meritocratic. We are so transparent.”For five years Sachin Pilot gave his blood , tears, toil and sweat for the Congress party between 2013-18. The Congress came back from a wretched 21 seats to 100. We just gave him a performance bonus. We are so meritocratic. We are so transparent.Meanwhile, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Tuesday said he was sad to see Sachin Pilot “leave” the Congress and asserted that instead of “parting”, the former Rajasthan deputy chief minister should have joined the effort to make the party a more effective instrument for “his and our dreams”.However, when asked on Twitter whether Pilot had left the party, Tharoor said, “Not formally. I certainly hope that reconciliation is still possible. The events of the last few days led me to draw an obvious inference.”      “If he returns to the fold & works for a revived &reformed @incIndia, he would be more than welcome,” the MP from Thiruvananthapuram said.I am sad to see @SachinPilot leave @INCIndia. I consider him one of our best & brightest, and wish it had not come to this. Instead of parting, he should have joined the effort to make the Party a better& more effective instrument for his, and our, dreams.  It's a real tragedy and it's a terrible indictment of Congress that the two of the people who should be leading the party have left while the brightest star of them all has been (at least partially) sidelined  Historian Willam Dalrymple replying to Tharoor's tweet, wrote, "It's a real tragedy and it's a terrible indictment of Congress that the two of the people who should be leading the party have left while the brightest star of them all has been (at least partially) sidelined."The Congress on Tuesday cracked the whip on dissident leader Pilot, stripping him of the posts of deputy chief minister and the party’s Rajasthan unit president for revolting against Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.Responding to the developments, Tharoor tweeted, “I am sad to see @SachinPilot leave @INCIndia.“I consider him one of our best & brightest, and wish it had not come to this.

14-07-2020||New Delhi||SC seeks report from Centre on plea for help to poor pregnant, lactating women||The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought a report from the Centre on a plea of an NGO seeking status of a 2013 statutory scheme which provided for distribution of maternity benefits of Rs 6,000 to all pregnant women and lactating mothers in the country. One of the provisions of the National Food Security Act, which came into effect from July 5, 2013, said that the poor pregnant and lactating women have to be given monetary help of minimum Rs 6,000 per month. A Bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices R Subhash Reddy and A S Bopanna was hearing the PIL filed by NGO ‘Peoples Union For Civil Liberties’ (PUCL). It also issued notice on one of the prayers of the PIL relating to monetary help to lactating and pregnant women as it was not taken note of in 2015. “Issue notice in respect of prayer (j) of the instant writ petition which reads as under: ‘For an order directing all States and UTs to pay the maternity benefit of not less than Rs.6,000 to all pregnant women and lactating mothers with effect from July 5, 2013 in accordance with Section 4(b) of the National Food Security Act’,” the Bench said in the order.                         In a hearing conducted through video conferencing, it asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to file the status report giving details of the steps taken in helping the poor lactating and pregnant women in the country. Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the NGO, said that a status report be sought from the government on the steps taken to extend financial help to such women in the event of cessation of the lockdown. Pregnant women receive incentive given under the “Janani Suraksha Yojana” (JSY) for institutionalised delivery and the incentive received under JSY would be accounted towards maternity benefits. Gonsalves said the issue was very important in view of the fact that there was a very high mortality rate of children and women here. Earlier, the top court, on September 4, 2015, had sought the response from the Centre on a plea seeking distribution of subsidised food grains to the poor through PDS and proper implementation of maternity benefit schemes.It had issued notices to Union Ministries of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution and Women and Child Development on the PIL. The plea had sought a direction to all states and Union territories for proper implementation of the National Food Security Act and the maternity benefit scheme. The petition had claimed that even after lapse of statutory time-limit, process of identification of beneficiaries is not complete and the National Food Security Act is not being fully implemented. “As many 45.9 crore beneficiaries entitled to subsidised grains at Rs 3, Rs 2 and Rs 1 for rice, wheat and coarse grains respectively, from July 4, 2014 under provisions of the Act, are not receiving grains at the specified prices due to delay in implementation of the Act,” it had said. It said that “meal provision under the Integrated Child Developments Services (ICDS) scheme has very low coverage and is far from universal as has been laid down in the Act and directed by the apex court”.        It also sought a direction to all the states and UTs to ensure that no eligible applicant is denied a ration card.

14-07-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||India’s strategic rail projects with Japan, Iran in trouble||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 14Two rail projects that are statements of diplomatic significance are in trouble and would need intervention by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sources said.The project in partnership with Japan to run the subcontinent’s first Bullet Train is facing a cost overrun while there is reportedly Indian apathy over funding a rail line in Iran. The latter’s significance is that it will be Afghanistan’s first route to the Indian Ocean independent of Pakistan.The Bullet Train project has been impacted by cost overruns, especially during the first two lockdowns when Japan kept asking for relaxation in movement of its engineers and material. The cost overrun is understood to be over $ 2 billion (Rs 15,000 crore) that is beyond the realm of executives from both sides to resolve.The project faces the danger of sliding into a time overrun if the issue is not considered on a priority basis, said sources. There is also the issue of delays in issuing tenders worth Rs 50,000 crore for the project after India announced the “Atmanirbhar Bharat” initiative to source more form local companies. That has necessitated reworking of calculations. The other rail project, on Iranian soil, has seen Tehran fretting that New Delhi is yet to play a bigger role in funding and constructing a strategic transit route from Chabahar to Zahedan in Afghanistan, and from there to Sarakhs at the border with Turkmenistan.Sources said as far as Chabahar Port is concerned, Iran will always partner with India. In fact, even during the Corona pandemic, humanitarian assistance from India to Afghanistan transited via Chabahar Port which is operated by an Indian public sector company.Interestingly, the development of Chabahar port by India has been exempted by the US from its sanctions regime. As is the case with Frazad-B gas field which has been offered by Iran to India, Tehran has started expressing its impatience with Indian procrastination in investing in the railway line, a vital link in the International North – South Transit Corridor which significantly shortens the trade routes between India and European and CIS markets.Diplomatic sources said Tehran has indicated to India that it does not want to depend solely on Beijing for co-development of transportation routes. “Iran is determined to expand its relations with all Asian partners in particular China and India as two friendly countries. Such agreement is fully in the line with Iran’s publicly declared “Look East Policy”,’’ said a diplomatic source.In the case of Farzad-B oil field, Iran has often threatened to take back ownership from Indian companies if there is no investment for fear of US sanctions. Iran seems to be similarly nudging India to get interested in the rail project by declaring that it has started work but left a window open for Indian rail PSUs to re-enter. An intervention at the highest levels and ample funds have now become roadblocks in two projects of strategic intent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-strategic-rail-projects-with-japan-iran-in-trouble-112888

But this is not to say the Union Government should do nothing."It said the Centre could exercise powers under the National Disaster Management Act to issue some guidelines.Earlier, it had asked the Centre to identify private hospitals where Coronavirus patients could be treated for free or at nominal charges.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wont-regulate-cost-of-covid-19-treatment-says-sc-112887

The Jharkhand Government has also filed a writ petition in the matter.Jharkhand contended that it was highly inappropriate for the Centre to conduct auction during COVID-19 pandemic as both the central and state machinery were needed to deal with the health crisis.“The impugned action impinges the rights of the indigenous people of the plaintiff state and will lead to large scale displacement and consequential rehabilitation and re-settlement issues,” it added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coal-block-auction-sc-notice-to-centre-on-jharkhand-governments-plea-112880

Telangana has on the other hand segregated the old city of Hyderabad into clusters and sealed many locations.The clinical trials for coronavirus vaccine – COVAXIN – began on Tuesday at Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS).COVAXIN is India’s first indigenous COVID-19 vaccine, developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and National Institute of Virology.The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has given a nod for its human clinical trials. Trials will be conducted at 12 places across the country.Andhra Pradesh reported 1,916 new cases and 43 deaths in the past 24 hours.New guidelines for quarantine of people coming into the state from various parts of the country and also abroad have been announced.The Special Chief Secretary (Health) KS Jawahar Reddy has ordered that all persons coming from other states might be advised strict home quarantine for 14 days.Neighbouring Telangana and Karnataka that were categorised as "low-risk" states earlier have been put in the "high-risk" category now.The AP State Road Transport Corporation has announced it was cancelling over 150 inter-state busses for Bengaluru because of the lockdown being imposed in the Garden City from July 15 to 23.The Telangana Government has also brought back the concept of containment clusters in certain pockets of the old city. These clusters are mainly seen in Sultan Shahi, Moghalpura, Lal Darwaza and Shahalibanda areas of the old city.Ashok Samrath, Zonal Commissioner (South), Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, said areas were being barricaded to mark cluster zones.Some 20 cluster zones have come up in the city.Andhra Pradesh has not opened its inter-state borders yet for movement of persons and obtaining an e-pass for entry into the state is still mandatory.It has ordered a uniform institutional quarantine of seven days for all foreign returnees and tests might be conducted between the fifth and seventh day (upon arrival) and, based on the result, follow up action be initiated, he added.The overall COVID-19 death toll in Andhra Pradesh shot up to 408 following a record 43 deaths in the past 24 hours.The toll on Tuesday is higher than the previous record of 37 deaths reported the preceding morning.Meanwhile, 28 police personnel have tested positive for coronavirus in the state in the last 48 hours.

One end of the rope used for hanging was fastened to the left hand of the deceased MLA and the mark on the left hand above the knuckle was caused by it.Citing the postmortem report ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Derek O’Brien today said the report conclusively proved that the death was a case of suicide. Uttar Dinajpur district SP Sumit Kumar had earlier said it was a case of suicide and claimed that a suicide note was found in the MLA’s pocket in which he said two people were responsible for his death and gave their names.The MLA’s wife and other family members have, however, have trashed the police version.West Bengal BJP leaders, including union minister of state Babul Supriyo, Darjeeling MP Raju Bishth, Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta and BJP general secretary and the party’s West Bengal observer Kailash Vijayvargya, today also wrote to Union Home Minister Amit Shah stating that Roy’s death was similar to that of BJP activists Trilochan Mahato and Dulal Kumar who were “murdered by hanging” in Purulia following the 2018 panchayat elections. The letter urged Shah to have Roy’s death investigated by the CBI.A 12-hour North Bengal bandh call today by BJP to press for CBI investigation into Roy’s death evoked mixed response. A BJP delegation led by Vijayvargya also presented a memorandum to President Ramnath Kovind today on the alleged sorry state of law and order situation in West Bengal. The memorandum stated that 105 BJP workers got killed in the state during last three years in political violence.While Debendra Roy won the Assembly general elections in 2016 as a candidate of CPI(M), he later switched allegiance to BJP. He was preparing to contest from Hemtabad on BJP ticket when the Assembly polls are held next year.West Bengal BJP leaders also met Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and urged him for a CBI investigation into Roy’s death.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/autopsy-report-says-west-bengal-mla-debendra-roy-died-by-hanging-112868

According to the Vishwa Hindu  Parishad, the embattled Oli appears to have made the statement under the pressure of a foreign power. “It is an unsuccessful attempt to break the unbreakable ties between religious Hindu communities of both the countries,” VHP working  president Alok Kumar said“Ayodhya is the only birth place of Shri Ram. Shri Ram baarat proceeds to Janakpuri from Ayodhya every year. It’s impossible to misguide on the issue,” he said.“Hindu scriptures, janshruti, customs, traditions and history don’t have different views about the Ram Janmbhoomi. Bhagwaan Ram and Bhagwaan Pashupati Nath are the bounding force of Indo-Nepal religious, cultural and spiritual relations. His statement cannot be relied upon by anybody except himself,” the VHP working president said.Several Ayodhya priests and mahants also lashed out at Oli, condemning his statement.Member of Ram Temple Trust Mahant Dinendra Das said: “Lord Ram was born in Ayodhya near Sarayu River. In politics, a person can say anything”.President of Rama Dal Trust Kalki Ram Das Maharaj also condemned the comment.“They used to be a Hindu Rashtra (nation) but now they are working on the behalf of China and Pakistan,” he was quoted as saying.Also condemning Oli, BJP spokesperson Bizay Sonkar Shastri said Left parties in India have always played with people’s faith and Communists in Nepal will be rejected by masses in the same way they have been here.“Lord Ram is a matter of faith for us and people will not allow anybody, be it Prime Minister of Nepal or anyone, to play with this,” he said, responding to the statement by Oli at an event to mark the birth anniversary of Nepalese poet Bhanubhakta in KathmanduOli said that Nepal had “become a victim of cultural encroachment and its history has been manipulated”“Although the real Ayodhya lies at Thori in the west of Birgunj, India has claimed the Indian site as the birthplace of Lord Ram,” he was quoted as saying.“We also believe that deity Sita got married to Prince Ram of India. Actually, Ayodhya is a village lying west of Birgunj,” he said, adding that the marriage between the bride and the groom at such a distance was not possible at the time when there was no communication and transportation system.“The place called Thori, near Birgunj is the real Ayodhya, where Lord Ram was born. In India there is great dispute on Ayodhya. But, there is no dispute in our Ayodhya,” Oli was quoted as saying“Valmiki Ashram is also in Nepal and the holy place where King Dasharath executed rites to get the son is in Ridi, which is in Nepal,” he said.As Dasharath was the ruler of Nepal, it is natural that his son Ram was also born in Nepal, Oli argued.Therefore, real Ayodhya lies in Nepal, he said.Many scientific inventions and knowledge originated in Nepal, but unfortunately such a rich tradition could not continue later, he added according to reports.Oli is under growing pressure to resign amidst a rift in the ruling Nepal Communist Party over his style of functioningHe has also alleged that some of the ruling party leaders are aligning with the southern neighbour to remove him from power after his government issued a new political map incorporating three Indian territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vhp-ayodhya-saints-priests-condemn-nepal-pm-olis-statement-on-ayodhya-claim-hes-under-pressure-112866

I was offered a job to teach preschoolers in 2008 and that was the beginning of my love for re-learning,” she said.In 2015, Lakyntiew took up a distance education course offered by IGNOU after a gap of 26 years to retain her post at SSA School, where she used to teach.“I was happy because mathematics was not included in the IGNOU course,” she said.Education Minister Lahkmen Rymbui congratulated Lakyntiew for her feat despite her age.“Age is not an issue when one is in search of education. Lakyntiew Syiemlieh is an example for everybody and especially those who give up studies midway. I congratulate her and appreciate her hard work and dedication,” Rymbui said.Her story was widely circulated on social media.Lakyntiew said, she has been replying to congratulatory messages on her Facebook page and is busy attending to calls from friends and family members.Radio jockey Desmond Rimaki Sunn posted on his Facebook page, “If you have the will power to succeed, nothing can stop you.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/grandmother-clears-class-12-board-exams-in-meghalaya-112862

One of these is purportedly shot by the MLA himself. It is not clear when the videos were shot.In the video uploaded on social media in the evening, a police inspector is seen taking away keys of his car, with a constable saying “there is a threat”.In one of the video clips that surfaced earlier in the day, the Chorasi MLA, while referring to the current political crisis in the state, was heard saying that he has been “kept like a hostage”.The video was uploaded on rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot’s official WhatsApp group.Roat said he has been at the MLA quarters in Jaipur for the past three days where “many asked him to come along”.The MLA said when he tried to leave for his constituency, three to four police vehicles came there and did not let him go.He is seen alleging that police vehicles surrounded his car and his keys were taken away from him.The MLA also showed two police vehicles parked around his car.The Congress has counted both BTP MLAs as supporters of the Ashok Gehlot government.They had voted for Congress candidates in the Rajya Sabha elections last month but their party issued a whip on Monday, directing them to remain neutral and not vote for the BJP or the Congress in case of a floor test in the assembly.Roat has switched off his mobile phone.

Corona has neither any vaccine nor any medicine,” Modi said in a virtual rally, details of which were shared on his Twitter handle.The move comes close on the heels of recent spike in positive cases which had necessitated lockdowns, imposed by the local administrations, in several districts.Meanwhile, more than 20 people, including four senior office-bearers of the BJP, have tested positive for COVID-19 at the party's headquarters, said its Bihar unit chief Sanjay Jaiswal.Reports in a section of the media here, however, stated that the number of people found infected was as high as 75.Jaiswal, nonetheless, maintained "only 24 samples are positive. These reports are of preliminary rapid tests and we are still awaiting the results of the comprehensive QT-RPR. None of those who have tested positive are having any symptoms. Yet, by way of abundant caution, they have all quarantined themselves at home".He said the samples were collected on Monday upon the request of the party office, after it was learnt that a person who visited the premises recently had tested positive."Samples of 110 people were collected.

14-07-2020||New Delhi||HRD announces guidelines for online classes by schools||The HRD Ministry on Tuesday announced guidelines for online classes by schools and recommended a cap on duration and the number of sessions in a day for students.The guidelines have been framed by the ministry, following concerns raised by  parents about schools conducting online classes like regular schools, which has increased children’s screen time after the COVID-19 pandemic mandated a shift from classroom teaching to online learning as schools continue to remain shut for over four months.In the guideline called “Pragyata”, the Ministry of Human Resource Development  (MHRD) has recommended that the duration for online classes for pre-primary students should not be for more than 30 minutes.For classes 1 to 8, the HRD Ministry has recommended two online sessions of up to 45 minutes each while for classes 9 to 12, four sessions of 30-45 minutes duration have been recommended.“The COVID-19 pandemic has led to closure of schools and has impacted over 240 million children of the country who are enrolled in schools. Extended school closures may cause loss of learning.“To mitigate the impact of the pandemic, schools will not only have to remodel and reimagine the way teaching and learning have happened so far, but will also need to introduce a suitable method of delivering quality education through a healthy mix of schooling at home and schooling at school,” HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ said.He said the guidelines have been made with a focus on online education for students who are at home.“The guidelines have been developed from the perspective of learners, with a focus on online, blended, digital education for students who are presently at home due to the lockdown. These guidelines on digital education provide a roadmap or pointers for carrying forward online education to enhance the quality of education,” Nishank added.Universities and schools across the country have been shut since March 16, when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak. A nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24, which came into effect the next day.While the government has largely eased restrictions, schools and colleges continue to remain closed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hrd-announces-guidelines-for-online-classes-by-schools-112851

The family had refused to accept the former finance minister’s due pension last year on the grounds of Jaitley’s “philanthropist past”, it added.In a letter written to the chairman of the Rajya Sabha and also marked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, late Jaitley’s wife had said that the pension due “be offered to Class IV Rajya Sabha staff”.The late BJP leader succumbed to his ailments on August 24, 2019, at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) following a prolonged illness.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rs-secretariat-launches-employee-welfare-scheme-named-after-arun-jaitley-112847
14-07-2020||New Delhi||Abide by army’s mandate, delete your FB account: HC to Lt Col||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday declined to grant any interim relief to a senior army officer, who has challenged the Indian Army’s recent policy banning armed forces personnel from using social networking platforms like Facebook and Instagram, saying he has to either abide by the mandate of the organisation or put in his papers.The high court said he has a choice to make and asked him to delete his FB account as the policy to ban the use of social networking platforms for army personnel was taken keeping in view the security of the nation.It said he can create a new social media account later.A bench of Justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Asha Menon said that when it has not even found a reason yet to entertain the plea, “the question of granting any interim relief does not arise.“Especially when the matter has the potential of concerning the safety and security of the country,” the bench said.Lieutenant Colonel P K Choudhary contended that once deleted all the data, contacts and friends in his FB account would be “irretrievably lost” and the loss would be “irreversible”.“No. No. Sorry. You please delete it. You can always create a new one. It cannot work like this. You are part of an organisation. You have to abide by its mandate,” the bench said.It further said, “If you are so dear to FB, then put in your papers. See you have to make a choice, what do you want to do. You have other choices which are also irreversible.”The army officer had sought an interim relief that he be allowed to retain his Facebook (FB) account in deactivated form till the next date of hearing when the court will decide whether to entertain his petition after going through the Army’s policy under challenge.According to the new June 6 policy, all Indian Army personnel have been ordered to delete their accounts from Facebook and Instagram and 87 other applications. The counsel for the army officer said the only choice he has is whether to face departmental action for not deleting the account.The officer’s lawyer repeatedly urged the bench to allow him to retain the account in deactivated form, saying forcing him to delete it and the data therein amounts to violation of his right to privacy.The Centre, represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma, told the court that the policy decision was taken as “we found that Facebook was a bug. It was infiltrating as a cyber warfare and there were so many instances of personnel being targeted”.Sharma also said the petitioner’s grievance was that he needs FB to communicate with his family in the US, when there were other modes of communication like WhatsApp, Twitter and Skype which were available to him.After hearing him for some time, the bench said it finds no ground to grant the interim relief.It asked the ASG to file the policy document in a sealed cover for perusal by the bench and said the reasons for taking the decision be also filed.With the direction, the court listed the matter for hearing on July 21.The petition has sought a direction to the Director General of Military Intelligence to withdraw its June 6 policy to the extent that it orders all the members of the Indian Army to delete their accounts from Facebook and Instagram and 87 other applications. Lt Col P K Choudhary, who is currently posted in Jammu and Kashmir, said in the plea that he is an active user of Facebook and uses the platform to connect with his friends and family as most of them are settled abroad, including his elder daughter.In the petition, the officer has sought a direction to the Ministry of Defence to withdraw the June 6 policy to ensure that the fundamental rights of armed forces personnel are not abrogated amended or modified by arbitrary executive action which is not backed by the mandate of law, offends the provisions of the Army Act and Rules made thereunder and is unconstitutional.The petition has alleged that the policy which bans social media platforms is illegal, arbitrary, disproportionate, violates the fundamental rights of soldiers including but not limited to the freedom of speech and expression, the right to life and the right to privacy.     It has said the authorities have cited security concerns and risk of data breach as the basis of imposing the restrictions contained in the policy regarding usage of social media platforms but the act of banning it is a clear violation of Article 14 (Equality before law) of the Constitution. The plea also seeks a declaration that the Director General of Military Intelligence is not empowered under the Constitution or under any other law to modify, amend or abrogate the fundamental rights of the petitioner and other members of the armed forces.Besides, the Centre and Director General of Military Intelligence, the petition has also made Chief of the Army Staff, who is the professional head, commander and the highest-ranking military officer of the Indian Army, party to the petition. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/abide-by-armys-mandate-delete-your-fb-account-hc-to-lt-col-112843
14-07-2020||New Delhi||NIA arrests one in People’s Liberation Front terror funding case||The anti-terror probe agency National Investigation Agency said on Tuesday it has arrested Fuleshwar Gope, a resident of Gumla District in Jharkhand, in connection with a terror funding case involving People’s Liberation Front of India (PLFI).The NIA officials said the suspects were produced before a special court in Ranchi, which remanded him to NIA’s custody for four days.They said the NIA took up the investigation into the case from Jharkhand Police, which had registered an FIR under various sections of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the Indian Penal Code and Criminal Law Amendment Act.The state police registered the case after seizure of Rs.25.38 lakh belonging to PLFI chief Dinesh Gope and was about to be deposited in one of the branches of the State Bank of India (SBI) in Ranchi in November 2016. The state police had then arrested four accused persons and a charge-sheeted was filed on January 1, 2017, the officials said.The NIA took up the case a year later in January 2018 and had arrested six more accused persons involved in the case.“Further investigation revealed that Fuleshwar had conspired with main accused Dinesh and formed a dubious company namely, M/s Shiv Shaktisamridhhi Infra Pvt. Ltd, in partnership with Hira Devi (first wife of Dinesh), for channelling the extorted levy amount into legitimate means by depositing it in the bank account of the dubious business entity,” a senior agency official said, adding that the profit earned by the said company was intended to be used for furtherance of PLFI’s insurgent activities.PLFI, a Maoist splinter group, is a banned organisation in India.  Earlier during the course of investigation the NIA had conducted searches and seized properties worth Rs 90 lakh and other incriminating documents. A little later Hira Devi and Sakuntala Kumari---both wives of Dinesh---were arrested and two other associates Jaiprakash Singh Bhuiya and Amit Deswal were also arrested.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-arrests-one-in-peoples-liberation-front-terror-funding-case-112839

India supplies 60 per cent of world vaccine requirements. Bhargava said India’s two indigenous vaccine candidates are on phase one and two human trial stage and will be tested on 1,000 human volunteers each.Health Ministry OSD Rajesh Bhushan today also said the rate of growth of active cases was on a progressive decline from 31 per cent in March to 9 per cent in May to 4.82 per cent in May end go 3.24 per cent on July 12.“In March active cases were far higher than the recovered. But now we have 5,71,459 recoveries as against 3,11,565 active cases,” said Bhushan, adding that the disease spread was not uniform nor do absolute number of cases tell the real story of disease management in a country like India with the second highest population in the world.Declining rate of daily growth in cases is an important indicator of nation’s response to the outbreak, Bhushan said.He also said 20 states had recovery rates higher than India’s average of 63.02 per cent and 22 states were testing more than 140 persons per day per million which is the threshold for comprehensive testing as mentioned by the WHO in case of India.“We have urged every state to test more than 140 people per day per 10 lakh people, Bhushan said. India’s average testing is 201 per day per million,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/86-pc-covid-cases-in-10-states-half-in-maharashtra-tamil-nadu-112837

These reports are of preliminary rapid tests and we are still awaiting the results of the comprehensive QT-RPR. None of those who have tested positive are having any symptoms. Yet, by way of abundant caution, they have all quarantined themselves at home”.He said the samples were collected on Monday upon the request of the party office, after it was learnt that a person who visited the premises recently had tested positive.“Samples of 110 people were collected. These included not just party functionaries but all other staff members hired for running errands,” he said.Although Jaiswal did not disclose how many party functionaries were among those who tested positive, BJP spokesman Nikhil Anand confirmed these included “four office-bearers”.Party sources said the office-bearers were state vice-presidents Radhan Mohan Sharma and Rajesh Sharma, state general secretary Devesh Kumar and state general secretary (organisation) Nagendra.The party office premises situated on the Bir Chand Patel Marg were, meanwhile, being thoroughly sanitised.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav took potshots at the saffron party, saying “their office has become a corona hotspot and they are busy conducting virtual rallies and spreading infections thereby”.“I wonder to which jamaat (creed) these BJP leaders belong,” Yadav quipped, the pun alluding to the infamous Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi.However, Jaiswal rubbished the allegation and asserted that no crowds gather at the party office during the virtual rallies.“All senior leaders address these through Internet from their homes.

The two sides will also resume their dialogue on human rights, which could stave off criticism of India’s actions in Kashmir.The India-EU virtual summit will be Brussels fourth such endeavour having held similar interactions recently with Japan, China and South Korea.India has signed 15 civil nuclear agreements that vary in letter and spirit but the very fact of their inking after more than a decade of negotiations is seen as a diplomatic initiative indicating a great degree of trust among the signatories. The India-EU nuclear pact will be research oriented in areas such as medicine, water and environment. Despite outlining commonalities in Indian and EU values, including democracy and rule of law, EU officials were scathing in their criticism of Indian approach towards trade and investment. The EU officials were even handed in their stance on the India-China clashes in the line of actual control (LAC) and advocated dialogue to arrive at a peaceful settlement.Officials said they were not even close to a free trade agreement with India because of its protectionist stance on tariffs and the opening of service sectors. In fact the wide divergence in their positions and the plethora of non-tariff barriers imposed by India had discouraged the EU from considering an early harvest of low hanging fruits in the trade arena.“The EU wants to see a far reaching agreement that should be win-win for both sides. We should focus not only narrowly on low hanging fruits but to bring the relationship to a new level,” said another EU official.The EU has proposed an investment protection agreement as the first step but has not received any response so far from New Delhi. Instead, the EU is proposing a high level trade dialogue mechanism to explore the prospects of a trade pact at the political level.The EU was unimpressed by India’s model bilateral investment treaty because its remedy for disputes is local courts “is not something we are looking favourably at,” said officials who added India’s scrapping of previous investment treaties was “not the right signal” for its companies.On the China-India clash, officials said they were encouraged by the desire of both sides to settle their differences peacefully, through dialogue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-eu-ink-civil-nuclear-pact-on-eve-of-bilateral-summit-112828

It had done so in the December 2019 Hyderabad encounter case.However, it said it was not inclined to monitor any probe.On behalf of the Uttar Pradesh Government, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said he would not take an adversarial stand.There are several petitions filed on the issue, including the one by an Uttar Pradesh Police officer arrested for allegedly leaking information about a raid to nab gangster Vikas Dubey.Inspector KK Sharma has moved the Supreme Court seeking protection after encounter killing of Dubey and his associates.In a petition filed through his wife Vinita Sirohi, Sharma expressed apprehension that he might be eliminated through “illegal and unconstitutional means”.Sharma and three other cops were suspended on July 5 for their alleged involvement in giving a tipoff to Dubey about the police raid on July 3.Eight policemen, including DSP Devendra Mishra, were ambushed and killed in Bikru village in Chaubeypur area of Kanpur on their way to arrest Dubey. Dubey was killed last Friday in an encounter after a police vehicle carrying him from Ujjain to Kanpur allegedly met with an accident and he tried to flee.Questioning the police version about leaking information, Sharma, currently in jail, asserted he was directed by his in-charge Vinay Tiwari, Station Officer of the Chaubeypur police station, to remain at the police station.People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) has also filed a plea seeking a Special Investigation Team (SIT) monitored probe into the killings of Dubey and his associates.PUCL filed an application in a petition already filed by it in 2018 that questioned police encounters in Uttar Pradesh between January 2017 and March 2018.Now it wants a probe into the encounter killing of Dubey and his associates Amar Dubey and Prabhat Mishra as also the criminal-political nexus in Uttar Pradesh.The third petition is by advocate Ghanshyam Upadhyay who moves top court hours before Dubey was killed in an encounter. He had sought a direction to UP Government to ensure the gangster’s safety as he apprehended cops might kill him.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-seeks-up-govts-response-on-pleas-for-sit-probe-into-vikas-dubeys-encounter-killing-112827

It is full of brilliant passages describing the bio-diversity that surrounds Ram and the other characters during their life in the forest,” he said.                 “Based on the unique concept of recreating for visitors diverse forest ambiences through which Lord Ram passed during his exile beginning from Ayodhya and culminating in Sri Lanka, the garden is the first of its kind in the country,” Chaturvedi said.       30 important trees, herbs and shrubs mentioned in the Aranya-Kand of Valmiki Ramayana including Seeta Ashok, Chandan, Raktchandan, Brahmi, Jeevanti, Tulsi, Saal, Sagaun,Maulshri, Peepal, Sadan, Nagkesar etc,” he said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/thematic-garden-inspired-by-rams-14-year-vanvas%C2%A0developed-in-haldwani-112818

Sachin should immediately join BJP in national interest. Another example of Rahul Gandhi’s arrogance and lack of leadership,” said Joshi, BJP’s Prayagraj MP who dumped the Congress in favaour of the saffron party in 2016. Another recognized Congress leader insulted.Sachin shud immediately join BJP in National interest.Another example of Rahul Gandhi's arrogance and lack of leadership@Sachin Pilot@ANI  In the past couple of years several senior Congress leaders have switched sides, most recent being Jyotiraditya Scindia whose exit from the grand old party in March resulted in the fall of the Kamal Nath government and return of the BJP in Madhya Pradesh. Whether Rajasthan is headed the same way as MP and before that Karnataka remains to be seen but political observers say indications are all there. “The BJP is a fierce adversary and is unlikely to let go of the golden opportunity,” they say.   While central leaders are holding meetings and are also in touch with “rebels”, sources say the BJP’s Rajasthan unit also held a meeting to strategise and discuss possibilities emerging out of today’s developments in the Congress. Rajasthan BJP chief Satish Poonia said the party will be happy if Pilot joins the party but final decision was with the central leadership.Meanwhile, senior BJP leader and former chief minister Vasundhara Raje is also expected to be in Jaipur tomorrow. The BJP says the Gehlot government is now in a minority and will fall soon. “We are not demanding a floor test but they have lost the confidence of the people and should step down themselves,” Poonia was quoted as saying in reference to Pilot’s claim that he has the support of 30 MLAs. A lot also depends upon how many Congress MLAs stand in support of Pilot. Reacting to the replay of the MP political drama in Rajasthan and earlier Karnataka, Scindia had said: “Sad to see my erstwhile colleague, @SachinPilot too, being sidelined and persecuted by Rajasthan CM, @ashokgehlot51.

Gen. Harinder Singh, whose troops guard LAC along with ITBP in Ladakh, and his Chinese counterpart Major General Liu Lin to find out an early and everlasting solution to the face-off that had started with fisticuffs on May 5, and then assumed a deadly shape in Galwan Valley on June 16. Twenty Indian soldiers, including a commanding officer, were killed, while Chinese are quiet about the number of casualties.Picking up threads from their last meeting on June 30 in which, according to Chinese foreign ministry,  a consensus to  resolve the issues amicably  was reached, The China, however, had continued to accuse India of engineering the Galwan Valley clash. Things were smoothened on July 5 when the special representatives on border question , National Security Advisor  Ajit Doval and Chinese Foreign minister held a video-conference dialogue, in which the two sides agreed to withdraw the troops to maintain “peace and tranquillity” on the borders.A week after the withdrawal process started, the Indian and Chinese sides exchanged their notes about the withdrawal and the positions where they were stationed. It was not a buffer zone but an arrangement that has to be stretched further to the mutual satisfaction of both the sides.The areas that were under scanner on both sides were Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso, Hot Springs  where the standoff position has not diluted much  and the need was felt that there should be early progress to ease the tensions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/corps-commander-level-talks-continue-even-after-11-hours-outcome-caught-in-wrangles-112808
14-07-2020||New Delhi||Rajasthan Congress developments echo in national political landscape||The infighting in the Congress in Rajasthan has cast doubt on the longevity of the party in the national political landscape.The development in the state has discomfited the opposition parties at the Centre who apprehend that it could give momentum to the BJP in upcoming assembly elections in some states.The Congress is the largest opposition party at the Centre and has a promise to act as a sheet-anchor against the BJP.But its house being disorder presents bad optics, and a general sense of losing out to the BJP in the war of perception, besides weakening the united fight against the BJP.The Congress lost its government, and a young star in Jyotiraditya Scindia, to BJP in Madhya Pradesh when 22 of its MLAs under his leadership deserted it.They raised rebellion to the kill against the Congress leadership.The present Congress crisis in Rajasthan has struck the opposition parties with a sense of deja vu. With internecine struggle in the organisation, the suspense on the stability of the government would remain.Reports say that Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government hangs the by skin of its teeth with state party president and Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot raising a banner of revolt against the Chief Minister and the party’s central leadership.Pilot, youth Congress, and MLAs supporting him have camped in a hotel in Manesar in Haryana holding the red flag in defiance against Central leadership.Sources said the possibility of these Congress MLAs petitioning to the Haryana Police to ensure their safety can not be ruled out in case they get a sense that a desperate Gehlot government and the Congress would adopt to “cut and thrust” approach to holler them back to the stable.These developments have miffed the section of opposition parties.A slew of Assembly elections, starting with JDU-BJP-LJP ruled the state of Bihar in October-November, are slated in the immediate future.Bihar would be followed by elections in TMC-ruled state of West-Bengal, BJP-ruled state of Assam, the Left-ruled state of Kerala and AIADMK-ruled Tamil Nadu middle of next year.The Left, which has two MLAs( CPI-M) in Rajasthan, and which supports the government, is visibly upset at the development in the state.CPI chief D Raja minced no words saying that the Congress should set its house in order, and manage its affairs in a better way.“The fiasco in Madhya Pradesh followed by avoidable situation in Rajasthan has the potential to give BJP an advantage in Bihar and West Bengal,” Raja said, and added that the BJP is a “past master in fishing in troubled waters and horse-trading.”Raja said efforts to should be made to strengthen the arc of opposition against the BJP.AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Gupta said that the Congress leadership should be more accessible and in tune with its leaders.“Developments like Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh do weaken the opposition’s strength at the Centre,” Gupta added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-congress-developments-echo-in-national-political-landscape-112806
14-07-2020||New Delhi||Railways float fresh tender for coronavirus surveillance cameras||The Railways on Tuesday floated a fresh tender for coronavirus surveillance thermal cameras, removing a provision that led to Indian firms alleging that it favoured a Chinese firm while making it mandatory for vendors to list the country of origin of each item.RailTel, a Railway PSU had floated the tender last month for AI-based surveillance cameras that measure body temperatures of individuals and even detects whether a person is wearing a mask or not. This tender was scrapped two weeks back after receiving feedback from vendors that specifications mentioned for the procurement of the equipment may have favoured a Chinese company.Indian vendors, in letters to RailTel, raised concerns that the specifications mentioned in the tender favoured Chinese company Hikvision, one of the world's largest video surveillance companies which currently dominates India's CCTV market.They said the technology—DeepInMind—which is part of the specification for the cameras and mentioned in the tender document, is a proprietary feature of Hikvision.The new tender has done away with this technology as a requirement, but retained other significant specification of the blackbody temperature—the ability of the cameras to accurately measure temperatures emitted by a person to say whether a person has fever or not.Additionally, it has asked vendors to name the origin country of all equipment that they supply. "Bidder shall mention country of manufacturing against each item in SOR (schedule of requirement). In case country of manufacturing is not mentioned by the bidder, RailTel Reserves the right to reject his offer. Moreover, GoI's Present as well as Future Guideline regarding foreign country material will be applicable," the new tender documents said. The PSU has also listed features of the cameras to include software with simultaneous temperature screening for multiple persons with alarm(indoor), contact-free mask detection, alarms on people without masks, identity verification and stranger alarm, that is confirming identity, even with mask.Over the last few weeks, the Railways has had to deal with issues related to involvement of Chinese firms in tenders floated by the national transporter which comes after a violent face-off between India and China in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh last month.Following a standoff with the neighbouring country, the national transporter had cancelled a Rs 471-crore signalling and telecommunication work for a stretch of 417-km on the Kanpur-Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) section by a Chinese company. A Chinese JV has also emerged as one of the bidders for a tender floated for manufacturing 44 Train 18 sets.

14-07-2020||United Nations||Number of undernourished people declines in India; obesity in adults on the rise: UN||The number of undernourished people in India has declined by 60 million in over a decade, according to a UN report which said that there were less stunted children but more obese adults in the country.The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report, released on Monday, estimated that almost 690 million people globally were undernourished (or hungry) in 2019, up by 10 million from 2018.The report—considered the most authoritative global study tracking progress towards ending hunger and malnutrition—said that the number of undernourished people in India declined from 249.4 million in 2004–06 to 189.2 million in 2017–19.In percentage terms, the prevalence of undernourishment in the total population in India declined from 21.7 per cent in 2004-06 to 14 per cent in 2017-19, it said.“The two subregions showing reductions in undernourishment—eastern and southern Asia—are dominated by the two largest economies of the continent—China and India.“Despite very different conditions, histories and rates of progress, the reduction in hunger in both the countries stems from long-term economic growth, reduced inequality, and improved access to basic goods and services,” it said.The report is prepared jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).It further said that the prevalence of stunting in children under 5 years of age in India declined from 47.8 per cent in 2012 to 34.7 per cent in 2019 or from 62 million in 2012 to 40.3 million in 2019.More Indian adults became obese between 2012-16, the report said.The number of adults (18 years and older) who are obese grew from 25.2 million in 2012 to 34.3 million in 2016, growing from 3.1 per cent to 3.9 per cent.The number of women of reproductive age (15–49) affected by anaemia grew from 165.6 million in 2012 to 175.6 million in 2016.The number of infants 0–5 months of age exclusively breastfed grew from 11.2 million in 2012 to 13.9 million in 2019.The hungry are most numerous in Asia, but expanding fastest in Africa.Across the planet, the report forecasts, that the COVID-19 pandemic could push over 130 million more people into chronic hunger by the end of 2020.  In percentage terms, Africa is the hardest hit region and becoming more so, with 19.1 per cent of its people undernourished.At the current trends, by 2030, Africa will be home to more than half of the world's chronically hungry.The COVID-19 is intensifying the vulnerabilities and inadequacies of global food systems - understood as all the activities and processes affecting the production, distribution and consumption of food.“While it is too soon to assess the full impact of the lockdowns and other containment measures, the report estimates that at a minimum, another 83 million people, and possibly as many as 132 million, may go hungry in 2020 as a result of the economic recession triggered by COVID-19,” it said, adding that the setback throws into further doubt the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal two, whose target is achieving zero hunger.The latest estimates are that a staggering three billion people or more cannot afford a healthy diet.In sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, this is the case for 57 per cent of the population - though no region, including north America and Europe, is spared.In 2019, 191 million children under five were stunted or wasted - too short or too thin. Another 38 million under-fives were overweight.Among adults, meanwhile, obesity has become a global pandemic in its own right.The study calls on the governments to mainstream nutrition in their approaches to agriculture; work to cut cost-escalating factors in the production, storage, transport, distribution and marketing of food - including by reducing inefficiencies and food loss and waste.It also urges them to support local small-scale producers to grow and sell more nutritious foods, and secure their access to markets; prioritise children's nutrition as the category in greatest need; foster behaviour change through education and communication; and embed nutrition in national social protection systems and investment strategies.The report noted that generally, cash transfer programmes are considered an appropriate instrument to increase dietary diversity in well-connected urban or rural contexts, while in-kind transfers are more appropriate for remote areas, where access to markets is severely limited.“In India, for instance, the country's Targeted Public Distribution System represents the largest social protection programme in the world, reaching 800 million people with subsidised cereals that can be purchased from more than 500,000 fair price shops across the country.” In India, rural business hubs have facilitated linking smallholder farmers to rapidly growing urban markets.Apart from procuring food products from the farmers, these hubs provide services such as farm inputs and equipment, as well as access to credit.Having food processing, packaging and cooling facilities at the same location allows consumers to benefit from economies of agglomeration and, on the whole, reduce transaction costs throughout the food supply chain.This model in India has given rise to rural supermarkets that provide cheaper staple food, it added.

14-07-2020||Mumbai||Mahesh Bhatt's daughter Shaheen exposes rape, death threats; to take legal action||Actress Alia Bhatt's sister Shaheen has shared screenshots on Instagram of hate messages and rape threats that she has been getting from unknown people. Shaheen has also warned of legal action against her abusers.Sharing the screenshots, Shaheen wrote: "Does this surprise you? Why? It doesn't surprise me." "So, I speak now to those of you who think it's okay to send me or anyone messages full of hate: If you send me a message with the sole hope (I say hope because I promise you -- nothing you say is keeping me up at night) of humiliating, insulting, or bullying me, then the following things will happen: -- The messages or comments will first be blocked and reported to Instagram directly.-- You will forfeit the right to your privacy. I will NOT protect your identity. Every sh**ty message you send me will -- should I choose to -- go up for everyone to see. Abusers are emboldened by their anonymity. I will not help hide you.-- I WILL use all legal recourse available to me to take action. If you think you can't be located because your account is anonymous, please think again.-- IP addresses are easily trackable. You are not invisible. Harassment is a crime."Shaheen's post comes at a time when the Bhatt family—Mahesh Bhatt, his daughters Pooja and Alia Bhatt and mother Soni Razdan—are being targeted with trolls and memes on social media for allegedly practising nepotism in the film industry.The trolling started ever since Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput passed away last month.Social media or anti-social media?Motivated,misguided or inherently miserable people target those they wouldn’t normally have access to & those who dare go against popular opinion,unleashing abuse & threats.Ignoring them fuels their frustration & makes them direct hate elsewhere.In a series of stories posted on Instagram, Shaheen further wrote: "We live in a country that seems to relish nothing more than rendering people powerless. A country that relishes 'putting people in their place' are showing them their 'aukad'.""A country where rather than being raised on empathy, most people are raised with explicit permission to hate. A country where a woman is either your mother, your sister, your wife or a wh**e. A country where not just men, but women feel like the worst thing you can call another woman is a s**t." "Because what better way to render a woman powerless than to make her ashamed of being a woman. Ashamed of being herself. Because if she weren't a woman would she still be debased, humiliated and threatened with violence and violation every day?" "Would she so casually be robbed of her security and sense of agency? You see. It's genius. You abuse her. Yet, you try to convince her the problem is her. Not you.""I wondered for days whether or not this was something I should address. I debated whether it was worth the effort it would take because ugh, why waste time and even 1 per cent of mental processor power on this." "But then I realised, if I believe that the world should be a place in which women can feel safe and exist without being constantly threatened, sexualised or subjected sexist/misogynistic slurs with the sole intent to humiliate them - if I believe women should be treated like HUMANS.""Then that's a world I have to help create. And in order to create that world I have to draw boundaries in my own life and pursue action no matter how annoying or time consuming or downright sad it is." The author also addressed Instagram in her story and wrote: "To Instagram- you have zero tolerance policies for a lot of the content that people put up on your platform - I think it's fair to say that misogynistic slurs, intended to subdue and oppress *should* fall under the umbrella of your zero tolerance community guidelines.-- But if you don't want to receive abusive message turn off your message requests.' -- Tired of being called a b*tch in your comments? Turn off your comments.' "Asking me to change the way I use a platform because of someone else's hatred and misogyny is the equivalent of telling me that if I go out at night and get assaulted 'I was asking for it'. I should not have to change the way I use a platform if someone is being abusive. They should. Full stop." — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mahesh-bhatts-daughter-shaheen-exposes-rape-death-threats-to-take-legal-action-112786

As the criminals were firing from the rooftop, we could not see them," he said.The team from three police stations -- Bithoor, Bilhaur and Chaubeypur -- which went to conduct the raid consisted of about 35 police personnel, he said.Contrary to the earlier assertion that the power supply to the village had been disconnected before the police team reached Bikru, Kaushalendra Pratap Singh said, "When we reached Bikru village, lights were on and the criminals on the terrace easily spotted the locations of police personnel and took position accordingly. Soon after, the village plunged into darkness owing to a power cut." He said that suspended SO Chaubeypur Vinay Tiwari disappeared when the criminals started firing indiscriminately.The Special Investigation Team (SIT) and the judicial commission headed by Justice Shashikant Agarwal (retired) are visiting Bikru village to record statements of the local people and police about the July 3 massacre and the events prior to the incident.

But Sunday saw quite a few of them joining hundreds of Indians, literally hand in hand, in a protest organised outside the Chinese Embassy in London.Arif Aajakia, a Pakistani human rights activist who believes in speaking "bitter and naked truth" about his country, shouted "boycott China" and "down with China" along with the members of several Indian diaspora groups protesting against China's expansionist policies."Today was also the first time in my life that I sang Vande Mataram," said Aajakia.1st time in my life, part of Bhaarti National antheme & Vande Maatram.. pic.twitter.com/xr4Sv5ygULJoining him also was Amjad Ayub Mirza, who hails from Mirpur in Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK), a few others from Karachi and many from Iran, all pretty upset with China meddling in their affairs too.Down with China! Boycott China!#ExpansionistChina pic.twitter.com/JaCyHsn1RU  "I have travelled all the way from Glasgow for this protest. I am from PoK, an Indian living under Pakistani occupation.The Chinese are wreaking havoc across Gilgit-Baltistan through CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) and the Pakistani government continues to work hand in glove with them," said Mirza, who has been quite vocal against oppression and injustice meted out to the people of PoK by Pakistani authorities.The Indians, who've organised similar protests against China in the US, Canada and other parts of the world, carried posters and placards against Chinese President Xi Jinping, asking him to control his over-ambitious power play.The growing outrage against China is quite visible on the streets of London too. In fact, Saturday night saw an image reading 'Free Tibet, Free Hong Kong, Free Uyghurs' projected onto the Chinese Embassy building in central London.With the US sanctioning the Chinese government and its officials for their connection to serious human rights abuse against ethnic Uyghur Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, the world condemning China's 'brutal, sweeping crackdown' against Hong Kong's people, Indians boycotting Chinese products after People's Liberation Army intruded the Indian territory and killed Indian soldiers in Ladakh's Galwan Valley and countries from Japan till Australia up against the dragon, the noose is gradually tightening around the authoritarian regime.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/watch-pakistanis-sing-vande-mataram-with-indians-in-london-protest-against-china-112780
14-07-2020||Kathmandu||PM Oli says 'real' Ayodhya is in Nepal and Lord Ram is Nepali; BJP rejects claim||Stoking a potential controversy, embattled Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli on Monday claimed that the "real" Ayodhya lies in Nepal, not in India and that Lord Ram was born in Thori in southern Nepal.Condemning Oli for his remarks, BJP national spokesperson Bizay Sonkar Shastri said that the Left parties even in India played with people's faith, and the Communists in Nepal will be rejected by the masses in the same way they have been here."Lord Ram is a matter of faith for us, and people will not allow anybody, be it prime minister of Nepal or anyone, to play with this," he said in New Delhi. Speaking at an event on the birth anniversary of Nepalese poet Bhanubhakta at the Prime Minister's residence in Kathmandu, Oli said that Nepal "has become a victim of cultural encroachment and its history has been manipulated."Bhanubhakta was born in 1814 in Tanhu of western Nepal and is credited for translating Valmiki's Ramayan into Nepali language. He died in 1868."Although the real Ayodhya lies at Thori in the west of Birgunj, India has claimed the Indian site as the birthplace of Lord Ram,” Oli said. “We also believe that deity Sita got married to Prince Ram of India. Actually, Ayodhya is a village lying west of Birgunj,” he said, adding that the marriage between bride and bridegroom at such a distance was not possible at the time when there was no communication and transportation system."The place called Thori, near Birgunj is the real Ayodhya, where Lord Ram was born. In India there is great dispute on Ayodhya. But, there is no dispute in our Ayodhya," Prime Minister Oli was quoted as saying by his press advisor Surya Thapa. “Valmiki Ashram is also in Nepal and the holy place where King Dasharath had executed the rites to get the son is in Ridi, which is in Nepal,” he said.As Dasharath was the ruler of Nepal, it is natural that his son Ram was also born in Nepal, Oli argued. Therefore, real Ayodhya lies in Nepal, he claimed.Many scientific inventions and knowledge originated in Nepal, but unfortunately such a rich tradition could not continue later, Oli said.Prime Minister Oli, under growing pressure to resign amidst a rift in the ruling Nepal Communist Party over his style of functioning, has alleged that some of the ruling party leaders are aligning with the southern neighbour to remove him from power after his government issued a new political map incorporating three Indian territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura. His allegations have been criticised by senior NCP leaders, including former prime minister 'Prachanda', who demanded Prime Minister Oli's resignation, saying his recent anti-India remarks were "neither politically correct nor diplomatically appropriate."             The India-Nepal bilateral ties came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.Later, Nepal updated the country's political map through a Constitutional amendment, incorporating three strategically important Indian areas.India termed as "untenable" the "artificial enlargement" of the territorial claims by Nepal. India has handed over a diplomatic note to Nepal over the map issue, Nepalese media reports said.

The Congress has decided to immediately divest Sachin Pilot of his role as deputy CM and state party chief and state ministers Ramesh Meena and Vishvendra Singh are also relieved of their ministerial responsibilities forthwith,” Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said with the divorce between the Congress and Pilot complete.Also read: Another recognised Congress leader insulted, Pilot should join BJP immediately: Rita Bahuguna JoshiThe Congress has appointed Rajasthan education minister Govind Dotasra as the new state Congress president.Action against Pilot and his supporting ministers came a day after the CLP resolution demanded strict disciplinary proceedings against “any office bearers or CLP members who work to weaken the party and its government.”The resolution was passed parallel to Congress claims that top party leaders, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra, spoke to Pilot several times Monday and asked him to return and resolve internal differences internally.Also read: Rajasthan Congress developments echo in national political landscape“The Congress gave Sachin Pilot a lot of political heft even while he was young. He was made a minister at the centre in his 30s, a state unit chief and then the Deputy CM when he was just 40. Doors for him were always kept open. The fact that he was repeatedly backed by the party meant he enjoyed the affections of both top leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. But Sachin Pilot and his supporters have preferred to fall into the trap laid by the BJP,” said Surjewala even as Gehlot met state governor today show he has the numbers.All eyes are now on Pilot who may open his cards finally with no moral pressure left or quitting the Congress.He is now free to make his moves.सत्य को परेशान किया जा सकता है पराजित नहीं।||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-sacks-sachin-pilot-as-rajasthan-state-chief-deputy-cm-112774

Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan today allocated portfolios to new ministers in his Cabinet wherein many Scindia loyalists were given key departments.Chouhan owes his fourth record term as Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister to Scindia whose exit from the Congress in March marked the end of the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government in the state. Of 22 MLAs who walked out with him, 14 have been adjusted in the council of ministers.Interestingly, after he managed to get his loyalists included in the council despite Chouhan’s reservations, Scindia had used popular Hindi film title “Tiger Zinda Hai” to deliver a sharp message to his former colleagues, Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh, accusing them of trying to denigrate him.Many of those inducted from the Scindia camp are not MLAs as they had resigned from the Assembly in March and will now be contesting the bypoll. This is the first time in the political history of the state that so many non-members made it to the council of ministers and power corridors are buzzing with speculations of “scaling down” or “weakening” of the position of Chouhan.Apparently, the BJP hopefuls who will now not be given a ticket in the upcoming bypoll are also upset over new power equations in the state with some openly cautioning against the perils of ignoring the “real cadre” of the party at the cost of “outsiders”.14 of 22 make it to Cabinet||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/scindia-loyalists-get-key-ministries-in-mp-112660

The Congress for its part spoke in contradictory voices on Pilot.CLP resolution seeks action against rebelsOn the one hand, party observer Randeep Surjewala appealed to the rebel Deputy CM and his supporters to return and open a dialogue with the leadership, on the other the CLP resolution targeted Pilot without naming him. Even as Gehlot herded Congress MLAs to a resort near Jaipur after the CLP meeting today, the Pilot camp continued to contest the CM’s claims on having the majority and dared him to take the lawmakers to the Governor instead of a hotel. Leaders close to Pilot maintained the support of at least 20 MLAs in the Assembly, where the Congress has 107 MLAs at present plus the support of allies and Independents, taking its tally to 122. A simple majority in the Rajasthan Assembly is 101 in a House of 200.The Congress, meanwhile, worked all day to open channels of communication with Pilot, starting with Surjewala asking the rebel leader to attend the CLP meeting and saying Congress chief Sonia Gandhi’s “doors are open” for him.“Families have differences, but these differences must be resolved internally,” said Surjewala to Pilot, adding that personal ambitions are not larger than the state’s interest.Although Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and P Chidambaram are learnt to have spoken to Pilot, the latter's camp denied so. Congress sources were still trying to win Pilot back until tonight and felt he had overestimated his strength. There was also talk that Pilot had yesterday met BJP’s Om Mathur with Jyotiraditya Scindia although the Pilot camp denied plans of joining the BJP.Pilot’s future moves would depend on his bargaining power with the BJP in terms of the party MLAs he can wean away. He may be mulling forming his own party, said Congress leaders. Meanwhile, the Congress has called a meeting of its MLAs tomorrow.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gehlot-herds-mlas-to-resort-pilot-rebuffs-congress-overtures-112643

14-07-2020||KV Prasad||‘Jadugar’ Gehlot blows away desert storm, for now||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 13For the time being, the political storm building up in the desert state of Rajasthan blew away. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot held his fort what with the legislature party backing the veteran Congress leader in this time of crisis.Gehlot, known as “Jadugar” for having learnt the art of magic, demonstrated that majority of the legislators remained on his side, with three central observers, including Rahul Gandhi’s confidante KC Venugopal, pointsman on tricky missions Ajay Maken and chief spokespersons Randeep Surejwala watching over the proceedings. The political tug of war between the Chief Minister and his young deputy Sachin Pilot was the worst kept secret in the Congress. Eager to be at the helm, the young Pilot kept making moves to push the envelope since the Assembly results were out two years ago.Flapping his wing in order to create space for himself in the landscape dotted by Gehlot and his loyalists, ambitious Pilot remained in a unique position of being the Deputy CM and Pradesh Congress Chief, a post he holds for six years.While his hard work in the field did play a role in re-building the fortunes of the party in Rajasthan, where it lost power in 2013, the veteran Gehlot demonstrated he was no pushover when the results were out in 2018 bringing the party back to power.It is easy to characterise the tussle as old guard versus the young leaders and will resurface sooner than later. On one hand Pilot holds a grouse that Gehlot has pushed him to the margins and virtually ignored him and on the other, the young politician feels that it is time he steers the state.The underlying reason for what is playing out in Rajasthan, earlier in Madhya Pradesh or recently in Manipur, is the weak presence of the party central leadership. Ever since Rahul Gandhi walked away from the presidentship after the 2019 Lok Sabha debacle, Sonia Gandhi remains an interim president. Decision appears ad hoc or taken on the need basis.The writ of what was euphemistically described in the Congress as “high command” does not run and given the domineering presence of the BJP as a national political party, the Grand Old Party looks but a pale shadow of an organisation to tackle any internal and external challenge.As Gehlot demonstrates his hold, Pilot would require more dexterous walk on the political minefield for after this attempt to destablise the government, he renders himself vulnerable and open to greater suspicion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jadugar-gehlot-blows-away-desert-storm-for-now-112649

The overall pass percentage for Class XII is 88.78 per cent—5.38 per cent higher than 2019.CA exam cancelledNew Delhi: The ICAI on Monday told the Supreme Court that it had cancelled the May 2020 cycle CA examinations scheduled to be held in July-August in view of the Covid pandemic. The exams will be held along with the November 2020 cycle. TNSIn an important development, the CBSE did not declare any merit list this year and also did not use the term “fail” in its results. The board instead used “essential repeat”. Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas topped among affiliated schools with 98.70 per cent performance followed by Kendriya Vidyalayas at 98.62 per cent, government schools at 94.94 per cent, government aided at 91.56 per cent and independent at 88.22 per cent.‘Essential repeat’ replaces term ‘fail’The CBSE has decided against releasing the merit list and replaced the term “fail” with “essential repeat” because of the exceptional circumstances. Accordingly, the term “fail” will not figure in the result documents.Website crashesStudents had a tough time accessing the board website which crashed within minutes of announcement of the results and was not accessible even hours later.The number of students who scored over 95% this time has doubled compared 2019 when 1.5% managed high scores.This year, 3.24% candidates scored over 95% and 13.24% scored above 90%. These high scores would mean high cut-offs in college admissions.The percentage of students with compartment has reduced from 8.23% last year to 7.35% this time. The CBSE said the schedule for compartment exams would be announced later in consultation with the government.Meanwhile, students spent hours all day trying to access CBSE results after all three websites the board announced for result declarations crashed.The board blamed the NIC for the snag saying results had been sent to schools but the latter couldn’t help students as they were closed due to Covid. Schools didn’t also have advance intimation that the Class XII results would be out today.
