17-07-2020||United Nations||Fury of Covid-19 pandemic provides context for rebirth and reform of UN: PM Modi||The fury of the COVID-19 pandemic provides the context for the “rebirth and reform” of the United Nations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday, calling on nations to pledge to reform the global multilateral system to enhance its relevance and make it the basis of a new type of “human-centric globalisation”.Addressing the high-level segment of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) session via a video link, Modi said the 75th anniversary of the founding of the UN was an opportunity to assess its role and relevance in today’s world.Noting that a lot had changed since its formation, he said the UN now brought together 193 member countries and along with its membership, the expectations from the organisation had also grown.It was the Indian Prime Minister’s first address to the broader UN membership after India was overwhelmingly elected as a non-permanent member of the powerful Security Council last month.“India firmly believes that the path to achieving sustainable peace and prosperity is through multilateralism. As children of planet Earth, we must join hands to address our common challenges and achieve our common goals. However, multilateralism needs to represent the reality of the contemporary world,” Modi said.Addressing the session ‘Multilateralism after COVID-19: what kind of UN do we need at the 75th anniversary?’, he underscored that only “reformed multilateralism” with a reformed United Nations at its centre could meet the aspirations of humanity.“Today, while celebrating 75 years of the United Nations, let us pledge to reform the global multilateral system. To enhance its relevance, to improve its effectiveness, and to make it the basis of a new type of human-centric globalisation. The United Nations was originally born from the furies of the Second World War. Today, the fury of the pandemic provides the context for its rebirth and reform. Let us not lose this chance,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Modi said at the high-level session that India had been elected to the Security Council at this very important time.“With our deep commitment to maintaining global harmony, to improving socio-economic equity, and to preserving nature's balance, India will play its role in full support of the UN agenda,” the Prime Minister said.Modi told said as nations mark the 75th Anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, it was an occasion to recognise the UN’s many contributions to human progress and also an opportunity to assess the UN's role and relevance in today's world and to shape a better future for it.India was among the 50 founding members of the United Nations immediately after the Second World War but a lot has changed since then, he said adding that today the UN brings together 193 member countries.“Along with its membership, the expectations of the organisation have also grown. At the same time multilateralism is facing many challenges today.”The High-Level Segment of ECOSOC comes as the COVID19 pandemic is ravaging the world and causing unprecedented health and economic challenges.Modi said the COVID-19 pandemic has “severely tested” the resilience of all nations. “In India, we have tried to make the fight against the pandemic a people's movement, by combining the efforts of Government and society,” he added.He highlighted that the Indian government had given the highest priority to reach benefits to poor households and announced a package of more than $300 billion.“It will bring the economy back on track, build modern infrastructure and put in place a technology-driven system. We have put forward a vision of ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ a self-reliant and Resilient India, integrated with the global economy.”Modi had earlier delivered the keynote address virtually at the 70th anniversary of the ECOSOC in January 2016. India has had a long tradition of close association with ECOSOC, one of the six main organs of the United Nations. The inaugural Presidency of ECOSOC in 1946 was held by Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar of India.Modi said India contributed to shaping the ECOSOC agenda, including the Sustainable Development Goals and through its domestic efforts, India is again playing a salient role in achieving Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals.“We are also supporting other developing countries in meeting their Sustainable Development Goals. India is home to one-sixth of humanity. We are mindful of our weight and responsibility. We know that if India succeeds in achieving its development objectives, it will go a long way in achievement of global goals,” Modi said.“Our motto is ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas, Sabka Vishwas’, meaning ‘Together, for everyone’s growth, with everyone’s trust,” he said.Modi said in India’s fight against COVID, the grass-roots health system is helping the country ensure one of the best recovery rates in the world.“We are also on track to remove TB by 2025. Other developing countries can learn from the scale and success of India's development programmes. And from the technologies and innovations, we have deployed. It is this realisation that underpins India's own development partnership with the global South.”“Be it earthquakes, cyclones, Ebola crisis or any other natural or man-made crisis, India has responded with speed and solidarity. In our joint fight against COVID, we have extended medical and other assistance to over 150 countries. We also helped create a SAARC COVID emergency fund in our neighbourhood,” he added.

The Yorkshireman became a symbol of British endurance in the face of the adversity of the coronavirus crisis and cheered many with his promise that "the sun will shine again"."I could never have imagined this would happen to me," Moore said in a message posted on Twitter before received the ancient accolade."It is such a huge honour and I am very much looking forward to meeting Her Majesty The Queen. It is going to be the most special of days for me."Moore, who served in India, Burma and Sumatra during World War Two, quipped earlier this year that having a knighthood would be funny because he would be Sir Thomas Moore — a reference to the Tudor statesman Sir Thomas More.The monarch has been sheltering at Windsor Castle, the oldest permanently inhabited castle in the world, since March.Other investitures have been postponed because of the coronavirus and Moore's knighthood was one of the first official duties the Queen has carried out since the coronavirus lockdown.

17-07-2020||New Delhi||Districts in MP, Bihar, Telangana most vulnerable to Covid-19 pandemic: Lancet study||Districts in Madhya Pradesh may be the most vulnerable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by those in Bihar and Telangana, according to a study in The Lancet journal which assessed several key indicators like housing, hygiene, and the health system in these states.According to scientists, including Rajib Acharya from the Population Council, New Delhi, vulnerability in the research means the risk of consequences of infection, including spread, morbidity, mortality, and social and economic effects of the pandemic.The study noted that nine of 30 large states—Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Telangana, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha, and Gujarat—have high vulnerability to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.It rated the vulnerabilities of the states to the pandemic on a scale from zero to one, measured using 15 indicators across five domains—socioeconomic, demographic, housing and hygiene, epidemiological, and health system.“Our index aims to help planners and policy makers effectively prioritise regions for resource allocation and adopt risk mitigation strategies for better preparedness and responses to the COVID-19 epidemic,” the scientists said.In the study, they identified a number of vulnerable districts in India, which currently do not have large numbers of COVID-19 cases but could be strongly impacted by the pandemic.According to the researchers, a number of districts in the nine large states—Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha, and Gujarat—located in every region of the country except the northeast, had high overall vulnerability.They said these states also had high vulnerability with respect to most of the five domains.Madhya Pradesh had an overall vulnerability score of one, making it the most vulnerable, and Sikkim on the other end with a score of zero was noted to be the least vulnerable.Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh were two other states on the lower overall vulnerability end of the scale.“Although our intention was not to predict the risk of infection for a district or a state, we observed similarities between vulnerability and the current concentration of COVID-19 cases at the state level,” they wrote in the study.The aim of the index, Acharya said, is to provide a tool to identify districts that are vulnerable to the consequences of the infection, including spread, morbidity and mortality and social and economic consequences.“A state may be low in overall vulnerability but may be high on a particular domain,” he added.According to the researcher, some of the significant findings include that out of 100 most vulnerable districts 33 are from UP, 24 from Bihar and 20 from Madhya Pradesh.“These states have not detected as many cases proportional to their population size as yet (there may be many reasons for that including number of tests they are performing) but are highly vulnerable to higher mortality (because of lack of health facilities), for example,” Acharya said. The scientists said the relationship between COVID-19 vulnerability and the indicators was not clear for districts, adding that better data collection at this regional level can help make more refined evaluations of vulnerability in their respective states.They also added that data used in the study are two to five years old and might not have captured vulnerability well in districts in which rapid changes have occurred up to the present day.Commenting on the research, Gautam I. Menon, professor, Departments of Physics and Biology at Ashoka University in Haryana, who is unrelated to the research team, said the approach used in the study was interesting.“We have ourselves been looking for methods that capture district-wise vulnerabilities so they can be used in a modelling framework, and this approach looks both interesting and useful,” Menon said.However, he said the study assigned equal weights to each indicator for calculating domain vulnerability, which he added is a potential drawback.“The largest vulnerability to adverse outcomes on infection would stem from pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, so it might make more sense to assign a greater weight to this index,” Menon noted in an email.He said the numbers of COVID-19 patients in the country are still evolving, with the pandemic yet to seriously affect more than a handful of states at the moment.“So this conclusion may be premature,” Menon said.Acharya said the study was not for academic purpose.“The index should be put in use by the government. At the Population Council we are ready to help government with such useful tools,” he said.

Sinha wrote that people coming to Kolkata from these “high prevalence” cities were spreading the COVID-19 infection.Since there is no direct flight arriving in Kolkata from either Surat or Indore, there is no question of suspending flights to the Bengal capital from these two cities.While more than two hundred flights operated at Kolkata Airport daily in the pre-lockdown days, the number came down to daily 65 flights only after the airport re-opened with the resumption of service from May 25. However, the service has come down to a trickle now with the fresh restrictions imposed from July 6.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/suspension-of-flight-service-to-kolkata-from-major-cities-to-continue-114292

A Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra had also imposed a fine of Rs 100 on him.“It’s not my personal issue. Other advocates have also faced similar discrimination. That’s why they came forward to launch this campaign,” Kansal told The Tribune.“We have already collected more than Rs 100 and intend to deposit it on Monday or Tuesday,” he said.While dismissing Kansal’s petition on July 6, a Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra had said, “We are imposing a minimum cost of Rs 100 on you.”Being a member of the Bar, he should not have made such allegations against the court’s Registry, it had said, adding, “You (Kansal) are unnecessarily blaming the Registry. Documents were missing in the plea.”The Registry officials were working hard to make the functioning of the court smooth for lawyers and litigants, it had noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unique-protest-advocates-collect-50-paise-coins-to-pay-rs-100-fine-slapped-on-a-colleague-114291

We are asking state administrations to look into the possibility of roping them in their fight against Covid-19, as most of them are vacant these days,” a senior official said.“The fear and scare have set in among the massage because of their lack of confidence in the system that could treat them well.  Therefore, people prefer to hide their infection status and thereby it becomes difficult in breaking the infection chain,” he said.Contact tracing and testing are key to effectively deal with the pandemic and in this exercise, the civil society, being flexible in its approach and also instilling belongingness among the masses , can play a big role, they added.In Delhi, on the direction of Home Minister Amit Shah, a massive door-to-door survey was conducted in a time-bound manner and in the exercise “NGOs, RWAs, NCC, NSS teams and faith leaders were made part of it, the officials said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-pandemic-states-should-learn-from-successful-delhi-model-says-centre-114280

17-07-2020||New Delhi||India records single-day surge of 34,956 cases, recovery rate 63.33 per cent||The Union Health Ministry said on Friday that less than 1.94 per cent of the 3.42 lakh active COVID-19 cases in India are in ICU, 0.35 per cent on ventilator support and 2.81 per cent are being given oxygen, while the recovery rate has improved to 63.33 per cent.It said the actual caseload of COVID-19 cases in the country as on date is 3,42,756 while more than 6.35 lakhs patients have recuperated from the disease.India, the second-most populous country in the world with 1.35 billion people, has 727.4 cases per million population, which is four to eight times lower than some European nations, the ministry said.Also, according to it, the country’s case fatality rate at 18.6 deaths per million is one of the lowest in the world.“It is also notable that less than 1.94 per cent of the cases are in ICU, 0.35 per cent cases are on ventilators and 2.81 per cent cases are on oxygen beds,” the Ministry said, adding that 63.33 per cent of the total cases have recovered.On Thursday, the recovery rate was 63.25 per cent.The collaborative efforts of all states and Union Territories in house-to-house survey, contact tracing, surveillance of containment and buffer zones, perimeter control activities, aggressive testing and timely diagnosis have resulted in early identification of the infected persons. This has helped in early treatment too, the Ministry said.India has followed a standard of care protocol for differentiated categorisation of COVID-19 patients — mild, moderate and severe — as clearly formulated in the Clinical Management Protocol of the Health Ministry.Effective clinical management strategies have shown to yield positive results. Almost 80 per cent of the asymptomatic and mild cases have been advised home isolation under medical supervision, the Ministry said.Moderate and severe patients are being treated at either Dedicated COVID Hospitals or Dedicated COVID Health Centres.“The strategy of home-isolation for mild and asymptomatic patients has ensured to keep the hospitals unburdened, where the focus has been on treatment of severe cases and reduction of fatality,” the Health Ministry said.Medical infrastructure to ensure quality treatment of admitted patients is being continuously augmented across the country. As a result of concerted efforts, hospital infrastructure for treating COVID-19 patients is stronger today, it said.The country has 1,383 Dedicated COVID Hospitals, 3,107 Dedicated COVID Healthcare Centres, and 10,382 COVID Care Centres with a total of 46,673 ICU beds. As many as 21,848 ventilators are deployed in hospitals of all states and UTs, according to the Health Ministry statement.The Ministry also stressed that there is no shortage of N95 masks and personal protective equipment kits.The Centre has supplied 235.58 lakh N95 masks and 124.26 lakh PPE kits to state, UTs and Central institutions, it said.With a record single-day surge of 34,956 cases, India's COVID-19 tally zoomed past 10 lakh on Friday, just three days after it crossed the nine-lakh mark, according to the Union Health Ministry data.The total tally of COVID-19 cases in the country surged to 10,03,832, while death toll mounted to 25,602 with the highest number of 687 fatalities recorded in a day, the data updated at 8 am on Friday showed.

Empty words don't suffice in the world of geopolitics. pic.twitter.com/XM6PXcRuFh  Jaishankar’s riposte in a series of tweets was stylish and acidic where he blamed the previous government of messing up ties with many countries in the neighbourhood.“India has been disturbed and disrupted,” said Rahul, adding “empty words don’t suffice in the world of geopolitics. Today, our relationship has become transactional.”The Congress leaders alleged that while India’s ties with major powers such as the US, Russia and the European Union, most of its neighbours did not share a warm relationship as before.Jaishankar opened his response by asserting that all of India’s major partnerships were stronger and India’s international standing higher than before.“Witness the regular summits and informal meetings with the US, Russia, Europe and Japan. India engages China on more equal terms politically,” he claimed while ending his tweet with “Ask the analysts”. This last flourish was a constant factor in the subsequent tweets where he asked Rahul to “ask the Afghan street”, “ask Bhutan households”.“We speak our mind more openly now. On CPEC, on BRI, on the South China Sea, on UN-sanctioned terrorists, etc,” said Jaishankar. “Ask the media,” he added.Dealing with the neighbourhood, he said Rahul’s criticism of India missing out on Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka (which went to China) was misplaced as the deal was concluded in 2008 (during the UPA era). The Foreign Minister then blamed the previous government for the dip in ties with Maldives and Bhutan.While skipping over the current disagreement with Nepal, he said the Himalayan nation received Prime Ministerial visits after 17 years while there has been a swathe of developmental projects. He also said Afghanistan has seen several completed India-built projects.On Pakistan, the Minister invited Rahul to note the difference between Balakot and Uri on the one hand, and the Sharm-el-Sheikh and the Mumbai attacks on the other.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-rahul-clash-on-social-media-over-direction-of-indias-foreign-policy-114273

Justice Singh, who was due to retire on April 20, was given a three-month extension on April 7 by the top court.A Bench led by Justice Ashok Bhushan directed the government to ensure that the appointment process for all the members of TDSAT was completed in the next three months.The top court had on April 7 extended Justice Singh's tenure as TDSAT Chairman by three months after it was informed that the tribunal had no other members except the Chairman and if he too was allowed to retire it would become dysfunctional.It had asked the Centre to explain why TDSAT members had not been appointed since October 2019. The order had come after the top court was informed that the tribunal was virtually non-functional as only Chairman – Justice Singh – was there and his original tenure was to end on April 20. "How can tribunals function like this?" The Bench had wondered.Tribunals were alternatives to judicial system, how can the tribunal function, it had noted after senior advocate Vikas Singh highlighted the inordinate delay in filling the vacancies in TDSAT.A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court had last year quashed the rules for appointment of tribunal chairpersons and members and said they should not be made to depend on government ministries and departments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-extends-tdsat-chairmans-tenure-114265
17-07-2020||Ravi S Singh||Left confident of saving its government in Kerala||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 17Although the Left parties are confident of CPI(M)-led LDF government in Kerala sailing through a no-confidence motion against it in the backdrop of gold scam, there are concerns among them on their image taking a hit.The Left parties are also firm that Pinarayi Vijayan will complete his present full tenure as Chief Minister.The Congress, principal Opposition in Kerala Assembly, has sent notice to the Speaker for moving the proposed no-trust motion."The BJP and the Congress have joined hands to malign the Left just as they tried through Sabarimala temple issue. The Left Front government is stable, and it will not allow them to succeed," CPI national secretary Atul Anjan said on Friday. A section in the CPI(M) close to former Chief Minister of Kerala and party stalwart  VS Achuthanandan and the CPI are unhappy with the way Vijayan handled the alleged scam, notwithstanding the brave front and sangfroid countenance put up by Left leaders in public in the face of gold scam explosion.With the names of ex-Principal Secretary of the Chief Minister and state's officials surfacing in the scam, the miffed sections feel that Vijayan should have acted with demonstrable credibility.The name of Education Minister of the state getting embroiled in the scam has apparently dismayed the Left camp.There is a growing feeling in Left circles that Vijayan allowed the grass to grow under his feet by allowing unbridled power to his ex-Principal Secretary in the Chief Minister Office."There should be a proper investigation and the entire spectrum of the scam should be laid bare before the public without delay," said a Left leader, unhappy at the developments.The procrastination would only harm the Left, and allow it less time for damage control and salvage its image.The Left parties have in mind the next Assembly election in Kerala, due mid next year. The role of the office of Vijayan, who is the Left mascot, has come in question.Kerala is a bastion of the Left – other than West Bengal and Tripura where they have been ousted from power. The southern state continues to be the best bet for Left with regard to forming the government again.The Kerala development could not have come at a worse time for the Left. Assembly elections in Bihar are due this October-November. It will be followed by elections in West-Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Assam in May next year.Also, it had planned to up the ante against the Narendra Modi government on a panoply of issues, including economy, foreign relations, and farmers and labour.The unfolding of Kerala development surrounding the gold scam will henceforth compel them to include a defensive shield in their armour in the political battle front.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/left-confident-of-saving-its-government-in-kerala-114263

If India wants another access then our offer is open. If they (India) want to meet him tonight or tomorrow, we are ready,” the paper quoted Qureshi as telling a news channel.However, there was no official confirmation neither from India nor from Pakistan whether the decision was conveyed to New Delhi.India approached the International Court of Justice against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July last year that Pakistan must undertake an "effective review and reconsideration" of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.The first consular access under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 was earlier provided by Pakistan on September 2 last year.Though Pakistan Foreign Ministry had assured India that the consular access on Thursday would be unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional, it turned out that the arrangements of the meeting were not in accordance with the assurances made by Islamabad, said External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Srivastava.      Pakistan claims that its security forces arrested Jadhav from the restive Balochistan province on March 3, 2016 after he reportedly entered from Iran.India maintains that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran where he had business interests after retiring from the Navy.

There is no proposal before the government to extend the lockdown,” Yediyurappa was quoted as saying by his office in a release.The Chief Minister today chaired a meeting with Ministers, who have been made in-charge of eight zones in the city, and officials regarding the COVID-19 situation in Bengaluru.Earlier too, on July 13, the eve of the lockdown, Yediyurappa had said the government did not plan to extend it in Bengaluru urban and rural districts and had appealed to the people to cooperate by not paying heed to rumours.However, earlier today city Mayor M Goutham Kumar and commissioner of the civic body Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike BH Anil Kumar had favoured its extension.They had said that in their personal opinion, a 15-day lockdown would be good, as that much time is required to break the chain.The Opposition Congress, too, had asked for a minimum of 15 days lockdown after taking expert opinion.“Respected Chief Minister, you have imposed lockdown in Bengaluru, but it is difficult to expect results from this lockdown, which has been imposed just for the sake of it. Take expert opinion and enforce strict lockdown in Bengaluru at least for 15 days. If not, even if God comes,it will be difficult to protect Bengaluru,” KPCC Working President Eshwar Khandre tweeted.Speaking to reporters after attending the meeting chaired by the CM, Revenue Minister R Ashoka said the lockdown would not be extended and all activities could resume as usual from July 22.“Lockdown will not be extended. I’m saying this after discussing with the Chief Minister. There is no such thinking before the government. CM has got a report from the experts, it was discussed in the meeting. By lockdown we can only postpone things, we have taken that breathing time. If we continue lockdown it will keep on continuing,” he said.The Minister said the process of sealing places, wherever required, would continue.He said the plan to conduct more tests was discussed at the meeting and all the required zone wise arrangements would be made.“We also discussed beds and shortage of ventilators and steps will be taken to arrange for them,” he said.As of July 16 evening, cumulatively 51,422 COVID-19 positive cases have been confirmed in the state, which includes 1,032 deaths and 19,729 discharges.Bengaluru urban district tops the list of positive cases, with a total of 25,288 infections.Out of 4,169 fresh cases reported on Thursday, a whopping 2,344 were from Bengaluru urban alone.At the meeting, the Chief Minister said all necessary steps should be taken to clear all difficulties faced by infected patients in getting admitted to hospitals.The CMO statement quoted Yediyurappa as directing Ministers to hold meetings with private hospitals to ensure that COVID and non-COVID patients got treatment.Warning of strict action against private hospitals if they don’t allocate beds for COVID patients, he said volunteers and nodal officers would be appointed to gather information about admission of such patients and availability of beds.The Chief Minister said rapid antigen tests should be conducted on those dying at hospitals or homes and necessary action taken to hand over the bodies or to conduct last rites as per the procedures, depending on the cause of death.Recruitment was on to appoint doctors to resolve shortage, he said, adding that volunteers had been identified in each ward for micromanagement and ambulances allocated.Marriage halls and lodges have been selected in all wards for those not having separate quarantine facilities, Yediyurappa said and stressed on increasing testing.Deploying extra police force at places where there are chances of people gathering in large numbers, ensuring beds availability and ambulances within two hours of a patient testing positive with decentralised monitoring, giving priority to those symptomatic above 65-years during the allocation of beds were among directions given by the Chief Minister.

It fixed the next hearing for 10 am on Monday.Also read:Rajasthan Congress infighting also brings to fore factionalism in state BJPFIR against Union Minister Shekhawat in Rajasthan audio clip caseCongress accuses BJP of horse-trading in Rajasthan; suspends its 2 MLAsHigh drama outside ITC hotel as Rajasthan police’s Special Operations Group denied entryThe counsel for the Speaker assured the court that no order shall be passed on the notice till 5.30 pm on Tuesday.Earlier, Speaker C P Joshi had written to the court that the notices will not be acted upon till 5 pm on Friday. The counsel agreed to extend this to 5 pm on Tuesday as the court is yet to give an order on the petition.The petition had challenged the notices based on a Congress complaint that the MLAs should be disqualified from the Rajasthan Assembly for defying a party whip.The court of Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Prakash Gupta also asked Congress chief whip Mahesh Joshi, who had filed the complaint before the Speaker, to respond to the dissidents’ petition by Saturday.The Pilot camp has argued that a party whip applies only when the Assembly is in session.In its complaint to the Speaker, the Congress had sought action against Pilot and the other dissidents under paragraph 2 (1) (a) of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.The provision disqualifies MLAs if they “voluntarily” give up the membership of the party which they represent in the House.They Congress claims that this is the inference that can be drawn from the MLAs’ conduct. But the dissident camp says Pilot never indicated any intention to leave the party.Pilot was sacked as Deputy Chief Minister and the president of the state unit of the party after he rebelled against Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.

He was apprehended about 1.5 km short of Indo-Pak international border when he was attempting to cross over to Pakistan. He was in a dehydrated state and revealed that he had gone unconscious for about two hours in the Rann,” it said.

In the process six people, who are natives of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, have been arrested, as the consignments were found from their possession.  A senior DRI official said, “The seized gold bars are of foreign origin and were being carried to Delhi by passengers travelling in buses via Guwahati, Siliguri and Patna.”The DRI personnel found the smuggled gold concealed in specially-made cavities in the handles of the stroller bags, which the arrested persons were carrying as passengers, the officials said, adding that they also hiding the precious metals inside the underwear/waist belts worn by them.Giving details of the cases, the agency officials said two persons, who were coming from Guwahati via Siliguri and Patna, were intercepted at Jewar toll plaza on the Yamuna Expressway. The agency recovered around 4.98 kg of smuggled gold bars from them, they said.Two other passengers were intercepted by the officials at Siliguri (West Bengal) bus station when they were boarding a bus bound for Patna and seized from them 30 smuggled foreign-origin gold bars, collectively weighing 4.98 kg, the officials said, adding that in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur two persons were intercepted as they travelled first from Guwahati to Patna and from them a total of 24 gold bars, weighing 3.98 kg were seized.“In this well-coordinated operation, approximately 14 kg of smuggled gold bars were seized which have a market value of around Rs 7 crore,” the official said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dri-seizes-gold-worth-rs-7-crore-smuggled-into-india-from-myanmar-six-accused-held-114240

17-07-2020||Nagpur||No need for CBI probe in Sushant Singh Rajput death case: Anil Deshmukh||There was no need for a CBI probe into the death case of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput as the Mumbai police were capable of handling the matter, said Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Friday.The police were also examining the angle of "business rivalry" in the case, he said.Rajput, 34, was found dead in his Bandra apartment in Mumbai on June 14 and what the police claimed was a case of suicide. In the initial investigation, the Mumbai police had found that the actor was under medication for depression.On Thursday, Rajput's friend, actor Rhea Chakraborty, in a tweet, demanded a CBI inquiry to understand what "pressures" prompted Rajput to take the extreme step of suicide.Chakraborty said though she has "complete faith" in the government, a CBI inquiry would help bring justice to the case.Talking to PTI, Deshmukh said the Mumbai police were conducting a detailed inquiry into the actor's death and also recording statements of people concerned."There was no need to give the case to the CBI. Our police officials are capable and doing the inquiry in right way. We are also examining the angle of business rivalry," said Deshmukh.So far, the police have recorded the statements of more than two dozen people, including Chakraborty, filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Bollywood casting director Mukesh Chhabra and Rajput's family members, as part of a probe into the suicide, which jolted the Hindi film industry.Rajput starred in films such as 'Shuddh Desi Romance', 'Raabta', 'Kedarnath' and 'Sonchiriya'. But his most prominent role came as cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the biopic, 'MS Dhoni: The Untold Story'.

17-07-2020||New Delhi||Nepal envoys asks Yogi if Nepali youth’s head was forcibly tonsured||India and Nepal may have waded into another controversy after a video purportedly showing a Nepali youth being forcibly tonsured and ‘Ram’ being etched on his head in Uttar Pradesh began doing the rounds on social media.Nepali Ambassador Nilambar Acharya called UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to draw his attention to the video and ascertain the facts. The video gives no indications about the place of occurrence except that the youth’s head is being shaved next to the banks of a river.Nepali social media activists have been highlighting the video and pointing out that this was a fallout of Prime Minister KP Oli’s statement about Ram and Ayodhya. Oli had said that the ‘real’ Ayodhya was in Nepal and not in Uttar Pradesh, India.They alleged the youth was surrounded by a few people who could not be seen in the video but could be heard raising slogans against Nepal and Oli. The man was also prodded to shout ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Bharat Mati ki jai’.जय जय श्रीराम।।#विहिसे।While the Nepal government is still engaged with the UP government to ascertain the facts, the issue has generated heat in Kathmandu where social media users have urged the government to take immediate action.However, other voices urged Nepalis to stay calm and push for a peaceful solution.One social media post said if the government was serious about this issue and does not move towards a speedy solution, it will create a frightening situation.“If the people-to-people relationship deteriorates, many innocent people will lose their lives,’’ said Jerung Surya, a social media user.@varanasipolice उक्त प्रकरण को तत्काल संज्ञान में लेते हुए विधिक कार्यवाही कराएं व कृत कार्यवाही से अवगत कराएं @IgRangeVaranasi @Uppolice  According to The Indian Express, “Convener of the little-known Varanasi-based fringe group Vishwa Hindu Sena Arun Pathak recorded and shared the video of the incident on his Facebook profile.”In a tweet, Varanasi police said they have registered a case and would investigate the matter further.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-envoys-asks-yogi-if-nepali-youths-head-was-forcibly-tonsured-114233

"We are going through the legal route," he said.Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Friday rejected the Congress’ allegation based on some audio clips that he was part of a conspiracy to topple the Ashok Gehlot government in Rajasthan, saying his voice is not in those recordings and that he was ready to face any probe.Shekhawat said: "The voice in the tape is not mine and I am ready for investigation." He also said that he is not in touch with Jain and Sharma and added that there are many people going by the name of Gajendra Singh in the state.The Congress’ attack on Shekhawat and some rebel Congress leaders, including MLA Bhanwarlal Sharma, came after two audio clips surfaced pertaining to an alleged conspiracy to topple the Gehlot government.“This is not my voice.... Let there be an investigation. I am ready to face any probe,” the senior BJP leader from the state told reporters here after the Congress demanded his arrest. Later he also tweeted a Sanskrit saying that means "where there is dharma (righteousness), there is victory.”Sources close to Shekhawat said he would cooperate with any investigation in the matter.AICC spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also demanded the arrest of one Sanjay Jain, whom he described as a BJP leader.The BJP has dismissed the audio clips cited by the Congress as “manufactured”.Earlier in the morning, Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala had called a presser and accused the BJP of trying to topple the Gehlot government by indulging in horse-trading.The Congress is unable to keep its house in order and is blaming the BJP in frustration, the saffron party said.Meanwhile, Deputy Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore said that there is no truth in the Congress claims.

17-07-2020||New Delhi||Modi has weakened India, that’s why Chinese violated LAC: Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had “fundamentally weakened India” leading to the recent Chinese aggression along the LAC.In the first episode of his video series on issues of importance, Gandhi alleged that since 2014 the PM’s “constant blunders and indiscretions have fundamentally weakened India and left us vulnerable. Empty words don’t suffice in the world of geopolitics.“Dwelling on the timing of Chinese action, Gandhi said: “Today you have a country which is economically in trouble; in trouble as far as foreign policy is concerned; in trouble with its neighbours; and that’s why the Chinese have decided that this is possibly the best time to act and that is why they have acted.“Since 2014, the PM's constant blunders and indiscretions have fundamentally weakened India and left us vulnerable. Empty words don't suffice in the world of geopolitics. pic.twitter.com/XM6PXcRuFhGandhi’s three-minute-long video focused on the border conflict with China as he asked why the Chinese “chose this particular time to violate the LAC?”“What is it about India situation that has made China to act in such an aggressive way?” asked Gandhi.He said countries are protected by a confluence of forces—its foreign relationships, its neighbourhood, its economy and the vision of its people.“And what has happened over the last 6 years is that in all those areas India has been disturbed and disrupted.“Our relationship with the outside world used to be with multiple countries. The US, Russia and EU used to help us manoeuvre. Today our relationship has become transactional. We have a transactional relationship with the United States. We have disturbed our relationship with the Russians.We have a transactional relationship with Europe,” said Gandhi.Speaking of neighbouring countries, Gandhi said India no longer shared the same relationship with its past friends.“Today Nepal is angry with us. If you go to Nepal and you speak to the Nepali people they are furious with what has happened. Sri Lankans have given a port to the Chinese. The Maldives is disturbed. Bhutan is disturbed. So we have disrupted our foreign partners and our neighbourhood,” said Gandhi.He said the economy, "India’s pride", was badly hit with the worst economic growth in 50 years, the highest unemployment in 40 to 50 years.“Our strengths have suddenly become our weaknesses,” Gandhi said while dwelling on why the Chinese needled India at this time.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-has-weakened-india-thats-why-chinese-violated-lac-rahul-114224
17-07-2020||New Delhi||Arctic heatwave would have been almost impossible without human-caused climate change: Climate scientists||The recent record-breaking Arctic heatwave would have been “almost impossible” without the influence of human-caused climate change, according to rapid attribution analysis by a team of leading climate scientists published on Friday.The analysis found that the prolonged heatwave that Siberia experienced from January to June this year would only happen less than once every 80,000 years without human-induced climate change. It would otherwise be impossible in a climate that had not been warmed by greenhouse gas emissions.Climate change increased the chances of the heatwave by a factor of at least 600. This is among the strongest results of any attribution study conducted to date and is unequivocal evidence of the influence of human-induced climate change on the planet, according to the analysts.Impact of Arctic warming is well-established. Consider this: 38 deg C in a Siberian town is almost the same as Delhi right now.Warming arctic means rapid glacial melt which will lead to sea-level rise impacting SSTs. Indian Ocean Dipole is a phenomenon when the western part of the ocean is warm and eastern is cold due to glacial melt, leading to climatic impact in the entire region across the Indian Ocean.Researchers from international universities and meteorological services also found that temperatures were more than 2°C hotter than they would have been if humans had not influenced the climate by releasing greenhouse gas emissions.Temperatures in Siberia have been well above average since the start of the year.A new record temperature for the Arctic, 38°C, was recorded in the Russian town of Verkhoyansk on 20 June, while Siberia’s overall temperatures were more than 5°C above average from January to June.The heat in Siberia has triggered widespread fires, with 1.15 million hectares burning in late June, associated with a release of about 56 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, more than the annual missions of some industrialised countries such as Switzerland and Norway.It also accelerated the melting of permafrost - an oil tank built on the frozen soil collapsed in May, leading to one of the worst oil spills ever in the region. Greenhouse gases released by the fires and melting permafrost—as well as decreases in the planet’s reflectivity from loss of snow and ice—will further heat the planet. The heat has also been linked with an outbreak of silk moths, whose larvae eat conifer trees, says the analysis.Géosciences de l’Environnement, Grenoble, lead author IPCC AR6 says: “This study shows that not only was the magnitude of the temperature extremely rare but also the weather patterns that caused it. The blocking of the weather system over the Urals that caused the prolonged period of heat is projected to intensify with climate change leading to more events like this potentially occurring. We are continuing to study how the wildfires that have burned over thousands of hectares might also affect the climate as the flames pump smoke and ash into the atmosphere.”According to the lead author of the research and Senior Detection and Attribution scientist at the Met Office Andrew Ciavarella: “The findings of this rapid research – that climate change increased the chances of the prolonged heat in Siberia by at least 600 times – are truly staggering. This research is further evidence of the extreme temperatures we can expect to see more frequently around the world in a warming global climate. Importantly, an increasing frequency of these extreme heat events can be moderated by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.”Dr Friederike Otto, acting director of Oxford’s Environmental Change Institute, and co-lead of the World Weather Attribution initiative: “This study shows again just how much of a game-changer climate change is with respect to heatwaves. Given that heatwaves are by far the deadliest extreme weather events in most parts of the world they must be taken very seriously. As emissions continue to rise we need to think about building resilience to extreme heat all over the world, even in Arctic communities – which would have seemed nonsensical not very long ago.”Prof. Sonia Seneviratne from the Department of Environmental Systems Science at ETH Zurich (D-USYS), a lead author on several IPCC reports: “These results show that we are starting to experience extreme events which would have almost no chance of happening without a human footprint on the climate system. We have little time left to stabilize global warming at levels at which climate change would remain within the bounds of the Paris Agreement. For a stabilization at 1.5°C of global warming, which would still imply more risks of such extreme heat events, we need to reduce our CO2 emissions by at least half until 2030.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arctic-heatwave-would-have-been-almost-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change-climate-scientists-114223
17-07-2020||New Delhi||Rajasthan Congress infighting also brings to fore factionalism in state BJP||The Rajasthan Congress imbroglio has also brought into the open factionalism and different groups operating in the state BJP.On Friday, the Congress accused senior BJP leader and Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat of allegedly being involved in horse-trading to topple the Ashok Gehlot-led government in Rajasthan.Interestingly, national convener of Rashtriya Loktantrik Party Hanuman Beniwal had on Thursday accused senior BJP leader and former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje of trying to save the Gehlot government.Though Beniwal is technically not from the BJP any more, political observers say the NDA ally could not have made such an accusation against someone like Raje, with known differences with Home Minister Amit Shah, without the "blessings and concurrence" of the central BJP leadership.Also read: Congress seeks FIR against Union minister Shekhawat, suspends 2 party MLAs over horse-trading chargesFIR against Union Minister Shekhawat in Rajasthan audio clip caseHC division bench hears Pilot camps' petition, Speaker to take up disqualification plea this eveningThe "silence" of Raje in the ongoing political tussle in Rajasthan is the talk of the town. The senior BJP leader, who is believed to have a mind of her own on what is being read largely as a "Delhi- sponsored programme", is yet to speak on the poltical turmoil in Rajasthan unlike other prominent BJP leaders like Shekhawat, Om Mathur and Gulab Chand Kataria.Raje’s hold over BJP MLAs and state unit is well known, how she held her ground in 2018 against someone as powerful as Shah, the then BJP president, over the selection of the state unit chief.  Shah wanted to appoint Shekhawat but after weeks-long stalemate, a middle path was adopted in the form of Madan Lal Saini.Shekhawat has been named along with rebel Congress MLA Bhanwar Lal Sharma in an FIR over allegations of a conspiracy against the Congress government. The Congress has alleged that investigations had found rebel MLAs plotting with the BJP against the Gehlot government.Shekhawat on Tuesday had given several indications that rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot may be joining the BJP after he was sacked from the posts of Rajasthan Congress president and state Deputy Chief Minister. This despite Pilot claiming he was not intersted in joining the BJP.Beniwal, who represents Nagaur in the Lok Sabha and is a NDA ally, had claimed Raje was "making all efforts to save the minority government of Ashok Gehlot" and that she "had also rung up many Congress leaders close to her in this context".  Beniwal also alleged that Raje called up her loyalists in the BJP and told them to support Gehlot. He said he had the proof of the former BJP CM "telling Jat MLAs from Sikar and Nagaur to keep distance from Sachin Pilot".Beniwal also alleged that people of the state were well aware of the close association between Raje and Gehlot and how they tried to "cover up each other's corruption".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-congress-infighting-also-brings-to-fore-factionalism-in-state-bjp-114221
17-07-2020||New Delhi||Too soon to say whether recovered COVID patients lose immunity with time: Scientists||Recent studies suggest that those recovering from COVID-19 may have antibodies for only a few months, a signal that long-term immunity is difficult to achieve, but several scientists dispel the gloom and say it is too soon to determine if such individuals can contract the disease again.Some special cells of the immune system may still offer protection against the disease, the scientists said as questions swirl on whether people who have recovered from COVID-19 can get it again—even those whose antibodies dwindle progressively as the days and weeks pass.It is too soon to say whether people with lowered levels of novel coronavirus-blocking antibody levels (nAbs) after recovery are at risk of contracting the COVID-19 disease on re-exposure to the virus, Vineeta Bal, an immunologist from the Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research in Pune, told PTI."This pandemic is only six-seven months old, and reports of people testing positive for the virus for a second time, post-recovery, are mostly only from those who were first infected in January," Bal said in a video interview.The discussion – and disquiet amongst laypersons following news of the pandemic – intensified when a yet-to-be peer-reviewed study, published in medRxiv last week, assessed 90 recovered COVID-19 patients in the UK and found their nAbs decreased between twofold and 23-fold during an 18-65 day follow-up period.Another study, published last month in the journal Nature Medicine, surveyed the levels of antibodies in COVID-19 patients, including those who did not show symptoms, and revealed that nAbs lasted only two to three months after recovery. While reports of people testing positive for re-exposure to the virus emerge, it does not necessarily mean that those losing nAbs will develop the disease, said Bal, who was a member of the Prime Minister's task force for women in science under the Ministry of Science and Technology.It might take a year to get sufficient data to confirm this.While antibody levels, as indicated by the two studies, may decrease in recovered individuals, other immune system players may still offer longer lasting immunity."Some reports say detectable T cells which may fight off infection and prevent the COVID-19 disease on re-exposure, can offer protection," Bal said.Commenting on the implications of the studies, immunologist Satyajit Rath from the National Institute of Immunology in New Delhi, said the findings are in line with how the human immune system interacts with coronaviruses such as those causing the common cold.In Rath's opinion, just like in other coronavirus infections, the more severe the COVID-19 disease, the higher the peak antibody levels' in patients as well as the tendency of their nAb levels to go down in weeks-to-months.Asymptomatic infected individuals make very little nAbs to begin with, and may both recover and be protected by non-antibody-based mechanisms, he explained in an email interview."There is also some evidence that virus-specific T cells are activated and expanded in infected people, and they too can plausibly provide accelerated recovery re-infection," Rath said, adding a caveat that there is no direct evidence for such an actual causal relationship.According to the immunologist, if antibodies do play a major role, the two studies could mean that long term immunity both individually, and for the population, may be difficult to achieve.Under such a scenario, he said, people may periodically keep getting re-infected and the "virus may keep spreading around" until effective vaccines come into widespread use.There is no good evidence yet about this, and it may or may not be the case, he said.Another study, published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, also revealed the involvement of T cells.The research, conducted by scientists from the Duke-Nus Medical School in Singapore, found that individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, or the 2002-03 SARS pandemic virus, or other coronaviruses, develop memory T cells.These coronavirus-specific T cells could last in the body for over 15 years after people recover from infection, and can still proliferate once they encounter a protein from that virus.According to this study, patients who had recovered from the 2002-03 SARS virus 17 years ago still possess virus-specific memory T cells which cross-reacted with the current pandemic virus.However, whether such pre-existing T cells affect the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 remains to be studied, said Nina Le Bert, a co-author of this study."However, if an individual already has memory T cells which recognise the new infection, the adaptive immune response could start earlier and may reduce the severity of COVID-19," she told PTI over email, wanting for more studies to confirm this.According to Le Bert, the immune system is complex, and the different cell types usually complement each other."I believe that both cellular and antibody immunity will be equally important," she added.Discussing the implications of the involvement of T cells in vaccine development, Bal said, "For a vaccine to be effective, it needs to generate reasonable concentration of nAbs and cytotoxic T cells.""Then they can kill viruses on re-exposure," she said, adding that the combination makes "two components of a perfect vaccine".She cautioned that vaccines which rely more on cell mediated immunity may not be effective in every individual to the same extent, compared to those which boost an antibody response alone.Bal explained that this is due to genetic diversity of the global human population."Human cells have surface proteins called HLA antigens which are different for every individual. So there is no way to trigger a cell mediated immune response in a universal vaccine that is generalisable to everyone," she said.

Some of the most important topics are being left out. How are young minds supposed to form political opinions?,” she wrote. Sonam also shared a news article on the same with her post.The CBSE’s move is to ‘rationalise’ its syllabus by dropping certain chapters to reduce course load on students in the view of the Covid-19 pandemic. CBSE secretary Anurag Tripathi said addressed the controversy, saying, “The reduction of syllabus from classes 9 to 12 has been interpreted differently. Contrary to some of the impressions being created, it is clarified that the rationalization of syllabus up to 30 per cent has been undertaken for nearly 190 subjects for the academic session 2020-21 as a one-time measure only.”Sonam recently flew to London after spending almost three months in India during the coronavirus lockdown. “London I’m back,” the actor wrote, over a video that showed the Thames from above. “So beautiful,” she added, on footage of the landing.Sonam followed it up with several more videos of herself, unpacking food.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sonam-kapoor-ahuja-questions-cbses-decision-to-remove-chapters-on-nationalism-secularism-calls-it-bizarre-114211
17-07-2020||Washington||Want to do everything possible to keep peace for people of India, China: Trump||US President Donald Trump has said that he wants to do everything possible to keep peace for the people of India and China, according to his spokesperson.Over the past several weeks, the Trump administration has come out in support of India against China.“He (Trump) said I love the people of India and I love the people of China and I want to do everything possible to keep the peace for the people,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at a news conference here on Thursday.She was responding to a question on Trump’s message to India, which recently had a standoff with China in eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control.Earlier in the day, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow described India as a great ally, saying President Trump is a great friend of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that India has been a great partner of the US.“India has been a great partner… They are an important partner of ours. I have a great relationship with my foreign minister counterpart. We talked frequently about a broad range of issues. We talked about the conflict they had along the border with China. We’ve talked about the risk that emanates from the Chinese telecommunication infrastructure there,” Pompeo told reporters in response to a question.Travelling in Europe, US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien told reporters that China has been very aggressive with India.O’Brien said that India is a democracy and is a great friend of the United States. Prime Minister “Modi and President Trump have a super relationship,” he said.“In fact, it was the last foreign trip that I took with the president before the COVID-19 crisis hit, was to India, and we had a great reception of the Indian people there. We have a lot in common with them, we speak English, we’re democracies. We’ve got a growing, very strong relationship with India,” O’Brien said.Welcoming the White House statement, Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, said that unlike his predecessor, President Trump has come out openly in support of India.“Most of the Indian-Americans have observed that every earlier president - be it a Democrat or Republican, like Clinton or Bush Senior or Bush Jr or Obama have been very scared to side with India openly, for fear of hurting China.“Only President Trump has had the courage to say that… I love India, America respects India… US stands with India - and that also, to over one billion Indians in India at the Namaste Trump rally held in India… and that too… near India’s neighbour China,” Mason said in a statement.“And he is consistent in his love for India and Indian-Americans,” he added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/want-to-do-everything-possible-to-keep-peace-for-people-of-india-china-trump-114210

These are malicious attempts at character assassination, and the Congress can’t put its own house in order.”Surjewala said the Congress had demanded a probe into the tapes saying party’s chief whip in the state Mahesh Joshi had written to the police to take cognisance of the matter.The fast- paced developments come hours before the Rajasthan High Court is to hear petitions of rebel Congress MLAs led by Sachin Pilot challenging the disqualification notices issued to them by speaker CP Joshi under the anti-defection law.Pilot and company have challenged the constitutional validity of these notices and all eyes are now on the HC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-accuses-bjp-of-horse-trading-in-rajasthan-suspends-its-2-mlas-114208

17-07-2020||Washington||After US, India has done most Covid tests: White House||After the US, which has carried out a record 42 million Covid-19 tests, India has done the second largest number of 12 million coronavirus tests, the White House has said.More than 3.5 million people have tested positive with the coronavirus and 138,000 died in the US. Globally, more than 13.6 million have tested positive and over 586,000 have died.“With regard to (the coronavirus) testing, we've done more than 42 million tests. The second-highest number is 12 million from India. We're leading the world in testing,” White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at a news conference here on Thursday.The White House was responding to questions related to the coronavirus pandemic in the US.“We have done more than any country in the world on testing; there's no doubt about that -- 42 million tests. The country with the next highest number is India at 12 million,” McEnany said.This record testing, she said, is in a very stark contrast than the previous administration.CBS is reporting that in 2009 under Obama-Biden, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention abruptly advised states to stop testing for the H1N1 flu and stopped counting individual cases, she said.“Ron Klain, Vice President Biden's former Chief of Staff said this: It is “purely a fortuity that (H1N1) isn't one of the great mass casualty events in American history. It had nothing to do with us doing anything right.” This is former VP Biden's Chief of Staff. It just had to do with luck,” she said.“Contrary to that, this President led the world in testing; led the world in ventilators -- redistributing ventilators for therapeutics; 13 vaccine candidates -- one going into phase three clinical trial. This response has been extraordinary and historic. We didn't pause testing; the Obama-Biden administration did, and that was a shameful decision,” McEnany said.There has been encouraging news on vaccines, the press secretary said.“Moderna's vaccine candidate is showing promising signs. They produced a positive, neutral immune response among the 45 participants in the study. This is comparable to what we see in recovered patients. The bottom line is that, so far, we are seeing exactly what you would hope to see in a vaccine. The Moderna vaccine in particular is expected to reach phase three by late July, with 30,000 participants.“On the therapeutics front, I just want to note: A very encouraging Regeneron contract. A USD 450 million contract for a monoclonal antibody cocktail. This is a bioengineered version of convalescent plasma, one of the several therapeutics available to treat COVID-19. It can be used for prophylaxis and treatment. They say they could have up to 70,000 to 300,000 doses -- by the end of the summer or early fall,” she said.As such there is encouraging news on the therapeutics front, McEnany added.

The receptionist informed this correspondent that all rooms were booked till next week.When asked about visiting the resort for a forthcoming wedding, the receptionist said the visit would be possible after one week. Quizzed about the “quarantine centre” status of the resort, she claimed, “No ma’am, we have no Covid issue or quarantine centre. We had some guests last week, so we have closed the resort for sanitisation.”A source says Pilot, who has been avoiding media glare in light of the political rumblings in Rajasthan, wanted his team of MLAs to be shifted to a more secluded place. He was seen entering the resort riding pillion on a bike from the gate reserved for staff. He was wearing a helmet.About 45 rooms have reportedly been booked in the name of two persons. The names of MLAs are not mentioned in the booking register. A video in which 16 MLAs could be purportedly seen inside the resort was “leaked”.

The rebels’ plea is that absence from the two CLP meetings Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had called did not constitute defiance of the party whip and a whip was issued only for proceedings on the floor of the House and not otherwise. Their petitions say the Speaker showed “undue haste” in issuing disqualification notices under the Tenth Schedule and the notices were “bad in law”.The Congress is being represented in the matter by lawyer Abhishek Singhvi, with political observers citing the choice of legal representatives of the two sides as evidence enough of which way the matters were moving.The Congress, however, kept the doors ajar for Pilot even today, with top sources saying the leadership had asked CM Gehlot to go soft on the rebel leader. Gehlot had yesterday publicly lashed out at Pilot, accusing him of “indulging in horse-trading of MLAs and conspiring to topple the Congress government in the state”.Tenth Schedule and the notices were “bad in law”.The Congress is being represented in the matter by lawyer Abhishek Singhvi, with political observers citing the choice of legal representatives of the two sides as evidence enough of which way the matters were moving.The Congress, however, kept the doors ajar for Pilot even today, with top sources saying the leadership had asked CM Gehlot to go soft on the rebel leader.Gehlot had yesterday publicly lashed out at Pilot, accusing him of “indulging in horse-trading of MLAs and conspiring to topple the Congress government in the state”. Gehlot also said Pilot had got it too easy in life unlike veterans like himself who had to slog for everything. Meanwhile, a Congress source said Pilot had reached out to a senior party leader today and set certain conditions for talks. The party is learnt to have told him that he should return unconditionally and the leadership would let bygones be bygones. Pilot, it is learnt, also sought legal advice from Congress man Abhishek Singhvi today. Singhvi declined as he was advising the Congress.A section in the Congress however believes that Pilot has gone too far to return, and is likely to soon reveal his future plans. Both sides are geared for a prolonged legal battle which is expected to reach the Supreme Court. Rajasthan Speaker CP Joshi has, meanwhile, given time until Friday to rebel MLAs to respond to disqualification notices.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pilot-18-rebels-move-high-court-against-speakers-notice-hearing-today-113893

There would also be no recording of the meeting.However, Indian consular officials not only found Pakistani officials in close proximity to Jadhav, but also detected a camera for recording the conversation. Jadhav too was under visible stress and indicated that to the consular officials.“The arrangements did not permit a free conversation between them… in the light of these circumstances, we came to the conclusion that this consular access was neither meaningful nor credible. After lodging a protest, the officers left the venue,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.Srivastava recalled that over the past year, India has requested Pakistan more than 12 times to provide unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional consular access to Jadhav, who has been in Pakistani custody since 2016. “It is clear that Pakistan’s approach to this matter continues to be obstructive and insincere,” he alleged.Indian national on death row||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-renders-jadhav-meet-meaningless-113896

Any unilateral attempt to change the status quo along the LAC is not acceptable.”Firm on LAC stand: MEAMutual redeployment should not be misrepresented. There is absolutely no change with respect to India’s position on the LAC.— Anurag Srivastava, MEA spokespersonThese statements emerged after the meeting last evening of the China Study Group (CSG) in New Delhi that followed the 15-hour marathon meeting of the Lt Gen-level commanders that ended at 2 am on Tuesday.“Both sides have agreed at specific points to redeploy towards their regular posts on their respective sides of the LAC. These are mutually agreed reciprocal actions to be taken by both sides. This mutual redeployment should not be misrepresented. There is absolutely no change with respect to India’s position on the LAC,” said MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava.Intricate process: ArmyThe two sides remain committed to objective of complete disengagement. This process is intricate and requires constant verification —Col Aman Anand, Army spokesperson The disengagement process currently underway on both sides in eastern Ladakh was specifically aimed at addressing face-off situations and close-up deployments of troops, said the MEA.“The two sides remain committed to the objective of complete disengagement and full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas.” The two sides will continue their diplomatic and military engagements to achieve these outcomes, said the MEA, amply hinting that it was work in progress.The Indian Army said: “Process (of disengagement) was intricate and requires constant verification”. “Rebuilding mutual trust after the June 15 clash at the Galwan valley will take time, therefore speedy disengagement may be difficult to achieve,” said a source.The MEA sought to dispel the impression that the “mutual redeployment” had led to a change in the pre-April situation along the LAC.Both sides have been engaged in discussions through established diplomatic and military channels to address the situation. The process was given an impetus by two hours of talks between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Chinese State Councillor-cum-Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi on July 5.
