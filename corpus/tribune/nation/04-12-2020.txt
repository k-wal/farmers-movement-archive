Media should not be complicit to any narrative that derogates dissent stereotypes protestors based on their attire and ethnicity,” the statement issued by EGI president Seema Mustafa said.

04-12-2020||Islamabad||Pakistan claims it didn’t attempt to link Jadhav case with another Indian prisoner||Pakistan on Friday claimed that it did not make an attempt to link the Kulbhushan Jadhav case with that of another Indian prisoner.The remarks of the Foreign Office (FO) came a day after Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) spokesperson Anurag Srivastava, at a media briefing in New Delhi, said: “Pakistan is trying to link the case of Kulbhushan Jadhav with another prisoner’s case,” asserting that Pakistan has failed to respond on core issues pertaining to the case.After Pakistani media reports claimed that the counsel for the Indian High Commission, Shahnawaz Noon, had told the Islamabad High Court that Deputy Indian High Commissioner Gaurav Ahluwalia wanted to explain India’s stance over appointment of a lawyer for death-row prisoner Jadhav, New Delhi said Noon had made the remarks without any authorisation and appeared to have acted under pressure from the Pakistani establishment.Giving a background to the other case, Srivastava said in a routine consular practice, Noon was selected by the Indian High Commission to appear in the case for release and repatriation of Indian prisoner Mohammad Ismail, who has completed his sentence but continues to be in jail in Pakistan.“However, during proceedings of the case regarding Ismail, Pakistan Attorney General raised the matter pertaining to Jadhav, though the two cases are not connected in any way,” he said.“Mr Noon is reported to have made those statements which are not true and are in contravention of our stand in the case. He appears to have acted under pressure from the Pakistani establishment to make such statements for which he has no authorisation,” Srivastava said.Noon had misrepresented the position of the Indian High Commission, the MEA spokesperson said, adding that he was clearly told by the Indian High Commission that he had no authority to represent either the government of India or Jadhav.The Indian mission in Islamabad has written to Noon reiterating that he has no authority to represent Jadhav and has no basis to suggest that the Indian Charge d’Affaires Ahluwalia would appear in the court.“Pakistan has failed to respond on core issues pertaining to the case, including provision of all documents, providing unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional consular access to Jadhav and this is required to provide the basis for an effective review and reconsideration of the case as ordered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ),” Srivastava said.Reacting to the MEA’s remarks, the FO here termed them as “incorrect and misleading assertions” in the Jadhav case.It said during the course of the proceedings, to show the discrepancy in India’s position, the Attorney-General for Pakistan cited the case of Ismail where the Indian High Commission had instructed Noon as its lawyer.The FO said no attempt was made to link the Jadhav case with that of another Indian prisoner as they were and remain entirely distinct.Pakistan has already provided consular access to the Indian High Commission twice and has taken all necessary steps for effective review and reconsideration in the case, the FO said, adding that the offer for a third consular access is still there.Fifty-year-old retired Indian Navy officer Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017.In 2017, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence handed to him by a military court.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.A Pakistani court was informed on October 6 that India failed to appoint a lawyer to represent Jadhav in the case of the review of his death sentence by a military court in this country.Earlier, Pakistan had again rejected India’s demand that an Indian lawyer or a Queen’s counsel should be appointed for Jadhav to ensure a free and fair trial in the case.India has slammed Pakistan for adopting a “farcical” approach in denying available legal remedies to Jadhav against his death sentence in contravention of the ICJ order.

04-12-2020||Mumbai||Ruling MVA wins 4 of 5 Council seats, BJP loses in Maharashtra’s Nagpur||The one-year-old Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress government in Maharashtra got a shot in the arm on Friday as the ruling coalition won four of the five Legislative Council seats from the Graduates’ and Teachers’ quota.In a setback for the BJP, which lost power in the state after Assembly elections last year, its candidate also lost in Nagpur, a bastion of the saffron party.The biennial elections to the upper house, held on December 1, were a sort of litmus test for the unlikely ‘Maha Vikas Aghadi’ (MVA) of the Shiv Sena and Congress-NCP which came to power after the Sena parted ways with the BJP.The term of five sitting members had ended in July this year but the election was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The NCP’s Satish Chavan defeated the BJP’s Shirish Boralkar to win the Aurangabad Division Graduates’ constituency.In Nagpur Division Graduates’ seat, the Congress’s Abhijit Wanjari trounced the BJP’s Sandeep Joshi.In the past, this seat had been held by BJP stalwart and Union minister Nitin Gadkari.In Pune Division Graduates’ seat, the NCP’s Arun Lad defeated Sangram Deshmukh of the BJP.In Pune Division Teachers’ constituency, Jayant Asgaonkar of the Congress trounced sitting MLC and Independent Dattatraya Sawant.In Amravati Division Teachers’ constituency, Kiran Sarnaik (Independent) defeated sitting MLC and independent Shrikant Deshpande who contested onthe Shiv Sena ticket.Reacting to the results, NCP supremo Sharad Pawar said: “The results are a clear reflection of the MVA’s work in the last one year.”The MVA government led by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray assumed office on November 28 last year.BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said his party failed to gauge the combined strength of the MVA.Another BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said: “We will introspect over the setbacks that the party received in these polls. I think we were caught unawares in this election.”The Maharashtra Legislative Council has total 78 seats, of which 12 are filled from the Governor’s quota and are currently vacant. The MVA has submitted a list of 12 names to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari.The only solace for the BJP was that its candidate Amrish Patel won the by-election to Dhule Nandurbar Local Bodies constituency. Patel had resigned after quitting the Congress and joining the BJP, necessitating the by-election.In the upper house, the BJP at present has 22 members, Shiv Sena 14, NCP nine, Congress eight, RSP, PWP and Lok Bharati party one each, and four are independent legislators.There were 18 vacancies — 12 from governor’s quota, five from teachers’ and graduates’ quota and one from local bodies.

04-12-2020||New Delhi||India kick starts two-day naval drill with Russia in eastern Indian Ocean||India on Friday kick-started a two-day naval exercise with Russia in the eastern Indian Ocean, two weeks after it conducted the Malabar wargames with the US, Australia and Japan.The Russian Navy had deployed its guided-missile cruiser Varyag, large anti-submarine ship Admiral Panteleyev and medium ocean tanker Pechenga for the “passage exercise”, officials said.The Indian Navy has been represented by indigenously constructed guided-missile frigate Shivalik and anti-submarine corvette Kadmatt along with their integral helicopters.“The exercise is aimed at enhancing interoperability, improving understanding and imbibing best practices between both the friendly navies. It would involve advanced surface and anti-submarine warfare exercises, weapon firings, seamanship exercises and helicopter operations,” Indian Navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said.“The passage exercises are conducted regularly by the Indian Navy with units of friendly foreign navies while visiting each other's ports or during a rendezvous at sea,” he said.He said the ongoing exercise reflects the strong long-term strategic relationship between the two countries.“This exercise is being conducted on the occasion of ‘Navy Day’ which emphasises the strong bonds of friendship shared between the two friendly militaries. It would be another step towards strengthening Indo-Russian defence relations,” Commander Madhwal said.Navy Day is celebrated every year on December 4 to commemorate the Indian Navy’s achievement in inflicting heavy damage on Pakistani vessels in Karachi harbour during the India-Pakistan war in 1971.The Indian and the Russian navies conduct a biennial exercise called ‘Indra Navy’ and its last edition took place in the Northern Indian Ocean Region in September.Last month, India held the Malabar exercise. India invited Australia for the exercise, effectively making it a drill by all the Quad member nations.The Quad, comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan, is aimed at ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific, a region that witnessed increasing Chinese military assertiveness in recent years.China has been suspicious about the purpose of the Malabar exercise as it feels that the annual wargame is an effort to contain its influence in the Indo-Pacific region.Notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic, the Indian Navy participated in maritime exercises in the last few months with a number of countries.

The bank alleged that Rs 392 crore were diverted by the company.“Searches are being conducted today at three locations in Delhi at the office and residential premises of borrower company and other accused,” CBI spokesperson R K Gaur said.

04-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||Farm laws: Farmer leaders to attend meeting with Centre on Saturday; also plan to gherao toll plazas||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 4Even before the ‘nirnayak baithak’ (decisive meeting) tomorrow, farmer unions on Friday gave a call for ‘Bharat Bandh’ on December 8.Farmers will also be burning effigies of the Narendra Modi government and corporate houses tomorrow — the day Punjab ‘jathebandis’ and other farmer leaders meet Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar regarding the three contentious farm Acts.Farmers’ leaders, including from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Telangana/Andhra Pradesh and Bengal, today collectively decided that they will go for the meeting tomorrow but will sit through it only if the Centre assures the three laws will be repealed and guarantees MSP on all 23 crops across the country.Incidentally, farmers are also planning to ghearao toll plazas to stop them from charging toll tax on a day announced later.While the Narendra Modi government appears conducive towards some amendments (around nine major issues were identified in yesterday’s meeting) and also give a written assurance on the MSP, it is unlikely to concede to the main demand of a complete roll-back.It now remains to be seen how much the government is willing to pull-back to buy peace.One of the times, the Modi Government did a U-turn on a decision was in 2015 when it agreed to drop most of its contentious amendments to the Land Acquisition Act of 2013.Sources say ministers and officials are holding talks, including with the Law Ministry, to discover a “middle path”.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who again reiterated that the government was open to farmers’ concerns and wanted to end the deadlock soon, said the APMC would not be weakened.“The government is conducive to points raised by farmers in the Acts,” he said, adding “We are making an honest attempt to satisfy the farmers on identified points and resolve the issue.”However, farmer leaders say the government has only two options-either repeal the laws or use force against them in this ‘aar-paar ki ladai’.“We are approaching a historic win and the government historic loss. They know that if they take back the Acts Modi-aura will finish. Tomorrow, we will ask the Centre if it is ready to take back the laws. Only if they are ready, we will talk. It is time for a decision. We need a guarantee on the MSP, whether the government or the private sector buys,” they said.BKU leader Yudhvir Singh said talks tomorrow would only be on taking back laws and not amendments. He was supported by Harvinder Singh Lakhowal, Hannan Mollah, Buta Singh Shadipur and other leaders who asserted that “minor amendments will not work and neither will the government’s divide and rule policy”.“Country’s top 10 trade federations have given us support. This is now a ‘jan andolan’. We do not go there for ‘chai pe charcha’,” said Yogendra Yadav.Regarding security concerns raised by Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, they said: “There is no security threat. We have not done any damage, He (Punjab CM) knows this well. We don’t believe in violence.”With support pouring in from across the country, farmers say they are preparing to completely cut-off Delhi from all sides, asking others to join them as the “fight is expected to be long”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-laws-farmer-leaders-to-attend-meeting-with-centre-on-saturday-also-plan-to-gherao-toll-plazas-179961
04-12-2020||New Delhi||Need for plan to provide COVID vaccine at low costs to all citizens: Congress to Govt||The Congress on Friday raised with the government issues concerning the availability of a prospective COVID-19 vaccine at the grassroots level in the country with party leader Rahul Gandhi asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi to clarify when every Indian will get it.The Congress also asked what would happen to the BJP’s poll promise in Bihar of providing the coronavirus vaccine free of cost to every person in the state.“In today’s all-party meeting, we hope the PM clarifies when will every Indian get a free Covid vaccine,” Gandhi said on Twitter ahead of the all-party meeting chaired by the Prime Minister to discuss the COVID-19 situation.At the virtual all-party meeting, to which floor leaders of various parties in Parliament were invited by the government, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said COVID-like pandemics could pose a threat to the country’s internal security and policy makers should address this challenge.Also read: Covid vaccine will be ready in next few weeks; rollout soon as scientists approve: ModiThe senior Congress leader while addressing the meeting said the country should be well placed to get vaccines at affordable prices and at an early stage and distribute them up to the grassroots level.Prime Minister Modi said at the meeting that experts believe the wait for a COVID-19 vaccine will not be long and it may be ready in a few weeks, asserting that the vaccination drive in India will begin as soon as scientists give the nod.Modi said healthcare workers involved in treating COVID-19 patients, frontline workers including police personnel and municipal staff, and old people suffering from serious conditions would be inoculated on priority.Noting that there have been questions about the price of the COVID-19 vaccine, the Prime Minister said it was natural to have such queries and asserted that public health would be accorded top priority in the matter and the states would be fully involved.In his concluding address at the meeting, Modi sought to address the most significant aspects of the issue — ranging from India’s vaccine readiness to its pricing — and reiterated that in tackling the pandemic the country had done better than even some developed countries and those with better health infrastructure.Taking a swipe at the Prime Minister, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said he had an “obscene sense of priorities” as he was going ahead with spending on the central vista project.“The Prime Minister says that the Centre is in talks with states over the price of vaccines, while he splurges crores and crores on personal vanity projects like new Parliament and Central Vista. Obscene sense of priorities! What happened to the BJP’s Bihar manifesto promise of free vaccines,” he said on Twitter.Azad at the meeting also said “COVID-like pandemics can be one of the greatest threats to the internal security of any country. In the future, policy makers at the national level should include COVID-like pandemics as a threat to internal security, besides external threats and internal insurgencies, if any”.Expressing hope that the country’s pharma manufacturers in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) will get the final nod from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) for a COVID-19 vaccine soon, he said mechanisms for delivery of vaccine at the grassroots level should be ready.“Considering the challenges due to the population and size of the country, we should be well placed to get vaccines at an affordable price and at an early stage,” he told the meeting.Scientists, policy makers and political leaders must work together to set parameters for vaccine prioritisation and distribution, said Azad, a former union health minister.The government must prepare for building capacities for vaccine availability up to the district, community and primary health care levels, the Congress leader said.“We are hopeful that a vaccine will be introduced shortly,” he said.“I am sure by January, our pharmaceutical manufacturers in collaboration with the ICMR will get a final nod from the DCGI,” he said.He also asked the government to deal with issues of storage, distribution, number of dosages, eligibility and side effects of the vaccine.The Congress leader called for putting in place a vaccine safety monitoring mechanism in place to assess the adverse events after immunisation.“There could be adverse effects or side effects or even long term after effects which may need time to be identified and which are not discovered in Phase I, II or phase III clinical trials. India has to be more cautious since we have a large and young population and the government should rigorously monitor the quality, safety and efficacy of the vaccine,” he said.This was the second time that the government convened an all-party meeting to discuss the pandemic situation in the country.

04-12-2020||New Delhi||CSE provides FSSAI details of investigation into honey adulteration business||Environment watchdog CSE on Friday said it shared with FSSAI the details of its investigation into the “well-organised” honey adulteration business.The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) had on Wednesday reported adulteration in honey sold by major brands in the country, adding that any claim by these companies of meeting all Indian standards “holds limited value” and was “jugglery” of language.CSE Director General Sunita Narain emphasised that the investigations had revealed that the honey adulteration business was sophisticated and that it was designed to bypass the purity and quality standards laid down by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).The CSE said in a statement on Friday that it presented to the officials of FSSAI, including Chairperson Rita Teotia and CEO Arun Singhal, the details of the investigation, including the step-by-step developments which brought the food fraud to light.“CSE also showed how Chinese companies were openly advertising products to bypass standards on their website; how it had contacted these companies; and how it had procured the sample,” it said.The environment watchdog said the FSSAI officials asked about the specific names under which the adulterants were being imported into India.The CSE explained that on online trade portals, Chinese companies (the same companies that were exporting to India) were using ‘fructose’ and ‘glucose’ as the key words. The watchdog also provided information about the fact that fructose and glucose were being imported into India - 11,000 tonnes in the past few years. And that the bulk of this was from China.The CSE said the FSSAI officials wanted to know about the tests conducted on the deliberately adulterated syrup samples, which CSE had procured from China and from a factory in Jaspur in Uttarakhand.In India, the syrup was called “all-pass syrup”, CSE explained to FSSAI.The environment watchdog said FSSAI representatives enquired why CSE had not asked for ‘SMR’ - specific marker for rice - in the spiked samples that were sent to the National Dairy Development Board laboratory in Gujarat for testing.The FSSAI officials said SMR was required to detect adulteration by rice syrup and that the other tests, namely isotope ratio tests and foreign oligosaccharides, were unable to detect rice syrup adulteration, according to the CSE statement.“Our research has clearly established that samples adulterated even up to 50 per cent can bypass our testing for C3 and C4 sugar,” Narain said.The FSSAI officials asked about the economics of the syrup and why it would be favoured over natural honey.“The Indian and Chinese syrups offered to us were much cheaper - while the sample cost was between Rs 53-68 per kg, we were told that we could get the sample at much more competitive rates once we placed bulk orders,” Arnab Dutta from CSE who was part of the study explained              Also, he added, there is the element of convenience. This syrup is factory made and can be procured in bulk, as against the honey that would be procured from bee-farms in different locations of the country.FSSAI officials also wanted to know if there was an existing database for Indian honey for effective screening for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) tests. The CSE explained that it had sent the samples for NMR tests to one of the top food testing laboratories of the world, based in Germany, which has the expertise and necessary databases for NMR screening.Based on requests by FSSAI, CSE handed over the samples and documents to allow the regulator to take up the matter expeditiously and ensure that the nefarious business of adulteration is stopped, the statement said.The CSE also stressed the urgency of the matter as it involved health, already compromised in the COVID-19 times.“The adulteration business is a double-whammy for us, as we have increased our honey consumption to boost immunity and that instead of honey we are now ingesting sugar.“We know that overweight people are more at risk to COVID-19 and therefore, it is necessary that this extremely well-organised honey adulteration business, which is so bad for us, is immediately stopped,” Narain asserted.

04-12-2020||New Delhi||Rajnath’s veiled swipe at Pak, says countries unable to protect their sovereignty become like India’s ‘neighbours’||In a veiled swipe at Pakistan, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said countries which were unable to protect their sovereignty and cannot even build roads or do trade on their own become like India’s “neighbours”.Singh’s comments are seen as an indirect reference to Pakistan where China has been rapidly enhancing its influence in an increasing number of areas including trade and infrastructure development.In an address at an online event, Singh also highlighted the effective response by India’s armed forces in dealing with various security threats including the challenge to the country’s territorial integrity or confronting cross-border terrorism.“Countries which are not able to protect their sovereignty become like our neighbours. Those who can neither make their own ‘road’, nor walk on it, nor do trade themselves, nor stop anyone else from doing trade,” he said.China is implementing a $50 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) besides developing the Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea. Several major Chinese companies have been playing a major role in Pakistani economy in the last few years.In his remarks, the Defence Minister also said India’s “brave soldiers” were fearlessly engaged in protecting the country’s borders when people were largely confined to their homes in view of the rising cases of coronavirus.The Indian and the Chinese troops are locked in a tense border standoff in eastern Ladakh for the past seven months. Indian troops had strongly responded to multiple attempts by the Chinese military to intimidate them. Multiple rounds of talks between the two sides have not yielded any concrete outcome to resolve the border standoff.“When COVID-19 cases were on the rise, we sat in our homes helplessly, but our brave soldiers were fearless and bravely engaged in protecting the borders. They not only protected the border with promptness, but also made supreme sacrifice when needed,” he said.Singh further said: “Whether it is to win in multidimensional wars to protect India’s integrity, and sovereignty, or to counter terrorist activities from across the border, our armed forces have responded to challenges with great vigour.”The event was organised by the Kendriya Sainik Board (KSB) on the eve of the Armed Forces Flag Day. The KSB is the apex body of the government that formulates policies for rehabilitation and welfare of ex-servicemen and their dependants.India has been observing December 7 as the Armed Forces Flag Day since 1949 to honour those soldiers who valiantly fought on the borders to safeguard the country’s honour.The Defence Minister also appealed to people to make contributions towards the Armed Forces Flag Day Fund, and even referred to donations made by the citizens during the 1962 war with China.“In the war of 1962, the people of this country had happily donated ‘hot wool to warm blood’ at the call of the nation. There was no count of money or jewellery. This is our feeling towards the nation,” he said.He also mentioned how people of Bardhana Khurd village in Rajasthan had decided that one son from each family would be sent to the border knowing very well what could have been the result of going to the frontier.The government had constituted the Armed Forces Flag Day Fund (AFFDF) for the welfare and rehabilitation of the ex-servicemen (ESM) community.There are more than 32 lakh ex-servicemen and around 60,000 are added each year due to superannuation.“We must come forward with a ‘big’ and ‘open’ mind in fulfilling responsibility towards the security of our nation,” Singh said.

04-12-2020||New Delhi||India biggest buyer of COVID-19 vaccine with 1.6 bn doses, experts say this could cover 60 pc population||India is the largest buyer of COVID-19 vaccines in the world with 1.6 billion doses, according to a global analysis, a number some scientists say could cover 800 million people, or 60 per cent of its population, and will be enough to develop ‘herd immunity'.India has purchased 500 million doses of the Oxford University-AstraZeneca vaccine candidate, one billion from the US company Novavax and 100 million doses of the Sputnik V candidate from Russia's Gamaleya Research Institute, according to the US-based Duke University Global Health Innovation Center. The ‘Launch and Scale Speedometer' analysis, which is updated every two weeks, shows India has confirmed 1.6 billion doses of three vaccines as of November 30 while the US and the EU have purchased doses of six candidates.According to the analysis, India is the top COVID-19 vaccine buyer followed by the European Union which has confirmed 1.58 billion doses and the US, the worst affected country so far, that has managed to purchase just over a billion doses.As countries strategise to secure more shots to protect their populations against the novel coronavirus infection, Duke University has released a new global assessment of purchasing agreements for COVID-19 vaccines, even before any candidates are in the market.“Countries with manufacturing capacity, such as India and Brazil, have been successful in negotiating large advance market commitments with leading vaccine candidates as part of the manufacturing agreements,” the Duke researchers noted in their analysis.    "The data is based on what is in the public domain and after speaking to government officials, especially in India," explained noted virologist Shahid Jameel.In November, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said 400-500 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were estimated to be made available for 250 to 300 million (25 crore to 30 crore) people in India by July-August 2021.Jameel told PTI that all the vaccines ‘pre-booked' by India are manufactured by Indian companies – Oxford-AstraZeneca and Novavax by Serum Institute of India (SII) in Pune and Sputnik V by Dr Reddy's Lab in Hyderabad.India's domestic vaccine candidate by Bharat Biotech also entered Phase 3 clinical trials this week.“Bharat Biotech and Zydus-Cadila would also add about 400 million doses annually. In brief, the numbers appear reasonable over 2021 and 2022,” said Jameel, director of the Trivedi School of Biosciences, Ashoka University.“We can expect the first 250 million to be vaccinated in 2021; the remaining in the following years. The problem will not be vaccine doses, but the ability to deliver them,” Jameel explained.He noted that 1.6 billion doses would cover 800 million people or 60 per cent of India's population. This, the virologist said, should be enough to develop herd immunity,  a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection.The first 500 million doses, the virologist said, are likely to go to 250 million people in the group that includes frontline workers, healthcare workers, sanitation, emergency services, and security services.This group also includes the elderly above 65 and patients with comorbidities.Immunologist Satyajit Rath said there is currently no particularly reliable estimate of the percentage of community coverage needed to be vaccinated in order to reach the point of 'herd immunity'.The reliability of models being used for these estimations is far from clear, he stressed.“Since all the vaccine candidates that are being discussed as purchased have two-dose vaccine regimens, the current number for India would vaccinate, at best, 80 crore (800 million) people. This, of course, does not account for logistical losses, which can be substantial,” Rath, from the National Institute of Immunology (NII)  in New Delhi, told PTI.“Also, this seems to imply that COVID-19 vaccination is a one-time exercise. But it is not clear how long the vaccine-mediated protection will last, and therefore it is not clear when repeat vaccination will be needed, and how that will be delivered,” he added.Flagging some uncertainties about the COVID dose purchases, Rath said he is “curious” about the "confirmed" purchase by India.“Have these been paid for or at least committed to at a given price, are these acquisitions through the COVAX programme or independent of it, and most of all, of course, what is the delivery schedule agreed to in this acquisition, etc.”  Rath also noted that it is difficult to predict how many will be immunised, and when.“The next set of uncertainties I have is whether there are credible and well-worked out plans in India to match these delivery schedules with downstream transport, uptake and actual vaccination, plans for multi-stage transport, multi-point cold storage, provision of injection accessories... , the recording-keeping needed and most of all, the skilled personnel to administer the injections.”  In Rath's view, a certain sector of healthcare workers will likely be immunised in the next few months, as well as a certain proportion of 'first responder' people at high occupational risk of infection.“Beyond that, we are simply whistling in the wind at this stage,” he said.The Duke analysis also found that Canada and the UK have each struck deals for over 350 million doses from seven developers.The analysis doesn't include Russia and China, both of which have their own vaccine programmes for their citizens.The researchers noted that a flurry of nearly 200 COVID-19 vaccine candidates are moving forward through the development and clinical trials processes at unprecedented speed.More than 10 candidates are already in Phase 3 large-scale trials and several have received emergency or limited authorisation.The number of advance market commitments (AMCs) made by countries and multilateral partnerships eager to reserve vaccine supply, even before any candidates are on the market is unprecedented.“High-income countries currently hold a confirmed 3.8 billion doses, upper middle-income countries hold 829 million doses, and lower middle-income countries hold more than 1.7 billion doses,” according to the report.The researchers said they have not been able to find evidence of any direct deals made by low-income countries, suggesting that such countries will be entirely reliant on the 20 per cent population coverage from COVAX.COVAX is a global initiative led by the WHO, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and international vaccine alliance organization Gavi that aims to bring governments and vaccine manufacturers together to ensure all countries have access to COVID-19 vaccines once they become available.Since none of these vaccines are approved, Duke researchers said some of the purchased candidates may prove to be unsuccessful, adding countries that can afford to are purchasing a portfolio of vaccines, in hopes that one or more will get through the regulatory process. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-biggest-buyer-of-covid-19-vaccine-with-1-6-bn-doses-experts-say-this-could-cover-60-pc-population-179952
04-12-2020||Mumbai||Chargesheet filed against Arnab Goswami in 2018 suicide case||The police on Friday filed a chargesheet against Republic TV editor-in-chief Arnab Goswami and two others in a 2018 abetment of suicide case.The chargesheet was filed before a court in Alibaug in neighbouring Raigad district, where the case for alleged abetment of suicide of interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother Kumud has been registered.Besides Goswami, the other two accused named in the chargesheet are Firoze Sheikh and Nitish Sarda, said special public prosecutor Pradeep Gharat.As many as 65 persons are named as witnesses, he added.Incidentally, Goswami had moved the Bombay High Court on Thursday seeking a stay to the filing of charge sheet, but the petition is yet to be heard.Goswami, Sheikh and Sarda were arrested by Alibaug police on November 4 in the case, but they got bail from the Supreme Court on November 11.Anvay Naik and his mother Kumud committed suicide in 2018, allegedly because of non-payment of dues by firms of Goswami and other two accused.The case, closed for want of evidence in 2019, was reopened in May this year, with Goswami alleging that the Maharashtra government was pursuing a vendetta against him for his work as a TV journalist.

04-12-2020||Mumbai||24X7 RTGS from Dec 14; Rs 5,000 new limit for contactless card transactions||In a bid to give a push to digital payments, the Reserve Bank on Friday announced a slew of measures including enhancing the limit for contactless card transactions to Rs 5,000 and making RTGS transaction facility available round the clock from December 14.The RBI has also decided to grant licence to entities operating payments systems on a perpetual basis, and permitted companies to reapply for licence after one year of rejection of their application or revocation of their licence.These were part of the announcements made by RBI Governor Shaktikant Das earlier in the day after the meeting of the central bank's rate setting panel – Monetary Policy Committee. Now the central bank has issued circulars notifying the announcements.On 24x7 availability of Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) System, the RBI said it had been decided "to make RTGS available round the clock on all days of the year with effect from 00:30 hours on December 14, 2020".The RTGS System is used for high value transactions. The NEFT System of payments is already available round the clock.The RTGS will be available for customers and inter-bank transactions round the clock, except for the interval between 'end-of-day' and 'start-of-day' processes, whose timings would be duly broadcast through the RTGS system.The RBI also decided to increase the limit for contactless card transactions to Rs 5,000 from Rs 2,000 at Point of Sale (PoS) terminals from January 1, 2021 in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and feedback from stakeholders.Earlier in the day, the RBI Governor had announced that per transaction limit for Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA) relaxation for contactless card transactions will be increased."Accordingly, given the sufficient protection available to users, it has been decided to increase the per transaction limit to Rs 5,000," read one of the circulars, adding that all other requirements, including the discretion of cardholder to use contactless or contact mode of transaction, would continue to remain applicable.Similarly, the limit for processing e-mandates and standing instructions on cards and Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs) for recurring transactions has been increased to Rs 5,000.In both cases, the existing limit is Rs 2,000 per transaction.In another significant decision, the RBI has decided to grant authorisation for all PSOs (both new and existing) on a perpetual basis, subject to the usual conditions, with an aim to reduce licensing uncertainties and enable them to focus on business as also to optimise utilisation of regulatory resources.For existing authorised Payment System Operators (PSOs), grant of perpetual validity shall be examined as and when the Certificate of Authorisation (CoA) becomes due for renewal.Currently, RBI grants authorisation to new entities desirous of operating a payment system for specified periods up to five years. Similar approach is adopted for renewal of validity of authorisation to existing entities.In another circular related to authorisation of entities for operating a payment system, the RBI said it had been decided to introduce the concept of "cooling period" in certain situations so as to inculcate discipline and encourage submission of applications by serious players as also for effective utilisation of regulatory resources.The cooling period would be for one year from the date of revocation, non-renewal, acceptance of voluntary surrender or rejection of application, as the case may be.In respect of entities whose application for authorisation is returned for any reason by the RBI, the condition of cooling period would be invoked after giving the entity an additional opportunity to submit the application.

He is on bail on an extradition warrant executed three years ago by Scotland Yard on April 18, 2017.The Centre had on October 5 told the apex court that Mallya, a liquor and airlines businessman, cannot be extradited to India until a separate secret legal process in the UK, which is judicial and confidential in nature, is resolved.Acting High Commissioner of the UK Jan Thompson had told reporters here last month that Mallya cannot be extradited to India till the resolution of a confidential legal matter and that it is trying to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.The ED booked Mallya and others under money laundering charges in 2016 after studying a CBI FIR into the alleged bank fraud done by his companies and others.  The agency has attached assets worth Rs 11,231.70 crore (market value at the time of attachment) in this case till now and it has filed multiple FIRs against the accused that includes KAL, United Breweries Holdings Limited (UBHL), some bank officials and others.A special PMLA court in Mumbai had declared him a fugitive economic offender on January 5 last year."Extradition request of Mallya was sent to the UK and the Westminster's Magistrates court has ruled for his extradition on charges of money laundering on December 10, 2018," the ED said."In its order, the court (in UK) has observed that a clear evidence of dispersal and misapplication of the loan funds has been found and prima facie accused Vijay Mallya was involved in a conspiracy to launder money," the probe agency said.Appeals made by Mallya before a UK High Court and later Supreme Court have been rejected, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-seizes-vijay-mallyas-assets-worth-rs-14-crore-in-france-179937

04-12-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||Hyderabad civic body polls: TRS emerges largest party, but fails to get majority; impressive show by BJP||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, December 4 The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has maintained its lead in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) polls, but not without losing a large number of seats to the BJP that has emerged as the second largest party in the GHMC polls. With the TRS securing 56 seats in a House of 150, the saffron party has done well by securing 47 seats, four seats more that the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) that won 43 seats.  The biggest setback has been to the Congress that has managed to get only two seats in the 150 divisions it contested. Trends showed TRS to be the largest party right from the beginning, but its seats fell from 99 in the 2016 polls to just 56 this time, a loss of 43 seats.  The AIMIM managed to retain it share by winning 43 seats, only one less than the 2016 elections. Though the results would formally be declared later at night, the situation is almost clear with the TRS Working President KT Rama Rao (KTR) telling the media that it had accepted the heavy loss in seats despite retaining the number one position in the election.  The aggressive campaigning by the top BJP leadership, including BJP national President JP Nadda, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, UP Chief Minister Yogi Aditya Nath, Union Ministers Prakash Javadekar and Smiriti Irani have paid rich dividends to the party in terms of good results.   The results have put the seats won by the TRS at 56, BJP 47, AIMIM 43 and Congress just 2. The state Congress President Uttam Reddy has submitted his resignation after the debacle of the party. The BJP is the biggest gainer in these elections as its seats have gone up from four in the previous House to 47 now. After the results are formally announced, Mayor's position will go to the TRS and post-poll will see the City get its first woman Mayor.  As the results started pouring in, the City burst into celebrations at the party headquarters of various parties. The TRS Bhawan saw women in traditional dresses dance to frenzied tunes. A similar mood was seen at the BJP’s party office at Nampally. The AIMIM that has almost maintained a status quo has large pockets of strength in the Charminar and old city area. Ballot papers were used in the election to the 150-ward GHMC on December 1.Counting of votes began at 8 am with postal ballots being counted first and BJP was ahead of its rivals in the postal ballot votes.The polling percentage was an unimpressive 46.55.Out of the 74.67 lakh voters, 34.50 lakh electors exercised their franchise.While the ruling TRS fielded candidates in all the 150 wards, BJP set up nominees in 149 wards.The Congress, AIMIM and TDP fielded candidates in 146, 51 and 106 wards, respectively.The civic poll results have served as a big morale booster for the BJP that has four MPs and two MLAs from Telangana. It had won the recent bypolls in Dubbak by defeating the TRS and this led to a renewed vigour among the party leadership and cadres.  The GHMC polls are very important for the Telangana Vidhan Sabha elections as the corporators of the 150 divisions have a direct influence on many seats. These elected representatives can change the fate of nearly 25 per cent candidates in the Assembly elections. Therefore, the GHMC polls are known to be mini-state elections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hyderabad-civic-body-polls-trs-emerges-largest-party-but-fails-to-get-majority-impressive-show-by-bjp-179931
04-12-2020||New Delhi||Chopper scam: SC stays HC order dismissing ED's plea to revoke approver status of Rajiv Saxena||The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the verdict of the Delhi High Court which had dismissed the plea of Enforcement Directorate (ED) to revoke approver status of businessman Rajiv Saxena in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam.A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde issued a notice to Saxena seeking his response on the appeal filed by the ED against the high court’s June 8 judgement.“Issue notice. In the meantime, there shall be a stay of operation of the impugned order,” said the bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.Dubai-based businessman Saxena was extradited to India on January 31 last year in connection with the Rs 3,600-crore scam case relating to the purchase of 12 VVIP helicopters from AgustaWestland.During the hearing conducted through video-conferencing on Friday, Additional Solicitor General Aman Lekhi, appearing for the ED, told the bench that there was a “clear error” on the part of high court as it had said pardon could be revoked only after he deposed as witness.“There is a provision in the CrPC that pardon can be withdrawn if he fails to give any evidence,” the bench observed.The high court, in its verdict, had said the ED’s plea before the trial court for revoking the approver status was not maintainable as his statement under Section 306 (4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) had not been recorded.Section 306 (4) of the CrPC provides for recording of statement of an accomplice who has been granted pardon.The high court had further said once his statement under Section 306 (4) of the CrPC was recorded, the ED could again move an application for revoking Saxena’s approver status.The ED had sought revocation of Saxena’s approver status in the high court claiming that he had undertaken to disclose all facts related to the offence but he was not doing so.The probe agency had challenged the trial court order, which had refused to revoke Saxena’s approver status, in the high court.The ED, in its plea before the trial court, had said while seeking pardon, Saxena had said he would make full disclosure of the facts within his knowledge and his statement was recorded in March last year after which he was granted pardon.The agency had said Saxena was allowed to be an approver by the trial court subject to his making full and true disclosure of the whole of circumstances within his knowledge relating to the offence.The ED had alleged that Saxena had very strategically withheld and not disclosed full and true facts which were within his knowledge relating to the commission of the offence and had deliberately hidden and fabricated certain documents to shield the other co-accused, which was contrary to the terms of the grant of pardon granted by the trial court.

A call for Bharat Bandh has also been given for December 8.The decision was taken by 51 representatives of farmer unions, under the banner of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, in a marathon meeting held at the Singhu border to discuss the proceedings of the meetings with a ministerial delegation on Thursday, and strategise their next course of action.Unhappy with the BJP ministerial delegation insisting on making amendments to the farm laws, the farmers have decided that though they would go for the next round of talks with the government in Delhi on Saturday, they would initiate dialogue only after the Centre assures that the three contentious laws will be repealed and the MSP on crops will get a Constitutional guarantee.They are also demanding that no amendments be made to the Electricity Act.Farmers across the country will emulate the “Punjab model” of protest by ghearaoing all toll plazas in the country run by corporates and stop them from charging the toll tax from commuters, they said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-to-intensify-stir-call-for-bharat-bandh-on-dec-8-179918

It was caused mostly due to wintry conditions with particulate matters hanging in the air and a large number of vehicles hitting the roads," he said.AQI between 401 and 500 is designated as 'severe' and affects healthy people and seriously impacts those with existing diseases, causing respiratory difficulties, environmentalist S M Ghosh said."It is caused by the plying of a large number of diesel-run commercial vehicles, use of coal-fired chulha (clay stove) by roadside eateries and garbage burning at dumping yards," he said.The air quality turned 'very poor' (301-400) in other parts of the city. It can aggravate asthma and other respiratory conditions.Ballygunge recorded AQI of 309, Bidhan Nagar 320, Fort William 324, Victoria Memorial 314 and Jadavpur 303."Due to garbage burning and a higher number of vehicles on the roads, such situations may arise during the onset of winter."The PCB is taking steps like banning coal-fired chulha and old commercial vehicles in the city. The board is also using water sprinkler vehicles to prevent the accumulation of dust in the air," the official added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kolkatas-air-quality-deteriorates-to-very-poor-179913

In the future, policy makers at the national level should include COVID-like pandemics as a threat to internal security, besides external threats and internal insurgencies, if any,” Azad said at the meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The Congress leader called for putting in place a vaccine safety monitoring mechanism to assess long-term adverse effects after immunisation.The former Union minister said that scientists, policy makers and political leaders must work together on COVID-19 vaccine prioritisation and distribution.

04-12-2020||Coimbatore||Keyhole surgery performed on 4-month-old boy with large head||Doctors in a city hospital have saved a four-month-old baby with a large head by a path-breaking keyhole endoscopic bran surgery.The premature baby with a large abnormal head and neurological deficits was referred to KMCH for expert management.The baby, one of the twins weighing only 800 grams at the time of birth, showed a progressive increase in head-size and down-rolling eyeballs and abnormal limb movements that alarmed the parents to seek medical advice.The baby was seen by a team of doctors and evaluated the newborn with MRI and diagnosed the child with having congenital hydrocephalous, a condition in which the fluid cavities were dilated abnormally with locked-up brain fluid called cerebro spinal fluid, a KMCH press release said on Friday.This profound locked-up fluid in the natural cavities produces unprecedented pressure exerted on the neural tissue leading to neurological deficits, incapacitating the baby and finally leads to death, the release said.This condition that may not be treated with medical management warranted diversion of the fluid from the cavities immediately to save the child.While the baby that recovered from COVID-19 on admission was found to have abnormal electrolyte disturbances and that was effectively managed in the neonatal intensive care unit.Dr J. K. B. C. Parthiban, senior neurosurgeon and course director of National Board of Education for Neurosurgery at KMCH, performed a keyhole endoscopic brain surgery to divert the locked-up fluid within the drainage system thus bypassing the congenital block in the cavities.This technique is unique in establishing normal fluid circulation in the brain and reduces the pressure in the cavities.The conventional tube surgery done using a long silicon tube diverting the fluid from brain cavities to the abdominal cavity is thus avoided in this baby, the release said.Subsequent to the procedure the baby's neurological status improved remarkably, with near normal eye and limb movements to the delight of the parents. The keyhole surgery is called endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an established endoscopic procedure and not new.The technique is challenging but good for patients, particularly in this type of cases where the baby was underweight at birth and emaciated and post-COVID-19 status.The procedure can be done in neonates, babies less than one year of age, comfortably.Risk of any surgical procedure in premature babies before four months is a great challenge and can be done only with a team work, Parthiban said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/keyhole-surgery-performed-on-4-month-old-boy-with-large-head-179909

04-12-2020||Bengaluru||Karnataka likely to impose curbs on new year celebrations||The Karnataka government on Friday indicated it is likely to impose curbs on public celebrations ahead of the new year, while ruling out the possibility of night curfew for now, amid an experts' panel report expecting a second wave of COVID-19 in early 2021.The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) for COVID-19 in the state has indicated the possibility of the second wave of the pandemic during January-February, and has recommended banning new year public celebrations in the last two weeks of this month till January 1 and to impose night curfew in the period.Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa in response to a question from reporters about the possibility of imposing a night curfew said "...there is no such plans for now." Health Minister K Sudhakar along with officials today held a meeting with TAC members on their advisory/recommendations to control the second wave.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Sudhakar too said, there was no question of any curfew as there is no need for it now.But people will have to follow the guidelines like social distancing, control unnecessary large gatherings at places including marriages, he said.Responding to a question on new year celebrations, especially at places in Bengaluru where large numbers of people gather, he said, not only Brigade or MG Road, TAC has said that in the entire state from December 20 to January 2, all kinds of events have to be prohibited, and a decision on this will be taken soon."When the government appointed TAC has given advice we will have to take it seriously.We will discuss with the Chief Minister and announce our final decision," he said.On opening of pubs, bars during these days, the minister said a decision will be taken after going through the report and discussing with senior officials and consulting the Chief Minister.The TAC, consisting of expert doctors and specialists, was constituted in March and from then till now it has held 54 meetings.The committee has made a slew of recommendations in a bid to avert a crisis emerging out of the possible second wave after studying a similar outbreak in various places across the world.The TAC has said the next 45 days were crucial and mentioned the need to take certain control measures that were taken during the lockdown and unlock phase during the period, he said.Until there is a clear vaccine, all the precautionary measures and guidelines need to be followed, he asserted.As of December 3 evening, cumulatively 8,89,113 COVID-19 positive cases have been confirmed in the state, which includes 11,821 deaths and 8,52,584 discharges.Sudhakar said the first wave of COVID-19 in the state was declining as the positivity rate has now come down to 1.2 per cent and the reproduction number (R0) has also come down to 0.46 per cent."So the first wave's curve has flattened... the gap between the first curve and the second curve is about 40-90 days, when we look at other countries or states…," he said.The TAC has asked the state to keep ready by first week of January, clinical facilities at October level (when daily cases were about 10,000 per day) in terms of beds, ICUs, ventilators, and so on, both in government and private hospitals or this could be ramped up at a short notice of 2-3 days maximum.Noting that a minimum of 1.25 lakh tests per day should continue till the end of February 2021, of which one lakh shall be RT-PCR (1:5 pooled in lab as per state protocol), the TAC has recommended fortnightly testing of all teachers, pupils, and staff in educational institutions, Anganwadi staff, and others by RT-PCR.On opening of schools and pre-university colleges, the minister said a decision is likely to be takaen during a meeting under the Chief Minister's leadership in December third or fourth week.Conceding that a large number of people are gathering at political events ahead of gram panchayat polls in the state, Sudhakar said: "We politicians and also all the political parties need to understand their responsibilities.""Regarding panchayat polls I had written to the state election commission informing about the TAC's view that the polls may lead to door delivery of virus.If the elections were not held till March certain things could have been controlled.The Commission and courts had to take this seriously," he said.The state election commission has announced polls to 5,762 gram panchayats in the state in two phases on December 22 and 27, after the High Court recently providing three weeks time, had asked it to announce the schedule. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karnataka-likely-to-impose-curbs-on-new-year-celebrations-179898

We are looking to find out what happens in Saturday's meeting," Tikait told PTI.Delhi's border points remained choked as thousands of farmers from Haryana, Punjab, and other states held demonstrations for the ninth consecutive day, after talks between three union ministers and a representative group of agitating farmers failed to yield any resolution on Thursday.The two sides are scheduled to meet on Saturday again.The farmer community has expressed apprehension that the new laws are "anti-farmer", and would pave the way for dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporations.     However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hope-govt-will-meet-demands-else-farmers-protest-will-continue-says-tikait-179896

At places, they were involved in the standoff for 17 to 20 hours throughout the intervening nights.The ITBP troops not only effectively used shields to protect themselves, but also responded fiercely to PLA advancing troops and brought the situation under control, he had said, while announcing the names of 21 personnel for gallantry awards for their action during faceoffs and skirmishes with Chinese troops in May-June 2020 along the Himalayan frontier.The stand-off between the two nations in Ladakh is continuing for the past seven months after China unilaterally attempted to change the status quo along the LAC and deployed a large number of troops in the region.This action was mirrored by the Indian side and despite several rounds of talks between commanders of both sides, there are no visible signs of de-escalation.Ane-La, Chip-Chap, Rango, Yula, Mukhpri, Daulat, Charding, Srijap, Chung-Thung, Chang-Chenmo, Imis, Sultan-Chusku and Khardungi are other names approved for the pups.These are border posts and other locations in the vicinity of the LAC.About three months ago, two ITBP bitches, Olga and Oleshya had given birth to 17 pups that were sired by another ITBP dog, Gala. All three canines, of the Malinois breed, are veterans of counter-insurgency and Anti-Naxal operations.ITBP was the first Force to deploy Malinois dogs in left-wing extremism hit areas a decade ago, and now they have also started scientifically breeding K9s to meet own demands and provide pups to other CAPFs and state police forces as mandated by the Ministry of Home Affairs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/itbp-names-its-new-born-k-9-warriors-after-flash-points-along-lac-in-ladakh-179894

04-12-2020||New Delhi||Honey adulteration: Food regulator meets CSE experts to discuss data||The Indian food regulator is holding a meeting with the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) experts on Friday after the organization revealed that 10 of the 13 major honey brands in domestic markets failed the test of purity.Speaking to The Tribune, CEO of the Food Safety and Standards Association of India Arun Singhal said, that the regulator welcomed the role of CSE in focusing attention on the issue of food safety and would engage them tomorrow to see whether existing test protocols needed any changes.The CSE, meanwhile, defended its findings after Patanjali accused them of promoting German technology Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, that they used for detecting adulterants after deliberately spiking samples.“The findings are now about big brands, including Dabur. We have talked about how smaller brands are also adulterated. This is consumer’s health,” said, CSE Director General, Sunita Narain.CSE on Thursday said FSSAI's testing parameters for honey could not detect any adulteration. “The fact that samples deliberately adulterated by us by up to 50 per cent of syrups passed all Indian tests is a robust proof of this,” said Narain noting, that NMR was an advanced test to detect adulteration with modified sugar syrups and was used worldwide.FSSAI, however, said: “Almost no food regulator globally has so far mandated NMR as a test method for honey.”“Prior existence of a broad honey database is a necessity for effective use of NMR. No such database exists in India and so NMR testing will have limited utility. The cost of conducting it is also quite high,” said FSSAI.The regulator also said, that while CSE has spoken about no use of Trace Marker for Rice syrup (TMR) for detecting rice syrup adulteration in honey, the “fact is a more sensitive Specific Marker for Rice syrup test (SMR) has already been made mandatory in India and it can test adulteration.”Regarding fructose adulteration, which CSE has flagged went undetected by Indian tests, FSSAI said, that India was already using sensitive tests for detection of fructose in honey.“We will see what methods CSE used and then take a call on whether Indian testing standards for honey need to be reviewed,” said Singhal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/honey-adulteration-food-regulator-meets-cse-experts-to-discuss-data-179890
04-12-2020||New Delhi||Sitharaman commends DRI for seizures during pandemic||Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday commended the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) for its stellar work during the Covid pandemic, especially when India was in complete lockdown."You did not allow exports and imports to suffer ….there was smooth flow of imports at the cost of exposing yourself. You have rendered great service at unusually challenging times,’’ said the Finance Minister while speaking at the virtual celebrations of DRI’s 63rd founding day.The event was attended by the World Customs Organisation DG Kunio Mikuriya who delivered the opening address.Sitharaman noted that even at the cost of exposing themselves to the pandemic, the 800-strong DRI had managed to capture contraband and arrest people, thus making sure offenders were not given leeway despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic.Putting the DRI’s role in perspective, she said physical borders are clearly demarcated and well-trained soldiers protect them. In the case of customs and revenue intelligence, economic borders are drawn "with a line so thin you don’t know at what level the economic zone ends'', she said.The DRI acted upon whatever actionable intelligence was given to it.Because of social media, information about successful seizures and arrests were brought into public domain though it brought greater risk to the security and safety of DRI staff in the field. At the same time, this publicity helped people realise the many ways in which the country's economic security was being threatened.Dwelling on the number of seizures of drugs and gold, the Minister wondered if the country is dealing with the tip of the iceberg. "We have to be very alert. We can’t feel we have succeeded in stopping every one of them. Every one of them will have to be stopped,’’ she observed.She called on the DRI personnel to remain on their toes to make sure that the Indian economy finds resurgence and can become the engine of global growth.The DRI awarded the bravery medal to T S Najibuddin, a contract employee in Kerala, who is on crutches after smugglers rammed their car into his trailing motorcycle and dragged him and another officer for 20 metres. It also honoured Sumer Sen of Rajasthan for braving bullets to help seize 5.5 kgs of gold in September. Since then he has been recuperating at home with a bullet lodged inside his body.The DRI also honoured its former officer, B Shankaran, with a distinguished services medal. Shankaran had lived up to the DRI motto of "Invisible presence and visible results’’, said the citation.Along with senior DRI officer Vivek Chaturvedi, the occasion was also addressed by Union Finance Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, CBIC Chairman Ajit Kumar and Principal DG NRI C Balesh Kumar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sitharaman-commends-dri-for-seizures-during-pandemic-179888

The @indiannavy is at the forefront of keeping our seas safe by ensuring maritime security. I salute their valour, courage and professionalism," Singh said.Chief of Army Staff Gen MM Naravane, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh and Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria paid their tributes to the country's fallen heroes at the National War Memorial on the occasion of the Navy Day.Navy Day is celebrated every year on December 4 to commemorate the Indian Navy's achievement in inflicting heavy damage on Pakistani vessels in Karachi harbour during the India-Pakistan war in 1971. In a message, Admiral Singh reaffirmed the Navy's steadfast commitment to ensure India's maritime security and territorial integrity.The Indian Navy has increased its surveillance missions and beefed up operational deployment in the Indian Ocean in the wake of increasing forays into the region by Chinese naval vessels and submarines."On the occasion of #NavyDay2020 we reaffirm #IndianNavy's steadfast commitment to the service of the Nation and towards ensuring our maritime security & territorial integrity," Admiral Singh said.A number of union ministers, diplomats and prominent personalities conveyed their greetings to the Indian Navy on the occasion of the Navy Day.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, in a tweet, said his ministry has been a close partner of the Navy in securing India's interest abroad and that both sides have jointly delivered on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief that has enhanced the country's stature. "Look forward to continuing this partnership," he said.US Ambassador Ken Juster too conveyed greetings to the Indian Navy and mentioned last month's "successful" Malabar naval exercise. "On behalf of the U.S. Mission in India, a very happy #NavyDay to @IndianNavy.We thank you for hosting the US, Japan, and Australia for this year's successful Malabar Exercise and look forward to continued growth in the #USIndiaDefense partnership. Sham No Varunah!," he tweeted. India had invited Australia to be part of the Malabar exercise this year that effectively made it a drill by all the Quad member nations. The Quad, comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan, is aimed at ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific, a region that witnessed increasing Chinese military assertiveness in the recent years.At a press conference on Thursday, Admiral Singh said that Indian Navy remained steadfast in protecting India's maritime interests."In these testing times, the Indian Navy aims to stand steadfast as a combat-ready, credible and cohesive force furthering our national and maritime interests," he said.

04-12-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Comments by Trudeau and others: Canada High Commissioner told not to interfere in India’s internal affairs||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 4Canadian High Commissioner Nadir Patel was summoned to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Friday and informed that comments by the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, some cabinet ministers and Members of Parliament on issues relating to Indian farmers “constitute an unacceptable interference in our internal affairs”.“Such actions, if continued, would have a seriously damaging impact on the ties between India and Canada,” the MEA warned Patel.The Government has viewed these comments as having encouraged gatherings of extremist activities in front of the Indian High Commission and Consulates in Canada that raise issues of safety and security.“We expect the Canadian Government to ensure the fullest security of Indian diplomatic personnel and its political leaders to refrain from pronouncements that legitimise extremist activism,’’ said an MEA note.On the occasion of Gurpurab, Trudeau had veered from greeting Punjabis saying, “I would be remiss if I didn’t start also by recognising the news coming out of India about the protest by farmers. The situation is concerning and we’re all very worried about family and friends.’’The MEA had at that time itself unfavourably viewed Trudeau’s remarks on the farmers’ stir.Trudeau is the first world head of government to comment on the protest by Indian farmers.MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had then referred to “some ill-informed comments by Canadian leaders” relating to farmers in India and said they were “unwarranted”. Srivastava was also targeting Canadian ministers Navdeep Bains and Harjit Sajjan whose comments had preceded those of the Canadian PM.Trudeau indicated that his government’s concerns about the protest had been conveyed to South Block but Srivastava said “it is also best that diplomatic conversations are not misrepresented for political purposes”.Trudeau’s observations on the farmers’ stir came during a Facebook video interaction on Gurpurab. Ministers Bains and Sajjan, also critical of the handling of the farmers’ stir, along with several of the 18 Sikh Canadian MPs, had joined the interaction.The thrust of his opening address was on underlining Guru Nanak’s teachings of compassion, equality and selfless service, which, he said, were at the heart of both Sikhism and Canadian values.But Trudeau spent considerable time on the farmers’ stir. “I know that’s a reality for many of you. Let me remind you, Canada will always be there to defend the right of peaceful protest. We believe in the importance of dialogue and that’s why we’ve reached out through multiple means directly to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns,” he said.Sources here said Trudeau’s observations were aimed at his domestic constituency of which the Indian-origin diaspora was a major part. His hold on the Sikh community is under challenge by Jagmeet Singh Dhaliwal-led New Democratic Party.The MEA initially downplayed Trudeau’s comments since they were made at a time when New Delhi is actively soliciting investment from Canada’s deep-pocketed pension funds.Modi had recently virtually addressed an Indo-Canadian business gathering which was seen as a repairing of ties as New Delhi thought Ontario was soft on Sikh separatists.Earlier last month, a “virtual trade mission to Canada” had featured Canadian minister John Hannaford, Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan and the two respective High Commissioners Nadir Patel and Ajay Bisaria.But the demonstrations at the Indian High Commission and consulates in Canada may have tested MEA’s patience.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/comments-by-trudeau-and-others-canada-high-commissioner-told-not-to-interfere-in-indias-internal-affairs-179879
04-12-2020||New Delhi||Naidu releases postage stamp in former PM IK Gujral's honour||Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu on Friday virtually released a commemorative postage stamp to honour former Prime Minister IK Gujral on his 101st birth anniversary.Naidu recalled the former prime minister's contributions to the country, including the "Gujral Doctrine".Recalling the yeoman services rendered by Gujral to the country's progress, Naidu described him as a "great son of a great country".Naidu said the former premier was well endowed with endearing qualities of head and heart, and his courteous attributes had won him friends across-the-board.He said in public life there are "rivals", not "enemies"- a lesson which the present generation of politicians should imbibe.Referring to the protean attributes of Gujral, Naidu said he was "soft-spoken", " a gentle politician", "courteous to a fault", but one who never compromised on his high principles.The younger generation should take inspiration from the life and principles of Gujral.He referred to the "Gujral Doctrine" -- a clutch of organising principles for coordinating better relationships with smaller countries. Everyone should abide by the country's policies.Gujral was the progenitor of these principles as External Affairs Minister when Deve Gowda occupied the prime minister's post.Naidu, however, underlined that foreign policy cannot be static and it evolves in a dynamic situation.He said India is facing cross-border terrorism like every other nation.The South Asian nations must eradicate the scourge of terrorism.Naidu lauded the farmers of the country for their determination in pursuing their avocation of agriculture against all odds during the Covid-19 enforced lockdown and made a case for helping them, including remunerative prices for their crops.Underlining the contribution of farmers, Naidu said, "We must address their problems."He pitched for remunerative prices for their crops and infrastructural support."Work have been done...more needs to be done."Naidu batted for gender-equality and wanted more women participation in governance and policymaking to take the country forward.He noted that women were underrepresented in state Legislatures, Parliament and Judiciary."Quality is defined not by physical attributes, but cognitive faculties."Rajya Sabha member of the SAD, Naresh Gujral said the former premier joined public life from his student days.Former Chairman of National Commission for Minorities Tarlochan Singh, who had written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposing the commemorative postage on Gujral, thanked the Union government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/naidu-releases-postage-stamp-in-former-pm-ik-gujrals-honour-179878

The estimated total amount is USD 90 million.The Pentagon said that the proposed sale ensures the previously procured aircraft operate effectively to serve the needs of the Indian Air Force (IAF), the Army and the Navy transport requirements, local and international humanitarian assistance, and regional disaster relief.This sale of spares and services will enable the IAF to sustain a mission-ready status with respect to the C-130J transport. India will have no difficulty absorbing this additional sustainment support, it said.According to the Pentagon, the proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region. The prime contractor will be Lockheed-Martin Company, Marietta, Georgia.In a major move in 2016, the US had designated India a "Major Defence Partner" intending to elevate defence trade and technology sharing to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners.

04-12-2020||Ahmednagar (Maharashtra)||Dress code in Shirdi Temple not new or compulsory: Official||The Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust (SST) on Friday said that the 'civilized dress code' suggested for darshan at the world-famous temple is neither new nor compulsory, but devotees must "cover their legs at least below the knees and arms till the elbows".Referring to an ultimatum issued by social activist and leader of Bhumata Ranragini Brigade (BRYZ President Trupti Desai, the SSST chief spokesperson Rajaram Thete said the civilized dress code is voluntary in nature and suggested way back in 2005."The old board at the temple gates got faded and damaged, so last month we erected a new one. Some people have misinterpreted it as a new dress code... It has been in existence since over 15 years. This seems to be just a publicity stunt," Thete told IANS.He said that many people come under-dressed which lowers the dignity of the temple, and there been scores of complaints by other devotees."This request is purely seeking peoples' cooperation to come properly attired, covering their legs at least below the knees and arms till the elbows, as desired in Indian culture and in keeping with the atmosphere here," Thete explained.In the past few years, many devotees, especially some women turn up in bare shorts or sleeveless tops, which others found distracting and disturbing in the long queues for darshan of Saibaba, a volunteer at the temple said.The Pune-based Desai has shot off a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray demanding action against the SSST authorities for violating people's democratic rights besides insulting them.Serving a deadline of December 10 to the temple management by which they must remove the alleged dress code, she warned of an agitation at the Shirdi temple when they would go and remove the board.Desai further demanded that since the temple priests (pujaris) are also half-clad, would the SSST ask them to be properly attired, but the temple authorities declined to react.Reopening after the pandemic lockdown in late-November, the Shirdi Temple now permits around 10,000 devotees daily, strictkly implementing all Covid-19 protocols.Prior to the lockdown, the temple normally attracted 100,000-plus devotees from all over the world daily with all its services available virtually round-the-clock.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dress-code-in-shirdi-temple-not-new-or-compulsory-official-179873

It will be ready in the next few weeks. As soon as we get the nod from scientists to proceed, vaccination will start. Priority in vaccination will be given to health workers, frontline workers and elders with pre-existing serious diseases,” the PM said.Also read: Need for plan to provide COVID vaccine at low costs to all citizens: Congress to GovtHe said the Centre was talking to states on vaccine pricing and the same would be determined with public and national good in mind.The PM also hailed Indian scientific community saying “they are reassured and are brimming with confidence about vaccine progress”.Listing eight potential Covid vaccine candidates, the PM said though many vaccines had been unveiled, the world is still looking at India for a low-cost efficacious vaccine.“There are eight potential vaccines in different stages of development which are to be manufactured in India. India’s own three candidates are under development,” he said.The PM also assured the nation of national capacity to scale up production and distribution of the COVID vaccine saying India’s vaccine distribution network was unparalleled in the world and assessment of additional need of cold chains and logistics is being done.Guaranteeing transparency in vaccination as and when ready, the PM said the government had developed an online platform COVIN which will offer real-time data on COVID vaccine beneficiaries, stocking and utilisation.In an important appeal to political parties, the PM said they must warn people against potential circulation of myths around COVID vaccine.“We must guard against any fake news in respect of the COVID vaccine,” the PM said.He said from the “anxious and fearful times of February and March to the atmosphere of hope in December India has come a long way in the fight against the pandemic”.“We have done better than many countries by basing our decisions on science. India has a very high daily testing rate, very high national recovery rate and very low mortality rate,” he noted saying India’s resilience in the face of COVID remains unmatched globally.The PM also cautioned people against any laxity in practising Covid-appropriate behaviour saying “laxity can squander current gains”.The PM says that the Centre is in talks with states over the price of vaccines, while he splurges crores and crores on personal vanity projects like new Parliament and Central Vista.

They also said that National Highway-44 was closed on both sides.They instructed commuters to take alternative routes via National Highway-8, Bhopra, Apsara border, and Peripheral expressway."Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba & GTK road. Avoid Outer Ring Rd , GTK road, NH 44," the Delhi Traffic Police tweeted.According to the police, Tikri and Jharoda borders are closed for any traffic movement while Badusarai border is open only for light motor vehicles like cars and two wheelers. Jhatikara border is open only for two-wheelers, it said.However, if anyone needs to commute towards Harayana, they can go via Dhansa, Daurala, Kapashera, Rajokri National Highway-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera Borders, the police said."The Chilla border on Noida link road is closed for traffic from Noida to Delhi due to farmers protests near Gautam Budh Dwar.

04-12-2020||Lucknow||Lucknow police stop marriage of Hindu woman and Muslim man with families' consent||Police in Lucknow stopped an interfaith marriage, which was taking place with the consent of both the families, leading to anger against the anti-conversion law.The police intervened just before the rituals began."This is exactly what is going to happen now. The police will decide whether a marriage can take place or not. The courts have said that no one can stop consenting adults from living together but with this law, it is the police that will take a call," said Maroof Ali, a young techie.Shirish Gupta, a relative from bride's side, was equally upset."The marriage was taking place in the presence of both the families but the police stopped the ceremonies. The guests were sent back without dinner. Could have never imagined such an incident would take place in Independent India," he said.A Muslim cleric, who did not wish to be named, said: "Our apprehensions have come true sooner than expected. The police are now running the state and individual freedom has been mopped up by this new law."According to reports, a Hindu Mahasabha district president Brijesh Shukla had submitted a complaint about the wedding in writing.The police reached the venue on Wednesday night where Raina Gupta, 22, was to marry her childhood friend Mohammad Asif, 24.The wedding was to be first solemnised according to Hindu rituals and then as per Muslim tradition.Additional DCP (South Zone) Suresh Chandra Rawat said: "When the police reached the venue, they found that preparations were underway to conduct marriage rituals as per Hindu traditions. Later, the wedding was to be solemnised through Muslim rituals. The wedding was taking place with the consent of both families, but the planned religious ceremonies could not have been conducted without conversion." The ADCP said the marriage was stopped in accordance with Sections 3 and 8 (clause two) of the recently promulgated Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, which states that nobody should convert or attempt to convert directly or otherwise any person from one religion to another "by use or any practice of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage".Abetment, convincing or conspiring to carry out such conversion is also punishable under the new law.No FIR has been lodged in the matter since the couple had the consent of both families.Vijay Gupta, the bride's father, said that there was no forced religious conversion for the marriage and that both families had unconditionally given their consent to the union."I was unaware, until the police told us, that even after consent from all  the parties, an interfaith marriage can be held only with the district magistrate's approval." Raina and Mohammad Asif can now marry only after two months from the date of informing the District Magistrate.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lucknow-police-stop-marriage-of-hindu-woman-and-muslim-man-with-families-consent-179856

04-12-2020||New Delhi||DSGMC sends legal notice to Kangana Ranaut over 'derogatory' tweets against farmers||The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) has sent a legal notice to actor Kangana Ranaut, seeking an unconditional apology for her "derogatory" tweets against farmers and activists involved in the protest against the Centre's farm laws, the committee's president said on Friday.The Bollywood star, who is known for her combative comments, was also asked to remove the particular tweets."We have sent a legal notice to @KanganaTeam for her derogatory tweet calling the aged mother of a farmer as a woman available for Rs 100. Her tweets portray farmers protest as anti-national. We demand an unconditional apology from her for her insensitive remarks on farmers protest," Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president of DSGMC, said in a tweet. Earlier this week, Ranaut misidentified a woman farmer from Punjab as Bilkis Bano, the octogenarian who made international headlines during the anti-CAA protests earlier this year in the Delhi neighbourhood of Shaheen Bagh.She shared a tweet alleging that the 'Shaheen Bagh dadi' also joined the farmers' agitation over the new agri laws at various border points of the national capital.She retweeted the post with pictures of two elderly women, including Bilkis Bano, and wrote that the "same Dadi" who featured in Time Magazine was "available in 100 rupees". Ranaut was also embroiled in a bitter war of words with actor-singer Diljit Dosanjh over the matter on Thursday. Thousands of farmers have gathered at Delhi's gateways to demand a repeal of the Centre's three new farm laws. The protesting farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana as well as Uttar Pradesh, are worried the new laws will eliminate the safety cushion of a Minimum Support Price and procurement system, while rendering ineffective the mandi system that ensures earnings for various stakeholders in the farm sector. The government has been in talks with farmer leaders to resolve the issue.

04-12-2020||Washington||US House of Representatives passes legislation to promote Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr’s legacies||The US House of Representatives has passed a legislation that would establish an exchange initiative between the US and India to study the work and legacies of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.Written by civil rights icon John Lewis, who died early this year, and co-sponsored by Indian-American Congressman Ami Bera, the Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act authorises the State Department, in cooperation with the Indian government, to establish an annual educational forum for scholars from both countries that focuses on the legacies of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.“This legislation honours the long-standing relationship between the US and people of India and advance his teachings and establish a development foundation that would allow India and the US to work together to address pressing issues like climate change, education and public health,” Congressman Eliott Engel, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on the House floor on Thursday.“Just like Gandhi and Dr King, Congressman Lewis shaped the world through his actions of non-violence and his commitment to human rights, equality, and justice for all. The Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act is a fitting tribute to the incredible life and legacy of John Lewis,” said Bera, the longest-serving Indian American lawmaker.“As the world's oldest and largest democracies, the US and India have long traditions of upholding these shared values championed by figures like Gandhi, King, and Congressman Lewis,” he said.“But they are increasingly under threat in both countries. I'm proud the House of Representatives passed this legislation, which will help these values endure and remind us that by holding true to them, we embody and live up to the best of our two nations,” Bera said.In 2009, Congressman Lewis led a congressional delegation visit to India to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Dr King Jr's pilgrimage to India.Inspired by his visit, Congressman Lewis created the Gandhi-King Exchange Act to seek to apply the philosophies of Gandhi and Dr King Jr to conflict resolution efforts and current policy challenges.The legislation also authorises to develop a professional development training initiative on conflict resolution based on the principles of non-violence; and establish a foundation to address social, environmental and health priorities in India.The measure authorises USD one million a year through fiscal 2025 for the Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative. It authorises USD 2 million for FY 2021 for the Gandhi-King Global Academy, and USD30 million for 2021 for the US-India Gandhi-King Development Foundation.The development foundation would also be authorised at USD 15 million per year from 2022 through 2025 - but only if India's private sector commits to match US government contributions. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the bill would cost USD 51 million over five years.Congressman Michael McCaul said that after years of working with India to address their development challenges, the United States has seen impressive results. "The best result so far is that India which once was a recipient of foreign aid is now a donor. This is true when it comes to improving water sanitation, increasing education and empowering women," McCaul said.

The visuals represent the ultimate callousness and insensitivity towards the dignity of the dead, repeatedly affirmed by this court as a non-negotiable right at the pinnacle in the hierarchy of fundamental rights,” the former Law Minister’s letter read. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ex-law-minister-writes-to-cji-on-dog-nibbling-at-girls-body-in-up-hospital-179630

The UN General Assembly has failed to acknowledge the rising hatred and violence against Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism, and underlined that the culture of peace cannot be only for “Abrahamic” religions, said Indian diplomat Ashish Sharma while addressing the UN General Assembly session on ‘Culture of Peace’.India fully agreed that anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and anti-Christian acts needed to be condemned. India also firmly condemns such acts, but UN resolutions on such important issues spoke only of these three Abrahamic religions together.“This august body fails to acknowledge the rise of hatred and violence against Buddhism, Hinduism and Sikhism also. Culture of peace cannot be only for Abrahamic religions. And as long as such selectivity exists, the world can never truly foster a culture of peace,” he said. “What we are trying to build here is an ‘alliance of civilisations’, not set up a clash. I call on the UN Alliance of Civilisation to act likewise and speak for all, not just a select few,” he said.Sharma said the destruction of the Bamyan Buddha and terrorist bombing of a gurdwara killing 25 Sikhs, both in Afghanistan, and destruction of Hindu and Buddhist temples needed to be condemned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/un-selective-in-condemning-violence-against-religions-envoy-179631

This usually resolves in six to eight weeks. But there are some who develop permanent damage. They have lung fibrosis, scarring of the lungs, breathlessness, stroke, cardiac damage and breathless on minimal activities,” Dr Guleria said.“In some cases, Covid may cause permanent complications but in majority cases, people tend to recover in two months,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/emergency-vaccine-nod-by-month-end-aiims-179617

The MEA spokesperson was referring to China’s plan to build a large hydropower project on the Yarlung Zangbo river that has raised concerns in India over potential political and ecological threats. The two downstream riparian states in this respect are India and Bangladesh.“As a lower riparian state with considerable established user rights to the waters of the trans-border rivers, the Indian government has consistently conveyed its views and concerns to the Chinese authorities and urged them to ensure that the interests of downstream states are not harmed by any activities in upstream areas,’’ he said.The MEA put India’s concerns in perspective by pointing out that it is a lower riparian state with considerable user rights to trans-boundary rivers. China has been urged to ensure that the downstream interests are not harmed. In response, the Chinese side has conveyed that these are run-of-river hydel projects and involve no diversion of river waters.“India intends to remain engaged with China on trans-border rivers to safeguard our interests,” added Srivastava.There is concern in India that China will use the project as a tool to promote a political strategy in the region, with their border conflict as the backdrop, to potentially restrict India’s right to utilise downstream water resources.The Chinese side says China’s water resource development along the Yarlung Zangbo river was put off for years due to India’s protests. It says the dam on the Yarlung Zangbo river can generate the largest amount of power from the section closest to the border.Beijing has also said India should not have “any anxiety” over the project and it would continue to have “good communication” with lower riparian states – India and Bangladesh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-flags-concerns-over-chinas-hydel-project-on-brahmaputra-179627

It is now or never. If I win, it will be the people’s victory and if I lose, it will be their defeat.

Rajinikanth promised “wonder and miracle” while predicting a “sure win” for his party in the upcoming poll.“In the upcoming Assembly elections, the emergence of spiritual politics will happen for sure. A wonder will happen,” he said on his twitter handle.“I am ready to sacrifice even my life for the sake of Tamil people.

While the ruling AIADMK, led by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and his deputy O Panneerselvam, rediscovered faith in alliance with the saffron party after Home Minister Amit Shah’s recent visit, observers are suggesting positive vibes from Rajinikanth who has so far been keeping fans and supporters guessing.Though Shah’s message to the state leaders is clear that the BJP should build and expand on its own, and not depend on celebrities and outsiders, sources said the megastar conveyed his “feelings” to Shah via RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajini-to-launch-party-in-jan-ahead-of-poll-179628
