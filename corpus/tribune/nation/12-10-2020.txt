The party came out with its list of 42 candidates for the first phase of assembly elections last week, a sizeable number of them rebels drawn from the BJP and the JD (U).LJP candidates are in the fray in all seats contested by JD(U) and new entrants to the NDA - ex-CM Jitan Ram Manjhis Hindustani Awam Morcha and Mukesh Sahnis Vikasshel Insaan Party (VIP).However, the party has taken care, so far, not to field its candidate in seats which the BJP itself was contesting.As part of the seat-sharing formula in the NDA, JD (U) has got 122 seats out of which it has allocated seven to its associate partner HAM, while the BJP received the rest 121 seats and it has given 11 from its share to its associate VIP.The BJP, which had initially kept silent over Chirag Paswans antics giving rise to suspicions that the son of late Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan enjoyed its tacit support, has in the recent past distanced itself from the young leaders brinkmanship and backed Nitish Kumar’s leadership to the hilt.In addition to the aforementioned BJP rebels, Ajay Pratap has faced action for entering the fray from Jamui where the saffron party has fielded ace shooter Shreyasi Singh, daughter of former party MP Putul Kumari and late Union minister Digvijay Singh.Ajay Pratap has filed his nomination papers as the candidate of former Union minister Upendra Kushwahas Rashtriya Lok Samata Party.RLSP which quit the RJD-helmed Grand Alliance recently and after a failed bid to gain entry into the NDA, ended up forming a six-party front which also includes Mayawatis BSP, Asaduddin Owaisis BSP besides some smaller, non-descript outfits.Yet another BJP leader to have been expelled is Anil Kumar who is contesting as an Independent from Bikram where the party has fielded Atul Kumar as its official candidate.Meanwhile, the Chief Electoral Office sources said that a total of 1065 candidates have been left in the fray for the first phase of assembly polls for 71 seats after 25 nominees withdrew their nomination papers on the last day of withdrawal on Monday.Additional Chief Electoral Officer (ACEO) Sanjay Kumar Singh said a total of 1354 nomination papers were filed in the first phase out of which 1090 candidates were left in the first phase after nomination papers of 264 nominees were found invalid by the Commission during scrutiny.Total 45 candidates have, so far, filed their papers on the second day of filing of papers for the second phase for 94 seats, the ACEO said.Voting for the second round will take place on November 3.

12-10-2020||New Delhi||Ladakh standoff: India insists on early disengagement by China at 7th round of military talks||India on Monday insisted on restoration of status quo ante of April and comprehensive disengagement of troops by China from all the friction points in eastern Ladakh to resolve the border standoff, government sources said, as the two countries held a seventh round of military talks.The Corps commander-level talks began at around 12 noon in Chushul on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh and continued beyond 8:30 PM, they said.As the border standoff entered the sixth month, an early resolution to the row appeared dim with close to 100,000 Indian and Chinese troops remaining deployed in the high-altitude region and showing readiness for a long-haul.There is no official word on the talks yet but sources said the agenda was to finalise a roadmap for disengagement of troops from all the friction points.The Indian delegation is led by Lt Gen Harinder Singh, the commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and includes Naveen Srivastava, Joint Secretary (East Asia) in the Ministry of External Affairs(MEA). It is learnt an official of the Chinese foreign ministry is also part of the Chinese delegation.The sources said India pressed for an early and complete disengagement of troops by China from all the friction points besides demanding immediate restoration of status quo ante in all areas of eastern Ladakh prior to April. The standoff began on May 5.The China Study Group (CSG) comprising Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat and the three service chiefs on Friday finalised India’s strategy for the military talks. The CSG is India’s key policy making body on China.Ahead of the talks, sources said India will also strongly oppose any demand by China for withdrawal of Indian troops from several strategic heights on the southern bank of the Pangong lake to kick-start the disengagement process.During the sixth round of Corps commander talks on September 21, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) insisted on withdrawal of troops by the Indian Army from several strategic heights in Mukhpari, Rezang La and Magar hill areas around the southern bank of Pangong lake.Indian troops had occupied the strategic heights after the PLA soldiers attempted to intimidate them in the southern bank of Pangong lake on the intervening night of August 29 and 30.India has been maintaining that the disengagement process has to start simultaneously at all the friction points.At the talks, the two sides were expected to further explore steps to maintain stability on the ground and avoid any action that may trigger fresh tension in the region where troops from the Indian army and the PLA will be facing difficult conditions in the next four months due to harsh winter, the sources said.Following the sixth round of military talks, the two sides announced a slew of decisions including not to send more troops to the frontline, refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground and avoid taking any actions that may further complicate matters.The military talks were held with a specific agenda of exploring ways to implement a five-point agreement reached between Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at a meeting in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation(SCO) conclave.The pact included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC.Days after the military talks, the two sides held diplomatic parleys under the framework of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, but no concrete outcome emerged from the negotiations on September 30.After the diplomatic talks, the MEA said it was agreed that the next round of the meeting of senior commanders should be held at an early date so that both sides can work towards an early and complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC in accordance with the existing bilateral agreement and protocols.Naveen Srivastava, who has been leading the Indian side at the WMCC talks, also attended the military parleys on September 21 for the first time.It is Lt Gen Singh’s last round of talks with the PLA in the current standoff as he is due to take charge as head of the prestigious Indian Military Academy(IMA) this week. His successor at the 14 Corps Lt Gen PGK Menon is also part of the Indian delegation.At the previous six rounds of military talks, the Indian side insisted on complete disengagement of Chinese troops at the earliest, and immediate restoration of status quo ante in all areas of eastern Ladakh prior to April.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated following at least three attempts by the Chinese soldiers to “intimidate” Indian troops along the northern and southern bank of Pangong lake area between August 29 and September 8 where even shots were fired in the air for the first time at the LAC in 45 years.As tensions escalated further, the foreign ministers of India and China held talks in Moscow on September 10 where they reached a five-point agreement to defuse the situation in eastern Ladakh. The agreement was the basis for the sixth round of Corps commander-level talks.In the last three months, the Indian Army rushed tanks, heavy weaponry, ammunition, fuel, food and essential winter supplies to various treacherous and high-altitude areas of the region to maintain combat readiness through the harsh winter of around four months starting around mid-October.

12-10-2020||New Delhi||Former Supreme Court judge laments ‘weaponising’ sedition law||Former Supreme Court judge Madan B Lokur on Monday lamented “weaponising” the sedition law, adding one of the worst forms of curtailment of freedom of speech is charging a person with sedition.Observing that law is being misused to curb free press and speech, the retired judge said “a lethal cocktail” of use and misuse of law is being used to impact adversely the liberty of all those who dare to speak up.He said the law is always to be interpreted objectively, but of late, subjective satisfaction has taken over and the consequences are unpalatable.The former apex court judge was especially critical of “weaponising” the sedition law, “abuse” of prohibitory orders and blanket shutdown of the Internet.Justice Lokur (retd) was delivering the 2020 B G Verghese Memorial Lecture on “Preserving and Protecting our Fundamental Rights—Freedom of Speech, Expression and the Right to Protest”, organised by the Media Foundation.The Media Foundation presented the 2019 Chameli Devi Jain Award to women for outstanding journalism.This year, the award was shared by Arfa Khanum Sherwani of ‘The Wire’ and Rohini Mohan, a Bengaluru-based independent journalist.Rukmini S, an independent data-journalist from Chennai, received an “honourable mention.”      In his lecture, Lokur pointed out that the Supreme Court had laid down the sedition law clearly and cogently in 1962 itself, yet authorities have found various ways of “weaponising” this law.At a webinar on ‘Freedom of Speech and Judiciary’ last month, Lokur had said suddenly there are a lot of cases where people are charged with sedition. “A common citizen who says something is charged with sedition. Already 70 cases of sedition have been seen this year,” he said.Lokur was among the four senior apex court judges who held the controversial January 12, 2018 press conference against the then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra in an unprecedented revolt.While talking about the new methods of “silencing speech” in his lecture on Monday, he said these include attributing to a speaker something he or she never said and then instituting punitive proceedings against that person.He also referred to several cases, including that of the preventive detention of Dr Kafeel Khan in Uttar Pradesh, and said “almost every procedure known to law was violated” by the detaining authorities.Khan was arrested in January this year on the charge of delivering a provocative speech at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests. The Allahabad High Court ordered his release on September 1.Lokur also talked about the arrest of Pinjra Tod member Devangana Kalita in a Delhi riots case, and said any citizen “can be arrested on the basis of a fairy tale and will have to go through a long-drawn process for being set free”.Lokur, who retired in December 2018, alleged that the use of Section 144 of CrPC to impose prohibitory orders to “keep the media out of the Hathras gangrape rape area is nothing but an egregious violation of the freedom of the press through a bizarre abuse of law.”He said the frequent internet shutdowns through “blanket orders under the guise of preventing breach of peace” were a highly disproportionate response.“Fundamental right to free speech is extremely important for any civilised democracy,” Lokur said, adding that authorities are obliged to ensure that the laws are not twisted, misused or abused in such a manner that citizens get deprived of their liberties.He advised the “establishment” to understand that “the people of this country mean well and as in any democracy, there are bound to be different points of view”.“These must be respected, otherwise, the fabric of our society might disintegrate...,” he said. —  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-supreme-court-judge-laments-weaponising-sedition-law-154769

12-10-2020||New Delhi||Given Rs 50 lakh and job to Bilkis Bano: Gujarat government tells SC||The Gujarat government on Monday told the Supreme Court that it has paid Rs 50 lakh and a job was given to Bilkis Bano, who was gang raped when she was five months pregnant during the 2002 riots in the state.Bano, in her application said she was not satisfied as far as compliance of the apex court order with regard to job offer and provision for accommodation made by the state government.She said that the state government has done only lip service in the name of compliance of the orders of the top court.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Gujarat government, said “This petition is misconceived.” However, a Bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said the court would hear the matter after one week.At the outset, Mehta said that the state has given Rs 50 lakh and job to Bano as directed by the court and opposed the plea.Bano, in her application filed through advocate Shobha Gupta, said that in place of accommodation, the state government has given only 50 square metre land which is notified in records as garden area zone.She said that as far as job is concerned, the state government has offered her a job of peon in irrigation department on contract basis for a particular project in fixed pay grade.On September 30 last year the top court had directed that the Gujarat government to give within two weeks Rs 50 lakh compensation, a job and an accommodation of choice to Bano.The top court had asked the Gujarat government as to why it has not complied with the apex court’s earlier order of April 23, 2019 and given the compensation to Bano.She had earlier told the top court that despite its order the Gujarat government has not provided anything to her.The top court had clarified that its April order giving Rs 50 lakh compensation, a job and an accommodation to Bano was passed keeping in view the peculiar facts of the case.It had in April last year directed the state government to pay the compensation to Bano within two weeks.The top court had also asked the state government to withdraw the pensionary benefits given to erring police officials involved in the case.Bano had earlier refused to accept the offer of Rs five lakh and sought an exemplary compensation from the state government in a plea before the top court.According to the prosecution, on March 3, 2002, Bano’s family was attacked by a mob at Randhikpur village near Ahmedabad in the aftermath of the Godhra riots.Bano, five months pregnant at that time, was gang raped and some members of her family killed.The trial in the case initially began in Ahmedabad.However, after Bano expressed apprehensions that witnesses could be harmed and the CBI evidence could be tampered with, the Supreme Court had transferred the case to Mumbai in August 2004.A special court on January 21, 2008 had convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment 11 men for raping Bano and murdering seven of her family members, while acquitting seven persons, including the policemen and doctors.The convicts later approached the Bombay High Court and sought quashing and setting aside of the trial court’s conviction.The high court, on May 4, 2017, convicted seven people—five policemen and two doctors—under sections 218 (not performing their duties) and section 201 (tampering of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).The top court had on July 10, 2017 dismissed the appeals of two doctors and four policemen, including IPS officer R S Bhagora, challenging their conviction by the high court, saying there were “clear-cut evidences” against them. One of the officers did not appeal. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/given-rs-50-lakh-and-job-to-bilkis-bano-gujarat-government-tells-sc-154765
12-10-2020||---||Cow-dung ‘diyas’, idols of Lakshmi, Ganesh this Diwali||New Delhi, October 12To help ‘gaushalas’ and cattle farmers struggling due to Covid-19 pandemic and also counter Chinese products, the Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog has decided to promote ‘diyas’ made of cow dung this Diwali, targeting    production of 33 crore eco-friendly earthen lamps.  Set up in 2019 for the protection, promotion and conservation of indigenous cattle in the country, the Aayog has started a nation-wide campaign to encourage use of cow dung-based products during the forthcoming festival. Rejecting China-made diyas, the campaign will also boost ‘Make in India’ concept of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and ‘swadeshi movement’, chairman Vallabhbhai Kathiria said on Monday.Besides ‘diyas’, the Aayog is promoting production of other products made from dung, urine and milk, such as anti-radiation chip, paper weights, Ganesha and Lakshmi idols, incense sticks, candles, wall-piece, paper-weight, havan samagri, etc. More than 15 states have agreed to be part of the campaign.About 3 lakh ‘diyas’ will be lit in the holy city of Ayodhya, and 1 lakh in Varanasi, he said, adding that about 192 crore kilo of cow dung per day is produced in India at present. “There is huge untapped potential in cow dung-based products. In our view the sow-centric economy can also help in achieving this goal by making its own humble contribution,” Kathiria addedThe Aayog will not directly be involved in production of cow dung-based products but is facilitating and offering training to self-help groups and entrepreneurs seeking to set up business.Kathiria said the initiative would help cow shelters, which are currently in financial trouble due to the COVID-19 pandemic, become self-reliant besides creating job opportunities in rural India. He said a group of students from IIT-Delhi had come out with an online platform for marketing ‘diyas’ made of cow dung and already placed an order for nearly one crore ‘diyas’.Many NGOs are coming forward to supply moulds for making these ‘diyas’ and also distributing pre-mix materials used in making them to farmers.The Rashtriya Kamdhenu Aayog was constituted  by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the conservation, protection and development of cows and their progeny and for giving direction to the cattle development programmes. It is a high-powered permanent body to formulate policy and to provide direction to the implementation of schemes related to cattle so as to give more emphasis on livelihood generation. Livestock economy sustains nearly 73 million households in rural areas. Even though, the country is largest producer of milk, the average milk yield in India is only 50 per cent of the world average. The low productivity is largely due to deterioration in genetic stock, poor nutrition and unscientific management.The trend needs to be reversed and popular perception about cow and cow-based agriculture and cow-based industry need to be corrected immediately for social and economic rejuvenation of society, particularly poor in rural areas, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cow-dung-diyas-idols-of-lakshmi-ganesh-this-diwali-154760

He emphasised that no one in Jammu and Kashmir was willing to accept these changes," said an NC spokesperson.He claimed that Abdullah's comments on China in response to a question have been "completely twisted" by Patra, who accused the NC president of justifying Chinese aggression and expansionist mindset."Sambit Patra has a habit of twisting words and using the bully pulpit of the BJP office to lie when it suits the political agenda of his party,” said the NC spokesperson.“Dr Abdullah never said that together with China we will bring back Article 370 as Mr Patra claimed at a media briefing in which he also misquoted some previous statements of Dr Abdullah,".Earlier in the day, Patra accused Abdullah of making "seditious and anti-national" remarks on the issue of restoring the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and said he had become a "hero in China".He said the National Conference MP and former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir in his interview had stated that "with China's support", Article 370 of the Constitution, which conferred special status to Jammu and Kashmir, would be restored.

12-10-2020||Jammu||7,000 pilgrims to be allowed per day to pay obeisance at Vaishno Devi shrine from Oct 15||As many as 7,000 pilgrims will be allowed per day to pay obeisance at the cave shrine of Mata Vaishnodevi in the Trikuta hills of Jammu and Kashmir's Reasi district from October 15, an official of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board said on Monday.Reviewing the yatra arrangements for the ‘Navratras’ commencing from October 17, chief executive officer (CEO) of the board Ramesh Kumar said the earlier limit of 5,000 pilgrims per day was being increased to 7,000 pilgrims per day from October 15, irrespective of any limit on the number of pilgrims from within or outside the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.He added that the registration of pilgrims will continue to be done online to avoid people gathering at the yatra registration counters.Kumar said keeping with past practice, the work of floral decoration of the Mata Vaishno Devi Bhawan, Atka and the area surrounding it, which was done on the occasion of the holy Navratras twice a year, had started and would be completed well before the commencement of the Shardiya Navtratras."Likewise, the illumination of the bhawan area with attractive and colourful lights is also going on," he said.The Shat Chandi Maha Yagya will be organised by the board at the cave shrine during the Navratras. The ritual performed for the peace, prosperity and health of humanity will conclude with the "purna ahuti" on the auspicious occasion of Mahanavami, Kumar added.In view of the huge number of pilgrims expected to visit the shrine during the Navratras, the services of ponies, ‘pithoos’ and ‘palkis’ will be allowed to operate on the track between Katra and the bhawan from October 15 in a regulated manner by following all the safety norms and guidelines notified by the government in order to ensure the safety and health of the pilgrims, the board staff and the service providers. A detailed SOP in this regard will be issued shortly, said the CEO.He also took stock of other arrangements such as ensuring adequate water and an uninterrupted power supply along the tracks leading to the shrine and in the bhawan area, sanitation and cleanliness, availability of special fast-related food at the bhojanalayas of the board, etc.Pertinently, the bookings by the devotees for the Shradha Suman Vishesh Pooja and the Atka Aarti have also commenced.Kumar said the accommodation facilities of the board at the bhawan, Adhkuwari, Katra and Jammu had also been thrown open for the pilgrims, following all the prescribed SOPs.Similarly, for the ease and comfort of the pilgrims, all other supplementary facilities set up by the board such as battery-operated vehicles, passenger ropeway and helicopter services are also operating smoothly by strictly following social distancing norms and other precautionary measures, he added.Free community kitchen facilities at Tarakote Marg and the Prasad Kendra at Sanjichhat, besides the bhojanalayas along the track and in the bhawan have also been operationalised for the pilgrims, said the CEO.

12-10-2020||New Delhi||India signs $400 million loan pact with Maldives for mega connectivity project||India on Monday signed a $400 million (over Rs 3,000 crore) loan pact with Maldives for a mega connectivity project that will dwarf the Maldives-China Friendship Bridge as the most visible infra-project in the island country.Once implemented GMCP will render the Chinese project “insignificant’’ in comparison.It will also help showcase India’s expertise in conceptualising and implementing a complex infrastructural project, sources had said when External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar made the announcement during a video call with his Maldivian counterpart Abdullah Shahid.The line of credit (LOC) was signed by Exim Bank’s Nirmit Ved and Maldives Finance Minister Ibrahim Ameer on Monday. The Exim Bank has now provided three LOCs to Maldives totalling $1.2 billion (about Rs 10,000 crore) as India provides generous assistance after a turnaround in ties following a change of government in Male.Projects covered under other LOCs relate to water and sewerage, island development, a cricket stadium, a port, an airport and a road. India’s credit lines and grants to Maldives stand at over $2 billion (Rs 15,000 crore), all announced after Ibrahim Solih became President in November 2018.India had recently completed the Supreme Court building in Mauritius, another Indian Ocean island-country with which it has intensified diplomatic ties.Maldives has received 5.5 tonnes of essential medicines from India which also helped in evacuation of Maldivians from Wuhan and deployed a medical team.India has gone the extra mile to help Maldives financially through a transparent mechanism. The RBI raised Treasury Bonds which were sold to the State Bank of India (SBI), Male, for handover to the Maldives government.After the Galwan Valley clash, not only has India stepped up aid but welcomed the US signing a defence framework agreement with the Maldives.Just seven years back, it had strongly opposed a proposed US security partnership with the Maldives. The then government had felt American entry in Maldives would give rise to misgivings at a time when it thought India and China could co-exist in the Indian Ocean.Earlier, the Indira Gandhi-government had kicked up a row when the US sought to renew lease on a Sri Lankan transmitter.

12-10-2020||New Delhi||SC allows NTA to conduct second round of NEET exams on October 14||The Supreme Court Monday allowed National Testing Agency to conduct second round of the NEET (UG) for the COVID-19 affected students and those in containment zones on October 14.A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde passed the order after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta sought the top court’s nod in the issue citing special circumstances due to the coronavirus pandemic.“In view of the circumstances which have necessitated postponement of the examination in the past and in view of the prevailing circumstances, we consider it appropriate to grant permission to the National Testing Agency to conduct a second part of the NEET (UG) 2019 for the COVID affected students and for those in containment zones on October 14, 2020,” the bench said.The bench, also comprising Justices A S Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said the result may be declared on October 16, 2020.The crucial National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), which is a pen and paper based test unlike engineering entrance exam JEE, was held on September 13 after being deferred twice in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.The exam was originally scheduled for May 3, but was pushed to July 26, and then to September 13.The apex court had earlier dismissed a plea seeking postponement of JEE (Main) April 2020 and NEET-Undergraduate examinations, which are scheduled to be conducted in September, amid spurt in number of COVID-19 cases, saying precious year of students “cannot be wasted” and life has to go on.The top court had said career of students “cannot be put under jeopardy for long”.Later, the apex court had dismissed a review plea of ministers of six opposition-ruled states seeking review of its August 17 order allowing holding of NEET and JEE exams physically.The ministers had claimed that the top court order failed to secure students” “right to life” and ignored “teething logistical difficulties” to be faced in conducting the exams during the pandemic. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-allows-nta-to-conduct-second-round-of-neet-exams-on-october-14-154751
12-10-2020||New Delhi||India generated over 18,000 tonnes COVID-19 waste since June||India generated 18,006 tonnes of COVID-19 biomedical waste in the last four months, with Maharashtra contributing the maximum (3,587 tonnes) to it, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.Around 5,500 tonnes of COVID-19 waste was generated across the country in September – the maximum for a month so far.According to the data received from state pollution control boards, all states and Union Territories have since June generated 18,006 tonnes of COVID-related biomedical waste which is being collected, treated and disposed of by 198 common biomedical waste treatment facilities (CBWTFs).COVID-19 biomedical waste could include PPE kits, masks, shoe covers, gloves, human tissues, items contaminated with blood, body fluids like dressings, plaster casts, cotton swabs, beddings contaminated with blood or body fluid, blood bags, needles, syringes, etc.According to the data, Maharashtra, which has reported over 15 lakh coronavirus cases so far, generated 3,587 tonnes of COVID-19 waste in four months – 524 tonnes in June, 1,180 tonnes in July, 1,359 tonnes in August and 524 tonnes in September.Tamil Nadu generated 1,737 tonnes of Covid-19 waste, Gujarat (1,638 tonnes), Kerala (1,516 tonnes), Uttar Pradesh (1,432 tonnes), Delhi (1,400 tonnes), Karnataka (1,380 tonnes) and West Bengal (1,000 tonnes).The national capital generated 333 tonnes of such waste in June, 389 tonnes in July, 296 tonnes in August and 382 tonnes in September, according to the CPCB data.Around 5,490 tonnes of COVID-19 waste was generated in September, with Gujarat contributing the maximum 622 tonnes, followed by Tamil Nadu (543 tonnes), Maharashtra (524 tonnes), Uttar Pradesh (507 tonnes), Kerala (494 tonnes), and others.Around 5,240 tonnes of COVID-19 waste was generated in August, of which 1,359 tonnes was in Maharashtra, and 588 tonnes each in Kerala and Karnataka, followed by others.In July, the country generated 4,253 tonnes of COVID-19 waste, with Maharashtra (1,180), Karnataka (540) and Tamil Nadu (401) being the top three contributors.India generated 3,025 tonnes of COVID-19 waste in June, with Maharashtra alone accounting for 524 tonnes, followed by Gujarat (350 tonnes), Delhi (333 tonnes) and Tamil Nadu (312 tonnes).The CPCB had in March issued specific guidelines for handling, treatment and disposal of such waste at healthcare facilities, quarantine centres, homes, sample collection centers, laboratories, pollution control boards, urban local bodies and common biomedical waste treatment facilities (CBWTFs).The apex pollution body had in May developed the “COVID19BWM” mobile application to monitor coronavirus-related biomedical waste and to compile the data through electronic manifest system.This application tracks COVID-19 waste at the time of generation, collection and disposal.The Supreme Court has made it mandatory for all urban local bodies and state pollution control boards to use the mobile application for tracking biomedical waste daily in a bid to ensure that the waste is collected, transported and sent to the registered CBWTFs.The directions came on July 30 on recommendations made in a report by the Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority.On Monday, India's COVID-19 caseload stood at 71.2 lakhs while the death toll was 1.09 lakh.

12-10-2020||New Delhi||SC adjourns hearing in breach of privilege proceedings against Arnab Goswami||The Supreme Court on Monday adjourned hearing on Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami’s petition against breach of privilege proceedings initiated by Maharashtra Assembly Chief Justice of India SA Bobde recalled how his father Arvind Shrinivas Bobde and noted jurist Nani Palakhivala had also received similar notices from the Maharashtra Assembly.The CJI’s comments came after senior advocate Harish Salve submitted on behalf of Goswami that the journalist was worried that the Assembly might take his refusal to accept notice of the motion as confrontational.The Bench specifically wanted to know if the Assembly’s privilege committee had taken note of the show-cause notice or not.The Supreme Court had on September 30 issued notice to the Maharashtra Assembly Secretary on Goswami’s petition challenging a notice breach of privilege issued to him for his alleged remarks against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackrey in Sushant Singh Rajput death case.It had asked the Maharashtra Assembly Secretary to respond to Goswami’s petition within a week after senior advocate Harish Salve, representing Goswami, submitted his client didn’t interfere with the proceedings of the House or any of its committees.“There is only breach of privilege notice and there is no motion initiated,” the Bench said.Rajput, a Bollywood actor, was allegedly found hanging at his Bandra residence in Mumbai on June 14. The Supreme Court on August 19 ordered a CBI probe into his unnatural death, saying, “A fair, competent and impartial investigation is the need of the hour”. Salve had argued that a defamation complaint could be filed and there was no interference in the proceedings of the House.Unless there was interference in the functioning of the House or its committees breach of privilege motion can’t be initiated against an outsider. He had said he would come back to the court if anything adverse orders were passed against Goswami.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-adjourns-hearing-in-breach-of-privilege-proceedings-against-arnab-goswami-154745
12-10-2020||Mumbai||Why not have statutory body to regulate TV news content: HC to Centre||The Bombay High Court on Monday asked the Union government why there should not be a statutory body to regulate the content broadcast through television news channels, a poser coming in the backdrop of frenzied media coverage of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.The court sought to know why the electronic media should have an “open hand” over its coverage.“Is there a statutory mechanism for (TV news) broadcasters?” the HC asked.“Just as how the Press Council of India exists for the print media, why don’t you (Union government) think of a similar council for the electronic media? Why should they have an open hand?” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice GS Kulkarni.The bench was hearing a bunch of public interest litigations (PILs) seeking that the press, particularly TV news channels, be directed to exercise restrain in their reportage on the death of Rajput (34) and related probe by multiple agencies.The pleas, filed by several retired senior police officers, activists and private citizens, claim that the press has been conducting a “media trial” into the case, ascribing roles and presuming guilt of the accused persons, thus hampering a fair probe and trial into the matter.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Anil Singh,who appeared for the Union government, told the court that news channels “did not have an open hand as such.”“It is not as if the government is not doing anything.It does take action on complaints received (against channels),” Singh said.“But ultimately, the government cannot control everything. The press has freedom and its rights,” he said.The bench, however, pointed out that the government’s own affidavit, filed previously in the court, showed that on numerous occasions, it had forwarded the complaints it received, to private bodies such as the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) and News Broadcasters Federation (NBF).Earlier in the day, senior advocate Devadatt Kamat, who appeared for the NBA, had told the court that the government should be responsible in matters concerning media reportage, rather than outsourcing the responsibility to private bodies.Kamat said that there existed statutory provisions and rules under the Cable TV Act and it was the Centre’s responsibility to enforce these provisions.Instead, the ministry of information and broadcasting often forwarded the complaints it receives to the NBA and NBF, he said.Kamat showed instances of complaints against news coverage in the Sushant case having been “forwarded” by the government to the NBA.In the past, one TV news channel had refused to abide by the NBA’s recommendations in another case, saying it was not part of the association, Kamat said.“The question is whether this outsourcing is permissible or whether the authorities have to be responsible to enforce what the statute provides,” Kamat said.“When government has a regime in place, where is the question of GOI (Government of India) abdicating its duties and asking these private, self-righteous associations (to look into complaints)?” he said.Kamat argued that a media trial violated an accused’s right to life and personal liberty as guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution, and that it amounted to interference in the administration of justice.He urged the court to look at the “allied issue” of the “leakage of information by investigating agencies” while their probes are going on.The HC will continue hearing the arguments in the case on Wednesday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-not-have-statutory-body-to-regulate-tv-news-content-hc-to-centre-154740

Uma Devi directed the CBI to probe the comments and social media posts by leaders of YSR Congress Party (YSRCP). During a hearing on October 8 to the high court had observed that the state CID was not taking the investigation into the adverse comments on judges and judiciary seriously despite being pointed out and even after a formal complaint had been lodged by the high court Registrar. The high court took a serious view after about 90 social media users made derogatory comments against the judges after the decisions went again the current government. These included Assembly Speaker Thammineni Sitaram, Deputy Chief Minister Narayana Swamy, Rajya Sabha member Vijaya Sai Reddy, besides others. Some lawyers said the recent complaint by the Chief Minister YSR Jagan Mohan Reddy to the Chief Justice of India (CJI) against a sitting judge of the Supreme Court has also not been taken well by the judiciary.The chief minister in his complaint has accused the sitting Supreme Court Judge of interfering in the functioning of the Andhra Pradesh High Court to prevent action against former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu. The court has observed that the CID was not serious in probing the social media offenders. The police are registering cases against people who comment against the government on social media, but are unwilling to take action against the people who are commenting and defaming the judiciary on social media. Andhra Pradesh Advocate general Sriram and CID counsel Niranjan Reddy said they had no objection if the probe against the social media offenders were to be handed over to the CBI.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhra-pradesh-hc-orders-cbi-probe-into-social-media-comments-by-ysrcp-leaders-154733
12-10-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||CM KCR's daughter Kavitha sweeps Nizamabad MLC by-poll||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, October 12  After a short political oblivion, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader and former Member of Parliament (MP) Kalvakuntla Kavitha is all set to participate in active politics.Kavitha, who is also the daughter of Chief Minister K Chandershekhar Rao (KCR) on Monday, won the by-elections to Nizamabad Member Legislative Council (MLC) with an overwhelming majority.  She had lost the Nizamabad parliamentary constituency to the BJP’s Dharmapuri Arvind in the Lok Sabha polls held last year. But in the MLC polls she bagged 728 out of 823 polled votes, about 88 per cent of the votes.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the results after 10 invalid votes were excluded from the counting. The seat had fallen vacant after R Bhupathi Reddy, a former TRS leader, was disqualified after he defected to the Congress ahead of the Assembly elections in 2018.   Her nearest candidate Lakshmi Narayana of Bharatiya Janata Party polled only 56 votes, while Subhash Reddy of the Congress could get only 29 votes and another 10 votes were declared invalid. Both the Congress and the BJP candidates lost their deposits. Right at the outset the trends were clear and Kavitha got 532 out of 600 votes in the first round itself. It is now being said that Kavitha might be inducted into the KCR Cabinet as a minister. Her brother KT Rama Rao (KTR) is already the working president of the TRS and a minister in the KCR Cabinet. The MLC election was supposed to be held in March but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Kavitha’s win is expected to bring about a major impact in the state that include calling the shots and sharing of power between her and her brother.Kavitha played a major role in the Telangana movement through her cultural wing Telangana Jagruti and has been active in social life after she won her first electoral battle in 2014 when she got elected to the Lok Sabha from Nizamabad parliamentary constituency.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cm-kcrs-daughter-kavitha-sweeps-nizamabad-mlc-by-poll-154730

The DRDO is analysing all the details,” said a source.The DRDO has already carried out several successful trials of the ‘Nirbhay’ missile since October 2014.The state-of-the-art missile, which can be deployed from multiple platforms, has a speed less than that of sound (Mach 0.8).Powered by a solid rocket motor booster developed by the Advanced Systems Laboratory (ASL), the missile has an operational range of 1000 km, officials said.In the last few weeks, India has test-fired a number of missiles including a new version of the surface-to-surface supersonic cruise missile BrahMos and anti-radiation missile Rudram-1.India also carried out successful test-firing of a laser-guided anti-tank missile and nuclear-capable hypersonic missile ‘Shaurya’.The successful test firing of Rudram-1 is seen as a major milestone as it is India’s first indigenously developed anti-radiation weapon.The flight testing of the missiles comes in the midst of India’s bitter border row with China in eastern Ladakh.

All of them are in good health and are currently staying in the company’s premises in Brega. We are trying to complete requisite formalities to enable their return to India,” the MEA said.Following the kidnapping, the Indian embassy in Tunisia reached out to the Libyan government authorities as also the international organisations present there, seeking help in rescuing the Indian nationals.The Indian mission in Tunisia handles matters relating to the welfare of Indian nationals in Libya.Libya, an oil-rich country in North Africa, has been witnessing large-scale violence and unrest since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi’s four-decade regime in 2011.“We convey our sincere thanks to the Libyan authorities and the tribal elders from the region for their steadfast cooperation in securing the release of our nationals unharmed,” the MEA said.It also reiterated that there is ban on travel of Indian nationals to Libya, irrespective of the purpose, since May 2016 because of the security situation there.In September 2015, an advisory was issued by the government for Indian nationals to avoid travelling to Libya in view of the security situation there.In May 2016, the government imposed a complete travel ban irrespective of the purpose in view of the deteriorating security situation in Libya.

12-10-2020||New Delhi||BJP terms Farooq Abdullah’s statement on Article 370 'seditious and anti-India'||The BJP on Monday slammed NC leader Farooq Abdullah for his latest statement on Article 370 of the Constitution, terming it seditious and anti-India.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said it was sad that an elected MP was “using this kind of language against the country”.“According to Abdullah, abrogation of Indian Parliament irked and disturbed China, that’s why China is justified for aggression (against India). In a way by making the anti-national statement he is justifying the Chinese aggression.“He is saying that with the help of China we will bring back Article 370. How can a sitting MP say this? If you have reservations against any decision of the Parliament you are free to express them but to say what Farooq Abdullah has said is absolutely seditious,” he said.Notably, National Conference president Farooq Abdullah on Sunday said he wished that with China’s support, Article 370 of the Constitution, which conferred special status on Jammu and Kashmir, will be restored.In an interview, Abdullah noted that China was not happy with the nullification of Article 370, which was scrapped in August last year by Parliament.“As far as China is concerned, I didn’t bring (the) Chinese president here. Our prime minister invited him to Gujarat and even did jhoola sawari with him. He (PM Modi) even took him to Chennai and had food with him,” Abdullah said amid the five-month-long LAC standoff between India and China in Ladakh.Calling Abdullah a repeat offender, Patra said this is not the first time he has made such statements.“On September 24 he said if you ask people of J&K whether they are from India they will say no,” Patra said, calling his statements a question mark on India’s Independence and sovereignty.“The same Abdullah said the POK doesn’t belong to your father that you can take it back,” he saidClaiming that the same soft corner for Pakistan and China is prevalent in Congress as well, Patra said: “There is no difference between Farooq Abdullah and Rahul Gandhi, they are the faces of the same coin. They praise other countries and criticise PM of our country.”Patra also said the entire country also wants to know when Rahul “who had fallen then (in UP), will get up and walk towards Rajasthan where atrocities against women are being committed”.Also slamming the Congress for attack against a woman leader, Tara Yadav, in UP, Patra claimed Rahul “lied that the police pushed and he fell down (in UP while trying to move towards Hathras). Everyone saw he fell down himself”, he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-terms-farooq-abdullahs-statement-on-article-370-seditious-and-anti-india-154713
12-10-2020||Mumbai||Richa Chadha, Payal Ghosh get 2 days to file consent terms||The Bombay High Court on Monday granted two days time to actor Richa Chadha and aspiring actor Payal Ghosh to file ‘consent terms’ for settling the dispute between them with regard to the defamation suit filed by Chadha against Ghosh.Last week, Chadha filed the suit against Ghosh for making a “false, baseless, indecent and derogatory” statement against her and sought monetary compensation as damages.Ghosh, while levelling allegations of rape against filmmaker Anurag Kashyap, had also dragged Chadha and two other female actors into the controversy.Ghosh’s lawyer Nitin Satpute told the high court last week that his client regrets the statement she made, and sought to withdraw it and apologise.On Monday, Chadha’s lawyer Saveena Bedi Sachar, however, told a single Bench of Justice AK Menon that the defendant (Ghosh), after the court hearing last week, put up a post on her social media saying she would never apologise.Justice Menon then asked Satpute if Ghosh was interested in settling the matter with Chadha.Satpute reiterated that Ghosh was withdrawing her statement and apologising, but with certain conditions.“After settling this matter, the plaintiff (Chadha) should not file any criminal case against the defendant,” Satpute said.“After the last hearing, the plaintiff made certain statements to the media saying she has won the case. This has resulted in the defendant being trolled on social media. But, we would like to settle the matter, he said.Satpute further said he would get in touch with Chadha’s lawyer and finalise the consent terms.To this, Justice Menon said, “If you (Chadha and Ghosh) are settling the matter, then it would be best if you talk to each other instead of others and file the consent terms.”The court said no further time would be given on Wednesday (October 14) to file the consent terms.The HC also continued its interim order passed last week by which it had restrained persons from making any false or derogatory statements against the plaintiff.On September 23, Ghosh lodged an FIR at Versova police station in Mumbai, accusing Kashyap of raping her in 2013.During his questioning by police on October 1, Kashyap denied the allegations and provided documentary evidence to show that he was shooting in Sri Lanka at the time when the alleged incident was said to have taken place.

First, it was Pakistan, and now also by China, as if a border dispute is being created under a mission. We have a border of about 7,000 km with these countries where the tension continues," Singh said.The defence minister was speaking after inaugurating the bridges built in strategically key areas of Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir.A majority of these bridges are expected to significantly improve movement of troops in areas along the border with China in Ladakh, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh sectors, officials said.Both India and China held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the border standoff. However, no breakthrough has been achieved to defuse the situation.Singh said in the challenging times of COVID-19 and despite the border tensions and disputes caused by Pakistan and China, the country was not only resolutely facing them but also bringing about historical changes in all sectors of development.The defence minister also laid the foundation stone for Nechiphu Tunnel in Arunachal Pradesh. This 450 metre-long tunnel would ensure all-weather connectivity across Nechiphu pass.The bridges inaugurated by Singh included 10 in Jammu and Kashmir, eight in Ladakh, two in Himachal Pradesh, four each in Punjab and Sikkim and eight each in Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh.In his address, Singh complimented the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) for their achievements in improving infrastructure in border areas and said that dedication of 44 bridges in one go in itself was a record.He said the annual budget of BRO that varied from Rs 3,300 crore to Rs 4,600 crore in years between 2008 and 2016, saw a substantial rise and is pegged at over Rs 11,000 crore in 2020-21."There was no reduction of this budget despite COVID-19," he said Singh said construction of the bridges will benefit both the civilian population as well as the military in the areas."Our armed forces personnel are deployed in large numbers in areas where transport is not available throughout the year," he said, noting improvement in border infrastructure will significantly help armed forces."These roads are not only for strategic needs, but they also reflect equal participation of all stakeholders in the development of the nation," Singh said.The defence minister praised the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) for working tirelessly even during the coronavirus-triggered lockdown period.The defence ministry said despite unprecedented snowfall breaking a 60-year record, all strategic passes and roads were cleared for traffic about one month before their average yearly opening dates."I am happy to know that over 2,200 kilometres of roads have been cut by the BRO during the last two years, using the latest technologies, and state-of-the-art equipment. Also, surfacing was carried out on about 4200 km of roads," he added.Amid the border standoff with China, India is expediting work on several key projects including on a strategic road linking Darcha in Himachal Pradesh with Ladakh that will criss-cross several high-altitude snow-bound passes.The nearly 290-km-long road will be crucial for the movement of troops and heavy weaponry into the frontier bases of the Ladakh region and will provide a crucial link to the Kargil region.

12-10-2020||New Delhi||IIT Madras researchers develop anti-bacterial, biodegradable food wrapping material||Researchers at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras have developed a food wrapping material which is not only anti-bacterial but also biodegradable.According to the team which has also filed a patent for the wrapper, their product can tackle two major problems - prevent packaged food contamination by bacteria as well as reduce the plastic waste generated in the environment when disposing of the wrappers. "Our idea was to design a food wrap that will address two major issues--solid waste and food contamination during storage due to bacterial growth. We have developed a biodegradable wrapping material with in-built anti-bacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth in stored food. The anti-bacterial compound should be safe for consumption as it is approved by the authorities and does not cause any toxicity," said Mukesh Doble, Professor, IIT's Department of Biotechnology."The wrapping material we have developed also degrades at various environmental conditions with the rate of degradation varying from 4 to 98 per cent in 21 days. The wrapping material degraded rapidly in moist conditions when compared to dry ones. Hence, our wrapper is eco-friendly and can play a major role in plastic waste reduction," he added.The films developed by researchers were made with polymeric blends containing starch, polyvinyl alcohol, cyclic beta glycans (CBG). The composition was optimised to achieve the best film with a smooth texture, flexibility, uniform thickness and good clarity. "Our anti-bacterial coated polymer wrapper was used for wrapping paneer, meat and chicken and its performance was tested. Samples were placed in 4 degrees Celsius and 30 degrees Celsius for 10 days and tested for the effect of the coating on reducing the bacterial growth with respect to the uncoated wrapper," said Puja Kumari, a research scholar at IIT Madras."Our study found that 99.999 per cent reduction in bacterial colonies was observed in food samples wrapped with our anti-bacterial wrap and stored at 30 degrees Celsius for 10 days when compared with a plain wrapper. This study also suggests that our anti-microbial wrapper can, to some extent overcome, the reduced availability of cold storage units. Paneer is known to have a very low shelf life (less than 7 days) and hence extending its shelf life is a major advantage," she added.The researchers also found that the wrapping material degraded at various environmental conditions with the rate of degradation varying from 4 to 98 per cent in 21 days. The material degraded rapidly in a moist condition when compared to dry ones.

Sources say she may be given a key role in the 2021 Assembly election. Besides, there are also speculations about a Rajya Sabha seat for her.As an actor who has worked in various languages, including Hindi, Kushboo Sundar enjoys a sizeable fan following. Her fans have also built a temple for her and the BJP, which lacks a charismatic leader in the state and has been wooing megastar Rajinikanth for long, hopes to improve its presence in Tamil Nadu with Kushboo.So far, the BJP has not received much traction from its alliance with the ruling AIADMK, which performed rather poorly in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Apparently, the AIADMK, for which the next elections are important from the survival point of view, is also wary of the BJP backing Rajinikanth who, too, is expected to finally launch his party.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kushboo-sundar-promises-to-do-her-best-to-ensure-victory-in-tamil-nadu-154699
12-10-2020||---||Rahul, Priyanka seek people’s support in Hathras incident; say UP govt 'insensitive'||New Delhi, Oct 12Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Vadra on Monday appealed for people’s support for justice in the Hathras case terming the Uttar Pradesh government’s conduct in the matter “insensitive” and “inhuman”.While Vadra said women in India would now have to take responsibility for their safety, Rahul said, “The UP government’s attitude in the Hathras incident is inhuman and unethical. The state is busy helping criminals rather than the family of the victim. Come, let us raise our voice against the injustice being done to women across the country. Let’s take one step towards change.”The Gandhis tweeted with hashtag Speak up for Women’s safety.Vadra earlier said, “Crimes against women are rising. Instead of heeding the voice of victims the government is defaming the victims and levelling allegations against them. This is the most cowardly act. But the country’s women will not remain silent anymore. If one sister is victimised, others will stand in solidarity with her. We are taking responsibility for our own safety.”Rahul recalled his visit to Hathras saying he was first stopped from going to Hathras and he went in the second attempt. “I don’t understand why am I being stopped from meeting the family? Why am I not being allowed to meet the family? Their daughter was killed, raped. Why am I being stopped? When I reached the house, spoke to them, the state started attacking the family and helping the accused. It is not the government’s job to help the perpetrators.”Gandhi said the government’s job is to save the victims, deliver justice to them, and send the criminals to jail.“The state government is not doing its job and that is why I am being stopped. I want to tell the government to start doing its job by putting criminals in jail and saving the victims. This is not the story of one isolated woman. This is the story of lakhs of women across India. Lakhs of women are looming towards the government for help and the government is not doing its job,” he said, adding that people had to exert pressure on the government, change society because what is being done to mothers and daughters in the country is “grossly unjust”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rahul-priyanka-seek-peoples-support-in-hathras-incident-say-up-govt-insensitive-154698
12-10-2020||New Delhi||SC issues notice to Centre on a PIL demanding equal protection to transgenders against sexual offences||The Supreme Court on Monday issued notice to the Centre on a PIL demanding equal protection of the law for members of the transgender community against sexual offences."It is a very good issue. Issue notice," said a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde.The top court asked senior advocate Vikas Singh to place before it a list of issues on which it had laid down guidelines, including the Vishaka Guidelines, issued in 1997, against sexual harassment at workplace.Highlighting gaps in penal laws dealing with sexual offences, advocate Reepak Kansal had last month moved the Supreme Court demanding equal protection of the law for members of the transgender community against sexual offences.Kansal alleged that there was no penal provision which protected those belonging to the third gender from sexual assault.He urged the top court to direct the Centre to "make appropriate modification/ interpretation of sections/ provisions of IPC dealing with sexual assault to include transgender/ transsexuals/kinnar and eunuchs in the definitions accordingly".Kansal also wanted an Anti-Discrimination law that penalised discrimination and harassment based on gender and implementation of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights by India as it was a signatory to it."In spite of declaring transgender people to be a 'third gender' by this court, there is no provision/section in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which may protect the third gender from the sexual assault by male/female or another transgender," Kansal submitted in his PIL, referring to a 2014 verdict of the top court on rights of transgenders.The top court had granted "recognition to the transgender/ third gender as 'persons' falling under the ambit of Article 14 of the Indian Constitution"—still, they do not have equal protection of law concerning sexual offences.Kansal has challenged the validity of certain clauses of Section 354A (outraging the modesty of a woman) of IPC, to the extent that they were interpreted to exclude transgender victims of sexual harassment. It violated their right to equality, right against discrimination and right to life and personal liberty under Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution respectively.He pointed out that the IPC, recent amendments to it and other laws on sexual offences -- none talked about the "transgender, transsexuals, kinnar and eunuchs".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-a-pil-demanding-equal-protection-to-transgenders-against-sexual-offences-154697
12-10-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 school closure may cost over $400 billion to India, cause learning losses: World Bank||The prolonged closure of schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India may cause a loss of over $400 billion in the country’s future earnings, besides substantial learning losses, according to a World Bank report.South Asia region stands to lose $622 billion from the school closures in the present scenario or up to $880 billion in a more pessimistic scenario, it has said, adding that while the regional loss was largely driven by India, all countries would lose substantial shares of their GDP.The report titled “Beaten or Broken? Informality and COVID-19 in South Asia” claims that South Asia is set to plunge into its worst-ever recession in 2020 as the devastating impacts of COVID-19 on the region’s economies linger.“Temporary school closures in all South Asian countries have had major implications for students. They have kept 391 million students out of school in primary and secondary education, further complicating efforts to resolve the learning crisis,” said the report.“While most governments have made enormous efforts to mitigate the impact of school closures, it has been difficult to engage children through remote learning initiatives,” it said.The report also noted that the pandemic may cause up to 5.5 million students to drop out from the education system and cause substantial learning losses, which would have a lifetime impact on the productivity of a generation of students.“Most school systems closed in March, and though there are important exceptions, countries are starting to reopen or have already opened their schools. Children have been out of school for approximately five months. Being out of school for that long means that children not only stop learning new things, they also forget some of what they have learned. The projected learning loss for the region is 0.5 years of learning-adjusted years of schooling (LAYS), falling from 6.5 LAYS to 6.0 LAYS, an enormous setback from recent advances in schooling,” it said.The ‘Learning Adjusted Year of Schooling’ (LAYS) concept, introduced by the World Bank, seeks to combine access and learning outcomes into a single measure.It combines quantity (years of schooling) and quality (how much kids know at a given grade level) into a single summary measure of human capital in a society.The report has projected that based on country data on household labour incomes, the average child in South Asia may lose USD 4,400 in lifetime earnings once having entered the labour market, equivalent to five per cent of total earnings.“These projections are based on what we currently know about returns to schooling, using the reduced level of learning caused by the crisis. Summing these numbers for all children in South Asia, the region stands to lose $622 billion from the school closures in the present scenario, or up to $880 billion in a more pessimistic scenario.“While the regional loss is largely driven by India, all countries will lose substantial shares of their GDP. For reference, note that South Asian governments spend only $400 billion per year in total on primary and secondary education. The total loss in economic output from the current closures is hence substantially higher than what countries currently spend on education,” it said.The novel coronavirus has infected over 3.7 crore people across the globe claiming over 10.5 lakh lives.India’s COVID-19 caseload stands at 71.2 lakhs while the death toll is 1.09 lakh as on Monday.Universities and schools across the country were ordered shut on March 16 to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. On March 25, the Centre announced a nationwide lockdown. While several restrictions have been eased gradually in different phases of the ‘unlock’ since June 8, educational institutions continue to remain closed.However, according to the latest unlock guidelines, schools, colleges and other educational institutions outside COVID-19 containment zones can reopen after October 15. The final decision on reopening the institutions has been left with the states and Union Territories.

Time @MamataOfficial for healing touch rather than be in justification mode. Law allows capping of such wrongs." Dhankhar said on Twitter.He also said, "Apex Court dictum in D K Basu was outraged @MamataOfficial Recall Kabiguru felt pain of Jallianawala Bagh massacre thousand Kms away here & renounced his title. Time to vindicate Tagore so that we hold our 'head high' and not 'in shame' Time to be in rectification mode."The governor had on Sunday met members of the Sikh community and assured them that necessary action would be taken.The West Bengal government had said that a political outfit was deliberately giving "communal colour" to the last week's incident involving the Sikh man, whose turban came off during a scuffle with the police, to serve its "narrow partisan interest".The state home department, in a tweet, said the man was arrested in accordance with the law for carrying illegal firearms during the BJP's march to the secretariat.

Her tormentors robbed her, made objectionable videos and even thrashed the boy she had gone to meet.The victim alleged that around a dozen students of the polytechnic college on Sunday forcibly took her inside the campus where one of them raped her.The incident took place inside the campus where provincial civil services (PCS) examination was being held amid heavy police protection.SSP Jhansi, Dinesh Kumar P., said two of the main accused have been arrested.The victim had gone to meet her friend, a boy, when over a dozen students approached them. They forcibly took them inside the hostel where they manhandled the victim and thrashed her friend, the SSP said.Besides, the accused boys took away Rs 2,000 from the girl. One of the students raped her while the others made a video."When some police personnel, who were passing near the campus heard the cries of the victim, they took her to Sipree Bazar police station. The girl who was in a trauma, revealed the entire ordeal to the police and identified one of the accused as Bharat," the SSP said."The accused are second year students of the polytechnic whose actual identities are yet to be established," Naveen Kumar, principal of the polytechnic, said."It has to be ascertained whether they are hostellers or not. There is only one security guard for the entire campus whose whereabouts are not known at the time of the incident as he was busy with the PCS exams going on in the college on Sunday," he added.The SSP said police have lodged an FIR against main accused Rohit Saini and Bharat and other unknown persons under sections 120B, 376-D, 395, 386, 323 of the IPC, section 66D of the IT Act and section 3/4 of POCSO Act.The main accused Rohit Saini and Bharat have been arrested."Three police teams have been constituted to apprehend the other accused.

12-10-2020||Satya Prakash||SC issues notice to Centre on pleas against farm laws||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 12The Supreme Court on Monday issued a notice to the Centre on petitions challenging the validity of the recently enacted farm laws that have triggered protests in various parts of the country, particularly Punjab.A Bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, asked the Centre to respond to the petitions in four weeks.When the matter was taken up, the Bench refused to entertain advocate ML Sharma’s petition, saying he didn’t have a cause of action.“Mere passage of a legislation cannot be a valid cause of action,” the Bench told Sharma.However, it agreed to issue a notice to the Centre after advocate K Parameshwara submitted a petition on behalf of the Chhattisgarh Kisan Congress that there were other petitions against farm laws as well.Pointing out that different high courts might pass different orders, Parameshwara said it would be better if the matter was dealt with by the top court.“The questions raised in the rest of the petitions will have to be answered by the Centre at some forum or the other,” the Bench told Attorney General KK Venugopal while issuing the notice.There are several petitions against the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act 2020, which were passed by Parliament and assented to by President Ram Nath Kovind last month.The petitioners include TN Prathapan, Congress MP from Trissur in Kerala; DMK MP Tiruchi Siva, RJD MP Manoj Jha and the Bhartiya Kisan Party.In its petition filed on October 5, the Bhartiya Kisan Party contended that the new farm laws violated the basic features of the Constitution. The party submitted that agriculture was a state subject under List II of Schedule VII of the Constitution and therefore, Parliament didn’t have the legislative competence to make laws on the subject.RJD MP Jha contended the farm laws were “discriminatory” and would expose marginal farmers to exploitation by big companies.Siva submitted the new farm laws would be disastrous for the farming community as they gave an “uneven edge over the farmers’ interest in favour of the sponsor or the farm service provider” while Prathapan said they opened the door for “corporate greed” of multinational companies to trample on the agriculture market.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-pleas-against-farm-laws-154681

Before surrendering, the accused created drama.“At times, he expressed his readiness to surrender but changed his mind the next moment and switched off his mobile phone. We all tried our best and kept on persuading him to surrender,” the official said.According to another police official, the havaldar was involved in handling deployments and finances at the corps earlier.As per the initial investigation, after Naib Subedar Shikara came in some time back, a fight over supremacy started between them and the shooting was its fallout, he said. Shikara’s body was handed over to his family after post-mortem on Sunday, the official said.The OFK has a strength of around 1,200 workers.The DSC is tasked with guarding ordnance factories across the country.

12-10-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality ‘poor’; wind direction shift may improve it||The air quality in the National Capital and adjacent areas was recorded in the “poor” category on Monday morning, with concentration of fine particulate matter – PM2.5 and PM10 – increasing to the highest recorded levels this season so far.However, the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, said the air quality index (AQI) was likely to improve slightly in the coming days due to a change in the wind direction.The City recorded an overall AQI of 240 at 10 am. The 24-hour average AQI was 216 on Sunday and 221 on Saturday.The AQI in Jahangirpuri (301) and Vivek Vihar (316) hit the “very poor” category.An AQI between 0 and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 242 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 9 am—the highest this season so far, according to CPCB data. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers and is inhalable into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores.              The levels of PM2.5 – finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream – were 106 µg/m3. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.Delhi’s air quality had turned poor on Wednesday, the first time in since June 29, with the Central Pollution Control Board recording a 24-hour average AQI of 215.SAFAR said as many as 448 farm fires were observed in Punjab, adjoining Pakistan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh which impacted Delhi’s air quality on Sunday.However, the wind direction will change from northwesterly to southeasterly and the impact of farm fires will reduce, it said.On Monday morning, Delhi’s minimum temperature settled at 19.4 degrees Celsius. The maximum wind speed was 4 kilometers per hour.Low temperatures and stagnant winds help in accumulation of pollutants near the ground, affecting air quality.With Delhi-NCR bracing for months of poor air quality, experts have warned that high levels of air pollution can aggravate the COVID-19 pandemic.High level of air pollution in Delhi is a year-round problem, which can be attributed to unfavourable meteorological conditions, farm fires in neighbouring regions and local sources of pollution.According to an analysis by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a Delhi-based think tank, transportation contributes the most -- 18 to 39 percent—to Delhi’s air pollution.Road dust is the second largest source of air pollution in the city (18 to 38 percent), followed by industries (2 to 29 percent), thermal power plants (3 to 11 percent) and construction (8 percent).This year, the Delhi government has launched a massive anti-air pollution campaign—“Yuddh Pradushan Ke Viruddh’—which is being led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Environment Minister Gopal Rai.A “green war room” with a 10-member expert team has been set up at the Delhi Secretariat to monitor the steps being taken to deal with high levels of air pollution in winters.The environment department has also taken stern action against project proponents at large construction and demolition sites flouting dust control norms.The government will also start the spraying of “Pusa bio-decomposer” solution in non-basmati rice fields in the national capital, starting Tuesday.The solution, experts say, can turn the stubble into manure in 15 to 20 days and therefore, can prevent stubble burning.’                 Starting October 15, stricter measures to fight air  pollution will also come into force in Delhi and its neighbourhood as part of the Graded Response Action Plan, which was first implemented in Delhi-NCR in 2017.

12-10-2020||New Delhi||Why is your CM mortgaging your future for Modi: Rahul to people on GST compensation||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday took a jibe at the state governments that have agreed to the Centre's borrowing proposal on the GST compensation issue and asked people as to why their chief ministers were "mortgaging" their future for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In a tweet, Gandhi said, "1. Centre promises GST revenue for States. 2. Economy shattered by PM & Covid. 3. PM gives (Rs) 1.4 lakh Crs tax cuts to Corporates, buys 2 planes for himself for (Rs) 8400 Crs. 4. Centre has no money to pay States 5. FM tells States- Borrow.""Why is your CM mortgaging your future for Modi?" Gandhi asked.In August, the Centre gave two options to the states to borrow either Rs 97,000 crore from a special window facilitated by the Reserve Bank of India or Rs 2.35 lakh crore from the market. It had also proposed extending the compensation cess levied on luxury goods beyond 2022 to repay the borrowing.Following demand by some states, the amount of Rs 97,000 crore was increased to Rs 1.1 lakh crore.As many as 21 states -- which are mostly BJP-ruled or have supported it on various issues -- have opted to borrow Rs 1.1 lakh crore to meet the compensation shortfall.The Centre has released Rs 20,000 crore to the states towards the compensation shortfall so far in the current fiscal.Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent slabs.

Trains have started to resume operations, beginning with CR’s Harbour Line. The trains are carrying only essential services workers at present, which helped minimise the passenger inconvenience.Railway services across the city on the Western Railway and Central Railway came to a grinding halt at 1005 hrs as a result of the power outage, with both the networks blaming power cut from Tata Power (their power supplier) for it.Also read: Uddhav Thackeray orders probe into power outage in MumbaiThe #MVA govt has now gone powerless and I hope they will not blame @republic & #ArnabGoswami for their power failure #powercut  State’s Power Minister Nitin Raut said the trouble emanated from Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company (MSETCL) facilities during a planned maintenance work.Tata Power, which is into both generation and distribution, attributed the power outage to a simultaneous substation tripping at 1010 hrs at state-run transmission company MSETCL’s two substations in the suburbs of Kalwa and Kharghar.Raut said power supply would resume soon, as officials were working on it on a “war footing”. As the afternoon progressed, power at many pockets, including the Bandra Kurla Complex business district, Lower Parel and South Mumbai started resuming.With work-from-home (WFH) becoming the norm across vital industries, such as banking, finance and information technology, employee output was also impacted as the residences do not have electricity backup in a city which generally has stable power.In some instances, the snapping of power came at the most unfortunate moment, which resulted in incidents such as employees in an upscale business complex getting stuck in the elevator in the times of social distancing.Lights out #powercut :(  Officials at Tata Power were not immediately available for comment.Another discom official also said it was a grid failure and efforts are underway to restore power supply at the earliest with the help of Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company and Power Grid Corporation.The local trains, which are called the lifeline of the megapolis with over 70 lakh commuters daily, currently ferry only essential employees to workplaces.Mumbai experiences #PowerCut today in several partsMeanwhile Ulhasnagar & Ambernath residents to Mumbai : pic.twitter.com/k3IxN9f0yY  After a few difficult minutes, the employees were safely evacuated, as per a video doing rounds on social media.With the number of COVID-19 infections still very high and many patients recovering in hospitals, including specially-created facilities rendering services such as oxygen supply, Municipal Commissioner of Mumbai IS Chahal instructed staff to bolster diesel supply to last up to eight hours and also scout for mobile diesel generator vans which are used at film shoots as a standby.An industry source said it took longer than expected for the power supply to resume because one of the two thermal power stations in the city and its vicinity, which have to act as a ready source as part of an “islanding” system to avert such situations, took longer to start generating power.Raut said maintenance work was on in MSETCL’s 400 kv Kalwa-Padgha line when the technical fault happened in circuit number 2, which was taking the entire load at the time as circuit 1 was shut.MSETCL is responsible for getting power till the Kalwa substation from generating stations across the state, from where distribution companies namely Tata Power and Adani Electricity took it to the consumers, the source said.As part of the islanding system, a thermal-based power plant each of Adani at Dahanu and Tata Power (Trombay) are expected to supply power.“Restoration work in is in progress to bring supply from the three hydro units and Trombay units once the MSETCL transmission lines are connected,” the Tata Power statement said.The electric supply is inttruptted due to TATAs incoming electric supply faiure. Inconveniences is regretted.  Another official also said that it was a grid failure and efforts were underway to restore power supply at the earliest with the help of Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company and Power Grid Corporation.Power outages were reported from suburbs namely Thane, Panvel, Dombivili and Kalyan as well.It can be noted that economic activity is limping back to normal in many parts of the country as the COVID-19 unlock process is underway. However, there continue to be many restrictions due to the need for social distancing and avoiding further infections.The BSE and the NSE, the benchmark stock exchanges, which are based in the city, also reported power outages but added that their operations were continuing normally.A spokesperson of the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport said operations were normal too.

The matter is being probed, but no case has been registered so far,” Kotwali SHO Chandrabhan Singh said.Yadav, who claimed to be associated with the party for four years, said she was only questioning the choice of candidate and never expected that the party members would react in such a manner. “You have given the ticket to a rapist and this has tarnished the party’s image.

This means the Indian troops sitting atop Rezang La and the Renchin La — both occupied in the military action on August 29 and 30 — can get a bird’s-eye view of the Moldo garrison of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA).Commanders to meet at Chushul todayAlso, the approach roads to the garrison, Spanggur Tso and Spanggur Gap are now within the visual range of Indian troops from the heights they have taken over. The Spanggur Gap is one of the 13 natural gaps in eastern Ladakh mountains, and securing the gaps is vital to counter China’s military thrust. India fears that vacating the heights along the 70-km front could be strategically risky unless the Chinese agree to demarcate the LAC on ground. These positions are within the Indian claim line of the LAC. “If we vacate now, the PLA can attempt to capture these. The climb from their side is easier,” said a functionary in the know of things. Both Rezang La and Renchin La are located at a height above 16,000 feet.In the past meetings, India has been pressing for restoration of the April status quo ante. The present situation is such that the southern bank of Pangong Tso holds greater value.Top sources have confirmed that the China Study Group headed by the National Security Adviser has made it clear that the negotiations have to be for the entire eastern Ladakh and not on a piecemeal basis.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/control-over-lac-heights-key-to-talks-154491

12-10-2020||---||LAC row: India to press for early, complete disengagement at Monday’s military talks||New Delhi, October 11India will press for early and complete disengagement of troops by China from all the friction points in eastern Ladakh at the seventh round of high-level military talks between the two countries on Monday, government sources said.The talks are slated to begin at 12 noon in Chushul on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, they said.The agenda of the talks will be to firm up a roadmap for disengagement of troops from all the friction points in eastern Ladakh, the sources said.The China Study Group (CSG), comprising Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat and three service chiefs, on Friday finalised India’s strategy for the military talks.The CSG is India’s key policy-making body on China.The sources said India will strongly oppose any demand by China for the withdrawal of Indian troops from several strategic heights on the southern bank of the Pangong lake to kick-start the disengagement process.During the last round of Corps Commander-level talks, the Chinese military insisted on the withdrawal of troops by the Indian Army from several strategic heights in Mukhpari, Rezang La and Magar hill areas around the southern bank of Pangong lake.Indian troops occupied the strategic heights after the Chinese military attempted to intimidate them in the southern bank of Pangong Lake on the intervening night of August 29 and 30.India has been maintaining that the disengagement process has to start simultaneously at all the friction points.“Indian will again press for early and complete disengagement of troops from all the friction points,” said a source, adding that the onus is on the Chinese military to start the process.At the talks, the two sides are also expected to look into further steps to maintain stability on the ground and avoid any action that may trigger fresh tension in the region where troops from both sides will be facing difficult conditions in the next four months due to harsh winters, the source said.The Indian delegation at the talks will be led by Lt Gen Harinder Singh, the commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps of the Indian Army, and it will comprise Lt Gen PGK Menon and Joint Secretary (East Asia) in the Ministry of External Affairs Naveen Srivastava among others.Following the sixth round of military talks on September 21, the two sides announced a slew of decisions, including not to send more troops to the frontline, refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground and avoid taking any actions that may further complicate matters.The military talks were held with a specific agenda of exploring ways to implement a five-point agreement reached between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at a meeting in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) conclave.The pact included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management, and steps to restore peace along the LAC.Days after the military talks, the two sides held diplomatic talks under the framework of Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, but no concrete outcome emerged from the negotiation on September 30.After the diplomatic talks, the MEA said it was agreed that the next round of the meeting of senior commanders should be held at an early date so that both sides can work towards early and complete disengagement of the troops along the LAC in accordance with the existing bilateral agreement and protocols.Srivastava, who has been leading the Indian side at the WMCC talks, also attended the military talks on September 21 for the first time.It will be Lt Gen Singh’s last round of talks with the Chinese military as he will take charge as head of the prestigious Indian Military Academy around October 15.Lt Gen Menon will succeed Lt Gen Singh as the commander of 14 Corps on October 14.At the previous six rounds of Corps commander-level talks, the Indian side led by Lt Gen Singh insisted on complete disengagement of Chinese troops at the earliest, and immediate restoration of status quo ante in all areas of eastern Ladakh prior to April.The face-off between the Indian and Chinese armies began on May 5.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated following at least three attempts by the Chinese military to “intimidate” Indian troops along the northern and southern bank of Pangong lake area between August 29 and September 8 where even shots were fired in the air for the first time at the LAC in 45 years.As the tensions escalated further, the foreign ministers of the two countries held talks in Moscow on September 10 where they reached on the five-point agreement to defuse the situation in eastern Ladakh.The agreement was the basis for the sixth round of Corps commander-level talks.In the last three months, the Indian Army rushed tanks, heavy weaponry, ammunition, fuel, food and essential winter supplies into various treacherous and high-altitude areas of the region to maintain combat readiness through the harsh winter of around four months beginning mid-October. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-row-india-to-press-for-early-complete-disengagement-at-mondays-military-talks-154295

Biodiversity in Aarey needs to be conserved and protected. Nowhere is there an 800-acre jungle in an urban set-up.—Uddhav Thackeray, Maharashtra Chief MinisterThackeray said the government had earlier declared 600 acres of Aarey land as forest, but now it had been revised to 800 acre. “There will be no infringement on rights of tribals in the Aarey forest,” he added.“Biodiversity in Aarey needs to be conserved and protected. Nowhere is there an 800-acre jungle in an urban set up. Mumbai has a natural forest cover,” he said.Cases registered against citizens and environmentalists who protested against the Aarey project and felling of trees in that area last year have been withdrawn, he said.The move to relocate the car shed from Aarey came amid reports that the state government was considering if two of the upcoming Metro lines could share maintenance facility.Former chief minister and Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis recently said the state government’s plan to relocate Metro 3 car shed from Aarey was a reflection of wrong policy. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/metro-car-shed-at-aarey-to-be-shifted-154231
