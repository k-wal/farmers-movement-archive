The top court had said it has to first circumspect in imposing a prior restraint on publication or the airing of views.In the high court, the petition by Syed Mujtaba Athar, Ritesh Siraj and Aamir Subhani sought a direction to prohibit the telecast of the programme and to take down the trailers and all videos of the broadcast which are uploaded on the Internet by them.It said the trailer was uploaded by the channel’s editor-in-chief on August 25 on social media and the petitioners came to know about it on August 27 when it went viral.“The respondent no. 4 (Chavhanke) has openly incited his target non-Muslim audience by fearmongering that ‘jihadis’ or terrorists from Jamia Millia Islamia would soon hold positions of authority and power like that of collector and secretary,” it said.The plea said if the proposed broadcast is allowed to go ahead, it would present a clear danger to the security of the petitioners as well as that of other students and alumni of Jamia Millia Islamia including those who cleared the Civil Services Exam in 2020 as well as the Muslim community at large.It claimed that this would leave them open to the imminent threat of violence, including the possibility of lynching.“This would amount to an extremely egregious violation of the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed to the petitioners under Article 21 of the Constitution,” the plea said.It said a prima facie case is made out that the proposed broadcast amounts to hate speech and criminal defamation and fatally compromises the right to life and liberty of the petitioners. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-refuses-to-vacate-stay-on-telecast-of-sudarshan-tv-show-on-muslim-infiltration-in-govt-services-133331

29-08-2020||New Delhi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi pitches for taking farm education to middle school level||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday pitched for taking farm education to middle school level, saying necessary reforms have been made in this regard in the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.“There is a need to take knowledge related to agriculture and its practical application to school level. Efforts are (on) to introduce the Agriculture subject at middle school level in villages,” Modi said.This will develop agriculture related understanding in students and enable them to give information about agriculture, its modern farming techniques and marketing, to their family members, he said, adding this will promote agro-entrepreneurship in the country.“For this, many reforms have been made in the National Education Policy,” Modi said in an address after the virtual inauguration of college and administration buildings of Jhansi-based Rani Lakshmi Bai Central Agricultural University.The NEP approved by the Union Cabinet last month replaces the 34-year-old National Policy on Education and is aimed at paving the way for transformational reforms in school and higher education systems to make India a global knowledge superpower.Asserting that steady efforts are being made to connect farming with modern technology, the Prime Minister noted that research institutions and agricultural universities have a vital role to play.Currently, there are three central agricultural universities in the country, compared to just one university six years ago. Besides this, three more national institutions—IARI Jharkhand, IARI Assam and Mahatma Gandhi Institute for Integrated Farming in Motihari, Bihar—are being established.He remarked that these institutions will not only give new opportunities to students, but will also help in increasing their capacity, in providing technology benefits to the local farmers.Modi further said in the last six years, the government has endeavoured to establish a link between research and farming, and to provide scientific advice to farmers, at the ground level in villages.He sought the cooperation of the universities in developing the ecosystem to streamline the flow of knowledge and expertise from campus to agriculture fields.On use of modern technology in tackling farm sector challenges, Modi cited the recent locust attack and said the government worked on war footing to control the spread of the attack and to reduce the damage.He mentioned that dozens of control rooms were set up in several cities, arrangements were made to alert farmers in advance, and drones were supplied for spraying pesticides. Besides, dozens of modern spray machines used to kill locusts, were procured and provided to farmers.Asserting that the farm sector has a major role to play in making India ‘Aatmanirbhar’ (self-reliant), Modi said, “When I talk about aatmanirbhar in agriculture, it is not limited to foodgrains but the self-reliance of a village/rural economy”.Self-reliance in agriculture aims at making farmers both producer as well as entrepreneur. The growth of farmers and overall farm sector will lead to creation of jobs at village level, he said.To further boost the farm sector and double the income of farmers, Modi said the government is taking several historical reforms in the sector. He listed out the amendments in the Essential Commodities Act, and ordinances to allow farmers sell outside mandis.“Just like other industries, now farmers can also sell their produce anywhere in the country, wherever they fetch better prices,” he said, adding that a special dedicated fund of Rs 1 lakh crore has been set up for providing better facilities and promoting industries in a cluster-based approach.Earlier, interacting with the students of Rani Lakshmi Bai Central Agricultural University, the Prime Minister expressed concern over the whopping Rs 75,000 crore edible oil import bill and asked for solution from the students to address this issue.He also stressed on the need to boost food processing levels and create awareness among farmers about micro, drip and sprinkler irrigation in the drought-prone Bundelkhand region and other parts of the country.During the interaction, the Prime Minister also stressed on promoting recycling of water and rainwater harvesting through innovative and less costlier technology in the region. He also mentioned that Israel’s water technology can be of use.Besides, he talked about the need to increase agro-forestry, reduce consumption of chemical fertiliser, and adoption of organic farming as well as zero budget farming.Rani Lakshmi Bai Central Agricultural University started its first academic session in 2014-15 and is offering both under-graduate and post-graduate courses in agriculture, horticulture and forestry.It is currently operating from the Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute, Jhansi as the main buildings were getting ready.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Ministers of State for Agriculture Parshottam Rupala and Kailash Choudhary, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, and other senior officials were present in the virtual event.

Nobody anywhere is safe here," she said.Earlier in the day, Priyanka Gandhi tweeted about a man killed in Uttar Pradesh's Auraiya and said that according to family and journalists, police allegedly continued to prove this kidnapping case of being a missing person's case for five days.

29-08-2020||New Delhi||Prashant Bhushan contempt case: SC set to pronounce quantum of sentence Monday||The Supreme Court is scheduled to pronounce on August 31 its verdict on the quantum of sentence to be awarded to activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan, convicted for contempt of court over his two tweets against the judiciary.A Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra will pronounce its verdict against Bhushan, who faces simple imprisonment of up to six months or with a fine of up to Rs 2,000 or with both as punishment under Contempt of Court Act.On August 25, the top court was urged by senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan to show “judicial statesmanship” and not make Bhushan a "martyr" by punishing him for contempt over his tweets criticising the judiciary, after the activist-lawyer rejected fresh suggestions from the court for an apology.As the top court reserved its verdict on the sentence to be awarded to Bhushan, Justice Arun Mishra, who presided over a three-judge Bench, at the fag end of the nearly three-hour-long hearing had asked why he cannot seek an apology and what was wrong in using this word.Justice Mishra is demitting office on September 2.The apex court on August 14 had held Bhushan guilty of criminal contempt for his two derogatory tweets against the judiciary saying they cannot be said to be a fair criticism of the functioning of the judiciary made in the public interest.On August 25, Dhavan, representing Bhushan, had suggested that the top court recall the August 14 verdict convicting him for contempt of court and not impose any sentence and urged it to not only close the case but also to bring an end to the controversy.Attorney General K K Venugopal requested the court to forgive Bhushan with a message that he should not repeat this act.The bench also comprising Justices B R Gavai and Krishna Murari, had given 30 minutes to Bhushan to "think over" on withdrawing his statements made in the court and said he made "disparaging remarks against the institution and the judges".Venugopal had said Bhushan, who has been refusing to tender an unconditional apology for the tweets, should withdraw all statements and express regret.The Bench on August 20 had granted time till Monday to Bhushan to reconsider his "defiant statement" and tender "unconditional apology" for the contemptuous tweets.Referring to Bhushan's statements and his refusal to apologise, the bench had told Venugopal that mistakes were committed by all but they needed to be accepted, but here Bhushan was not willing to accept that.Dhavan had argued that reprimanding Bhushan like "don't do it again" as suggested by the attorney general will not be correct and instead a statesman-like message should be there like "Mr Bhushan though we disagree with many things, but from next time you should be more responsible".Bhushan in his statement had refused to offer an apology to the Supreme Court for his two tweets against the judiciary, saying what he expressed represented his bona fide belief which he continued to hold.

29-08-2020||New Delhi||India not to participate in multilateral war game in Russia next month||India has decided to withdraw from a multilateral war game in Russia next month, government sources said on Saturday, a week after New Delhi had confirmed its participation in the exercise that is also expected to be attended by the Chinese and Pakistani troops.Last week India had conveyed to Russia that it will participate in the strategic command-post exercise to be held in the Astrakhan region in southern Russia from September 15-26.Though no reason has been cited officially about India reversing its decision, people familiar with the development said that China’s participation in the exercise was a major factor behind the review.“A decision has been taken to not participate in the exercise,” said a source.It is learnt that the decision was taken following deliberations between the top brass of the military and the ministry of external affairs.Indian and Chinese troops have been engaged in a bitter standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh for over three-and-half months. Both the countries are holding talks at military and diplomatic levels to resolve the dispute.Around 20 countries including all member-nations of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) including China and Pakistan are expected to participate in the Kavkaz exercise.India’s reconsideration on its participation in the military drill comes ahead of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s scheduled visit to Russia next week to attend a crucial meeting of the SCO.The SCO defence ministers’ meeting is expected to deliberate on regional security scenario and geo-strategic developments.India had earlier planned to send around 150 Indian Army troops, 45 Indian Air Force personnel and a number of Navy officers to the multilateral military exercise.Russia has been a major partner of India in the defence sector and the cooperation has been steadily growing further.In June, a tri-services contingent from India participated at the Victory Day Parade at the iconic Red Square in Moscow to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in the Second World War. A contingent from China had also attended it.Both India and China are members of the SCO, an influential regional grouping.The SCO, seen as a counterweight to NATO, has emerged as one of the largest transregional international organisations which accounts for almost 44 per cent of the world population stretching from the Arctic Ocean to the Indian Ocean and from the Pacific Ocean to the Baltic Sea.

Only the persons mentioned in Section 32 are entitled to do the same,” said the Bench which also included Justice KM Joseph.However, the top court made it clear that there was no bar on police officers to investigate and prosecute a person where he has committed an offence, as stated under Section 32(3) of the Act, i.e., if he committed any cognizable offence under any other law.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/police-cant-deal-with-cases-under-chapter-iv-of-drugs-and-cosmetics-act-sc-133316

29-08-2020||New Delhi||Remove dedicated freight corridor bottlenecks: Railway Minister to states||From land acquisition, pending arbitrations and demands of villagers to sluggish work by state authorities, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has flagged issues, which have hampered work on the Rs 81,000 crore dedicated freight corridor, in the letters to nine Chief Ministers urging them to intervene and also telling them that the Prime Minister was "monitoring the project closely".Following concerns raised by the PMO, Goyal in letters to the Chief Ministers of Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Punjab, West Bengal, Haryana, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Jharkhand highlighted how the dedicated freight corridor has been facing "long-pending issues" which have remained "unresolved".The two dedicated freight corridors which are currently under construction – the Western Dedicated Freight Corridor (WDFC) from Uttar Pradesh to Mumbai and Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor (EDFC), from Ludhiana in Punjab to Dankuni in West Bengal – had December 2021 as their completion date which has now been pushed back by six months to June 2022, according to a statement from the Railway Board Chairman VK Yadav, who said that the delay was because of the disruption of work due to the coronavirus pandemic.Goyal has specially sought the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister's personal intervention in resolving the bottlenecks in his state as over 1,000 km of the DFC passes through it."The Prime Minister has been monitoring the progress of the project closely. Over 1,000 km length of DFC passes through the state of Uttar Pradesh... However, certain issues relating to land acquisition and ROB construction still persist, which need to be resolved urgently for ensuring commissioning of the project work within targeted time,” Goyal mentioned in his letter to UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.  "You may kindly appreciate that bottlenecks, even in a few stretches in this type of liner project, will stall the commissioning of the entire project," Goyal added.He has listed a slew of problems facing the Railways – pending road over bridges (ROB), hindrances in physical possession of land in areas like Muzaffarnagar, Meerut, Saharanpur among others due to agitation, arbitration cases, demand for compensation and jobs by villagers, undue demand of lease rent by the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department and protests by villages over building of ROB in Mirzapur district.In the letters, Goyal has listed all the issues that were being faced by the Railways in specific areas in the states. In West Bengal and Jharkhand, the Minister has raised issues of delay in disbursal of awards, arbitration and mutation."Out of total length of 1,839 km of Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor, 203 km (Gomoh-Dankuni) is passing through the state of West Bengal and likely to attract major investment being planned under the PPP model. The foremost criterion for initiating bidding for this project is to acquire at least 90 per cent land with mutation. As such, success of this project in your state depends upon early availability of land,” Goyal wrote in his letter to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee."However, delay in disbursal of awards, pending arbitration, mutations and hindrances in possession of land etc. in various districts has adversely affected project work... You will appreciate that removal of these hindrances are essential to ensure commencement of project work,” he added.In his letter to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Goyal said that the state was a major beneficiary of the project, as 236 km of Eastern DFC was passing through the districts of Gaya, Aurangabad, Kaimur and Rohtas and likely to attract major investment in the state.He said that land acquisition in certain stretches was held up for long due to delay in disbursal of awards, pending arbitration, mutations and hindrances in possession of land which "adversely affected the project work".The Minister has highlighted two major issues in almost all the states – land acquisition and delay by the local governments in building land approaches and road over bridges (ROB).In his letter to the Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, Goyal highlighted how out of the total of 1,504 km of the WDFC, 565 km is in the state.Out of the 60 ROBs that were to be constructed, 32 were to be built by the state, however, only 2 have been built and the progress of the other 20 are slow.Land acquisition for the approaches for 46 out of the 60 ROBs are also pending, he said.Similarly in states like Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Punjab, delay in land acquisition for ROBs by the state governments have delayed the project.Railways will also hold a review meeting with state government officials of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat and Maharashtra on September 1.The DFCCIL has been tasked with developing Indian Railways' quadrilateral, linking the four metropolitan cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Howrah, commonly known as the Golden Quadrilateral. The overall cost is pegged at Rs 81,459 crore.      In the first phase, the organisation is constructing the Western DFC (1,504 route km) and Eastern DFC (1,856 route km) spanning a total length of 3,360 km. These corridors were targeted to be completed in phases by December 2021. The DFCCIL had completed a total of 500 km till January.

29-08-2020||Ravi S Singh||Jal Shakti Ministry makes a push for conservation of Ganges dolphin||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 29The Union Jal Shakti Ministry has made a push for protection and conservation of Ganges dolphins in the context in order to rejuvenate the biodiversity of the river basin.Ganges dolphin is India’s National Aquatic Animal. It is found in the country’s Ganges and Brahmaputra river systems, including their major tributaries.  The Ministry’s National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), which has been mandated with the clean-Ganga campaign, has geared up to synergise its efforts to implement the proposed “Dolphin Project” of the Ministry of Forest and Environment.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the project in his speech on Independence Day.The project was conceptualised during a meeting of the National Ganga Council chaired by Modi on December 14 last in Kanpur. A case for conservation of Ganges dolphins was made by NMCG.The Jak Shakti Ministry is of the firm view that protection of dolphins will also help in enriching the biodiversity, which leads to safeguard of environment and boost to economy, particularly the states involving Ganga and Brahmaputra river systems.  The Centre has assigned the Environment Ministry to implement the project as a nodal authority.The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) has been tasked to prepare the project’s plan, which is expected to be ready by next month.Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, Director General of NMCG, said, “The NMCG had been working for conservation and protection of dolphins. The project will help convergence of efforts of all concerned, and evolve a uniform standard of practice in the matter.”“The Ganges Dolphin is an indicator species for the river ecosystem and is at the apex of the food chain,” Mishra said.“It is an endemic and rare aquatic mammal found only in the Indian subcontinent and is part of our natural aquatic heritage. Ganga River Dolphins, often called the ‘Tiger of the Ganges’, is an indicator species, which has the same role in a river ecosystem as a tiger does in a forest.”Studies put the present population of Ganges dolphins to about 3,000.The NMCG has also decided to rope in the Central Inland Fisheries Research (CIFR) Institute to help build conducive climate in behaviour of fishermen in protection of the mammal.CIFR can help rear fish which act as a diet for dolphins. Also, fishermen should be motivated to be careful with regard using nylon fishing nets which cause fatal injuries to dolphins.Also, NMCG has initiated a move for joint celebration of International Freshwater Dolphin Day on October 24 by India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar which would help build awareness for conservation of the mammal in the region.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jal-shakti-ministry-makes-a-push-for-conservation-of-ganges-dolphin-133301

29-08-2020||Vijay Mohan||For the convenience of elderly, pension orders to be integrated with DigiLocker||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 29Electronically generated pension payment orders (PPOs) of Central government employees will now be integrated with DigiLocker – the state-run online service to store personal documents – in order to provide greater service convenience and ease of access to pensioners. The move would benefit nearly 1.5 crore civilian retirees.The Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions observed that with the widespread Covid-19 pandemic it was a dilemma for the newly retiring officials to physically receive hard copies of the PPO.Further, there have been instances of pensioners, over a period of time, having misplaced the original copies of their PPO, which is a very important document. In the absence of their PPO, these pensioners have to face innumerable hardship at various stages of their retired life, the Ministry observed.The Department of Pension and Pensioners’ Welfare will link the electronic PPO generated through the Public Financial Management System application of the Controller General of Accounts with the DigiLocker.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology runs the DigiLocker, which provides an account in cloud to every Aadhaar holder to access authentic documents such as driving license, vehicle registration, academic certificates, medical records, bank transactions, etc., in digital format from the original issuers of these certificates. Scanned copies of documents can also be uploaded to the accounts.DigiLocker has about 3.5 crore registered users with a depository of close to 400 crore documents from 150 issuing authorities.A facility has been created within the Bhavishya software, which is a single window platform for pensioners from processing of pension claims. The software shall now provide an option to the retiring employees to link their DigiLocker account with their Bhavishya account and obtain their e-PPO in a seamless manner, said the Ministry.This system will enable any pensioner to obtain an instant print-out of the latest copy of his PPO from his DigiLocker account. This initiative will create a permanent record of his PPO in DigiLocker and at the same time eliminate delays in issuing PPOs to new pensioners as well as do away with the necessity of handing over a physical copy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/for-the-convenience-of-elderly-pension-orders-to-be-integrated-with-digilocker-133298

Multi-dimensional issues called for a final resolution on the basis of voluminous records including oral and documentary evidence which had to be translated from a host of different languages.“Every point was hotly contested and passionately argued by a renowned group of lawyers who represented the contesting parties,” Justice Gogoi said.Dixit has penned the book titled “Ayodhya Se Adaalat Tak Bhagavaan Shri Ram”, chronicling details of hearings and the decision. It was released here on Friday.Justice Gogoi, who conducted the hearing for 40 days in the historic case, said that reaching to the final verdict was a challenging task for a wide variety of reasons.“The cooperation of eminent lawyers and their assistance to the bench over a period of 40 days of continuous hearing was unprecedented,” he said in his message.Former apex court judge Gyan Sudha Mishra, ex-high court judge S R Singh and journalists B R Mani, Ram Bahadur Rai and N K Singh were also present at the event held at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts.The top court, in its decision, handed over the possession of the disputed 2.77 acre land rights at Ayodhya to the deity Ram Lalla, who was one of the three litigants in the case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ayodhya-dispute-most-fiercely-contested-case-in-indias-history-ex-cji-ranjan-gogoi-133297

Can’t I meet my ailing mother?“I have to take part in a meeting of the standing committee of Parliament on Sunday and I have been forcibly quarantined here...it’s really disgusting,” he said.He said, RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s son Tej Pratap Yadav had on Wednesday visited Ranchi to meet his father in RIMS and returned to Patna by road, but the administration did not take any similar action.“This appears to be inspired by political jealously,” he alleged.Jharkhand has a coalition government of JMM, Congress and the RJD headed by Hemant Soren. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-mp-sakshi-maharaj-put-in-14-day-home-quarantine-for-violating-covid-norms-133291
29-08-2020||New Delhi||Longer halting time for trains, less people in lifts: Delhi Metro's new normal plans||Limiting number of people in lifts and longer halting time for trains at stations to allow commuters to board and alight with social distancing norms, are among the measures the Delhi Metro will take to ensure safer travel for its passengers, whenever services resume.Metro rail services were closed on March 22 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) had last week said that it will be prepared to resume operations whenever directed by the government."We are still awaiting nod for resumption of services. However, all safety protocols have been worked out and some more being worked out so as to ensure maximum safety for passengers whenever services are ordered to be resumed," a source said.Inside metro premises like stations and train coaches, wearing of masks will be mandatory and social distancing norms will be followed as per government guidelines, and people not wearing masks will not be allowed to enter metro premises, officials said."Trains will halt for longer duration than on regular days to allow commuters to board coaches and alight from it while maintaining physical distance. Also, number of persons permissible to board a lift will be reduced in view of social distancing, and the exact number is still being worked out," the source told PTI.One train coach can accommodate about 50 passengers on seats and a total of nearly 300 riders in the entire compartment, including standing commuters. With social distancing norms, this number will reduce drastically.From new smart cards with auto top-up facility to stickers on social distancing norms pasted on seats and platform floors, Delhi Metro is all set to handle commuters in adherence to COVID-19 safety guidelines, whenever the services are ordered to be resumed, officials had earlier said.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had recently said that metro train services in Delhi should be resumed on a trial basis as the COVID-19 situation is improving in the city, and hoped that the Centre would soon take a decision on it.However, the number of fresh cases and active cases have risen in the last several days.Delhi recorded 1,808 fresh COVID-19 cases on Friday, taking the tally in the city to over 1.69 lakh, while the death toll from the disease rose to 4,389, authorities said.This was the second successive day when over 1,800 new cases have been reported in August.On Thursday, 22 deaths were reported and the daily case count was 1,840, the highest single-day spike in August till now.Experts have attributed the rise in cases in the last week or so to reopening of the economy and many people not following safety protocols and social distancing norms in public.Sources also said, a meeting was held by metro officials on Thursday with security officials, including from the CISF.Before Delhi Metro services were closed in March, a fine of Rs 200 was mandated for spitting inside metro properties. However, it is likely be hiked multiple times, sources had earlier indicated.The economy has slowly opened up in a phase-wise manner in the unlock period since June, but the DMRC has not received a nod from the Centre to resume operations."The DMRC shall be prepared to commence operations whenever directed by the government. All necessary guidelines in place to combat the spread of COVID-19 shall be implemented, and all efforts shall be made to make travel safe for our valued commuters," Anuj Dayal, Executive Director, DMRC was quoted as saying in a statement earlier.According to sources, the Delhi Metro has suffered a loss of nearly Rs 1,300 cr since the closure of services since late March due to the COVID-19 situation. On regular days, the average daily ridership of DMRC is over 26 lakh.Awaiting a nod to resume operations, the DMRC meanwhile, has been training its staff on compliance of COVID-19 safety norms and also on ways to make travel safer for commuters.Thermal scanners will take temperature of commuters while entering and hand sanitiser will kept for them too. Delhi Metro authorities have been working on protocols to ensure social distancing norms are in place whenever the commuters return.Seeking to promote greater e-transaction for commuters to avoid physical contact as such, the Delhi Metro on August 19 had announced a new facility that will enable riders to get their smart cards auto-topped up with money at AFC gates.The old smart card issued by the DMRC can also be upgraded to avail this facility, they said."This feature comes handy at these times wherein, commuters are going to follow a new travel protocol, whenever metro services resume, which calls for social distancing and contactless services due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic," a senior official said.Among other measures, red lines have been drawn at regular intervals next to AFC gates and security checking gates, just before commuters enter near the platform area.On platform floors, large stickers bearing 'Ensure Social Distancing' message have been pasted at regular intervals, with a while circle bordered by an outer red circle, to alert commuters.DMRC authorities, however, remain tight-lipped on whether keeping Aarogya Setu app will be mandatory for traveling in metro whenever the services are resumed.

29-08-2020||New Delhi||Centre revives 2-yr PG-diploma courses for medical graduates||To address the paucity of specialist doctors in district hospitals, the Centre has revived post-graduate diploma courses that one can pursue by clearing the NEET-PG exam after completing the MBBS.Hospitals with a minimum of 100 operational beds are eligible to seek accreditation with National Board of Examinations (NBE) for the diploma courses.The NBE, an autonomous body under the Ministry of Health has launched post-MBBS two-year diploma courses in eight broad specialities – anesthesiology, obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics, family medicine, ophthalmology, radio diagnosis, ENT and tuberculosis, and chest disease.The Medical Council of India (MCI) had in 2019 converted its diploma courses into degree courses to overcome the shortfall of teaching faculty in the country.To fill the void caused by discontinuing the MCI diploma courses, the Health Ministry had asked the National Board of Examinations to look into the possibility of launching the diploma courses under its aegis, said an NBE official."During the COVID-19 pandemic, the weakness and shortcomings of primary and secondary healthcare delivery system became obvious, thereby putting an extra burden on tertiary care health centres with medical colleges being converted into dedicated COVID care and treatment centres,” said Prof Pawanindra Lal, the Executive Director of the NBE."It was, therefore, imperative to augment the hospitals catering to the population in rural, semi-urban areas, and tier-two and tier-three cities," he said.After a series of consultations with the NITI Aayog, the Medical Council of India and the Health Ministry, the NBE prepared a blueprint for starting diploma courses and subsequently notified the launch on August 20.The diploma courses of the NBE are approved by the Union Health Ministry, and are included in the first schedule of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, vide a gazette notification dated August 6.Professor Lal hoped the diploma courses would provide the much-required trained manpower to district hospitals."This will enhance the readiness of the district and sub-district hospitals to provide effective healthcare in situations like the coronavirus pandemic," he said.The NBE diploma courses in anesthesiology, family medicine and tuberculosis and chest disease will provide trained manpower within the geographic region of the community for handling epidemics and common diseases, said the NBE Executive Director.The diploma courses in paediatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology will augment reproductive and child healthcare delivery system and will prove to be a milestone in reducing maternal and infant mortality, he added.Acknowledging the role of the Health Ministry in a speedy approval of NBE diploma courses, Dr Abhijat Sheth, the president of the NBE, said, "These courses will provide the much-needed opportunity to our medical graduates to undergo post-graduate training considering that there is still a significant shortfall in the number of post-graduate seats as compared to that in MBBS." Professor Lal said the key emphasis of NBE diploma courses would be on government hospitals and district hospitals.Entry to the diploma courses shall be through NEET-PG under the Post-Graduate Medical Education Regulations notified by the MCI.Also, keeping in consideration the requirement of the states, 50 per cent of NBE diploma seats in the district hospitals of a state shall be reserved for in-service candidates of the state concerned. This will reduce dependency on tier-1 cities for providing healthcare. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-revives-2-yr-pg-diploma-courses-for-medical-graduates-133272

29-08-2020||New Delhi||Cong writes to Facebook CEO again over allegations of ‘bias’ in favour of ruling BJP||The Congress on Saturday wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for the second time in a month, asking what steps were being taken on repeated allegations about the global social media giant’s India unit being biased towards the ruling BJP.At a press conference, the opposition party also demanded an investigation by a Joint Parliamentary Committee into the alleged “links of Facebook employees and the ruling establishment”.The Congress’ letter to Zuckerberg came over an article in Time magazine, which the opposition party claimed “revealed” more information and “evidence of biases and a quid pro quo relationship” of Facebook India with the Bharatiya Janata Party.There was no immediate reaction from Facebook or the BJP on the allegations. A report in the Wall Street Journal earlier this month had brought to fore similar allegations, which were strongly rejected by both Facebook and the BJP.Tagging the Time magazine report, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi claimed in a tweet that it exposes the “WhatsApp-BJP nexus”.“Used by 40 Cr Indians, WhatsApp also wants to be used for making payments for which Modi Government’s approval is needed. Thus, BJP has a hold over WhatsApp,” he alleged, without elaborating.Popular messaging app WhatsApp is also owned by Facebook.In his letter to Zuckerberg, Congress general secretary organisation, K C Venugopal, referred to his earlier letter dated August 17 in which the party had requested the US-based company to investigate the allegations made in the Wall Street Journal article that the social media platform refused to apply hate speech rules to certain BJP politicians.“We draw your attention to the article in Time magazine dated August 27 that reveals more information and evidence of biases and a quid-pro-quo relationship of Facebook India with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party,” Venugopal said in the new letter dated August 29 and asked for details of steps being taken by the group.“We will also be pursuing legislative and judicial actions in India to ensure that a foreign company cannot continue to cause social disharmony in our nation for their pursuit of private profits,” he said.At the party’s press conference, spokesperson Pawan Khera and AICC data analytics department chief Praveen Chakravarty called for an “exhaustive and unbiased investigation by a Joint Parliamentary Committee between the unending links of Facebook employees and the ruling establishment”.“The investigation must include how Facebook manipulated voter opinion, allowed hate speech and was oblivious to fake news, even when they were in clear violation of their own regulations,” they said in a statement.“WhatsApp cannot be granted approvals for its payment operations until the inquiry is complete and the recommended actions are taken by the company,” Khera and Chakravarty said.They also demanded that the report of the investigation ordered by Facebook into the conduct of its Indian unit be made public. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-writes-to-facebook-ceo-again-over-allegations-of-bias-in-favour-of-ruling-bjp-133270

Anti-poor and anti-nation forces and those who rule by making people fight against each other have been spreading hatred and venom of violence,” she said.“Bad thinking is dominating good thinking, freedom of expression is in danger and democratic institutions are being ruined. The influence of ‘tanashahi’ has been increasing on ‘lokshahi’,” she added.Without naming anyone, Gandhi further said, they want to suppress the voice of the people of the country.“What do they want? They want people of the country, our youth, our tribal people, our women, our farmers, shopkeepers and small traders, jawans to keep their mouths shut,” she said.Two years later, the country will complete 75 years of the Independence, Gandhi added.“Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi, former prime minister Pt Jawaharlal Nehru, G V Mavalankar (Speaker of Constituent Assembly of India), Dr B R Ambedkar and our other ancestors would have never imagined that after 75 years of Independence, the country will face such a difficult situation and our Constitution and democracy will be in danger,” she said.Extending wishes on the foundation stone-laying ceremony, she said, “Today is an important day and we all should take a pledge to protect the foundation of democracy.“We should also take a pledge that till the time we are in power, we should take a decision keeping in view the interest of people standing at the end of a queue.”              “It should be remembered that the Constitution will not be saved by buildings rather it will be protected by emotions,” she asserted.Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi also attended the programme via video-conferencing from Delhi, officialssaid.Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, Chhattisgarh Assembly Speaker Charan Das Mahant and state ministers were present at the venue of the function in Nava Raipur.

29-08-2020||New Delhi||Centre explores possibility of single voter list for LS, assembly, local body polls||The central government is discussing the possibility of having a common electoral roll for Lok Sabha, assembly and local body elections to avoid discrepancies and bring uniformity in the voters list, officials said on Saturday.At present, the Election Commission of India prepares the electoral roll or voter list for Lok Sabha and assembly polls. The state election commissions, which are altogether separate bodies as per constitutional provisions, hold elections for local bodies such as municipalities and panchayats in their respective states based on their own voter lists.Several state election commissions use the draft voter list of the EC to formulate their own rolls. The draft EC roll is often divided into wards for local body elections.Now, the Centre is exploring the possibility of having a single voter list for Lok Sabha, assembly and local body polls as this can help bring in uniformity and also save costs involved in an entire exercise getting repeated for making separate voter lists, officials said.There are provisions in the Constitution that empower states to formulate their own laws to hold panchayat and municipal polls. States also have powers to either have their own voter lists or to adopt the one prepared by the EC for assembly polls.“The government is discussing whether there can be a single electoral roll for these three types of elections. Now, states have to be persuaded to adopt the central electoral roll (the one prepared by EC),” explained a senior functionary.According to another functionary, it is “desirable” to have one common electoral roll as at present an entire exercise gets repeated for the same purpose.“Money is also spent for the same exercise twice. One roll can be good for voters also and there would be no discrepancy in local body and assembly voter lists,” he said.Often discrepancies have been noticed when names of voters are missing in one of the lists.Earlier this month, the Prime Minister’s Office organised a meeting on the issue where top officials of the Law Ministry and the EC gave their views on the present status and the future possibilities.Asked whether the proposed single electoral roll was linked to the idea of holding simultaneous elections, a government official said the two are not linked as simultaneous polls typically refer to holding Lok Sabha and assembly polls together in the Indian context.The Election Commission, the Law Commission and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Law and Personnel Ministries have supported the idea of a single voter list in the past also.In a letter written to the government in November 1999, the Election Commission had said that separate rolls prepared by the EC and State ECs “not only create confusion among the electors because their names may be present in one roll but absent in the other, or vice versa, but also result in duplication of effort and expenditure.”    In its report on Demands for Grants (2016-17) of the Law Ministry, the standing committee had also pointed out that as of now, the EC and State Election Commissions have separate electoral rolls.“They carry out registration of voters and updation of electoral rolls separately. The numbers of voters in their electoral rolls usually vary,” it had said.

29-08-2020||New Delhi||Letter ‘misconstrued’; never sought leadership change: Jitin Prasada||Congress leader Jitin Prasada, one of the 23 leaders who wrote to party chief Sonia Gandhi seeking organisational changes, said on Saturday that the letter was being “misconstrued” and he had full faith in the top leadership.In an exclusive interview to PTI, he said the letter was not written with the intention of leadership change.Asked why he chose to sign the letter, Prasada said: “The letter was written with the sole purpose of suggesting how to reinvigorate and revitalise the party and introspect for galvanising the organisation. It was not to undermine the top leadership. I had stated this at the Congress Working Committee meeting as well.”“The letter is being misconstrued,” the former union minister asserted.On allegations by some party leaders that the intention was to target the top leadership, Prasada said: “I have full faith in the leadership of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi and they have full faith in me.”His remarks assume significance as they come days after the District Congress Committee of Lakhimpur Kheri hit out at the letter from the ‘group of 23’ and called for action against Prasada.Prasada said the resolution passed by the DCC seeking action against him could have been the “result of local instigation of rival factions”.“These are small matters which happen in every democratic party and could be the result of local instigation of rival factions. I bear no grudge against anyone as everyone is part of the Congress family,” the 46-year-old leader said.“The Congress president has said that the matter stands closed and we have to concentrate on fighting the ruling dispensation,” he said.Asked about an audio clip that went viral on social media platforms in which Lakhimpur Kheri DCC chief purportedly suggested that the resolution was passed following directives of AICC, Prasada said: “I don’t comment on unverified media reports.”On the way forward after the controversy surrounding the letter, he said important elections were coming in Bihar, Bengal, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, and “we will put our energy in fighting the communal forces”.Prasada, along with 22 other signatories that included the likes of Ghulam Nabi Azad, Kapil Sibal and Shashi Tharoor, had written to Sonia Gandhi, seeking an active and full-time party leadership among other organisational changes.After the stormy Congress Working Committee meeting over their letter seeking urgent organisational reforms, several members of the ‘group of 23’ have stated that they were “not dissenters” but “proponents of revival”.

29-08-2020||New Delhi||Covid tests cross 4 crore-mark in India||With more than nine lakh samples tested for the third consecutive day, the number of tests for detection of COVID-19 has crossed the four-crore mark in India while the number of such tests per 10 lakh people has also increased to 29,280, the Union health ministry said on Saturday as the total number of coronavirus cases mounted to 34,63,972 in the country.With the focussed, consistent and coordinated efforts led by the Centre and implemented by the states and the Union Territories, the country has set a new landmark of testing 4,04,06,609 people for COVID-19 so far, the Ministry said.The number of daily tests has also seen an upsurge. Already having achieved the testing capacity of 10 lakh per day, 9,28,761 COVID-19 tests were conducted on Friday.Also read: Single-day spike of 76,472 cases pushes national COVID-19 tally to 34.6 lakh“This has boosted the Tests Per Million (TPM) with a sharp increase to 29,280. As is seen in many states and Union Territories that have increased the testing, the positivity rate will eventually fall with higher levels of testing. The national positivity rate has remained low at 8.57 per cent and is constantly falling,” the Ministry highlighted.The number of tests for detection of COVID-19 had crossed the three-crore mark in the country on August 17.India has come a long way from conducting the first COVID-19 test in January in a laboratory in Pune to crossing the milestone of conducting four crore such tests.The country is following the strategic approach of “test, track and treat”, where testing forms the initial and crucial pillar of COVID response and management.It is only by aggressive testing that positive cases are identified at an early stage, their close contacts promptly tracked and isolated, and timely and effective treatment is ensured for those under home isolation or in hospitals, the Ministry underlined.Expanding the network of diagnostic laboratories and facilitating easy testing across the country through several policy measures have given a substantial boost to this upsurge in the national testing rates.“Currently, there are 1,576 laboratories in the country — 1,002 in the government sector and 574 private ones — where COVID-19 tests can be performed,” the Ministry said.India’s COVID-19 tally rose to 34,63,972 with a single-day spike of 76,472 cases while the death toll due to the disease climbed to 62,550 with 1,021 people succumbing to it in a span of 24 hours, the Health Ministry’s data updated at 8 am showed.At the same time, the number of recoveries surged to 26,48,998, pushing the recovery rate to 76.47 per cent, according to the data.

29-08-2020||Chennai||Chennai doctors perform Asia's first lung transplant on Covid survivor||Severely damaged lungs of a 48-year-old Coronavirus positive male patient were successfully replaced by doctors at a Chennai hospital who carried out a critical bilateral lung transplant, the private hospital said.This is Asia's first known lung transplant on a Covid-19 positive patient and the second lung transplant in the hospital since the lockdown began, the statement claimed.In a statement issued here, the hospital said the patient from Delhi was suffering from severe lung infection with Covid-19. His lungs were severely damaged due to Covid-19-related fibrosis in one and a half month after he was infected by the virus.According to MGH Healthcare, the patient tested positive for coronavirus on July 8, and only a small portion of the lungs was left functional.As he became breathless and oxygen saturation came down he was put on ventilator support on June 20. His condition continued to worsen in spite of ventilator support.He was airlifted to MGM Healthcare from Ghaziabad on July 20."His lung condition continued to worsen in spite of maximum ventilatory supportive care, and he was put on ECMO support on July 25 for more than one month. Such patients are difficult to manage even in well-equipped ICUs (intensive care units)," MGM Healthcare said.The doctors decided to go for the transplant, and it was performed on August 27.The transplant was led by Dr. K. R. Balakrishnan, Chairman & Director of Cardiac Sciences and Director of the Heart and Lung Transplant Programme and his team. "Post the transplant, the patient is doing fine in the transplant ICU," MGM Healthcare said."As the patient's both transplanted lungs were working well, we removed the ECMO support. Now his clinical condition is stable," Suresh Rao, Co-Director, Institute of Heart & Lung Transplant and Mechanical Circulatory Support said."Those select patients suffering from Covid pneumonia where all medications and mechanical ventilators fail to show positive results, an early initiation of ECMO support may be a lifesaving modality," said Apart Jindal, Clinical Director & Consultant, Lung Transplant, Interventional Pulmonology & Chest Medicine."Over time, progression can determine whether the patient improves spontaneously or may be offered the option of lung transplant. Lung transplant may well be the answer to many of the Covid survivors whose lungs are healing with fibrosis and making them a chronic respiratory cripple," Jindal added.

Settlements in low-lying areas have also been inundated in several urban areas,” the official quoted the CM as saying during the meeting.Baghel instructed the officials to ensure proper arrangements for food, drinking water and health facilities to the affected people, he said.The chief minister also asked the authorities to carry out timely evacuation of the people stranded in floods and shifting them in relief camps.During the meeting, officials said that Raipur, Janjgir-Champa, Bilaspur, Durg and Raigarh districts witnessed “record rainfall” between Thursday and Friday, while there is flood-like situation in some parts of Jangir-Champa, Raigarh, Rajnandgaon and Balodabazar-Bhatapara districts, the official said.As many as 11,942 houses were partially or completely damaged in various districts due to continuous rainfall, while 219 relief camps have been set up in rain-affected districts for people, he said.During the meeting, Janjgir-Champa collector said that the Mahanadi river, considered the lifeline of central Chhattisgarh, was flowing above the danger mark and he had spoken to his Sambalpur counterpart in neighbouring Odisha about opening the gates of Hirakud dam (build on that river), he said.“The gates of Hirakud dam have been opened,” he said.In Janjgir-Champa district, around 4,000 houses were damaged due to rainfall and resulting flood and 2,091 affected people have been shifted to 45 relief camps, he said.Similarly, in Raigarh district, 27 villages in Baramkela and Pusaur areas were affected due to the floods, wherein 2,389 people were moved to 21 relief camps, he said.In Balodabazar district, 26 villages bore the brunt of the flood and 1,393 people were shifted to 24 relief camps there.At least 35 people were rescued from flooded areas in Balodabazar, he said.Rajnandgaon collector said the road link between Rajnandgaon and Kawardha towns snapped due to overflowing river on the route.Water of Aamner river was flowing above the bridge in Khairagarh town of Rajnandgaon, he said.The chief minister asked the rescue teams to remain alert to deal with the emergency situation.He also instructed the collectors to deploy a joint team of staff of Revenue, District Panchayat, Janpad Panchayat, Forest Department to provide relief to the affected people, the official said.According to the disaster management department officials, Jangir-Champa district received 211.9 mm rainfall on Friday, while Raipur witnessed 160 MM rainfall.Other districts which saw heavy rainfall on Friday are Bilaspur (119.5mm), Durg (142 mm), Rajnandgaon (99.9 mm), Balodabazar (108.9 mm) and Raigarh (119.3 mm).

29-08-2020||New Delhi||Experts welcome UN Secy Gen’s advice to India to phase out fossil fuel for combatting climate change||Experts on Saturday welcomed UN Secretary-General’s advice to India to phase out fossil fuel to combat climate change, saying it’s possible to shift to renewable energy but the government needs an inclusive and comprehensive action plan to ensure a just energy transition and livelihood of workers.The experts felt that Antonio Guterres’ remarks come timely and it could be a moment for India to create its global climate ambition but at the same time, they raised concern over the country’s need for financial and technological support.The UN Secretary-General had on Friday called on India to be at the “helm” of an ambitious global leadership on clean energy and climate action, saying the country can become a “true global superpower” in the fight against climate change if it speeds up its shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.Greenpeace India’s climate campaigner Avinash Chanchal said: “It’s a known fact that burning coal is one of the major reasons for air pollution and the increasing climate crisis. The UN chief rightly mentioned that burning coal in power generation is not only impacting public health and climate but also the economy.”Kamal Narayan Omer, CEO, Integrated Health and Wellbeing (IHW) Council, said the UN chief had complete support from advocates of clean air as fossil fuel has been found to cause various health problems in India.“Phasing out of fossil fuel from our life is no more an option, for the damage it causes is evident and scientifically proven. Fossil fuel still comprises a major chunk of thermal power provided through grids to light up our homes, cities. They are still a prevalent choice of fuels to propel our vehicles. We can already see the ill-effects of air pollution caused by fossil fuel has been found to cause 30 per cent premature deaths, cancer and mental diseases in the country. A recent study found that emissions caused by diesel vehicles are responsible for 66 per cent of air pollution-related deaths in India. It's important to progressively shift to cleaner fuel alternatives for cleaner air,” Omer said.Environmentalist Vikrant Tongad, the founder of NGO Social Action for Forest and Environment (SAFE), welcomed Guterres’ statement but urged the UN to find ways to financially and technologically support a developing country like India.“The Indian government will have to do this in future to deliver climate justice. Our leaders must consider it seriously. At the same time, the UN has to understand that we are a developing country and raising the living standards of our people is important to us. Often, renewable power sources are more expensive than coal, therefore the UN should look for ways to support India financially and technology-wise in this segment,” Tongad said.Chanchal, who shared a similar view, said the government needed a holistic and comprehensive action plan to ensure a just transition and livelihood of workers.“Transition to renewable energy is possible and to an extent, the process has started but the government needs an inclusive, holistic and comprehensive action plan to ensure a just energy transition and livelihood of workers,” he said.Chanchal said India was estimated to bear Rs 10.7 lakh crore annually because of air pollution from fossil fuels.“At the same time, the market is also unfavourable for coal power. The pre-construction pipeline continued to shrink In India and it fell by half from 2018 to 2019. Mostly because of financial reasons, at least 42 coal-fired power plant units under construction at 19 locations totalling 19,255 MW were on hold as of July 2020,” he said.He said according to the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, India had the potential for 1,050 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030 but “there is a need to ensure the growing demand is fuelled by sustainable and cleaner sources of energy and that is possible in today's world where renewable energy is not just environment and climate-friendly but is an economically cheaper option as well”.Suyash Gupta, director-general, Indian Auto LPG Coalition, termed Guterres’ plea to India to invest in clean energy as important, saying it can create new job opportunities and help recover the economy.“Carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning has, over the past century, been the main driver of global warming whose impact is clearly visible today in extreme weather events being witnessed around the world. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ plea to India to invest in clean and environmentally sustainable fuels is therefore important at this time as we work towards a post COVID recovery. Investing in clean energy solutions and creating new jobs in the sector can drive economic growth and recovery,” he said.Gupta added that it was important to make well-informed decisions to bring about the transition and suggested replacing high carbon fuels like petrol and diesel in the transport sector with low carbon fuels like Auto LPG.Aarti Khosla from Climate Trends gave examples of a few states which have said no to coal and said it reflected the sentiments of investors as well as industry.“Gujarat was the first state in India to announce a no new coal policy last year, Chhattisgarh followed up soon after though didn’t make an official statement but has clearly hinted to move in that direction. Maharashtra just recently announced that it would also not build new coal plants. This shift coming from the ground reflects the sentiments of investors, as well as industry,” she said.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/experts-welcome-un-secy-gens-advice-to-india-to-phase-out-fossil-fuel-for-combatting-climate-change-133234

He was also arrested in connection with the 2007 attack in which a person died, said an NIA official requesting anonymity.The official said that Ahmed is the cousin of the UK airport attack mastermind Kafeel Ahmed.The anti-terror probe agency officials said Ahmed was also wanted in a case registered by the Delhi Police Special Cell in 2015 and was declared a proclaimed offender by a Delhi court on July 12, 2016.In August 2017, the Indian agencies had brought in another Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) suspect named Syed Mohammed Zishan Ali from Saudi Arabia. He is believed to be married to Ahmed’s sister.The official said that the role of Ahmed in India came under scrutiny after the Special Cell busted a major AQIS network, with the arrest of Cuttack-based cleric Abdul Rehman and others in December 2015.According to agency officials, Rehman allegedly told the police that he met Ahmed in Bengaluru in 2009, shortly after the latter had returned from the UK after serving a sentence.The official added that Ahmed would be produced before a court later in the day in Delhi.

29-08-2020||Arun Joshi||Pakistani court convicts Hafiz Saeed in terror financing case||Tribune News ServiceJammu, August 29An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan has convicted Hafiz Saeed, the de-facto chief of the Lashkar-i-Taiba, the terror network that has spread its tentacles in the sub-continent, particularly in Kashmir where it operates and executes acts of terror under several front names.Hafiz Saeed, whose anti-India agenda and the acts of terror in Kashmir are well documented since the 1990s, now operates as the chief of Jamaat-ud-Dawa or JuD — which is apparently a charity organisation — was convicted along with two others by an anti-terrorism court on Friday in a case of terror financing.Hafiz Saeed was sentenced to jail terms in two FIRs registered by the counter terrorism department of Pakistan. The sentence was in connection with the acquisition of the properties for the charity, but in reality, were used for terror promotion.In India, Hafiz Saeed is wanted in the 26/11 terror assault in Mumbai but Pakistan has not acted against him despite having been provided with irrefutable evidence.The sentence against the JuD functionaries in the terror financing case by the anti-terrorism court, presiding judge Ejaz Ahmad Buttar announced the verdict against Prof Malik Zafar Iqbal, Hafiz Abdul Karim Rehman Makki and Hafiz Abdul Salam on Friday at a time when Pakistan is facing a lot of pressure from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) — the global terror financing watchdog — to act against terror financers.Pakistan figures in the grey list and if its conduct is found unsatisfactory as the per the requirements of the FATF, it could slip into the black list. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has already voiced these fears after the opposition stalled the passage of two bills in the Senate against money laundering.Khan had said if Pakistan was blacklisted by the FATF, its economy would collapse.The case related to the acquisition of properties by the JuD and its subsidiaries, which were used for terror activities.The prosecution, according to media reports that covered the case, said a property measuring 16 marlas (4,320 yards) in Vehari district in Pakistan’s Punjab was transferred in the name of Al-Hamad Trust, which is a proscribed organisation. “The property,” the media report said, “under the use and possession of the suspects, now convicts being members of the proscribed organisation, which was a subsidiary of Lashkar-i-Taiba, also a proscribed organisation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistani%C2%A0court-convicts-hafiz-saeed-in-terror-financing-case-133195

Before the pandemic struck India?""Will the FM as the Messenger of God please answer?" the former finance minister asked.Chidambaram also slammed the Centre for asking states to borrow more to make up for revenue losses due to pending GST dues.He asserted that the two options given by the Modi government to the states to bridge the GST compensation gap are unacceptable."Under the first option, the states are asked to borrow by pledging their future receivables under Compensation cess. The financial burden falls entirely on the states," Chidambaram said."Under the second option, states are asked to borrow from the RBI window. It is more market borrowing, only by a different name. Again, the entire financial burden falls on the states," he said in a series of tweets.Chidambaram claimed that the central government is absolving itself of any financial responsibility.This is a "gross betrayal" as well as a "direct violation of the law", he alleged.

Most of them chose Japanese as they were interested in robotics and technology.A local Japanese expert then started teaching Japanese online free of cost. Currently, 70 students are learning the language.Talking to PTI, Zila Parishad education extension officer Ramesh Thakur said: “A professor named Prashant Pardeshi from the National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics, who has been residing in Japan for the past 25 years, came to know about this initiative and decided to help these children to learn the foreign language in a better way.”“Pardeshi took details of the project from me over the phone and sent six sets of books on Marathi and Japanese languages. We have received the books, which includes a Japanese-Marathi dictionary, translated storybooks and books on grammar and other texts,” he said.According to Thakur, the Zila Parishad has now decided to expand the project of teaching Japanese to four more schools in the district.“An orientation lecture has been organised for 35 students from four other schools, who wish to learn Japanese,” he said.

29-08-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||US curbs may hit China’s Lanka project||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 28The US’ first-ever sanctioning of Chinese companies involved in building artificial islands in South China Sea may affect the fate of several of Beijing’s under-construction One Belt One Road (OBOR) projects, including the strategically-sensitive Port City Colombo project.New law expected to bar even third country firms from partnering with BeijingIndia and other western countries have tried in vain to dissuade Sri Lanka from handing over the Colombo Port City project in its southwest to China. Chinese companies had earlier completed the Hambantota port in the south-east. This has helped China establish lookouts on both flanks of Sri Lanka overlooking the Indian Ocean.Things are likely to change after the US sanctioned 24 Chinese companies, which means US firms cannot do business with them. Sources said some Chinese companies are in tie-up with US firms as subcontractors and equipment suppliers in the Colombo Port City project and it seems unlikely that they will get a special waiver.If this first economic strike by an executive fiat becomes law, sources expect the legislation to be more well-rounded since there is bipartisan political consensus in the US on containing China. A future law could even bar third country companies from partnering with Chinese firms. This possibility is high after reports quoted US officials as saying that the sanctioned mother company, China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), is the “Huawei of Construction”. This would further cripple Chinese construction activity in other countries.Sri Lanka’s involvement with Chinese companies had begun under Mahinda Rajapaksa as President. Rajapaksa is back and more politically powerful after his brother comprehensively won the Presidential elections and he helmed the sweep of the parliamentary polls.Though Rajapaksa has ensured that diplomatic civility guided the Indo-Sri Lanka ties, he has made no move to accommodate Indian interests by opening a port on the northern coast or allocating oil blocks in the common waters separating the two nations.Sources said if the US sanctions gather pace, not just Colombo Port City but other infrastructure projects in Myanmar and Thailand, that cause South Block unease, may seize-up and could be up for grabs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-curbs-may-hit-chinas-lanka-project-133038

They have filed the petition in individual capacity, their counsel Sunil Fernandes said.Sonia Gandhi, Congress ChiefHope govt listensI feel for you (students) because you are now facing a very difficult situation. You are our future. It is important that any decision regarding students’ future is taken with your concurrence... I hope the govt listens to you, listens to your voices and acts upon your wishesThe petitioners are Balbir Singh Sidhu (Punjab), Moloy Ghatak (West Bengal), Dr Rameshwar Oraon (Jharkhand), Dr Raghu Sharma (Rajasthan), Amarjeet Bhagat (Chhattisgarh) and Uday Ravindra Saman (Maharashtra).They requested the top court to reconsider its August 17 decision on conducting JEE and NEET, highlighting the fact 25 lakh students would cumulatively appear for the two exams at a time when Covid-19 cases had crossed 3.31 million. They said the decision failed to balance the competing but equally important aspects of conducting the exams and safety of students, i.e. their ‘right to life’ as mandatory safeguards had not been ensured during the tests. The SC had on August 17 rejected a petition seeking to postpone the exams scheduled in September, saying a precious year of students “can’t be wasted”.“Life has to go on... Life has to move ahead. A precious year of students cannot be wasted,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra had said, adding students’ career “cannot be put under jeopardy for long”.As per the public notices issued by the National Testing Agency (NTA), which conducts the tests, the JEE (Main) April 2020 is scheduled from September 1 to 6, while NEET-UG 2020 is scheduled for September 13.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/6-opposition-states-move-supreme-court-want-jee-neet-deferred-132975

But in such a situation, fresh dates would have to be worked out in consultation with the UGC, it added.For any exemption from the UGC guidelines, states would have to seek permission from the commission, said the Bench, which had earlier refused to stay the UGC’s July 6 circular on the issue.Apart from some students, Yuva Sena, the youth wing of the Shiv Sena, and governments of Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha and Delhi had questioned the UGC’s July 6 circular asking universities to conduct final-year examinations by September 30.These states maintained that students could be promoted without examination in view of the extraordinary situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic. On behalf of the UGC, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had argued that universities can seek extension of the deadline but they can’t take a decision to confer degrees without holding examinations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/apex-court-pupils-must-take-final-year-exam-for-promotion-132987
