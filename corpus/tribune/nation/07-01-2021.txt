India is invited to join us in this monitoring mission by bringing capacities. This will be an occasion to demonstrate convergence and the capacity to operate together,” French President’s Diplomatic Adviser Emmanuel Bonne said after holding the third round of strategic dialogue with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval here on Thursday.A big part of the conversation with Doval was about defence and security relationships. Bonne said this included talks on military equipment, maritime cooperation in the Indian Ocean, exchanging information and working on doctrinal and operational aspects of naval, air and space coordination.The two also discussed whether certain elements of the Quad naval exercises could be coordinated with the French Navy. “Let us not be too formal about it. We should care more about operational capacities,” he said in response to questions on expanding the Quad, at the Vivekananda Foundation here.The intention is that “we want China to accept certain rules, be less aggressive… If China does not play the game, by our rules, it allows us to say it and draw certain consequences,” he observed.“We should not counter china but compel China to walk in same framework as us,” added Bonne though he skirted a question on India’s military stand-off with China on the Line of Actual Control.Bonne ruled out a role for NATO in the Indo-Pacific in the future. Europe, he felt, first needed to have the capacity to assume responsibility within NATO which is currently US dominated.“NATO allies are far away. NATO will create more coordinating headaches. We would be happy to work with Japan, India, Malaysia and Singapore while Quad members, being format close of France, can develop a more integrated strategy,” he suggested.The French diplomat refuted the impression that Europe was adopting a defensive approach towards China. He defended the EU-China investment agreement and claimed EU had made sure that Beijing would do more on global issues, labour law, climate and different structural elements important for cooperation in the region.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/france-invites-india-to-join-eu-operations-in-persian-gulf-195138

But in case gold ornaments worth Rs 2 lakh are purchased through multiple cash transactions, the jeweller would not require to keep the customers’ details,” said the source.People involved in the jewellery industry, however, claimed that treating traders in gold as a means of generating “black money” does not augur well and the circular will have a far-reaching implication.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/enforcement-directorate-tightens-norms-for-selling-gold-in-cash-195136

07-01-2021||London||Nirav Modi's lawyers rely on Julian Assange extradition block for his final hearings in UK||Nirav Modi's lawyer raised a British court's judgment blocking the extradition of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to the US on mental health grounds, as the embattled diamond merchant appeared via videolink before a court here on Thursday for a two-day hearing of final submissions in his fight against being extradited to India.The 49-year-old diamond merchant, facing charges of fraud, money laundering and intimidating witnesses in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, appeared in the Westminster Magistrates' Court.Sporting a full beard and dressed casually in a blazer, he followed the proceedings from a room at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London as his counsel raised Monday's judgment which blocks the extradition of Assange to the US on the grounds of his mental health.In the Assange case, which is currently the subject of appeal, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser had ruled that extradition would be “oppressive by reason of mental harm” as the Australian activist could commit suicide.“As in the Assange case, the issues here evidentially are the same – the mental condition of Modi and the treatment he would receive given the prison conditions in India,” said barrister Clare Montgomery, reiterating that her client's mental health has been deteriorating due to his lengthy incarceration since March 2019.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities, sought an adjournment of the proceedings in order to access Modi's mental health records to be independently evaluated by a consultant psychiatrist and appropriate assurances be acquired in terms of his care in India.“While the issues of mental health are not contested, the consequences of those need cross-examining,” said CPS barrister Helen Malcolm, who appeared via video link for the part-remote courtroom settings in place due to the UK's coronavirus lockdown.The CPS pointed to already existing Indian government assurances in the case as well as the option for Modi to access privately paid for medical treatment, given his offer of millions in the course of several bail applications before the UK courts.However, District Judge Samuel Goozee turned down the application for adjournment and concluded that the Indian government had “ample opportunity” to respond to five reports presented by defence witness Dr Andrew Forrester, a forensic psychiatrist who examined Modi on several occasions last year and concluded that “coupled with a severe condition of depression, he presents a high risk of suicide albeit not immediately”.The hearing on Thursday went on to focus on the defence team's concluding submissions that several legal bars exist against extraditing Modi to India, including on human rights grounds due to inadequate prison conditions that would fail to provide sufficient anti-suicide measures.Modi's lawyers also claim that he would not receive a fair trial in India due to the case being politicised by the “ruling BJP”, which impacted on the principle of presumption of innocence until proven guilty.On Friday, the CPS will conclude submissions on the prima facie case against Modi in detail, which is expected to complete the final hearings in the case and a judgment expected in a few weeks' time.At the last full hearing in the case in November 2020, Judge Goozee heard the arguments for and against the admissibility of certain witness statements provided by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) and ruled that the evidence to establish a prima facie case of fraud and money laundering against the wanted diamantaire is broadly admissible.He concluded that he considered himself “bound” by the previous UK court rulings in the extradition case of former Kingfisher Airlines chief Vijay Mallya, who has been found to have a case to answer in India in his fraud and money laundering case and awaits a “confidential” legal clearance before UK Home Secretary Priti Patel can consider signing off on his extradition order.Clare Montgomery, who was also the defence counsel in Mallya's case, has sought to establish that the two cases are “completely different”.Nirav Modi is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of "Letters of Understanding" (LoUs or loan agreements), and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.He also faces two additional charges of "causing the disappearance of evidence" and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death” added to the CBI case.The jeweller has been in prison since he was arrested on March 19, 2019, on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard and his attempts at seeking bail have been repeatedly turned down.The charges against him centre around his firms Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds making fraudulent use of credit facilities or LoUs in a conspiracy with banking officials. —

Action is as per law and based on the outcome of our probe. Five persons, including the girl's father, have been arrested," the official added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/man-stabbed-to-death-in-tamil-nadu-over-love-affair-friends-allege-honour-killing-195122

They are stated to be based abroad and have never joined the probe.The ED had also got an Interpol global arrest warrant notified against Purvi Modi in 2018.The couple was arraigned as accused in the alleged criminal bank fraud case where multiple charge sheets have been filed by the ED and also the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).“Nirav Modi’s sister Purvi Deepak Modi, alias Purvi Mehta, and her husband Maiank Mehta filed an application before a special PMLA (Prevention of Money-Laundering Act) court in Mumbai for allowing them to seek pardon under sections 306 and 307 of the CrPC and undertook to make true and full disclosure of the circumstances and events without concealing any evidence and provide complete documents,” the ED said in a statement.“Purvi Modi has also agreed to assist in realising and repatriating various assets in India and abroad totalling to Rs 579 crore,” it said.The grant of tender of pardon and according status of approver in this case by the Mumbai court to the couple early this week was “on condition of making full and true disclosure”, according to the ED statement.It said the assets in the name of Purvi Modi or her companies that are expected to be confiscated with her help include a flat worth Rs 19.5 crore near Breach Candy on the Bhulabhai Desai Road in Mumbai, two Swiss bank account deposits worth Rs 168.08 crore and Rs 108.23 crore and bank deposits worth Rs 1.96 crore kept in a Syndicate Bank branch at Nariman Point in Mumbai.Two flats in the Central Park south area of New York (in the name of a trust) worth Rs 36.52 crore and Rs 182.82 crore, and a Rs 62.1 crore flat at Marylebone Road in London were also among the assets to be confiscated, the statement said.In her application made to the court for pardon, Purvi Modi had said she was not a prime accused and had been attributed only a limited role by the investigating agency.She said she had fully cooperated with the ED in this investigation by providing all requisite information and documents.Her plea said that on account of being Nirav Modi’s sister, she was in a unique position to provide “substantial and important evidence, information, proof, and documents and access to bank accounts, assets, companies and entities that are relevant to Nirav Modi and his actions/dealings”.The agency said its investigation found that Purvi Modi “has more than a dozen bank accounts and has ownership of various companies or Trusts abroad”.“Vide their statements and their submissions before the adjudicating authority (of the PMLA), Purvi Modi and Maiank Mehta have categorically stated that all the companies, properties and accounts mentioned in the prosecution complaints (except Pavillion Point Corporation) belongs to Nirav Modi,” the ED said.She gave her willingness to offer all cooperation to “repatriate the assets to India”, it said.“Both accused stated that the funds channelised through their accounts belonged to Nirav Modi and on Nirav Modi’s insistence,” the ED alleged.“The court further directed that the applicant-accused (couple) shall appear before the court by returning to India for which the complainant-prosecution shall facilitate the approach of accused at the earliest and shall take suitable steps accordingly,” the agency said.Nirav Modi and Choksi, both prime accused in the case, along with others are being probed by the ED on money laundering charges for allegedly perpetrating an over $2 billion (more than Rs 13,000 crore) bank fraud in connivance with bank officials and by issuance of fraudulent Letters of Undertaking at the Brady House PNB branch in Mumbai.Nirav Modi, declared a fugitive economic offender by a Mumbai PMLA court in December 2019, is presently lodged in a London jail after his arrest there in 2019 and the legal process to extradite him to India on money laundering charges is currently on.

Doctors later confirmed she had given birth to a full-grown baby hours before being brought there."It was based on the doctor's statement that the relatives searched the house and found the body of the child. But, she was not ready to reveal anything in the beginning," a police officer told PTI.First she said she was not remembering anything and later she gave contradictory statements."Later, she said her first baby was just one year and two months old. She did not want another baby soon, and she hid the pregnancy from the family out of shame," he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/woman-kills-unwanted-newborn-in-kerala-arrested-195114
07-01-2021||Satya Prakash||SC notice to Centre, EC on plea to debar defecting lawmakers from contesting by-poll||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 7The Supreme Court on Thursday issued notices to the Centre and the Election Commission in a petition seeking to debar lawmakers disqualified under anti-defection law from contesting by-elections during the term of the House to which they were originally elected.A Bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde asked the Centre and the poll panel to respond in four weeks to the petition filed by Jaya Thakur, a Congress leader from Madhya Pradesh, demanded implementation of Article 191(1)(e) read with para 2 of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution i.e. the anti-defection law.“Once a member of the House incurs disqualification under the Tenth Schedule, he cannot be permitted to contest again during the term for which he was elected. Article 172 makes a membership of a House co-terminus with the term of 5 years of the House except in circumstances mentioned therein,” Thakur submitted.A member of the House who voluntarily gave up the membership of a political party also came under the preview of the Tenth Schedule and was, hence, amenable to disqualification under Article 191(1) (e) of the Constitution, the petitioner contended.She contended that the recent trend of political defections rendered the Tenth Schedule redundant by making ruling party MLAs resign from the House leading to collapse of the government. Such MLAs were then made ministers by the new government and given tickets to re-contest by-elections.Accusing political parties of indulging in horse trading and corrupt practices in various states including Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, and Karnataka, Thakur said citizens were denied a stable government and such undemocratic practices needed to be curbed.Once the anti-defection law came into play and a seat fell vacant due to disqualification, the disqualified legislator incurred disability under Article 191(1)(e) and such a lawmaker should be debarred from being elected again during the term for which he/she was elected to the House, she submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-centre-ec-on-plea-to-debar-defecting-lawmakers-from-contesting-by-poll-195107

It is applicable only for regular timetabled trains cancelled by Railways,” the Ministry said in a statement.“After a lapse of six months from the date of journey, many passengers may have deposited the tickets to Claims Office of Zonal Railways through TDR or through general application along with original tickets. A full refund of fare on such PRS counter tickets shall also be allowed for such passengers,” it said.Soon after the lockdown was announced in March and regular train services were suspended due to the pandemic, the time limit for ticket cancellation was extended from three days to three months and in May it was extended to six months.This was done to restrict the number of passengers at counters and prevent transmission of the coronavirus.

These tribal people were often suspected to be involved in various crimes in the area by locals, he added.The provocation for this daring offence of mass kidnapping was the theft of a motorbike of someone belonging to Kalasiya village in the neighbouring Ratlam district, he added.“Following the theft, over 100 men of Kalasiya village, armed with guns, iron rods and lathis, reached Bamandevriya and Hajdia villages under Unhel police station area, where these tribal people lived, in a bus, a car and several motorcycles,” said Singh.They surrounded the makeshift tents of these tribal people and apparently wanted to round up men and threaten them against indulging in crime and recover their stolen bikes, said Singh.But as there were no tribal community men found there, the Kalasiya villagers forced a total of 10 women, 20 minor girls and eight children of various age, into the bus and sped towards their own village in MP, said Singh.“After the Unhel police came to know of this audacious act, it organised a team and rushed after the speeding bus, said Singh, adding after the Kalasiya villagers found themselves being chased, they dropped the kidnapped women on way under the Alot police station area in MP and fled the scene,” the SHO said.After recovering the kidnapped women and children, the Unhel police lodged a criminal case against 100-odd people under various IPC sections related to kidnapping, rioting, illegal confinement and unlawful assembly besides various other sections of Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, said Singh.The Unhel police also arrested six members of the villagers’ gang, travelling in a car and recovered a country-made pistol, two live cartridges, one sword and several iron rods from them, said Singh, adding the police also seized the car.The SHO identified the arrested men as Suresh Singh alias Suraj Singh, Bahadur Singh, Surender Singh, Mahendra Singh, Narayan Singh and Guman Singh, all residents of Kalasiya village in MP.He said the bus which was used to kidnap the tribal women was found to be belonging to Kishan Singh, a former ‘sarpanch’ of Kalasiya village.The entire operation to rescue the kidnapped women was guided by Additional Superintended of Police Rajesh Yadav and Dy SP Brijmohan Meena, the SHO said, adding efforts were being made to nab the remaining 94 involved in the crime.

07-01-2021||New Delhi||‘Modeling’ himself on lines of Adityanath, is ‘moderate’ Shivraj sensing trouble to his position?||Trying to “model” himself on the lines of BJP’s original “Hindutva poster boy, UP CM Yogi Adityanath”, is the “moderate” Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan sensing trouble to his position from the central or the state leadership?Those following his timeline, especially since he took over as the chief minister before the countrywide lockdown was imposed in March 2020, believe so.The “perceptible change in behaviour” of “mild-mannered” Chouhan enjoying a “reasonable mass support from across” in the state is “surprising”, they say.Whether it is the pressure from the Centre, or challenge from colleagues in top-heavy state leadership or instructions from the RSS for which the Madhya Pradesh is a ‘garh’ (home ground) the projection as a “new strong” leader is unmistakable.After enacting a law against ‘love jihad’, he is now promising “a strict law with a provision of life imprisonment to keep a tight rein on the incidents of stone-pelting in the state”.This after incidents of stone pelting at rallies, including by VHP, in Ujjain, Indore and Mandsaur to raise awareness about the Ram Temple construction in Ayodhya were reported.In December, he sounded an ominous warning to mafia, asking them to leave the state or else he will “bury” them 10 feet deep in the ground and now, “I am in a dangerous mood nowadays. I will not spare those who are involved in illegal activities. Leave, Madhya Pradesh, otherwise, I will bury you 10 feet deep and no one will know about your whereabouts,” he said, which observers say is “just not his style”.“The constant attempt by moderate Shivraj to mould as Yogi Adityanath is new,” they say.  Unlike some other states, in MP the BJP is flush with talent like Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s blue-eyed boy Kailash Vijayvargia, state Home Minister Narottam Mishra, Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and many more, including paratrooper from Congress Jyotiraditya Scindia.Sources say “Shivraj managed to hold on to the post in March with great effort and has to make more efforts to remain there”.“He managed to expand his Cabinet last Sunday with great effort,” they add.Apparently, worried over key support base slipping away, for the next state elections the RSS has already entrusted the responsibility of coordination with the BJP to its four senior cadres.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modeling-himself-on-lines-of-adityanath-is-moderate-shivraj-sensing-trouble-to-his-position-195096

07-01-2021||New Delhi||Sonia slams govt over fuel price hike, farmer stir, says country standing at crossroads||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday attacked the Modi government over the ongoing farmer agitation and the hike in fuel prices, and said the country was today standing at the crossroads for the first time since Independence.On the hike in fuel prices, she accused the government of profiteering and said it is turning a disaster into an opportunity to fill its coffers.She also alleged that the government was breaking the back of the poor, the farmers, and the middle class due to its “insensitivity”.“I demand from the government that the rates of excise duty on petrol and diesel be made similar to that during the UPA regime and provide immediate relief to the affected people. I once again appeal to the government to repeal the three farm laws immediately and fulfil all the demands of farmers,” she said in a statement.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also accused the government of “looting” the people by imposing heavy taxes on fuel and alleged that that was the reason it was not bringing them under the purview of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).“There has been unprecedented ‘development’ in prices of petrol and diesel. The Modi government is looting the public by charging heavy taxes on fuel. This is the reason why the government is not willing to bring petrol-diesel under GST,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.Sonia Gandhi said in the midst of a collapsing economy due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Modi government was trying to turn the disaster as an opportunity to fill its coffers.She said while the price of crude oil was USD 50.96 per barrel — just Rs 23.43 per litre internationally — diesel is being sold for Rs 74.38 and petrol at Rs 84.20 per litre in the national capital.This was the highest in the last 73 years, she alleged.“The country is standing at the crossroads today for the first time in the history of independent India. On one hand, the country’s ‘annadata’ is standing on the borders of Delhi for the last 44 days in support of their legitimate demands, while the country’s autocratic, insensitive and ruthless BJP government is busy breaking the back of the poor, farmers and middle class,” she said in a statement.The Congress chief said despite lower international prices, the government had broken all records of profiteering by exorbitantly raising excise duty instead of passing on the benefits to common people.In the last six-and-a-half years, the Modi government had increased excise duty to recover about Rs 19,00,000 crore from the pockets of common people, she said.She also said the BJP government had increased the price of gas cylinders that had hurt the budget of every household.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also demanded that the government rolled back the fuel price hike and help provide relief to the common man by reducing the taxes on fuel.He also urged the government to take back the farm laws and agree to the demands of farmers, who took out a tractor rally around Delhi in support of their demands.“Modi ji, if you still do not agree, then your ego and autocracy will lead to the downfall of your anti-people government,” he said.“To the blind and deaf government, this is the strength of the organisation of the ‘annadata’. Realising the seriousness of this farmers’ struggle in the fierce cold, immediately withdraw all three black laws,” he said in a tweet in Hindi and shared some of the pictures of the farmers’ tractor rally.“The Modi government that came to power by making promises of providing cheap petrol and diesel, if it withdraws the ‘excise duty’ imposed by it in the last 6.5 years, the public will be largely benefitted. Then, petrol will sell at Rs 60.42 per litre and diesel at Rs 46.01 per litre. But it will not do so. This is a game of loot,” he also said.He accused the government of “fleecing” people, profiteering from the miseries of common people and decimating the budgets of the poor.“This has become the mantra of the Modi government,” he alleged.“The Congress demands that the Modi government immediately rolls back the excise duty on petrol and diesel and give relief to the common people already facing the vagaries of insurmountable inflation as also the economic slowdown and recession,” Surjewala said.Petrol price on Thursday scaled to an all-time high of Rs 84.20 per litre in the national capital after state-owned fuel retailers hiked rates for the second day in a row.Petrol price on Thursday was hiked by 23 paise per litre and diesel by 26 paise a litre, according to a price notification from oil marketing companies.In Delhi, petrol now costs Rs 84.20 per litre and diesel is priced at Rs 74.38. In Mumbai, petrol comes for Rs 90.83 a litre and diesel for Rs 81.07.This is the highest ever price of petrol in Delhi while diesel is at record high in Mumbai.

The meeting has retired agricultural scientists from different states, agricultural universities and ICAR institutes as participants to discuss the present scenario emerging due to the ongoing farmers’ agitation. NS Verma, former Associate Director and Head of Extension Education at the HAU, was convener.Dr Khokhar stated that the participants agreed that the demand of the farmers to give statutory provision to the minimum support price (MSP) of their produce is genuine. “The Government is also not having any objection to continue it and prepared to give a written guarantee, hence, it should be given a legal sanction through a new Act,” he said.Besides, the former VC stated, since both the Government and the farmers are posturing their rigid stands with regard to new Agriculture Acts, the agriculture scientists suggested that these Acts should be held in abeyance at least for one year. “ln the meantime, when the aforesaid Acts are not under implementation, a committee having representatives of farmers, agricultural experts, economists, lawmakers, and other stakeholders should be constituted to redraft the Agriculture Acts so that these are acceptable to all who are having a stake,” he maintained.The participants appealed to government to show magnanimity for accommodating the point of view of the farmers and also urged the agitating farmers to maintain their stir peaceful in any eventuality and restrain themselves from falling prey to any clandestine design to flare up the situation. The participants also pay homage to the farmers who lost their lives during the 42 days of agitation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/set-up-panel-to-redraft-act-ensure-msp-to-farmers-agri-scientists-to-centre-195093

In 2021, apart from India, centres likely in Dubai (UAE), Dhaka (Bangladesh), Kathmandu (Nepal) and Singapore.“After careful consideration, it has been decided that JEE Advanced will be held on July 3, 2021, and the eligibility criteria of scoring 75 per cent marks has been waived off for the ease of students,” the Minister said.The Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, will organise the exam for admissions in 23 IITs all over the country.In a meeting of the IIT-JAB, several key decisions have been taken.Elaborating upon them Prof VK Tewari, Director, IIT Kharagpur and Chairman, JAB, urged aspirants to focus harder to ensure their success.“While they might have missed the usual preparation and probably in a more disadvantageous situation compared to those who appeared for the examination in 2020, but looking at the aspirant community as a whole, the competition would remain the same considering the crème de la crème who will be appearing for the examination,” Tewari said.“I would recommend the parents of students to provide special guidance. They may seek information from various initiatives undertaken by the Education Ministry in this regard. Students should take help from the online resources and aim for the goal like Arjuna’s fish-eye,” he added.Prof Debashish Chakravarty, organising chairman, JEE (Advanced) 2021, said: “On July 3, the first paper of JEE (Advanced) will start at 9 am and end at 12 noon (IST). The second paper will be conducted from 2.30 to 5.30 pm (IST).“In 2021, apart from India, JEE (Advanced) centres are likely to be set up also in Dubai (UAE), Dhaka (Bangladesh), Kathmandu (Nepal), and Singapore.

She also visited the village of the deceased and met her family members.On Sunday, the 50-year-old woman who had gone to a temple was found dead under mysterious circumstances. Her family members have accused the temple priest and his aides of raping and murdering her.A case has been registered against the accused and two of them were arrested on Tuesday night, while the priest is still absconding."I am not satisfied with the role of the police. Had timely action been taken, perhaps the life of the victim could have been saved,” Chandramukhi Devi told newspersons here.“The SSP has told me that the woman was found in an unconscious state and had she got treatment, her life could have been saved. The FIR was filed late and the post mortem examination was also done much later,” she said, adding that the autopsy report explains that the incident was "most sickening and unfortunate".SSP Sankalp Sharma had on Wednesday said the post-mortem report has confirmed rape and there are injuries in the victim's private parts and a fracture in her leg. The station house officer of Ughaiti police station has been suspended for laxity in the case, he had said.The NCW member said the incident is "most heinous and strict action should be taken. The government is very serious on these matters and yet such incidents take place".She said the woman was earning the livelihood of her family, adding that the culprits had planned the action as they had called her to the temple through a phone call.“Suspending a station officer is not enough. I have told the SSP that no one involved should be spared under pressure,” Devi said.She said such incidents are taking place despite campaigns like ' beti bachao-beti padhao' and 'mission Shakti' as criminals have no fear of police, and people's faith will be restored only when action is taken against criminals.Meanwhile, former Samajwadi Party MP Dharmendra Yadav alleged that the police and administration purposely delayed the post-mortem examination and did not disclose the report.Yadav, who met the victim's family as part of a Samajwadi Party team sent by party chief Akhilesh Yadav, alleged that crime against women is at its peak under the current government which makes tall claims about women's empowerment.He also alleged that action against culprits under the Yogi Adityanath government is taken on the basis of their castes. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-gangrape-and-murder-ncw-team-meets-victims-family-says-not-satisfied-with-police-probe-195085
07-01-2021||Bhopal||Government wants to privatise farm sector: Kamal Nath||Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath on Thursday alleged that the Centre wants to privatise the farm sector with its three new agri-marketing laws, which are being opposed by thousands of cultivators.Talking to reporters here while announcing the launch of his party’s protest against the government and an awakening drive for farmers which will continue till January 23, Nath claimed the “RSS and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh were votaries of privatisation since the beginning”.“They (the two organisations) also opposed the nationalisation of banks carried out by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,” the former state chief minister claimed.“The (present) government wants to privatise the farm sector with the three agri-marketing laws,” he alleged.The farmers of Madhya Pradesh are simple and the three new laws are against their interests, he claimed.Thousands of farmers have been camping at several Delhi border points for over 40 days, demanding repeal of the new farm laws and a legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP) for their crops, besides other issues.Nath alleged that the “Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its political branches — the Bharatiya Jana Sangh and the BJP — favour a capitalists-driven market economy and are votaries of privatisation”.He equated the three new laws to a “springboard made for industrialists” to venture into the “lucrative” farm produce market.In contrast, the Congress was a votary of socialism and that is why PSUs were set up under the Congress’s rule earlier, the former Union minister said.“Big corporate and multinational companies are eyeing the farm produce market which is of Rs 15 lakh crore to Rs 18 lakh crore in India. The three laws have been brought for these companies to foray into this sector,” Nath alleged.In contrast, the Congress has always favoured a “socialist economy and ideology”, he asserted.“The RSS and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh opposed public sector undertakings and big dams after Independence. They had opposed PSUs like the Steel Authority of India, the National Thermal Power Corporation, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and the Indian Oil Corporation,” he alleged.Referring to the Shanta Kumar committee, he said it recommended that the Central government should buy produce under MSP from states whose yield was deficit, whereas the state government should procure food grains from states (under MSP) where the agriculture production was surplus.The Central government won’t need much money to buy produce from the deficit states as the state governments would make food grains’ procurement from surplus states, Nath said.“We demand that a law be brought to procure food grains of maximum farmers under the MSP mandatorily,” he said.“Our protest (against the government) for the farmers’ cause at various levels including blocks and districts across the state — will continue till January 23,” Nath said.On January 15, a two-hour-long “chakka jam” (road blockades) will be held from noon across the state, he said.The Congress would also hold a massive “kisan mahapanchyat” (farmers’ meet) on January 20 in the state’s Morena district, he said.On January 23, farmers would gherao the Raj Bhawan (governor’s house) here over the demand for a repeal of the three new agri laws, the Congress veteran said.The Congress will launch a farmers’ awakening programme from Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh on January 16, the leader of opposition in the state Assembly said.Nath said he will address his party’s first awareness meeting for farmers on January 16.The party would hold such meetings at different places, he added.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the Centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the MSP and do away with the “mandi” (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-wants-to-privatise-farm-sector-kamal-nath-195082
07-01-2021||Mumbai||High Court praises Sushant Singh Rajput, says his face revealed he was a good person||The Bombay High Court on Thursday praised late actor Sushant Singh Rajput's work in the film "M S Dhoni: The Untold Story" and said that one could make out from the actor's face that he was a good human being.The remarks were made by a bench of Justices S S Shinde and M S Karnik while reserving its verdict on a petition filed by Rajput's sisters—Priyanka Singh and Meetu Singh—seeking to quash an FIR for alleged forgery and fabrication of a medical prescription for their brother."Whatever the case...from Sushant Singh Rajput's face one could make out that he was innocent and sober...and a good human being," Justice Shinde said."Everybody liked him especially in that M S Dhoni film," the judge added.The FIR was lodged against Priyanka Singh, Meetu Singh and doctor Tarun Kumar of Delhi's Ram Manohar Lohia hospital by the suburban Bandra police on September 7 based on a complaint by Rajput's girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty.As per the complaint, the sisters and the doctor prepared a forged and fabricated prescription for anti- depressants for their brother.Rajput, 34, was found dead in his suburban residence on June 14, 2020.His father K K Singh later lodged a case of abetment of suicide and cheating against Chakraborty and her family members.The case is being probed by the CBI.The Bandra police, after registration of the FIR against Rajput's sisters, forwarded the case papers to the CBI as per the directions from the Supreme Court, which had said that all cases pertaining to the death of Rajput shall be probed by the CBI.On Thursday, senior counsel Vikas Singh, appearing on behalf of the sisters, argued that the Telemedicine Practice guidelines permitted a doctor to prescribe medicines after online consultation.He added that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rajput couldn't go for physical consultation.Singh added that even assuming that such a prescription was procured, there was no evidence to show that Rajput consumed any medicines.Senior counsel Devdutt Kamat, appearing for the Mumbai police, however, claimed that no online consultation was done in this case.He said that the WhatsApp chat between Rajput and his sister from June 8, 2020 clearly shows that Priyanka Singh procured the prescription without any consultation between the doctor and the patient."The police has evidence to show that an unidentified man went to the OPD of the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital on June 8, 2020 and took a token and later a prescription from the accused doctor Tarun Kumar," Kamat said.He added that as per the legal provisions, the Mumbai police registered FIR after receiving a complaint and forwarded the same to the CBI.Advocate Satish Maneshinde, appearing for Chakraborty, sought dismissal of the petition and said that one of the circumstances that may have led to Rajput's death was the "dangerous cocktail of drugs and narcotic substances and medicines"."Rajput was under Rhea's care for 14 months before June 8, 2020 when he asked her to leave the house.

On June 14, when the actor was found dead in his room, the box was empty. This has been informed by the servant to the authorities," he said.Maneshinde added that the CBI should probe the case and if it comes to the conclusion that there is no case, then it can file a closure report."The complainant then has the option to file a protest petition. Quashing the FIR at this stage would be premature," he told the court.The bench directed the lawyers to submit their written submissions and reserved its order. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/high-court-praises-sushant-singh-rajput-says-his-face-revealed-he-was-a-good-person-195074
07-01-2021||New Delhi||Delhi HC refers to medical board woman's plea to terminate 28-week pregnancy||The Delhi High Court Thursday referred to an AIIMS medical board a woman's plea seeking termination of her 28-week pregnancy on the ground that the fetus suffers from anencephaly, a condition where the skull bone is not formed.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh asked the board to examine the woman and give a report on the feasibility of terminating her pregnancy by January 11, the next date of hearing.The woman has been asked to be present before the board on January 8 between 11.00 am and 1.00 pm.According to the woman's plea, "an ultra-sonography at the gestational age of 27 weeks 5 days found that the fetus suffered from anencephaly (skull bone not formed) thereby making it incompatible with life".The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act of 1971 prohibits abortion of a fetus after 20 weeks of gestation. The woman has, therefore, also challenged the provisions of the statute which restrict abortions after 20 weeks.She has contended that with advances in technology it was perfectly safe for a woman to abort a fetus at any point during her pregnancy.She has also contended that determination of fetal abnormality in many cases can only be done after the 20th week and "by keeping the ceiling artificially low, women who obtain reports of serious fetal abnormality after the 20th week have to suffer excruciating pain and agony because of the deliveries that they are forced to go through". "The ceiling of 20 weeks is therefore arbitrary, harsh, discriminatory and violate of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India." the petition has claimed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-hc-refers-to-medical-board-womans-plea-to-terminate-28-week-pregnancy-195068

They were later granted bail by the Supreme Court.On Thursday, as the case came up before Alibaug sessions court, Goswami's lawyer sought exemption from appearance. The court granted exemption for the day.The other two accused—Firoze Sheikh and Nitish Sarda—also did not appear.Special public prosecutor Pradeep Gharat took a strong exception, saying the accused should havebeen present for the purpose of identification as this was the first hearing after the court took cognizance of the chargesheet.He also sought issuance of warrant against Goswami and the other two.While keeping Gharat's plea pending, the court noted that as restrictions on account of coronavirus are in place till January 31, no coercive action can be taken.The court posted the matter for hearing on February 6.On that date, the accused will need to appear in person or through video conference, the prosecutor told PTI.After taking cognizance of the police's charge sheet, the court had asked all the accused to appear on January 7.The trio are facing a case under IPC sections 306 (abetment to suicide) and 109 (punishment for abetment).The charge sheet claims that Naik killed his mother, a partner in his business, and hanged himself at their Alibaug house in May 2018 as he was under stress due to non-payment of dues by the firms of the three accused.Goswami, editor-in-chief of Republic TV, alleged that the police reopened a case which had been closed in 2019 as the state government wanted to harass him. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arnab-goswami-two-others-do-not-appear-before-raigad-court-195066

07-01-2021||Lahore||Pakistan’s anti-terrorism court issues arrest warrant for Jaish chief Masood Azhar||In a significant development, an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan on Thursday issued an arrest warrant for banned Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar on the charges of terror financing.The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Gujranwala issued the warrant during a hearing in a terror financing case instituted by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab police against some members of the JeM.“ATC Gujranwala judge Natasha Naseem Supra issued an arrest warrant for Masood Azhar and directed the CTD to arrest him and present him in the court. The CTD told the judge the JeM chief was involved in terror financing and selling jihadi literature,” an official told PTI.He said the ATC judge issued the arrest warrant for Azhar on the request of a CTD inspector.Azhar is believed to be hiding in a “safe place” in his native town – Bahawalpur.Following the Pulwama terror attack in February 2019 in India, Pakistan’s Punjab province police had launched a crackdown on terrorism financing and in this connection arrested six activists of the JeM in Gujranwala, some 130 km from Lahore.The CTD said its teams raided the whereabouts of the JeM’s “safe house” and arrested its members—Muhammad Afzal, Muhammad Amir, Allah Ditta, Muhammad Iftikhar, Muhammad Ajmal and Muhammad Bilal Makki—and recovered lakhs of rupees from their possession.“The suspects were collecting funds to finance activities of JeM. The chargesheet against them has been submitted to the Anti-Terrorism Court Gujranwala and they are being interrogated,” the CTD said.Following immense international pressure after the Pulwama attack, the Pakistan government had arrested over 100 members of banned militant outfits including the JeM chief’s son and brother. The government also took control of the JeM, Mumbai terror attack mastermind Haifiz Saeed’s Jamaat-ud-Dawah (uD) and Falahai Insaniat Foundation (FIF) properties including seminaries and mosques across the country.JeM had claimed responsibility for the Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 CRPF soldiers.Pakistan’s Punjab government claimed to have taken over the administrative control of the JeM headquarters -- comprising Madressatul Sabir and Jama-e-Masjid Subhanallah – in Bahawalpur.According to the government, some 600 students are studying there and none of them is associated with any banned outfit or involved in any terror activity.In May 2019, the United Nations designated Azhar a “global terrorist” after China lifted its hold on a proposal to blacklist the Pakistan-based JeM chief, a decade after New Delhi approached the world body for the first time on the issue.The UN committee listed Azhar on May 1, 2019 as being associated with Al-Qaeda for “participating in the financing, planning, facilitating, preparing, or perpetrating of acts or activities by, in conjunction with, under the name of, on behalf of, or in support of”, “supplying, selling or transferring arms and related material to”, “recruiting for”, “otherwise supporting acts or activities of”, and “other acts or activities indicating association with” the JeM.Azhar is a fugitive released by India in exchange of passengers of the hijacked Indian Airlines plane IC-814 in 1999.After his release in 1999, Azhar formed the Jaish-e-Mohammed and scripted many audacious terror strikes in India.On February 26, 2019 India had launched air strikes on what was said to be JeM’s biggest training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot.The global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is instrumental in pushing Pakistan to take measures against terrorists roaming freely in Pakistan and using its territory to carry out attacks in India and elsewhere.The Paris-based FATF placed Pakistan on the Grey List in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019 but the deadline was extended later on due to COVID-19 pandemic.

07-01-2021||New Delhi||False, defamatory statement by Ramani led to others repeating it, Akbar tells court||Former union minister MJ Akbar told a Delhi court on Thursday that “false, defamatory statement” by journalist Priya Ramani against him alleging sexual misconduct led other persons and the media repeating them.Akbar made the submission before Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) Ravindra Kumar through senior advocate Geeta Luthra during the final hearing in a criminal defamation complaint filed by him against Ramani for allegedly defaming him by accusing him of sexual misconduct 20 years ago when he was a journalist.Ramani had made an allegation of sexual misconduct against Akbar in the wake of #MeToo movement in 2018 while he was travelling as a minister.Luthra said it was Ramani’s tweets that became the basis of other articles.“False, defamatory statement by her lead to repeat by other persons and media. She started this. That’s why immediately after my coming back, I (Akbar) made the complaint against her,” she said.She said due process was available to women and that Ramani had “no desire to go for due process”.“When Ramani says there was no availability of due process, it is incorrect. What they are saying is you can do a parallel trial without going to the courts and the legal system provides to redressal,” she said.She added that Ramani had “no desire to go for due process. There was no interest in due process. It is much easier to malign someone, defame someone on social media. It is impermissible”.Luthra reiterated that Akbar had an “unblemished reputation” that was destroyed by Ramani.“The common thread in all our evidence and theirs is that Akbar has a reputation and that reputation is unblemished till Ramani made her averments. It is not disputed,” Luthra said.The proceedings remained inconclusive and the court will further hear the matter on January 12.Akbar had filed the criminal defamation complaint against Ramani on October 15, 2018.He resigned as union minister on October 17, 2018.Akbar had earlier told the court that Ramani had defamed him by calling him with adjectives such as ‘media’s biggest predator’ that harmed his reputation.He has denied all allegations of sexual harassment against the women who came forward during the #MeToo campaign against him.Over 20 women came up with accounts of the alleged sexual harassment by Akbar while they were working as journalists under him.He termed the allegations “false, fabricated and deeply distressing” and said he was taking appropriate legal action against them.

This hotel was used to house Covid-19 warriors during the pandemic. If the permission doesn't come, I will restore it back to a residential structure.

Also, too much misinformation is being spread on the COVID vaccines. No misinformation campaign should be allowed to succeed at any cost," Vardhan said.The minister asked the states to make sure that every beneficiary of the COVID vaccine is rested at the session site for at least half an hour and immediately sent to the nearest health facility in case of any adverse event.He said while Covishield and COVAXIN had been licensed for use in India, seven vaccines are in clinical trial stage in the country and 30 are under different stages of development."India is well known for arranging glitch free elections through booth level management. The same experience of election management and of universal health immunization logistics will be used to deliver the first doses of COVID vaccines to one crore health workers and two crore frontline workers," Vardhan said.Prison staffers would be included among the frontline workers along with central and state police forces, paramilitary, disaster management teams and revenue workers, among others."We will be starting with three crore health and frontline workers. Tomorrow we have another trial run for a smooth rollout," the minister said.He also urged all state ministers to ensure the National Immunization Day -- January 17 -- sees polio vaccination of all under 5 children.The minister warned that two of India's neighbouring countries have reported cases of wild polio virus 1 and South Africa has seen vaccine derived polio virus."India has not seen any polio case for ten years but the risk of resurgence remains alive till even one country in the world has the virus.

I don't know if farmers are protected from COVID-19. Same problem may arise in the farmers' protest too," a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said during a hearing of a PIL seeking a CBI probe into Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin Markaz in March last year in violation of restrictions imposed due to COVID19.The petitioners alleged the congregation led to faster spread of COVID-19 due to "inaction" on the part of the Centre and the Delhi government, putting others' lives at risk.As Solicitor General Tushar Mehta replied in the negative and said he will find out the status and file a report in two weeks, the Bench said it could give rise to a situation like Tablighi Jamaat event at Nizamuddin."We are trying to ensure that COVID-19 doesn't spread. Ensure guidelines issued are followed," the CJI said.The top court was hearing petitions challenging the validity of the three farm laws passed by Parliament last year.One of the advocates said Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad was not traceable and his whereabouts were not known.Granting time to the petitioners to file a rejoinder, the Bench said the matter will be taken up on Monday along with other petitions on the issue.Noting that there was no improvement in talks between agitating farmers and the government, the top court had on Wednesday said it would take up petitions against farm laws and those against farmers' protests on January 11."There is absolutely no improvement in the situation," CJI Bobde had said during the hearing of a PIL by advocate ML Sharma on the issue.Attorney General KK Venugopal had told the Bench, "There is a good chance that the parties may come to some conclusion in near future."The CJI - who had on December 17 indicated constituting a committee of independent and impartial persons, including agriculture experts, to end the stalemate between protesting farmers and the Centre - had said, "We understand the situation. We want to encourage the talks. We will keep the matter on Monday and will adjourn if you say so."Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had pointed out that since healthy talks were going on between farmers and the Centre, it would not be advisable to take up the matter immediately.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/are-protesting-farmers-taking-precautionary-measures-against-covid-sc-asks-centre-195024

07-01-2021||---||Farmers hold tractor march, say govt has time till Friday to repeal agri laws||New Delhi, January 7Ahead of the meeting with Union ministers on Friday, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait on Thursday said the government can try as much as it can, but the farmers will not go back home till the three Acts are repealed.“The government has time till tomorrow. It can make a law on MSP and take back the three laws."Today's tractor march was a trailer, the entire movie will be shown on January 26," he said.Not expecting any breakthrough before the eighth round of talks with the Union Government, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha in a show of strength started took out a tractor rally.The protesting farm groups started their tractor rally on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) expressway.Armed with Google maps and contact details of points-persons appointed to guide them, the farmers descended on the KMP from four different locations. Those camping at the Singhu and Tikri borders will be entering the expressway from Kundli and Sampla, respectively. The two groups will then meet mid-way before returning to their respective bases.Similarly, the farmers camped at the Ghazipur border will meet farmers coming from Rewasan in Palwal and return to their campsites later in the day.Shingara Singh Maan, president of Haryana unit of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan), said the tractor rally was only the start of a long-drawn-out battle for their rights.“This rally is an example of our strong resolve because we know this will take a long time and we are prepared to sit for many more months. Today’s show of strength will only empower our farmers to join in,” said Maan, who is leading the group from Tikri border towards Palwal.Maan said they were not expecting any breakthrough from the scheduled eighth round of talks with the Union Government’s representatives led by Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar.“We don’t think we will get anything substantive from the meeting. Kal kuch nahi hona (nothing significant will come out of the meeting). We have known for a while that this will be a long-drawn-out battle to get those bills repealed and all of us are prepared for that,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmers-hold-tractor-march-say-govt-has-time-till-friday-to-repeal-agri-laws-195010
07-01-2021||New Delhi||India implemented several measures to facilitate trade from 2015-20: WTO||India has implemented several measures to facilitate trade, such as simplification of procedures and customs clearances for imports and exports, according to WTO.Geneva-based World Trade Organisation (WTO) said that the other trade-facilitation initiatives introduced by India since 2015 include introduction of Indian Customs Electronic Gateway (ICEGATE); Single Window Interface for Facilitation of Trade (SWIFT); the Direct Port Delivery and the Direct Port Entry facilities; and the increased use of the Risk Management System (RMS).These points were part of the report of India's seventh Trade Policy Review (TPR), which began on January 6 at the World Trade Organisation. The TPR is an important mechanism under its monitoring function, and involves a comprehensive peer-review of the member's national trade policies.India's last TPR took place in 2015."During the period under review, India implemented several measures to facilitate trade, such as a reduction in the number of documents required, and the automation of the customs clearance system for imports and exports," the WTO has said. It added that India's trade policy remained largely unchanged since the previous review.India continues to rely on trade policy instruments such as the tariff, export taxes, minimum import prices, import and export restrictions, and licensing, it said."These are used to... manage domestic demand and supply requirements, protect the economy from wide domestic price fluctuations, and ensure conservation and proper utilisation of natural resources. As a result, frequent changes are made to tariff rates and other trade policy instruments, which creates uncertainty for traders," it added.To support both domestic production and exports, it said, India continues to provide a number of incentives, in the form of direct subsidies and price support schemes, tariff concessions or exemptions, or preferential rates of interest.Meanwhile, an official statement said that India's delegation for the TPR was headed by Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan.In his opening statement to the WTO Membership on the occasion, the secretary emphasised that this review is taking place at a time when the world is witnessing an unprecedented health and economic crisis.With an eye on the rapidly expanding size of the Indian market, leading industrialised and developed countries sought greater liberalisation of India's trade policy, especially in the area of agriculture, harmonising its standards regime with international standards as well as reducing anti-dumping and other trade-remedy measures, it said.He highlighted that, in order to deal with the immediate fall-out of the COVID-19 pandemic, India has advocated a short-term package of effective measures at the WTO that includes a temporary waiver of certain TRIPS provisions to increase manufacturing capacity and ensure timely and affordable availability of new diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19; and a permanent solution for public stockholding for food security purposes to address food security concern.The country has also suggested for a multilateral initiative that provides for easier access to medical services to facilitate easier cross-border movement of health care professionals.The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement came into effect in January 1995. It is a multilateral agreement on intellectual property rights such as copyright, industrial designs, patents and protection of undisclosed information or trade secrets."A comprehensive report issued by the WTO Secretariat on the occasion, chronicling all major trade and economic initiatives that India took over the last five years, acknowledged India's strong economic growth at 7.4 per cent during the period under review and made a positive note of India's reform efforts during this period," the statement said.The TPR meeting will continue till January 8, when further discussions on India's trade and economic policies will continue among members.

07-01-2021||New Delhi||Farmers' protest: Security increased along Delhi borders||Security was increased along the borders of the national capital ahead of a tractor rally of farmers on Thursday morning.The farmers will hold the rally at 11 am at four borders of Delhi in protest against the Centre's agriculture laws. They had on Tuesday deferred their proposed tractor march from January 6 to January 7 due to bad weather forecast.The city has been receiving rain sporadically over the past four days.Braving severe cold and sporadic rain, thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and some other parts of the country have been camping at several Delhi border points for over 40 days, demanding repeal of farm laws, a legal guarantee on minimum support price for their crops and two other issues.The seventh round of talks between protesting unions and three central ministers ended inconclusively on Monday as farmer groups stuck to their demand for the repeal of three laws, while the government listed out various benefits of the new acts for the growth of the country's agriculture sector.Since the farmers arrived at the national capital's borders, the Delhi Traffic Police has been posting alerts on its official Twitter handle to inform commuters about road closures across the city.In a series of tweets, it had said Singhu, Auchandi, Piau Maniyari, Saboli and Mangesh borders were closed for traffic movement."Please take alternative route via Lampur Safiabad, Palla & Singhu school toll tax borders. Traffic has been diverted from Mukarba & GTK road. Please avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK Road & NH-44."The Chilla and Ghazipur borders are closed for traffic coming from Noida & Ghaziabad to Delhi because of farmer protests. Please take alternative route for coming to Delhi via Anand Vihar, DND, Bhopra & Loni Borders," the traffic police said.It said Tikri and Dhansa borders are also closed for traffic movement."Jhatikara Border is open only for LMV (Cars/Light Motor Vehicles), two wheelers and pedestrian movement," another tweet read.According to the traffic police, people travelling to Haryana can take the routes via Jharoda (only single carriageway), Daurala, Kapashera, Badusarai, Rajokri NH-8, Bijwasan/Bajghera, Palam Vihar and Dundahera borders.

07-01-2021||New Delhi||Petrol price at all-time high, diesel crosses Rs 81 in Mumbai||Petrol price on Thursday scaled to an all-time high of Rs 84.20 per litre in the national capital after state-owned fuel retailers hiked rates for the second day in a row.Petrol price on Thursday was hiked by 23 paise per litre and diesel by 26 paise a litre, according to a price notification from oil marketing companies.In Delhi, petrol now costs Rs 84.20 per litre and diesel is priced at Rs 74.38. In Mumbai, petrol comes for Rs 90.83 a litre and diesel for Rs 81.07.This is the highest ever price of petrol in Delhi, while diesel is at record high in Mumbai.State-owned fuel retailers Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) had on Wednesday resumed daily price revision after nearly a month-long hiatus.Price had been raised by 26 paise per litre for petrol and 25 paise on diesel on Wednesday.The previous highest ever rate of Rs 84 a litre for petrol in Delhi was touched on October 4, 2018. On that day, diesel too had scaled to an all-time high of Rs 75.45 a litre.The government had responded to that situation by cutting excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre in a bid to ease inflationary pressure and boost consumer confidence. Alongside, state-owned fuel retailers cut prices by another Re 1 a litre, which they recouped later.However, no tax cut is under consideration as of present, a senior government official had said on Wednesday.Though petrol and diesel rates are to be revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange, government-controlled fuel retailers have been moderating rates since the pandemic broke out.They first did not pass on to the customers a reduction in price warranted from the slump in international oil rates witnessed due to demand erosion beginning March 2020.While they promptly passed on an increase in sales tax by state governments such as the one in Delhi, they adjusted a steep increase in excise duty by the Central government against the reduction in retail price warranted.The government raised excise duty by Rs 13 per litre on petrol and by Rs 15 a litre on diesel in two instalments in March 2020 and May 2020 to garner additional revenue of Rs 1.6 lakh crore.That adjustment of rate revision against excise duty hike resulted in a 52-day status quo in prices between March 17, 2020, and June 6, 2020. This was followed by no change in rates between June 30, 2020, and August 15, 2020, and 58-day hiatus in petrol price revision and 48-day status quo on diesel rates from September 22, 2020, and October 2, 2020, respectively.Rates were again frozen after the last revision on December 7, 2020.Since May 2020, petrol price has risen by Rs 14.54 per litre and diesel by Rs 12.09 a litre, price notifications of oil companies showed.The highest level for petrol in Mumbai was on October 4, 2018 when it was Rs 91.34.

07-01-2021||Vibha Sharma||What to expect from eighth round of talks between Centre and farmers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, January 7Ahead of the eighth round of talks with Union ministers on Friday, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait on Thursday said the government can try as much as it can but farmers will not go back home till the three Acts are repealed. “The government still has time till tomorrow. It can make a law on MSP and take back the three laws and fulfil demands of the agitation.“The tractor march today was a trailer, the full movie will be shown on January 26 (Republic Day when farmers have planned a tractor parade),” he said. Meanwhile, slamming the “attempts to defame the agitation”, Dr Darshan Pal of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha said “few anti-social elements are disturbing the protests by various activities”.“The discipline committee is investigating reports and individuals concerned will be handed over to the police. We are again reminding the government ahead of tomorrow’s meeting that these laws should be completely repealed and remunerative MSP should be made into a legal right of all farmers. We will never accept the amendments offered by government and towards fulfilling our demands, we will continue to intensify the protests,” he said, making clear unions’ stance at the meeting. While after the January-4 talks, it is more or less clear the government has ceded all it intends to persuade farmers to end the agitation speculations are it may offer or propose the choice of implementation of the three contentious laws on States, giving them the power/freedom to enforce them.Farmer’ leaders say after what Punjab BJP leaders said after their meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that “Maoists have infiltrated the movement, the PM knows best and farmers should listen to him, it is clear the government has not understood the gravity of the situation”. “It is not about which party is in power in which State, it is about farmers,” they say. However, while farmers threaten escalation it seems the government too is prepared for a long haul. Sources say the government has already relented on the proposed Power Act, the Ordinance on stubble pollution and offered amendments to the three Acts. “They (farmers) should tell us something new, we are ready to discuss the three Acts clause by clause,” they say. Given the kind of support/traction the agitation has received from common people, the matter has moved out of the hands of unions’ leaders for any resolution on lesser terms, this farmer and government negotiators know well. “It is now a people’s movement,” says a union leader.  But as Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar has also pointed on many occasions, for the government “it is the matter of the entire country and not just Punjab and Haryana”. Politically, it is the question of 23 Lok Sabha seats of Punjab and Haryana and it remains to be seen how far the BJP-led Centre is willing to go to save those. Small and marginal farmers comprise almost 80 to 85 per cent. Plus if the government relents any further, it risks the chance of opening fronts of other such protests.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-to-expect-from-eighth-round-of-talks-between-centre-and-farmers-194999

There are about 90 names, including 20 of Galwan martyrs. After clearance from the committee, each name and rank is etched on a granite tablet. Each tablet is arranged in a circular pattern on one of the 16 walls of the memorial. The pattern symbolises ancient Indian war formation “Chakravyuh”. A tendering process has started to get the granite tablets etched. The process will take a few weeks, which means the inscriptions won’t be added before Republic Day.A functionary questioned annual update of names instead of a quarterly update. Having the names of Galwan heroes and others on the memorial wall would have been ideal when the President and the Prime Minister come to pay their respects.Stuck in red tape||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/galwan-heroes-yet-to-find-place-at-memorial-194941

07-01-2021||---||SC won’t stay UP ordinance against religious conversion||New Delhi, January 6The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to stay provisions of an Uttar Pradesh ordinance and an Uttarakhand law aimed at checking unlawful religious conversion for inter-faith marriages.A three-Judge Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, however, agreed to examine the controversial UP ordinance and the Uttarakhand law and issued notice to the two states asking them to respond in four weeks to petitions filed by Vishal Thakre and others and NGO Citizens for Justice and Peace.Jamiat too moves courtJamiat Ulema-i-Hind has also moved the SC against the UP ordinance and sought to be impleaded as a party in the petition on which notice was issued on Wednesday.At the outset, a disinclined CJI said, “The challenge is already pending in high courts. Why don’t you go there? We are not saying you have a bad case. But you must approach the high courts in the first instance instead of coming to the Supreme Court directly.”Later, the Bench agreed to issue notice after senior advocate CU Singh and lawyers for some other petitioners pointed out that the petitioners had challenged laws of two states and more BJP states were in the process of enacting similar laws.Terming the provisions as “oppressive” and “obnoxious”, Singh alleged that several innocent persons had been arrested on the basis of the UP ordinance against ‘love jihad’. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the Allahabad High Court was already seized of the matter. Singh wanted the top court to stay the operation of the laws that mandated prior permission for religious conversions for marriage.“You are asking for a relief which we cannot entertain under Article 32. Whether provision is arbitrary or oppressive needs to be seen. This is the problem when you come directly to the Supreme Court,” said the CJI.The petitioners questioned the validity of the laws on the ground of alleged violation of fundamental rights of citizens, contending their provisions went against public policy.The Uttar Pradesh Vidhi Virudh Dharma Samparivartan Pratishedh Adhyadhesh, 2020 (Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Ordinance, 2020) - which was promulgated in November last- prescribes imprisonment from one year to 5 years, or Rs 15,000 fine (in normal cases) minimum three years and maximum 10 years, and fine of Rs 25,000, if the girl is a minor or from the SC/ST community.It prescribes a jail term of minimum three years up to 10 years, and Rs 50,000 fine in cases involving mass religious conversion. The offence is cognizable and non-bailable.According to the Ordinance, no person shall convert or attempt to convert either directly or otherwise any other person from one religion to another by use or practice of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage nor shall any person abet, convince or conspire such conversion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-wont-stay-up-ordinance-against-religious-conversion-194904

The observation came a day ahead of a “tractor march” by farmers.“There is absolutely no improvement in the situation,” Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said during the hearing of a PIL by advocate ML Sharma on the issue.Attorney General KK Venugopal told the Bench, “There is a good chance that the parties may come to some conclusion in near future.”Traffic Advisory issued by Sonepat policeThe CJI, who had on December 17 indicated constituting a committee of independent and impartial persons, including agriculture experts, to end the stalemate between the protesting farmers and the Centre, said, “We understand the situation. We want to encourage talks. We will take up the matter on Monday and will adjourn, if you say so.”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said since healthy talks were going on between farmers and the Centre, it would not be advisable to take up the matter immediately.The Attorney General also said that filing of response by the Centre could foreclose avenues of ongoing negotiations between the two sides.Agreeing with Venugopal and Mehta, the Bench said if it was told on Monday that discussions were still underway, it would adjourn the hearing.The Bench, however, issued notice to the Centre on Sharma’s petition challenging a 1954 amendment to the Constitution putting certain agriculture-related issues on the Concurrent List, allowing the Centre to enact farm laws. Meanwhile, the agitating farmers will go ahead with the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha’s call for a tractor rally tomorrow morning.Bhartiya Kisan Union state president Joginder Nain said the farmers would assemble at the Bahadurgarh bus stand in the morning. “Thereafter, they will proceed towards Aasodha village. From there, they will drive down the KMP highway to reach Singhu border. Similarly, farmers from Singhu will proceed towards Tikri,” he added. The police have beefed up security along the march route to ward off any untoward incident.Preparing for long haulAs farmers, braving the biting cold, draw elaborate plans for Lohri, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary on January 23 and the ‘tractor parade’ on January 26, the govt too seems to be preparing for a long haul. Ahead of the eighth round of talks on Jan 8, sources say the govt has already expressed itswillingness to make amendments to the three farm Acts, and that is about all. Given the kind of public support the stir has received, the negotiators know too well that finding a middle path will be a tough task. “Politically, it’s a matter of 23 seats (Punjab & Haryana) in the 545-member Lok Sabha,” they point out. — Vibha Sharma||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-headway-will-hear-pils-on-jan-11-cji-194900

The provision for registration of a technical grade pesticide in India before registration of any of its formulations in India will result in unfair advantages to imported formulations which may contain unregulated, low-grade or expired technical-grade pesticides sourced from unapproved sources.The Bill vests unbridled power in the Registration Committee to review the registration of a pesticide and suspend, cancel or ban it without scientific basis. The pesticide producers suggest review of registration after 15 years of the grant of original registration or 10 years of products’ last review to eradicate arbitrariness.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/refer-pesticide-bill-to-select-house-panel-manufacturers-to-govt-194747

||Top court: Fix income of homemakers, will recognise their labour||New Delhi, January 6 Recognising homemakers' contribution to a household in terms of "economic value", the Supreme Court has enhanced by Rs 11.20 lakh compensation awarded to heirs of a couple from Delhi who died in an accident in 2014. A three-judge Bench of Justice NV Ramana, Justice S Abdul Nazeer and Justice Surya Kant enhanced the compensation of Rs 22 lakh awarded by the Delhi High Court in 2017 to the claimant – family members of the victims – to Rs 33.20 lakh. One of the deceased was a homemaker. In a separate judgment, supplementing the main verdict penned by Justice Surya Kant, Justice Ramana sought to dispel the notion that homemakers don’t work or that they do not add economic value to the household. Terming it a “problematic idea” that has persisted for many years, Justice Ramana said it must be overcome. "The issue of fixing notional income for a homemaker, therefore, serves extremely important functions. It is a recognition of the multitude of women who are engaged in this activity, whether by choice or as a result of social/cultural norms. It signals to society at large that the law and the courts of the land believe in the value of the labour, services and sacrifices of homemakers."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/top-court-fix-income-of-homemakers-will-recognise-their-labour-194752

Although Gunawardena offered no specific commitments in public, he agreed that Colombo required partnerships for enhanced investment in several sectors of the economy.India has its sights on the Colombo Port’s Eastern Container Terminal, but is being opposed by trade unions and the Left. Gunawardena represents a left-of-centre party and had campaigned against the Vietnam War in his youth. His father, a former Cabinet Minister, was Sri Lanka’s leading Trotskyite and an independence movement hero.Jaishanakar said early implementation of many proposals under discussion would definitely accelerate Sri Lanka’s economic recovery.“We have discussed some important opportunities in the course of yesterday and today, including in special zones for pharmaceutical manufacturing as also in tourism. I will ensure an early follow-up from the Indian side,” Jaishankar assured Gunawardena.The Sri Lankan Foreign Minister was highly appreciative of the Indian support over the past several months to mitigate the adverse impact of Covid. He also thanked India for extending assistance in repatriating Sri Lankan pilgrims, students and medical cases.“As close neighbours and littoral states, we discussed defence and security matters as well as maritime and fishery sectors. We agreed to continue the momentum brought about by close dialogue as also (agreed to) curb illegal activities,” added Gunawardena.Though Sri Lanka abuts further into the Indian Ocean than India and Colombo is a natural stopover for long-haul ships, there was no mention of Indo-Pacific. Nor was there any mention on infrastructure projects that are debt traps.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jaishankar-presses-for-early-decision-on-lanka-projects-194755
