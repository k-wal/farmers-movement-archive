The bilateral defence trade touched $18 billion-mark in 2019, reflecting the growing defence cooperation between the two sides.Both sides have also been pushing for joint venture and collaboration between private sectors of the two countries in defence manufacturing.In June 2016, the US had designated India a “Major Defence Partner”, intending to elevate defence trade and technology sharing with New Delhi to a level commensurate with that of its closest allies and partners.The Indian and Chinese armies were locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last eight weeks. The tension escalated manifold after a violent clash in Galwan Valley in which 20 Indian Army personnel were killed.The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. According to an American intelligence report, the number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35.In the past week, the Chinese military has withdrawn troops from all major friction points in line with a disengagement understanding with the Indian Army.Both sides have held several rounds of diplomatic and military talks in the last few weeks to ease tension in the region.

12-07-2020||Chennai||DMK MLA ‘opens fire’ during clash in Tamil Nadu, arrested||A land dispute near here between a realtor and a DMK legislator led to a violent clash and the latter allegedly fired at the opposite group, police said here on Sunday.MLA L Idhayavarman, property developer Kumar and three others who had allegedly assisted the legislator have been arrested today, a senior police official said.Trouble started on Saturday, after Kumar allegedly tried to level a “public land” so as to provide access to a parcel of his land at Sengadu village off Tiruporur near here.However, several villagers, the legislator representing Tiruporur, a suburb near here and his father Lakshmipathy opposed the move since the land in question was public in nature that abutted a temple.“It was essentially a civil dispute and an enquiry by the RDO (Revenue Divisional Officer) was pending for quite some time,” the official said.Arguments led to a violent clash between a group of people led by the MLA and another by Kumar, who allegedly had “hired about 50 goons for his protection”.  In the melee, Idhayavarman had allegedly opened fire and a single barrel gun and a pistol used during the clash were later seized, he said adding though the MLA said that these were licensed firearms, the “licence period has expired”.Also, a bullet allegedly fired by the MLA grazed through a bystander causing injury to him and he too has preferred a police complaint against the legislator and a car on the spot too had “bullet marks,” on the bonnet and windscreen.The clash resulted in injuries to people from both groups and a number of two-wheelers were also set on fire leading to anxiety and tension briefly.To a question, the official told PTI that people from MLA’s side have alleged that Kumar’s group too had used firearms against them, which was being probed.Before starting the land levelling work, the realtor had submitted a petition to the police alleging that the MLA had drained water into his land by creating a trench, without obtaining his permission.Clashes erupted despite a police party visiting the spot and advising both sides to maintain peace, he said.A case has been registered under various sections of the IPC and the Arms Act and both the groups have filed complaint and counter plaints and a probe was on.

12-07-2020||New Delhi||Suspended cop Davinder Singh shared ‘sensitive’ info with Pak High Commission: Officials||Suspended Deputy Superintendent of Jammu and Kashmir Police Devender Singh allegedly shared information including “sensitive” particulars with his contacts at the Pakistan High Commission which was grooming him to get some confidential details, officials have said.While probing Singh’s role, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had cracked passwords of his “secure” social media accounts which indicated his involvement with some staffers of the Pakistan High Commission, who had since been repatriated following their role in espionage activities in the national capital, officials said here.The NIA filed a chargesheet against Singh, at present lodged in Jammu jail, and five others on July 6 in a case of allegedly waging “war against India” with the help of Pakistan-based terror groups especially the Hizbul Mujahideen.Before his arrest, Singh’s last posting was at the crucial anti-hijacking unit of the strategic Srinagar airport. Immediately after his arrest on January 11 this year, the Centre began the process of handing over the security of the airport to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) as a precautionary measure.The 3,064-page chargesheet, filed in a Jammu court under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code, names Singh, self-styled commander of the Hizbul Mujahideen terror group Syed Naveed Mushtaq alias Naveed Babu and his alleged network of aides.The others named are his brother Syed Irfan Ahmad as well as the group’s alleged overground worker Irfan Shafi Mir, alleged accomplice Rafi Ahmad Rather and businessman Tanveer Ahmad Wani, former president of the Line of Control Traders Association.In the chargesheet, the NIA gave details of his role alleging that Singh was “in touch with certain officials of Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi through secure social media platforms. Investigation revealed that he was being groomed by Pakistani officials for obtaining sensitive information”.The chargesheet, which comprises 3,017 oral and documentary evidences, gives details about his contacts at the Pakistan High Commission and also about the information shared by him.The officials said he had been sharing “sensitive information” from the latter part of 2019 but refused to divulge further details.The officials said Singh was in close contact with a person identified as Shafqat, an assistant working with the Pakistani mission here. The official was among the 50 per cent staff which was repatriated late last month.The officials said Irfan Shafi Mir, an advocate who worked as an overground worker for the terror group, had always been negotiating with the High Commission officials and even receiving money on a regular basis.Before his arrest, the accused had received a huge amount for organising seminars in Jammu and Kashmir and was tasked with fuelling unrest in the union territory especially in the Kashmir valley, they said.Mir also visited Pakistan from where he allegedly carried information for the cadres of Hizbul Mujahideen in the Valley about the future course of action, the officials said.Singh was arrested on January 11 this year along with Naveed Babu, Rather and the advocate when their car was intercepted by Jammu and Kashmir police near Qazigund on the national highway connecting the Valley with the rest of the country.A search of the vehicle led to the recovery of an AK-47 rifle, three pistols and a cache of ammunition and explosives. The NIA took over the case on January 17.The investigation found that Singh, in an apparent bid to shield Naveed Babu, had shifted him along with the advocate to Jammu and arranged safe shelter for them in the city in February last year as well.Singh used his own vehicle for the movement of the Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists and also assured them help in procuring weapons, the NIA alleged. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/suspended-cop-davinder-singh-shared-sensitive-info-with-pak-high-commission-officials-112017
12-07-2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Increasing suicidal tendency among children during lockdown in Kerala; Over 60 end lives since March 25||At least 66 children have ended their lives in Kerala since the COVID-19 lockdown began on March 25 with youngsters facing stress unable to bear the unprecedented situation where schools are shut and friends out of reach to share their woes.According to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, there has been an increasing instance of suicidal tendencies among children in the state due to various reasons, including parents scolding them over mobile phone use and failure to attend online classes.This has prompted the government to launch a tele- consultation facility for children facing stress and also cautioning parents against hurting their sentiments while being concerned about welfare of their wards. It has also ordered a study into the issue.“Among the children an increasing instance of suicidal tendency is being witnessed which will become an extremely serious social issue. Since March 25, when the national lockdown was imposed, 66 children, below 18 years of age, have ended their lives due to various reasons”, Vijayan said.A mother scolding her child for not attending the ongoing online classes, or a parent questioning a child for downloading a sleazy video on the smart phone or the constant rift between the parents were among the reasons which triggered the suicidal tendency, he said on Saturday.As the schools have not yet re-opened due to the lockdown, the children are unable to meet their friends and share their problems.Vijayan said though the parents were intervening keeping in mind their child’s welfare, it was essential to ensure that the young minds were not hurt in the process.To help the children facing issues relating to mental pressures, ‘Chiri’ a tele-counselling initiative has been started by the government under its Our Responsibility to Children Programme (ORC), a planned community intervention that connects with people between the age of 12-18 years.The state health department has also launched “Ottakalla Oppamundu” (You are not alone, we are with you) programme to help children facing any kind of mental distress and to prevent the suicidal tendencies among them.Health Minister K K Shailaja said under the psychosocial support assistance, her department has so far reached out to 68,814 children and 10,890 children have been given counselling.The changes in the behaviour of their children should be noted by the family members and if they find something amiss, the district psychosocial help desk should be informed, she said.A 15-member team of Students Police Cadets will be constituted in each of the 14 districts to help the children needing any assistance, police sources said.Education should not be a competition, but a means to gain knowledge, Vijayan said.A society’s future lies with the children and it is the duty of the society and the government to ensure their physical and mental well being.Taking a serious view of the situation, the state government has constituted a committee headed by Fire and Rescue Services DGP R Sreelekha to conduct a study on child suicides in the state.The aim of the ORC was also to create a multi collaborative platform for government and professional agencies, parents and teachers to equip youth with appropriate know-how to face challenges, officials said.

12-07-2020||Vibha Sharma||Nadda says colour of gold is red in Kerala, attacks Vijayan-led govt||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 12In an all-out attack against Pinarayi Vijayan-led government in Kerala, BJP president JP Nadda on Sunday questioned its alleged involvement in the high-profile gold smuggling case and accused it of “suppressing actual figures” and “messing up” the coronavirus crisis in the state.Addressing a virtual rally at the inauguration of BJP District Committee office, ‘Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee Mandiram’, at Kasargod Nadda took a jibe at the State government, saying that while colour of gold is yellow everywhere it is red in Kerala. “The colour of gold is yellow everywhere but in Kerala, it is red, red and red. What is the relationship between that IT officer and the personal secretary of the Chief Minister,” Nadda questioned.“We can see the heat in CM’s office also. He wrote to the Prime Minister saying no stone should remain unturned as far as the investigation is concerned. We have a saying ‘chor ki daadi mein tinka’, it means the office of CM is also involved somewhere,” he said.Colour red symbolises left-wing ideologies. Due for polls in 2021, Kerala is the only State with a Left government in the country.The NIA has registered an FIR in the case pertaining to the seizure of 30 kg of gold from a diplomatic cargo addressed to the Consul-General of UAE in Thiruvananthapuram.On Saturday, Swapna Suresh and Sandeep Nair, two of the four key accused, were detained by the NIA from Bengaluru. Vijayan’s personal secretary M Sivasankar is also under the scanner as he had hired Swapna Suresh in the state IT department.Swapna was on the run since July 5.  Meanwhile, Nadda said the Narendra Modi government is committed for the development of Kerala. “We all know how CPM-led LDF and Congress-led UDF have joined hands to fight the ideology of BJP in Kerala but our ‘karyakartas’ are determined to see that in times to come, there will be ‘kamalam’, ‘kamalam’ and only ‘kamalam’ (lotus, lotus and lotus) everywhere in Kerala.”He also accused Congress’  Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi of “demoralising” defence forces and misleading people of the country and the Vijayan government of “messing up” the Covid -19 crisis”They tried to suppress actual figures and lied about the quarantine facilities and people suffered due to that. The LDF government also compromised medical data of the people.”It is corrupt, inefficient, believes in violence and practices nepotism in appointments. Misappropriation of funds, atrocities against Dalits and women and political patronage are prevalent under the Pinarayi government,” he said.Nadda said, “CPM-sponsored violence has been prevalent for over two decades now and more than 270 BJP karyakartas have lost their lives due to such violence and hundreds have been injured.”He also accused the LDF government of trying to “destroy the faith of the Sabarimala temple and its devotees and forcing Guruvayur Temple Devasthanam to deposit funds into the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nadda-says-colour-of-gold-is-red-in-kerala-attacks-vijayan-led-govt-112012

12-07-2020||New Delhi||Rajasthan crisis: Scindia takes jibe at Congress; says ‘talent finds little credence’ in INC||Reacting to what appears to be a replay of the Madhya Pradesh political drama, BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia on Sunday expressed sadness/ regret over his “erstwhile colleague” in Congress, Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, being “sidelined and persecuted” by Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.“Sad to see my erstwhile colleague, @SachinPilot too, being sidelined and persecuted by Rajasthan CM, @ashokgehlot51. Shows that talent and capability find little credence in the @INCIndia,” said Scindia, leading to speculations whether Pilot was also headed his way into the BJP.Scindia left the Congress---a party he and before that, his father, had long been associated with---for the BJP in March this year because of increasing rifts with senior Congress leader  and then chief minister Kamal Nath.Scindia’s departure led to a collapse of the Madhya Pradesh government.  A power struggle between Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and his deputy Sachin Pilot, which has been on since the Congress' central leadership picked the senior leader for the chief minister's post, appears to have deepened with those in Pilot's camp claiming that there have been repeated attempts to undermine his authority.The latest flashpoint between the two is a notice issued to Pilot by the Rajasthan police's Special Operation Group in a case related to alleged attempts to bribe Congress MLAs to switch sides in the Rajya Sabha polls.Gehlot, however, has repeatedly pointed out that a similar notice has been sent to him, the government's chief whip as well as some ministers.Pilot, along with some Congress MLAs, is currently camping in the national capital and is seeking a meeting with top Congress leadership.The SOG on Friday registered an FIR against two people who have been arrested after their call intercepts allegedly indicated involvement in horse-trading of Congress MLAs.Gehlot had on Saturday accused the opposition BJP of trying to topple his government by offering his legislators large sums of money and said his administration is not just stable but will complete its five-year term.The BJP had asked Gehlot to prove his allegation of horse-trading levelled against it or quit politics, and claimed he was targeting the opposition party as he was unable to check the infighting in the state Congress.The opposition party alleged that the whole controversy has been "cooked up" by the chief minister to defame Pilot.Notably soon after reports of arrival of Deputy Chief Minister of Rajasthan Sachin Pilot in Delhi, the social media was buzzing with posts suggesting that he will join the BJP very soon like Scindia.The BJP, which has not said anything officially on the issue so far, is watching the situation closely. Sources say its leaders are in contact with Pilot. With some MLAs already lodged in Haryana, the Rajasthan political situation is becoming more predictable, say political observers.  ----With inputs from PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-crisis-scindia-takes-jibe-at-congress-says-talent-finds-little-credence-in-inc-112010

12-07-2020||New Delhi||In a first, railway parcel train transports dry chillies across border to Bangladesh||The Railways has operated its first-ever special parcel train to Bangladesh, transporting dry chillies from Andhra Pradesh’s Guntur district to the neighbouring country.Farmers and merchants in and around Guntur area earlier transported dry chillies by road to Bangladesh in small quantities. During the lockdown period when they could not move this essential commodity by road, Railway officials approached the consignors and explained the facilities to transport the produce by rail, the national carrier said.The dry chillies were then moved in bulk to Benapole in Bangladesh by rail through a Special Parcel Express on July 10.It also helped in reducing the cost of transportation. Sending the chillies to the neighbouring country by road cost around Rs 7,000 per tonne while the expense for carrying the same by goods trains has come out to be Rs 4,608 per tonne.“For the first time the Indian Railways loaded a special parcel train beyond the country’s borders to Benapole in Bangladesh with dry chillies from Reddipalem in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh state,” the Railways said in a statement.Guntur and its surrounding areas in Andhra Pradesh are well known for the cultivation of chillies. The quality of this farm produce is internationally renowned for its uniqueness in taste and brand.For moving the consignment by goods trains, it is mandatory for farmers and merchants to mobilise the quantity in bulk — at least more than 1,500 tonnes in each trip.“To mitigate this problem and to facilitate the rail users to move their quantities in small amounts, i.e. up to a maximum of 500 tonnes in each trip, Guntur Division of South Central Railway took the initiative and moved the Special Parcel Express to Bangladesh,” the statement said.            “This has helped the farmers and merchants of Guntur to market their farm produce beyond the country border by transporting the dry chillies in small quantities through Special Parcel Express,” it said.Accordingly, one Special Parcel Express train consisting of 16 parcel vans moved to Benapole in Bangladesh on July 10, the Railways said.   It said each parcel van was loaded with 466 bags of dry chillies, weighing around 19.9 tonnes and the total weight carried by the Special Parcel Express was around 384 tonnes.The cost per tonne for carrying by Special Parcel Express is Rs 4,608 and which is very cheap and economical as compared to road transport which amounts to Rs 7,000 per tonne, the statement said.Through the COVID-19 crisis, the Railways has taken a series of steps to boost parcel train traffic. Transportation of essential items like medical supplies, medical equipment, food, etc. in small parcel sizes are very important items needed for business as well as consumption purposes, it said.In order to fill in this vital need, the Railways has made railway parcel vans available for quick mass transportation by e-commerce entities and other customers including state governments.Railways has been running time-tabled Parcel Special trains on select routes to ensure uninterrupted supply of essential items, the national transporter said.The total of 4,434 parcel trains have run between March 22 and July 11, it said.

12-07-2020||New Delhi||India’s COVID-19 recovery rate improves to 62.9 per cent: Health ministry||Focussed and coordinated action by the Centre along with states and UTs, effective clinical management of coronavirus and timely diagnosis led to a consistent increase in the number of recovered cases in the country, the Union health ministry said on Sunday.The number of recovered cases exceeds active COVID-19 cases by 2,42,362 as on date, it said.“The recovery rate has improved to 62.93 per cent,” the ministry said.“As more people are recovering due to all-round efforts, the recovered cases exceed active cases by 2,42,362,” it said. There are 2,92,258 active coronavirus cases in the country.In the last 24 hours, a total of 19,235 people were cured of the coronavirus infection. This has resulted in the cumulative total number of recovered cases among COVID-19 patients rising to 5,34,620 on Sunday. India, meanwhile, added a record 28,637 cases of coronavirus infection on Sunday, pushing the country’s COVID-19 tally to 8,49,553. The death toll climbed to 22,674 with 551 people succumbing to the disease in a day, according to the ministry’s data updated at 8 am.The country at present has 1,370 dedicated COVID hospitals, 3,062 COVID health centres, and 10,334 COVID care centres.The Centre has so far provided 122.36 lakh PPE Kits, 223.33 lakh N95 masks and 21,685 ventilators to various states, Union territories (UTs) and central institutions, the ministry said.Enabling factors like removing all impediments to COVID-19 testing and facilitating widespread testing by states and UTs continue to result in a steady rise in the total number of samples tested every day, it said. “As a result of these efforts, the testing per million for India is presently 8,396.4,” the ministry said.According to ICMR, a cumulative total of 1,15,87,153 samples have been tested till July 11, with 2,80,151 samples tested on Saturday.A crucial supporting factor in the progressive rise in testing numbers is a continuous expansion of the countrywide diagnostic lab network, which as on date, comprises 850 labs in the government sector and 344 private labs (total of 1,194  labs), the ministry added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-covid-19-recovery-rate-improves-to-62-9-per-cent-health-ministry-111994
12-07-2020||New Delhi||Can’t demand signed copies of online RTI applications: CIC to Army||Demanding a signed copy of an online RTI application negates the whole purpose of such a mechanism, the Central Information Commission (CIC) has said while cautioning the Army to refrain from such a practice.Information Commissioner Divya Prakash Sinha held that seeking citizenship proof in case of demand of sensitive information is justified but seeking a signed copy of the application does not seem appropriate as the online portal does not mandate uploading of signatures.Sinha was hearing the plea of an Odisha-based RTI applicant who had sought from the Army information regarding the implementation of rules under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, in all defence establishments.The Army did not provide any information to the applicant, the CIC noted.Akhand approached the Commission with a complaint that the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) of the army has demanded a signed copy of his online RTI application as well as identity proof before providing him with the records.“In this regard, it may be noted that as far as the CPIO’s request for citizenship proof is concerned, the same is not questioned as Commission in its prior decision(s) has held the view that Armed Forces stand on a slightly different footing as there may be instances that involve the disclosure of sensitive information, and for such reasons, it may be rational for the CPIO to ask for citizenship proof,” Sinha noted.He, however, said the facts of the instant case “do not suggest disclosure of sensitive information”.A Punjab and Haryana High Court judgment may be referred in the matter of Fruit & Merchant Union vs Unknown, decided on November 2, 2012, which has validated the need for RTI applicants to provide identity proof, he said.However, asking for a signed copy of an online RTI application did not seem appropriate as the online portal did not mandate uploading of signatures, Sinha said.“...if the applicants do so voluntarily by uploading a signed copy of the RTI Application under the supporting documents head, it is acceptable but insisting on a signed copy of online RTI Applications cannot be a norm and delaying the provision of information for want of a signed copy of online RTI Application negates the whole purpose of filing an online RTI Application,” he said.Sinha directed the CPIO to exercise due caution while dealing with online RTI applications in future.

12-07-2020||Gurgaon||India at good position in Covid-19 battle: Amit Shah||India is in a “good position” in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic and the country will fight the disease with determination and enthusiasm, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Sunday.Shah spoke after participating in a mega plantation drive initiated by the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) to plant 1.37 crore saplings in their campuses by this month-end. He planted a peepal sapling at the CRPF officers’ training academy campus in Kadarpur village here.“The world is seeing that if a successful battle has been fought anywhere across the globe against the coronavirus it is in India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Shah said.“It was feared that how would a large country like ours would face this challenge given that we have a federal structure of governance, dense population of 130 crore people and no single chain of command,” he said.But the 130 crore people of the country, all states and every individual fought the battle against COVID-19 as one nation, the home minister said.Across the globe, Shah said, governments are fighting this disease but in India everyone has joined hands.“We are in a good position in this coronavirus battle and will continue this fight with determination and there is no atmosphere of fear. We have the passion to battle it and the enthusiasm to defeat it,” he said in his address to the chiefs of various CAPFs and troops who heard him via a web link.“As the home minister of the country, I can proudly say that the security forces of the country have a ‘big role’ to play in this battle fought by India,” he said. He praised these forces for rendering duties at airports, railway stations and public places apart from aiding the state police forces for law and order duties.Shah noted that COVID-19 is a very contagious disease that challenges the very existence of the human kind.  Saluting the ‘corona warriors’ of the CAPFs and other security and police forces, the home minister said they have set a new example of rendering their duty and fighting the pandemic at the same time.         He said over 31 CAPF personnel have laid down their lives while rendering COVID-19 duties out of which ten personnel are from the Central Reserve Police Force.“I assure you that your sacrifice will not go in vain. Your sacrifice will be written in golden words,” he said. Talking about the importance of trees in environment protection, he urged the personnel to adopt at least one plant and ensure that they protect it till it grows bigger than them.“Consider the plant like your child and treat it with the affection and care that you bring up your children,” he urged them.“We are facing challenges of global warming, rise in temperature and depletion of the ozone layer. Only trees can save us from environmental challenges and they can help to lessen the existing pollution and nothing else,” he said.He said the Home Ministry, under the ongoing mega plantation drive, has chosen a maximum of those plants which have a life span of over 100 years so that they can help preserve the nature for long.  Shah also said that he believes that his ministry should have a culture that all projects or initiatives launched by it should reach successful completion.     The Modi government, he said, is working to bring in more clean fuel and as part of that “we are enhancing the usage of ethanol over petrol”.“I am happy to say that between 2014 and 2020 the production and consumption of ethanol in the country has risen by 20 per cent and we further plan to increase it by another 10 per cent,” he said.       The minister also talked about PM Modi’s speech during the Paris World Environment Summit.“The PM cautioned the world against over-exploitation of nature and the world accepted the Modi formula in the Paris declaration on tackling climate change. As a result of the prime minister’s efforts, the International Solar Alliance was set up in India,” he said.During the event, CRPF chief A P Maheshwari informed the minister that all the CAPFs are undertaking the mega plantation drive and his force will plant over 22 lakh saplings.

12-07-2020||New Delhi||BJP chief Nadda set to have new team with fresh faces||Several new faces are likely to enter the BJP parliamentary board, the highest body of the party, as its president J P Nadda appears set to announce a fresh team of office-bearers soon.Nadda had taken over as party president in January and, sources said, the Covid-19 outbreak has delayed the announcement of the new team of office-bearers.A senior party leader said the fresh appointments, a customary practice under a new president, will be a mix of continuity and new faces.Deaths of senior BJP leaders Ananth Kumar, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley and election of another party veteran M Venkaiah Naidu as the country’s vice-president have caused vacancies in the parliamentary board, and they will be filled soon, sources said.Swaraj was the only woman member of the board, and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is seen by many as a probable replacement to her in the body.BJP leaders, however, have given no indication about the new faces likely to be inducted in the board and at other levels of the organisational machinery of the party.There has been a speculation about a reshuffle in the Union Council of Ministers and that some office-bearers may join the government and a few ministers may be moved to the party organisation.The exercise to give the organisation a more youthful look, which had started under Nadda’s predecessor Amit Shah, also appears to be over with a top leader asserting that almost all district presidents in the party are under 50 years of age.                 In most cases, BJP state presidents are much younger than what they used to be, he added.

12-07-2020||New Delhi||Indian students concerned about deportation, dropping out semester as US announces new visa rules||Fear of deportation in the middle of a global crisis, unpaid loans, rising risk of COVID-19 infection, dropping out a semester and the possibility of never being able to return to campus are among the concerns of Indian students in the US after announcement of the new visa regulations.In a move that is expected to adversely impact thousands of Indian students, the US immigration authority has announced that foreign students will have to leave the country or risk deportation if their universities switch to online-only classes in this fall semester due to the coronavirus pandemic.While Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Johns Hopkins University have filed a lawsuit seeking to revoke the order, some universities, including Princeton University, Stanford University, California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and Cornell University have announced their support for the lawsuit.India's Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla also raised the issue with US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale during an online meeting earlier this week stating there is a need to keep in mind the role of educational exchanges and people-to-people relations between the two countries as they played a key role in development of the overall ties. However, the students continue to be gripped with anxiety waiting for further updates."This will be a big blow to students who came to the US with long term plans. I stayed back in the country when the campuses shut in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. I did not want to travel as well as different time zones would have made it miserable to attend online classes. But suddenly my stay here is now legally invalid," Shobhna Mukherjee, a student at Duke University told PTI. "What happens to the semester, what happens to the education loan, what happens to the work I was doing here at the university to aid my tuition fees? And most importantly if I am deported, will I ever be able to get back? There are no answers to these questions," she added.A student at University of Illionis in Chicago, who refused to be identified said, "Nobody saw this coming. I was shocked to hear this, something which was not imagined in the wildest of our dreams. When one moves to a country it is never a short plan, it has been thought through before. With this, the plan I had in mind for the next five years will also go for a toss. It is a situation where I don't know what to fear about more -- disease or deportation." "I arrived in Boston in January only. Right now my university is deciding to conduct classes in hybrid mode, which may be changed to completely online if the coronavirus cases rise further. What happens then? Will my stay here turn illegal?," Kosha Thakur, an Indian student in Boston, said.Vatsala Thapar, who is pursuing a degree in Computer Science at University of South California, came back to India in March when the university suspended on-campus classes."Threatening to deport students while they are already living in the middle of a global crisis shows their hostility towards non-citizens. Many of those students do not have the means to travel back to their home countries and some stayed back only to secure their visa status. How does their staying in the US while studying at an American university and contributing to their economy affect anyone else?" Thapar said in a social media post.Pallav Upadhyay, an Indian student in Atlanta said, "For universities operating in a hybrid system and holding some classes in person, international students who are enrolled in those are allowed back into the US. " "However, if the status of those classes changes at any point, which is likely if cases rise on campus, we would be sent back. Alternately, if we choose to pursue classes online and the university switches to in-person teaching, we are expected to travel back to the US to preserve our student visas," he said.According to a recent report of the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), there were 1,94,556 Indian students enrolled in various academic institutions of the US in January this year. Of these 1,26,132 were males and 68,405 were females.Universities in the US were forced to shift classes online in mid-March in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The country is the hardest hit by the pandemic with more than 3.3 million confirmed cases and 137,403 deaths.

The relatives transported the body in auto-rickshaw and performed the last rites, thereby exposing several people to COVID-19. A list is now being prepared of all those who may have come in contact with the body or the relatives who moved the body.The DME has instructed the Nizamabad Hospital Superintendent to file criminal cases against the staff that handed over the body. Strict instruction has been issued not to allow families to take possession of the body. Some private hospitals are reportedly asking for huge amounts of money to dispose of the bodies.Dr Reddy said: “All hospital superintendents in Telangana are instructed to strictly follow the guidelines and such incidents should not be repeated in the public interest.”On the other hand, in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, former chief minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N Chandrababu Naidu has criticised the hospitals and municipal bodies in Andhra Pradesh for putting the bodies of COVID-19 victims in mass graves, and in one instance, using a JBC machine.Andhra Pradesh has reported three cases where the dead have been put into a mass pit or a river or given an indecent burial, making this into a political issue.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-dead-body-carried-to-graveyard-in-auto-rickshaw-in-telangana-pictures-go-viral-111975

Bhoosreddy is heading the team, which will have Additional DG Hari Ram Sharma and DIG Ravinder Goud as its members, according to an official statement.The SIT will submit its report by July 31 after looking into all the angles, studying all related documents and spot inspection in Kanpur, it said.The team has been asked to probe into what effective action was taken in all the cases lodged against Dubey, the statement said.The SIT will also probe what action was taken to cancel the bail of “such a dreaded criminal”, what action has been taken against him under the Goonda Act, the National Security Act, Gangsters Act, and if there was any laxity and at what level, it added. On July 3, eight police personnel, including a DSP, were gunned down in Bikru village by the henchmen of Dubey.Seven others, including a civilian, were injured in the attack from a rooftop after the police team entered the village past Thursday (July 2) midnight to arrest Dubey. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sit-probing-polices-connivance-with-vikas-dubey-to-visit-bikru-village-111974
12-07-2020||Mumbai||Varavara Rao’s family says his health declining||The health of poet and activist  Varavara Rao, an accused in the Elgar Parishad case, is deteriorating and he is “hallucinating and is in a delirious state”, his family claimed on Sunday and urged the authorities concerned to provide him better medical aid.The 81-year-old activist is currently lodged at the Taloja jail in Maharashtra’s Navi Mumbai township.Addressing an online press conference, Rao’s wife, daughters and other family members said they wereworried about his “deteriorating health”.They claimed his health condition has been deteriorating ever since he was shifted to the state-run J J Hospital in Mumbai in an unconscious state on May 28, 2020.Three days later, he was discharged and sent back to the jail even as there was no improvement in his health condition, they said.“We were very much disturbed as during his routine calls (to family members) allowed by police, his voice was weak, he was incoherent, mumbling and unable to speak,” Rao’s wife said.On Saturday, Rao did not answer straight questions on his health and went into a kind of “delirious and hallucinating state”, she claimed, adding that he talked about the funeral of his father and mother, the events that happened decades ago.She said Rao’s co-accused informed them that the activist was unable to walk on his own.“We were also told he is always hallucinating that the family members were waiting at the jail gate to receive him as he was getting released,” she said.“The confusion, loss of memory and incoherence are a result of the electrolyte imbalance in the body and fall in sodium and potassium levels, leading to a possible brain damage,” she claimed.The family also said the Taloja jail is “not equipped to handle his medical condition”.“Thus, it is highly required that Rao be shifted to a better hospitalto save his life,” his wife said.The family said at the present juncture, they were keeping aside all the pertinent facts of the case registered against Rao.“His life is the topmost concern for us right now. Our present demand is to save his life. We demand the government to shift him to a better hospital or allow us to provide the required medical care,” Rao’s wife said.“We want to remind the government that it has no right to deny the right to life to any person, much less an undertrial prisoner,” she added.Rao has been in jail for over 22 months.His bail pleas, including thosefiled for relief on the ground of his age, ill-health and risk of COVID-19, have been rejected on multiple occasions.Rao and 10 other activists were arrested in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist link case, which was transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) by the Centre in January this year.The case pertains to alleged inflammatory speeches made at the Elgar Parishad conclave in Maharashtra’s Pune on December 31, 2017, which the Pune police claimed triggered violence the next day near the Koregaon-Bhima war memorial in the district. PTI Here's the full text of the press release'We, the family members of Varavara Rao, world-renowned Telugu revolutionary poet and public intellectual, who is incarcerated in Navi Mumbai’s Taloja Jail, are very much worried about his deteriorating health. His health condition has been scary for over six weeks now, ever since he was shifted in an unconscious state to JJ Hospital from Taloja Jail on May 28, 2020. Even as he was discharged from the hospital and sent back to jail three days later, there has been no improvement in his health and he is still in need of emergency heathcare.The immediate cause of concern now is that we are very much perturbed at the routine phone call we received from him on Saturday evening. Though the earlier two calls on June 24 and July 2 were also worrying with his weak and muffled voice, incoherent speech and abruptly jumping into Hindi. As an eloquent and articulate public speaker and writer in Telugu for over five decades, a Telugu teacher for four decades and known for his meticulous memory, this fumbling, incoherence and loss of memory were in themselves strange and frightening. But the latest call, on July 11 is much more worrisome as he did not answer straight questions on his health and went into a kind of delirious and hallucinated talk about the funeral of his father and mother, the events that happened seven decades and four decades ago respectively. Then his co-accused companion took the phone from him and informed us that he is not able to walk, go to toilet and brush his teeth on his own. We were also told that he is always hallucinating that we, family members, were waiting at the jail gate to receive him as he was getting released. His co-prisoner also said he needs immediate medical care for not only physical but also neurological issues. The confusion, loss of memory and incoherence are the results of electrolyte imbalance and fall of Sodium and Potassium levels leading to brain damage. This electrolyte imbalance may be fatal also. Taloja Jail Hospital is not at all equipped to handle this kind of serious ailment either in medical expertise or equipment. Thus it is highly required that he be shifted to a fully equipped super specialty hospital to save his life and prevent possible brain damage and risk to life due to electrolyte imbalance. At the present juncture we are leaving aside all the pertinent facts like, that the case against him is fabricated; he had to spend 22 months in jail as an undertrial with the process turned into punishment; his bail petitions got rejected at least five times now and even the bail petitions with his age, ill-health and Covid vulnerability as grounds were ignored. His life is the top most concern for us right now. Our present demand is to save his life. We demand the government to shift him to a better hospital or allow us to provide required medical care.  We want to remind the government that it has no right to deny the right to life of any person, much less an undertrial prisoner.'||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/varavara-raos-family-says-his-health-declining-111972

This means the recovery rate is around 63 per cent. More than 22,000 people have died due to the virus in the country.India resumed domestic passengers flights from May 25 after a gap of two months due to the coronavirus pandemic. Scheduled international passenger flights continue to remain suspended in the country.

12-07-2020||Jaipur/New Delhi||Rajasthan crisis: Sachin Pilot claims support of 30 MLAs, says Ashok Gehlot govt in minority||Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot on Sunday declared open rebellion, claiming that he has the support of over 30 Congress MLAs and some independents.The statement released on Pilot’s WhatsApp group claimed that the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government is in minority now.“Rajasthan Deputy CM and Congress leader Sachin Pilot not to attend Congress Legislative Party meeting scheduled to be held tomorrow,” the message added.The statement appeared just as ministers and Congress MLAs were gathering at Gehlot’s official residence in the state capital for a meeting to express support to the chief minister, amid the power tussle between the two leaders.Soon after the announcement Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the party remained intact, and its government will complete the five-year term in the state.Pilot had been incommunicado. Earlier in the day, All India Congress Committee general secretary Avinash Pande said he had been trying to get in touch with the leader for the past two days.Also read: Worried for Congress: Kapil Sibal posts cryptic tweet amid Rajasthan crisis“I have left messages for him,” Pande, who is in charge of Rajasthan at the AICC, told PTI.Pilot’s supporters said he is camping in Delhi and is upset over a notice sent to him by the Rajasthan police, who claimed to have stumbled on a plot to topple the Congress government.The notice from the Special Operations Group had (SOG) sought time from him to record a statement.The same notice was also sent to Gehlot, Government Chief Whip Mahesh Joshi and some other MLAs, but those close to Pilot insisted that it was meant to “humiliate” him.Sunday’s meeting at the CM’s official residence in the state capital was scheduled to take place at 9 pm. Minutes later, Pilot’s statement landed.Independent MLAs supporting the Gehlot government had also been invited, in what was planned to be a show of strength for Gehlot.Gehlot had alleged Saturday that the opposition BJP was trying to lure Congress MLAs to topple the state government.The BJP dismissed the claim, saying the recent developments only reflected a power struggle between Gehlot and Pilot, simmering since the Congress leadership in Delhi picked the more senior politician for the CM’s post.Hours before the scheduled meeting at the CM’s residence, Revenue Minister Harish Choudhary, Labour Minister Tikaram Jully, Health Minister Raghu Sharma and several other MLAs met Gehlot.“We have faith in the leadership of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and we have expressed this to him,” Independent MLA Babulal Nagar told reporters.Sports Minister Ashok Chandna urged party MLAs to take a lesson from the recent developments in Madhya Pradesh, where Jyotiraditiya Scindia switched sides.“Any person who crosses the party line will not be respected anywhere in the world. This is not the time to lose the respect earned over generations,” Chandna said, without naming anyone.In a tweet Sunday, Gehlot stressed that the police notices had gone to several people, including him. He did not name Pilot, but said a section of the media had interpreted the notices wrongly.“The notices have been issued to the chief minister, the deputy chief minister, the government chief whip and some other MLAs. It is a part of the process,” SOG Additional Director General Ashok Rathore told PTI on Sunday.He said as the investigation proceeds, others could also be issued notices.Independent MLA Nagar said he is among the legislators issued with the notice.“The SOG has issued notice to me and has sought time. There are other MLAs who have received such notices,” Nagar said.Apart from the SOG inquiry, the state’s Anti-Corruption Bureau has also begun a probe into the alleged bid to bring down the government.The Congress government has distanced itself from the three independent MLAs—Khushveer Singh, Omprakash Hudla and Suresh Tak—who were named in ACB’s preliminary enquiry (PE).Earlier, the government had the support of all 13 independent MLAs, who also voted for the Congress candidates in the Rajya Sabha elections last month.At a press conference Saturday, Gehlot had cited the FIR lodged by the SOG to accuse the BJP of trying to bring down his government and cited the FIR registered by the SOG.The FIR is based on an alleged tapped phone conversation between two men, said to be BJP members, who were later arrested.The Congress has 107 members and the BJP 72 in the 200-MLA state assembly. Going by Pilot’s claim, the Congress has fallen below the half-way mark. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-crisis-sachin-pilot-claims-support-of-30-mlas-says-ashok-gehlot-govt-in-minority-111966

12-07-2020||New Delhi||Rajasthan CM Gehlot calls MLAs’ meet to prove ‘all is well’ with his govt||Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot has called a meeting of Congress lawmakers this evening to prove all is well with his government in the state.Gehlot just finished a meeting with state police’ special operation group which is probing allegations of poaching of Congress MLAs by BJP.The group had sent notices for statements to Gehlot, his deputy Sachin Pilot, state Assembly chief whip among others.Gehlot also earlier tweeted that the police had summoned all senior leaders for giving statements in the matter and that the summons were not targeted at any particular leader. Gehlot said sections of the media were misinterpreting the summons.Also read: Pilot incommunicado, Cong trying for truce to save Rajasthan govtBJP trying to topple Rajasthan Govt, will complete full term: GehlotGehlot has called a meeting of MLAs amid growing concerns over the future of the Congress government in Rajasthan and a tweet by senior party leader Kapil Sibal who today said he was worried for the Congress.Worried for our party Will we wake up only after the horses have bolted from our stables ?  “Worried for our party.  Will we wake up only after the horses have bolted from our stables?“ a normally cautious Sibal tweeted a while ago as the political activity in Rajasthan Congress camp reaches frenzied proportions.The author of the mystery script is Rajasthan deputy CM Sachin Pilot who remained engaged in a constant battle for political one-upmanship with Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot.Pilot has been in Delhi with some of his supporters it is learnt and has not been picking up anyone’s phone.Taking a jibe at Gehlot, who used to be a magician, Sachin Pilot’s wife Sarah posted a tweet. बड़े बड़े जादूगरों के पसीने छूट जाते हैं जब हम दिल्ली का रुख करते हैं..।।#Sachin_pilot pic.twitter.com/NC4GewbFTr  Some party leaders today said the goings-on bear similarity to the events preceding Jyotiraditya Scindia’s exit from Congress.Scindia had also gone incommunicado for days before he left the Congress for BJP.Although the Pilot camp denies any extreme measures Sibal’s tweet raised doubts about where things are headed.Gehlot yesterday accused the BJP of trying to poach Congress MLAs to destabilise the party government in the state.The BJP counter accused Gehlot of internal Congress wrangles being responsible for the current state of Congress in Rajasthan.All eyes are now on the next moves of Pilot, who remains curiously silent amid reports that he might speak with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi today.Congress has 107 legislators in Rajasthan as against BJP’s 72. The majority mark is 101.Pilot has also been asked by Rajasthan police to give a statement in the poaching issue, a matter he has not taken lightly.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-cm-gehlot-calls-mlas-meet-to-prove-all-is-well-with-his-govt-111962

Their father had found the door locked when he came home and then informed the police.One of them was a former school teacher and another an ex-employee of a private company.The siblings had quit their jobs after their mother’s death.According to police, a suicide note found on the bodies said the siblings were “unable to bear the loss of their mother”. The two brothers, including one who was disabled, and their sister allegedly took their own lives when their father—a retired engineer  of the agriculture department—was not at home.The father, Aditya Prakash Awasthi, 60, told police his wife had died of illness in September last year. Since then, his three children Preeti, 25, Gagan, 35 and Pawan, 30, were disturbed.While Pawan had been employed in a private company in Lucknow, Preeti was working as a school teacher.“They quit their jobs after my wife passed away. I apparently could not fill the void left by her death as all my children were very close to her,” said Awasthi.SHO Kotwali police station Ajay Mishra said that neighbours told police that the siblings had stopped socializing after their mother passed away and kept to themselves. “It appears to be a case of suicide and a suicide note was also found.

12-07-2020||Mumbai||China is a ‘bigger threat to India’ than Pakistan: Sharad Pawar||Amid the border tension with China, NCP president Sharad Pawar has saidChina is a “bigger threat to India” than Pakistan.China’s military might is “ten times greater” than India, the former defence minister said, adding that Beijing has “weaned away” India’s neighbours to its side.The Centre should try to put international pressure on China through negotiations and diplomatic channels, Pawar said in an interview to Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.The second of the three-part interview series was published in the Marathi daily on Sunday.“When we think of an enemy, the first name that comes to our mind is that of Pakistan. But we need not worry about Pakistan. In the long term,it is China that has the power, vision and programme to act against Indian interests. China is a bigger threat to India,” Pawar said.The “real threat to India is from China” which has become economically strong, he added.“By creating a picture of camaraderie, you can’t resolve issues between two countries,” he said, referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s handshakes and hugs with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the latter’s India visit.Asked about the clash between Chinese and Indian soldiers at Galwan Valley in Ladakh last month, Pawar said, “When I say there should be no politics over the issue, it is because we can attack them. But the entire country will have to pay a heavy price when there is retaliation to the attack.”“Instead of striking, we should try to put international pressure on China through negotiations and diplomatic channels,” he said.Pawar said China had turned not just Pakistan, but even countries like Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka against India.“When Modi becameprime minister for the first time, he went to Nepal to offer prayers at the Pashupatinath temple.Modi praised Nepal, calling it India’s friend and the first Hindu nation. Now Nepal is not with us, but on Chinas side,” the former Union minister said.India took the lead to liberate Bangladesh, and now the neighbouring country has signed a treaty with China, he said.“China has weaned away all our neighbours to its side.This is the contribution of the recent period, Pawar said in an apparent reference to the Modi Government.He said Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi are always blamed for their handling of China and Pakistan.“But, during the tenure of Nehru, India and China shared warm relations,” he said.Nehru was of the view that China will become a superpower some day and that India should maintain a cordial relation with it since tensions were not beneficial to either of the two countries, he said.Nehru introduced the Panchsheel treaty with China and there was peace in the region, the NCP chief said.“Unfortunately, the Chinese leadership took a different stand and there was a conflict. This aspect cannot be ignored, he said.Speaking on the present state of the Indian economy, Pawar said Prime Minister Modi should consult economists and experts like Manmohan Singh to revive the economy.“When Manmohan Singh was the Union finance minister, he gave a new direction to the Indian economy. I was also part of that Union Cabinet. I credit Singh and late P V Narasimha Rao for the turnaround of the economy from crisis,” he said.“Modi should also take the help of experts. The country will support him in all the steps taken by him, he said, adding that the “country needs another Manmohan Singh”.To a question on Modi calling him a “political guru” (political teacher), Pawar said there is no such thing as guru in politics.Targeting the Centre, he said there is no dialogue between the Modi government and leaders of other parties.When Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee, P Chidambaram were finance ministers, they would constantly in touch with experts and political leaders cutting across party lines to ascertain their views on various issues facing the country.“This is not happening now,” he said.Speaking about the performance of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government, Pawar, who played a key role in the formation of the ruling alliance comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, saidit would not be right to judge the government on its performance in six months.“The written exam is over. Practicals are pending. The student is working hard. So there is no need to worry about the result. In the six-month exam, the student has passed. I am confident the student will clearthe next exam easily,” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-is-a-bigger-threat-to-india-than-pakistan-sharad-pawar-111955

12-07-2020||New Delhi||Gangster Dubey’s encounter may ‘widen’ UP caste divide||Key state Uttar Pradesh will vote for a new Assembly in about a year and a half from now. The term of the BJP’s Yogi Adityanath government is expiring in March 2022.Yogi for ‘ending’ the nexusSources say UP CM Yogi Adityanath wants to end the nexus between politicians and criminals and is prepared for the criticism because he knows that’s what people want“Dons like Dubey have been patronised by all parties. In the past 15 years, law and order has became a major issue with politicisation of police force,” they sayIt is in such a dynamic situation that dreaded criminal Vikas Dubey was today killed by the police in an “encounter”, a week after he and his men killed several policemen in a Kanpur village.It also coincides with the ‘Brahmin Chetna Samvad’ initiated by Congress leader Jitin Prasada to regain support of “upper caste Hindus” feeling “neglected and sidelined” by ‘Thakur’ CM Adityanath.Regional players SP and BSP have also pulled out all stops, raising questions about the “encounter” that ended the free run of the hardcore criminal in the state under various regimes, including theirs.Political observers are sensing that the current situation may be used to “widen the existing gap” between castes in UP, a state driven by caste and community equations, while Dubey’s protectors, in police and political parties, go scot-free. UP-based political observer Sudheer Panwar explains: “Congress’ ‘Brahmin’ face, Prasada, has started a movement to wean off the caste from the BJP on the pretext of ‘Thakur’ dominance. He has criticised the encounter.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gangster-dubeys-encounter-may-widen-up-caste-divide-111683

The probe has revealed that certain CAs played a key role in managing the affairs of these entities.The agency said Rs 3.57 crore seized during the search operations had also created suspicion about the operations of such entities and their blatant violation of the statutory requirements.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/enforcement-directorate-seizes-rs3-57-cr-in-raids-on-travel-firms-111684

Considering both are dependable allies, it won’t be easy to find the middle groundRussia and the US, however, are ranged against each other with two competing proposals before two separate bodies. Interestingly, UN member states approved both the Russia-approved OEWG (Open Ended Working Group) and US-backed Governmental Group on Experts. The issue at stake is when will a cyber-attack lead to war against the alleged perpetrator? There have been several incidents of a grave provocative nature such as the targeting of an Indian nuclear plant, Stuxnet and Russian cyber-activity during the last US presidential polls. While all nations share the expectations of responsible online behaviour, they differ on who should define the conditions under which a state can take aggressive action against the perpetrator of an on-line attack.At this juncture, while the US wants to retain the right to respond as it wishes to cyber-attacks, this is not an opinion shared by the other big powers Russia and China which want the UN to be in the centre of the picture. With the situation in a flux, it remains to be seen how India can influence opinion towards UN-mandated criteria for responding to a cyber-attack.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-russia-cyber-rivalry-puts-india-in-quandary-111687

Of all the big cats, 2,461 (around 83 per cent) have been photo-captured.What workedBetter corridors between isolated pockets of tiger territory, reduced poaching, building up prey nosTerming it a great moment for the country, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi for India fulfilling its resolve to double the tiger numbers four years before the 2022 target set at St Petersburg in 2010.Tracking the feline“It is a shining example of ‘atmanirbhar’ (self-reliant) Bharat attained through ‘sankalp se siddhi’ (attainment through resolve),” Javadekar said.The citation at the Guinness World Records website reads: “The survey, conducted in 2018-19, was the most comprehensive to date in terms of both resource and data amassed. Camera traps (outdoor photographic devices fitted with motion sensors that start recording when an animal passes by) were placed in 26,838 locations across 141 different sites and surveyed an effective area of 121,337 sq km (46,848 square miles).”“In total, the camera traps captured 34,858,623 photographs of wildlife (76,651 of which were tigers and 51,777 were leopards; the remainder were other native fauna). From these photographs, 2,461 individual tigers (excluding cubs) were identified using stripe-pattern-recognition software,” it reads.The 2018 ‘Status of Tigers in India’ assessment also conducted extensive foot surveys covering 522,996 km of trails and sampled 317,958 habitat plots for vegetation and prey dung.Apart from setting a new world standard, the results validated India’s efforts in tiger conservation. The country’s tiger population increased by roughly one-third, from 2,226 in 2014 to 2,927 in 2018 following efforts that included better corridors between isolated pockets of tiger territory, reduced poaching and building up prey numbers through habitat restoration.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-largest-tiger-census-sets-guinness-record-111630
12-07-2020||New Delhi||Covid may lead to higher NPAs, capital erosion, warns RBI Governor||The Reserve Bank of India on Saturday warned of certain stress points in the financial system, such as the redemption pressure on non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and mutual funds.Economic outlook Uncertainn Protracted lockdown, which began on March 25, has resulted in severe disruption of industrial productionGDP growth forecast to contract sharply in April-June, pushing growth for 2020-21 into deep recessionThe Covid crises may result in higher non-performing assets and capital erosion of banks though the Indian economy has started showing signs of getting back to normalcy, RBI chief Shaktikanta Das said at a stock-taking of the Indian economy at the SBI Banking and Economics Conclave.He said in order to protect the interest of mutual fund investors, the RBI had asked private NBFCs to appoint independent chief risk officers, while government-owned NBFCs were now under the RBI surveillance framework. Besides, the central bank was closely monitoring some large NBFCs and those with certain weaknesses.Das said a recapitalisation plan for public sector banks (PSBs) and private banks (PVBs) had, therefore, become necessary which might have to be larger than normal because the minimum capital requirements of banks might no longer be considered sufficient enough to absorb the losses.Of the two PVBs that had gone down, the Yes Bank case was resolved quickly but the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank issue was pending even after 10 months because its losses had eroded deposits by over 50 per cent, the RBI chief said, emphasising that banks must be proactive in building buffers and raising capital.The RBI chief took heart from the smooth functioning of the financial system but drew attention to three uncertainties — it was uncertain when supply chains would be fully restored, how long would it take for demand conditions to normalise and what durable effects the pandemic would leave behind on potential growth.“The need of the hour is to restore confidence, preserve financial stability, revive growth and recover stronger, even as the country follows a careful trajectory to unwind the counter-cyclical regulatory measures,” he said. He pointed out that the LAC tensions would naturally spur a move to replace Chinese products in the global supply chains. “But to be successful, quality and price have to be the determining factors.”The central bank, he said, strived to maintain the balance between preserving financial stability, maintaining banking system soundness and sustaining economic activity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-may-lead-to-higher-npas-capital-erosion-warns-rbi-governor-111593

Their indiscriminate use or use in conditions for which they are not desirable may cause more harm than good,” the ICMR said.Available evidence for Remdesivir suggests it may decrease the time needed for clinical improvement in moderate to severe cases, but does not reduce mortality.The ICMR caution came as India saw another record daily increase of 27,114 cases that took Covid-19 count to 8,20,916 with 22,123 deaths. There were 519 mortalities in 24 hours.With rising cases, the focus has shifted to patient management. The ICMR said the focus of clinical management should continue to remain on oxygen therapy (including high flow nasal oxygen), steroids (widely available and inexpensive) and timely administration of anti-coagulants and high quality supportive care.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1-lakh-cases-in-4-days-caution-on-remdesivir-111594

12-07-2020||New Delhi||13 gaps in mountains along LAC hold key||Even as India and China talk of de-escalation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the Indian Army has its eyes trained at defending the 13 identified possible routes of military ingress into Ladakh from the Chinese side.It’s work in progress: JaishankarExternal Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said the disengagement and de-escalation process was “very much a work in progress”. This came a day after the two sides during diplomatic talks resolved to push for “complete disengagement” of troops. PTIThese routes are natural gaps in the mountains along the 826-km LAC in Ladakh. Starting from east of the Karakoram pass, the northern-most point, and ending at Demchok, the southern-most edge of Ladakh, these gaps permit major land-based war-waging equipment and troops to pass through. Some eight of these 13 routes are open even during the winter as these areas get little snowfall, a senior functionary said.Large parts of Ladakh are a flat plateau at more than 12,000 feet, but the mountainous parts are rugged, treeless and inhospitable. The possible ingress routes (gaps in the mountains) are all across, but in a bigger concentration in the Depsang plains — the route that was used during the 1962 war. Another set of gaps is in Hot Springs area. The route running south from Dungti to Demchok has another set of gaps. In the eastern part of Ladakh abutting Tibet, India has a deterrent at all these 13 routes. However, the forthcoming winter in Ladakh, that starts in September, will be a test. The mistrust between the two armies means both could hold on to major deployments at these gaps.The aggression being shown by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) China has turned the focus on these routes. On the Indian side, the defensive positions, built in the past 10 years or so, mean the gaps have been ‘militarily tailored’ to hold back the PLA.On the Chinese side, its highway G-219 can be used for a quick build-up.The Tibetan Plateau on the Chinese side is flat and gets lesser snow than the Himalayas or the Karakoram ranges. Indian estimates are that G-219 can be used by the PLA even in peak winter as snowfall in the area is never more than 2 feet and can be cleared with machines within hours.On the Indian side, the two access routes to Ladakh via Manali and Srinagar see heavy snowfall throughout the winter starting September-end or early October and remain closed for months.Also, crossing over from Leh to DBO, Depsang, Galwan, Pangong Tso, Hot Springs and Tangtse is possible either via Khardung La (18,300 feet) or Chang La (17,590 feet). Both receive snowfall.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/13-gaps-in-mountains-along-lac-hold-key-111597
