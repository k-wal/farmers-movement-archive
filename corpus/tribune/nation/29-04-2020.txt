29-04-2020||New Delhi||Dismayed at White House unfollowing of PM, President: Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has sought an explanation from the Foreign Office after the official Twitter handle of the US President unfollowed President Ramnath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“I'm dismayed by the unfollowing of our President and PM by the White House. I urge the Ministry of External Affairs to take note,” he said in a tweet.The White House Twitter handle had started following handles of PM Modi, Prime Minister’s Office, President of India, the Indian Embassy in the US and the US Embassy in India. It reduced the number of accounts it was following from 19 to 13 on Wednesday. In neither case did it provide an explanation.All its recently-followed Indian handles were among those unfollowed but accounts of the Indian Embassy in the US and the US Embassy in India were among the select group of 13 it retained.The following and the unfollowing has taken place during a bumpy time in Indo-US ties which began with Trump warning India of retaliation if it did not lift the ban on hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) which he said could be a “game changer” in the battle against Covid. After Delhi decided to supply HCQ to over 100 countries including the US, Trump thanked India and said the “gesture would not be forgotten.’’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dismayed-at-white-house-unfollowing-of-pm-president-rahul-gandhi-78118

For terminal semester students, exams would also be held in July, the UGC clarified.Extension of six months will be granted to Mphil and PhD students, and viva-voice could be conducted through video conference.“The timing of examination may be considered appropriately by universities. In case the situation does not appear normalise, to maintain social distancing for safety of students, grading of students could be composite of 50 per cent marks on the basis of the pattern of internal evaluation adopted by universities while the remaining 50 per cent marks can be awarded on the basis of performance in previous semester only,” the UGC said.The Commission guidance added that where previous semester or previous year marks were not available, 100 per cent evaluation might be done on the basis of internal assessments.“If the student wishes to improve grades, they may appear in special exams for such subjects during the next semester,” the Commission said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-academic-session-in-varsities-from-sep-final-semester-exams-in-july-says-ugc-78117
29-04-2020||Washington||US places India on ‘Priority Watch List’ for Intellectual Property protection||The US on Wednesday placed India on the ‘Priority Watch List’ for lack of sufficient measurable improvements to its Intellectual Property framework on the “long-standing” and “new challenges” that have negatively affected American right holders over the past year.The US placed 10 countries, including some of its major trading partners like India and China, on the list, alleging that enforcement of the intellectual properties have deteriorated or remained at inadequate levels and the Americans who rely on their protection have difficulty with fair and equitable market access.The countries placed on the list by the Trump administration on Intellectual Property (IP) related issues are Algeria, Argentina, Chile, China, India, Indonesia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and Venezuela.Kuwait has been removed from the last year’s list that included 11 countries. And in 2019, the US had removed Canada and Thailand from the list.“The Trump administration is committed to holding intellectual property rights violators accountable and to ensuring that American innovators and creators have a full and fair opportunity to use and profit from their work,” said US Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer after the release of annual Special 301 Report on the adequacy and effectiveness of trading partners’ protection of IP rights.Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Guatemala, Kuwait, Lebanon, Mexico, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, Romania, Thailand, Trinidad & Tobago, Turkey, Turkmenistan, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Vietnam have been placed on the Watch List.In its report, the USTR said that India had been placed on the ‘Priority Watch List’ for lack of sufficient measurable improvements to its IP framework on the “long-standing” and “new challenges” that have negatively affected US right holders over the past year.Long-standing IP challenges facing US businesses in India include those which make it difficult for innovators to receive, maintain, and enforce patents in India, particularly for pharmaceuticals; ineffectual enforcement activities, copyright policies that fail to incentivise the creation and commercialisation of content, and an outdated and insufficient trade secrets legal framework, it said.India also further restricted the transparency of information provided on state-issued pharmaceutical manufacturing licenses, continues to apply restrictive patentability criteria to reject pharmaceutical patents, it said.And, it still has not established an effective system for protecting against the unfair commercial use, as well as the unauthorised disclosure, of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval for pharmaceuticals and certain agricultural chemical products, the USTR claimed.It said China’s continued placement on the Priority Watch List reflected US’ concerns with Beijing’s system of pressuring and coercing technology transfer.And the continued need for fundamental structural changes to strengthen IP protection and enforcement, including as to trade secret theft, obstacles to protecting trademarks, online piracy and counterfeiting, the high-volume manufacturing and export of counterfeit goods, and impediments to pharmaceutical innovation, it said.In its report, the USTR said that over the past year, India has been inconsistent in its progress on IP protection and enforcement.While India’s enforcement of IP in the online sphere has gradually improved, a lack of concrete benefits for innovators and creators persists, which continues to undermine their efforts, the report said.India remains one of the world’s most challenging major economies with respect to protection and enforcement of IP, it said.Patent issues continue to be of particular concern in India as longstanding issues remain for innovative industries, it said.The potential threat of compulsory licenses and patent revocations, and the narrow patentability criteria under the India Patents Act, burden companies across different sectors, the USTR said.“Moreover, patent applicants continue to confront costly and time-consuming pre and post-grant oppositions, long waiting periods to receive patent approval, and excessive reporting requirements,” it added.The USTR said that in the pharmaceutical sector, Section 3(d) of the India Patents Act remained problematic. One implication of its restriction on patent-eligible subject matter is the failure to incentivise innovation that would lead to the development of improvements with benefits for Indian patients.India still lacks an effective system for notifying interested parties of marketing approvals for follow-on pharmaceuticals, which would allow for the early resolution of potential patent disputes, it said.Despite India’s justifications of limiting IP protections as a way to promote access to technologies, India maintains extremely high customs duties directed to IP-intensive products such as medical devices, pharmaceuticals, information and communications technology products, solar energy equipment, and capital goods, it said.Noting that the levels of trademark counterfeiting continue to remain problematic, the USTR said the US brand owners continue to report excessive delays in obtaining trademarks and a lack of quality in examination.“The United States intends to continue to engage with India on IP matters, including through the US-India Trade Policy Forum’s Intellectual Property Working Group,” the report said.

29-04-2020||London||Nirav Modi set for remote extradition trial from May 11 in UK court||The five-day extradition trial of fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi will begin from May 11 in a part-remote setting, a UK court has ordered, amidst the restrictions and social distancing measures put in place to contain the coronavirus spread.Nirav Modi is fighting his extradition to India over the nearly USD 2 billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud and money laundering case.The 49-year-old, who has been lodged at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest last year, appeared before the court via video conferencing due to the social distancing procedures put in place across the UK courts in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.He spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth during the hearing, which took place at the Westminster Magistrates' Court in London.District Judge Samuel Goozee, who presided over the case management hearing, expressed some reservations about the extradition hearing going ahead next month as scheduled under the current lockdown.But it was agreed between all the parties that a trial run of the court's CVP (Common Viewing Platform) will take place during a lawyers-only hearing on May 7 ahead of the final hearing."Some prisons are producing prisoners in person, so I will direct Wandsworth Prison to produce Mr Modi in person for the trial from May 11. If that is not practicable, his participation by live link remains a backstop," Judge Goozee concluded.It was agreed that a limited number of legal representatives will be present physically in court for the trial as witnesses give their evidence via video link. Modi will be able to observe the proceedings either from the dock, if the prison authorities agree to a physical transfer, or via the judiciary's common viewing system from Wandsworth Prison.The five-day hearing from May 11 relates to the Indian government's extradition request certified by the UK government last year.The case, filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED), relates to a large-scale fraud upon an Indian Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) through the fraudulent obtaining of letters of understanding (LoUs) and the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.Two additional charges of "causing the disappearance of evidence" and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death” were added on by the CBI and certified earlier this year.“The May 11 extradition hearing is going ahead and the new request (two additional offences part of the CBI case) has not been joined but will be dealt with at a separate later hearing, probably in July,” said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), appearing on behalf of the Indian authorities.CPS barrister Nick Hearn indicated that the Government of India's representatives would be following the proceedings and giving instructions via the court's online common viewing platform, given the coronavirus related travel restrictions.“We have received comprehensive responses in writing from the government of India, which would reduce the likely length of cross-examinations,” said Hearn.It was also confirmed that the diamond merchant would not be giving evidence in the case, but his legal team plans to produce around six witnesses, including a jewellery expert as well as judicial and prisons experts.“We are very anxious to hold the hearing if we can, if Mr Modi's participation and that of the witnesses seems feasible,” said Modi's barrister Clare Montgomery, during the tele-conference hearing on Tuesday.Judge Goozee has set May 4 as the deadline for the skeleton arguments, draft charges and any further evidence to be presented in the case.In reference to the "wealth of documentary evidence relied on in the case", he has sought an agreed pre-trial reading list by the end of this week.Most of the legal cases in the UK have incorporated video link and telephonic options where possible, with all new jury trials suspended amid the social distancing rules in place to combat the coronavirus pandemic.Modi, whose Wandsworth prison is considered one of the most over-crowded in England, made a fifth attempt at bail in the High Court last month, which was rejected as the judge ruled that he continued to pose a flight risk.He was arrested on March 19, 2019, on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard on charges of fraud and money laundering brought in by the Indian government.The coronavirus cases in the UK have crossed 158,000 while more than 21,092 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins University tracker.

29-04-2020||New Delhi||Explain why technical loan write-off route applied to fugitives: Chidambaram to govt||Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram, on Wednesday, asked the BJP government to explain why it had taken the technical loan write-off route for fugitives like Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Vijay Mallya.His remarks came after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said wilful defaulters were beneficiaries of ‘phone banking’ under the UPA regime and the Modi government was chasing them to recover the dues.She was responding to the opposition party’s allegations of loan waiver worth Rs 68,607 crore in the form of write-offs to the top 50 wilful defaulters till September 2019.Chidambaram said one could not deny the rule that banks could write-off loans technically and recoveries could continue against wilful defaulters, but why was the rule applied to fugitives, who fled the country, after committing frauds.“One is not denying that such a rule can be applied to a wilful defaulter. But, we are asking this because these are fugitives and they have left the country and are absconding. Why are you applying this rule to Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Vijay Mallya,” he said at a press conference conducted through video conferencing.The former finance minister said: “When they are fugitives, the technical rule in the book should not be applied to them. That is my view. This rule can be applied to other categories of defaulters, but why is it being applied to fugitives.”“Why does she take shelter behind the technical rule,” he said hitting out at Sitharaman.“One can technically write off loans of defaulters, willful defaulters, and willful defaulters, who stay back and try to face an enquiry, but why do they have to apply that rule to a willful defaulter who has fled India and the government has declared him a fugitive,” he said.“Why does this rule apply to Nirav Modi, Vijaya Mallya and Mehul Choksi? They have been declared fugitives. That’s why we questioned the bonafides of this government,” he said.Asked whether these loans were recoverable, the Congress leader said he did not know whether they were recoverable or not as it would depend on whether these fugitives have assets in India or abroad. “Those are the questions which the government must answer,” he said.Attacking the finance minister, Chidambaram said: “Why was she silent for the last 37 days and has now suddenly sprung to life and sprung to the defence of these fugitives. Is it not a little surprising and ironic.”Earlier, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala accused Sitharaman of “misleading and mis-stating facts”.“To mislead or mistate facts while holding the august office of FM is most unfair @nsitharaman ji! You tweeted that Rs 2,780.50 cr have been recovered from Modi-Choksi-Mallya. On 16th March, 2020; Parliament was told that ED has recovered only Rs 96.93 cr in 5 yrs under PMLA-FEMA,” he tweeted.He attacked the government over the issue of bad loans, accusing it of weakening the entire banking architecture fiscally and imprudently in the name of cleaning the system.“Mr @PrakashJavdekar & @nsitharaman ji, Listen to Sh @PChidambaram_IN , take tuition & answer- Why did Modi govt waive loans of defaulters & fugitives like Mehul Choksi+Nirav Modi (Rs 8,048Cr), Jatin Mehta (Rs 6,038 cr), Mallya (Rs 1,943 cr) & others? Why defend the fugitives,” Surjewala tweeted.The party was responding to Sitharaman’s tweet on Tuesday night in which she accused the Congress and its leaders of “misleading” people on loan write-offs.“Nirmala Sitharaman ji, cleaning the banks of people’s money by writing off loans of absconders and fraudsters is not called ‘cleaning the system’. It's called weakening the entire bank architecture fiscally and imprudently, if not maliciously,” Surjewala said in a tweet.In a tweet, the Finance Minister had accused Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Surjewala of attempting to mislead people in a brazen manner. “Typical to Congress, they resort to sensationalising facts by taking them out of context,” she said.Hitting back, Surjewala demanded answers from Sitharaman instead of “twisting facts”.“Simple answer that FM, Smt @nsitharaman needs to give instead of twisting facts-:Why has Modi govt written off bank loans worth 6,66,000 cr between 2014-15 & 2019-20? Is RBI’s RTI reply dated 24th April, 2020, of bank loans write off of Rs 68,607 crore wrong or right,” he asked.“Why is Modi govt writing off bank loans of absconders & fraudsters like Nirav Modi+Mehul Choksi (Rs 8,048 CR), Jatin Mehta (Rs 6,038 cr), Mallya (Rs 1,943 cr) & others as per RBI’s RTI reply of 24/4/2020? Who permitted such huge write offs of bank loans of defaulters and why,” Surjewala asked the finance minister.The RBI released a list of 50 top bank loan defaulters in the country in an RTI reply.Sitharaman also said: “Congress and Rahul Gandhi should introspect why they fail to play a constructive role in cleaning up the system. Neither while in power, nor while in the opposition has the Congress shown any commitment or inclination to stop corruption and cronyism.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/explain-why-technical-loan-write-off-route-applied-to-fugitives-chidambaram-to-govt-78108

It’s a question of national security. Recently, a militant was killed and 500 people showed up for his funeral,” Attorney General KK Venugopal had told a Bench headed by Justice NV Ramana.Asserting that right to access the internet was not a fundamental right, the UT administration said it can be curtailed in the interest of the “sovereignty”, “security” and “integrity” of India.It said the alleged deprivation of access to education, health care facilities was incorrect as the administration was taking all possible steps to ensure minimum impact of COVID-19 was felt.The rationale behind limiting internet speed are well-founded keeping in mind the ground situation, it said adding there had been instances of lifting of restrictions on internet speed being misused by militants.Regarding online education getting impacted, it said majority of students in J&K were studying in government schools who did not have mobile/smart phones or computers to access the internet”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/j-k-administration-opposes-restoration-of-4g-services-says-right-to-access-to-internet-not-fundamental-right-78104
29-04-2020||---||Govt to invest Rs 111 lakh crore in infrastructure by 2025||New Delhi, April 29The final report of the Task Force on National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) has projected investment of Rs 111 lakh crore till 2025 in order to provide world-class infrastructure across the country, and thereby improve the quality of life for all citizens.Compiled in three volumes, the final report presented on Wednesday to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman increased the expected investment by about 10 per cent as compared to the earlier projections.The report noted that projects worth Rs 44 lakh crore or 40 per cent of those identified by the task force are already under implementation. Another 30 per cent—worth Rs 33 lakh crore—are at conceptual stage and projects worth Rs 22 lakh crore (20 per cent) are under development. Strangely, the official press release said there was no information regarding project stage for 10 per cent of the works worth Rs 11 lakh crore.Over 70 per cent of the projected investment is in four sectors ­ -- energy, roads, urban infrastructure and railways.As for investment, the report envisages states spending slightly more than the Centre with the private sector expected to contribute 21 per centSitharaman in her Budget speech 2019-20 had announced that Rs 100 lakh crore would be invested on infrastructure over the next five years. This was after Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke of Rs 100 lakh crore having been earmarked for infrastructure development in his Independence Day speech last year.The government claims that NIP is a “first-of-its-kind, whole-of-government exercise which aims to improve project preparation, attract investments into infrastructure, and will be crucial for target of becoming a $ 5 trillion economy by 2025.The report has also suggested ways and means of financing the NIP through deepening Corporate Bond markets, including those of Municipal Bonds, setting up Development Financial Institutions for the infrastructure sector and accelerating the monetisation of infrastructure assets.The task force has suggested the setting up of several more committees -  one to monitor progress, one at each Infrastructure ministry level and the last one in the Finance Ministry to raise financial resources for NIP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-to-invest-rs-111-lakh-crore-in-infrastructure-by-2025-78102

29-04-2020||---||CSIO develops electrostatic disinfection technology to combat COVID||Chandigarh, April 29The Central Scientific Instruments Organisation (CSIO) here has developed an innovative technology based on electrostatics for effective sanitisation to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and has transferred it to a Nagpur-based company for commercial manufacture and marketing.Called Electrostatic Disinfection Machine, it produces a fine uniform spray of disinfectants in the range of 10-20 micrometers to kill microorganisms and viruses. The machine uses very less disinfection material as compared to conventional methods, which is helpful in saving natural resources with negligible increase of chemical waste in the environment.“Charged droplets emitted from the disinfection machine can cover the directly exposed and obscured surfaces uniformly with increased efficiency and efficacy. The disinfectant reaches to any hidden areas of the target, where there is a maximum possibility to find the viruses. Therefore, it kills or inhibits the growth of pathogens very effectively,” said Dr Manoj K Patel, senior scientist and innovator of the technology.“We have come up with this innovative concept of electrostatic spraying for disinfection and sanitisation of public places, especially hospitals, poultry, trains and buses, airports and airplanes, offices, classrooms and hotels. It contributes to healthy lifestyle and healthcare of masses and is directly linked to Swachh Bharat Mission of Government of India,” said CSIO Director Dr Sanjay Kumar.The technology transfer agreement was signed by Abhijeet Gaan, Director, Rite Water Solutions Private Limited, Nagpur, and Dr Surender Singh Saini, Head, Business Initiatives and Project Planning at CSIO. The meeting was held through video conferencing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/csio-develops-electrostatic-disinfection-technology-to-combat-covid-78098

The medical services are being offered by respective state governments.“Since April 13, we have brought on board 10 states where patients can get access to doctors in their respective states. The platform is being rolled out in nine other states where training of medical staff is underway,” said Dr PK Khosla, Director, C-DAC.C-DAC is a research and development organisation of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology in the domain of IT, electronics and associated areas. Earlier, Indian telemedicine rules allowed only doctor-to-doctor exchanges and doctor-patient was prohibited. It was only on March 25 that the rules were changed by NITI Aayog, allowing telemedicine consultancy for patients.“Following this, we were tasked by the Central government to develop the required platform and we had taken up work on the eSanjeevaniOPD on a war footing, mobilising all available human resources and putting in extra hours,” said Dr Khosla.C-DAC, in the past, had also developed software enabling doctor-to-doctor consultancy. So far Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Puducherry, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh are online. Over the next few days, it will cover Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Rajasthan and West Bengal. Other states are expected to follow subsequently.After logging in and being granted access to the required OPD or doctor, a patient can have an online face-to-face interaction with the doctor and upload records, reports and other information. An e-prescription is generated which can be used to purchase medicines.The platform also generates national and state level statistics on a daily basis which can be analysed by the authorities concerned or policy planners.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-lockdown-new-national-telemedicine-platform-brings-doctors-at-patients-doorstep-78093
29-04-2020||New Delhi||India readies mega plan to bring back its nationals stranded abroad||The government is working on a mega plan to deploy a raft of naval ships as well as military and commercial aircraft to evacuate thousands of Indians stranded in the Gulf and other regions after the lockdown ends, official sources said on Wednesday.The government has already reached out to several states asking them to make necessary arrangements after the citizens are brought back home under the multi-agency operation.The Civil Aviation Ministry has conveyed to the core group planning the operation that it was ready to make available majority of nearly 650 commercial planes, including freighters, for the mission, the sources said.They said the Navy and the Indian Air Force had also been told to keep some of their platforms on stand-by for the evacuation, which is likely to be the biggest after ‘Operation Raahat’ when India brought back over 6,700 people, including citizens from 41 countries, from strife-torn Yemen in 2015.The Navy has identified the INS Jalashwa, an amphibious ship, and two other landing ship tanks for the operation.The INS Jalashwa, capable of carrying out amphibious operations as well as search and rescue missions, can transport over 1,000 people. Indian naval ships Mumbai, Tarkash and Sumitra were part of ‘Operation Raahat’. The sources said the Indian Air Force was also keeping a number of its transport aircraft ready for the operation.The operation will begin after the lockdown is lifted. The current phase of the lockdown ends on May 3. It is not immediately clear whether the government will further extend it.The sources said priority would be to evacuate Indians from the Gulf nations, following which the government would try to bring back those stranded in Europe and other parts of the globe.It is not immediately clear how many Indians the government plans to bring back home. As a matter of policy, India decided not to bring back the stranded Indians from abroad till the nationwide lockdown ends.Around eight million Indians are living in the Gulf countries and there has been growing anxiety among them over their livelihood in view of the pandemic as it has majorly impacted the oil-driven economy of the region. It is also learnt that Indian missions in the region have been told to identify people who want to return home.Almost all Gulf countries have taken a series of drastic measures, including imposing total lockdown, travel restrictions and even closing borders, to stem the spread of the Covid-19 infection.In a video-conference with chief ministers on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said evacuation of Indians had to be done keeping in mind the fact that they didn’t feel inconvenienced and their families were not under any risk.Over the last few weeks, Prime Minister Modi has been holding consultations with leaders of several Gulf nations, including Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with whom he spoke on March 17 to discuss the Covid-19 situation.Modi has also spoken to Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Qatar Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad al Thani, Kuwaiti Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Sabah and Bahraini King Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifa.During the discussions, one of the primary issues raised by Prime Minister Modi was the well-being of the Indian diaspora in these nations, officials said.The Prime Minister personally requested the leaders to ensure the wellbeing of the Indian community there, and each of these leaders gave strong assurances that the Indian diaspora would be taken care of in these tough times, they said.

29-04-2020||Hyderabad||Telangana becoming new rice bowl of India: KCR||Punjab and Haryana, which are known to be the rice bowl of the nation, are getting tough competition from the southern state of Telangana that has produced a record paddy, touching 225 lakh tonnes as the acreage increased by 123 per cent.“Telangana is the new rice bowl of the country after an additional 15 lakh acres were bought under paddy cultivation under Mission Kakatiya and another 20 lakh acres under pending projects,” Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) said on Tuesday.The bumper crop had become possible due to improved irrigation facilities. The next step is to ensure a reasonable support price in view of the increase in yield and acreage, he said.The chief minister has issued an order to construct godowns with an additional capacity of 40 lakh tonnes.Punjab had targeted 170 lakh tonnes of paddy during the last crop, while Haryana marginally lower.India’s top rice and wheat producers Punjab and Haryana contribute almost 15 per cent of India’s entire rice production.Both the states are trying to persuade the farmers to move away from paddy to other crops like maize.KCR said the increased yields resulted from better irrigation and soon about 1300 TMC of water in Godavari and Krishna would be used tofurther boost irrigation.The state is providing 24-hour-free power supply to the farm sector. Under projects related to wells and bore wells, there is a possibility of having two crops in 1.45 crore acres and three crops in 10 lakh acres.Telangana’s paddy yield will be doubled in the years to come making it the rice bowl of India, KCR said.The state government, he said would buy each and every morsel produced by farmers as the farmers are in distress due to the prevailing COVID-19 situation.Arrangements are being made to keep the fertilizers available for farmers, he said.Saying that godowns with a capacity of 22.5 lakh tonnes are available in the state, he favoured construction of godowns with an additional capacity of 40 lakh tonnes.He suggested that the Rythu Bandhu Samitis (farmers’ coordination panels) plays an active role in helping the farmers. He further said the government is taking stern action against sale of spurious seeds, fertilisers and pesticides.According to official sources, the estimated production of paddy during the current season is around one core MTS.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-becoming-new-rice-bowl-of-india-kcr-78088
29-04-2020||New Delhi||Rahul should take tuition from Chidambaram, govt has not waived any loan of bank defaulters: BJP||Taking a swipe at Rahul Gandhi, the BJP, on Wednesday, said the Congress leader should take “tuition” from his party colleague and former finance minister P Chidambaram to understand the difference between ‘write-off’ and ‘waive’, and asserted that the Modi government had not waived any loan of bank defaulters.“Rahul Gandhi should take tuition from P Chidambaram on the difference between ‘write-off’ and ‘waive’. The Narendra Modi government has not waived-off any loan. ‘Write-off’ is a normal accounting process. It doesn’t stop recovery or action against defaults,” senior BJP leader and Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said.He said Gandhi had been trying for over two years to spread this confusion that the government had waived loans of businessmen who wilfully defaulted on bank loans.Citing a list of top wilful bank loan defaulters given by the RBI in response to a RTI query, Rahul Gandhi, on Tuesday, had taken on the government, saying he was not given the answer when he had asked the same question in the Parliament.Taking a dig at the government, he said the list included fugitive economic offenders such as Mehul Choksi and Nirav Modi, and many of BJP’s “friends”.Hitting back, Javadekar said the Congress leader should try to expand his understanding of issues. The government, he asserted, has gone all out to bring the accused to justice and not waived even a single penny of loan.Nirav Modi is in jail in London and Vijay Mallya has been left with no option but to return to India after rejection of his bail plea in the UK, the BJP leader said. Authorities had seized Nirav Modi’s assets and auctioned them, he said, highlighting the action against him.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said wilful defaulters were beneficiaries of ‘phone banking’ under the Congress-less UPA regime and the Modi government was chasing them to recover the dues.

The order says all seeking to return should be screened first and allowed to return only if they are found to be asymptomatic.During the chief ministers interaction with Prime Minister Narednra Modi on Monday, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had raised the issue claiming that the state government would not facilitate return of students from Kota, Rajasthan, till the Centre allowed movement of all, including stranded migrant labourers.In the order, the MHA has asked all state governments and Union Territory (UT) administrations to make necessary arrangements for return of its residents only through buses. Sources in the MHA added that there was no plan to start special trains for the initiative and only travel by road had been allowed.The lockdown has left a huge number of students and migrant labourers stranded in various parts of the country. Over the past few days, there have been individual efforts by some states to bring standed residents home.According to reports, the Jammu & Kashmir administration in the past four days has made arrangements to bring back over 6,000 labourers and students of the Union Territory, who were stranded in various parts of the country. With this, the total count of those brought back to the UT reached to over 17,700 people, it is said.Punjab, on Monday, had written to the Delhi government to grant permission to bring back 220 people stranded in the national capital’s gurdwara Majnu Ka Tilla.It was also reported that the Centre had helped in arranging over 65 buses to ferry more than 3,800 stranded fishermen from Gujarat to Andhra Pradesh.

29-04-2020||Vibha Sharma||Lockdown has not affected backbone of Indian economy, says Agriculture Minister||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 29Presenting a very positive outlook for the sector, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, today, said despite the lockdown in the country, the sowing of summer crops had increased to 57.07 lakh hectare, which is more than 38 per cent over the area sown last year.“Even in such trying circumstances and conditions, sowing has not decreased. In other related activities, the sector is making good progress due to the good practices adopted by the government and hard work by farmers,” Tomar said while speaking on issues related to harvesting and sowing in the country amid the Covid-19 lockdown.The Minister said despite the lockdown and adverse conditions, harvesting had also not been affected. “In GDP, the contribution of agriculture remains 3.7 per cent, and I am sure it will not be affected much in the coming days as well,” he addedEchoing the sentiments, Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand said agriculture might, in fact, come to the rescue of the economy in these gloomy times. “Even at a time when 60 per cent of India’s economy is closed, in the case of agriculture, things are happening. Our estimate is that the sector will see a growth rate of 3 per cent despite all prevailing adverse circumstances. The share of agriculture sector in the economy is 17 per cent. I am sure that during these distressing times, agriculture will rise and give support to the economy,” he added.Notably, the contribution of agriculture to the GVA decreased from 18.2 per cent in 2014-15 to 16.5 per cent in 2019-20.  The decline was mainly due to a decrease in share of GVA of crops from 11.2 per cent in 2014-15 to 10 per cent in 2017-18, according to the economic survey. The share has been declining on account of relatively higher growth performance of non-agricultural sectors.However, according to Chand, prices of major commodities and vegetables were higher in mandis this year than last year. “When prices are favourable and terms of trade are better, farmers invest more. As much as 60 per cent of India’s economy is closed, but in the case of agriculture, things are moving. It will register a 0.5 per cent growth rate and the fear that the Indian economy will shrink will be negated,” said Chand.According to the Niti Ayog member, the positive outlook is based on two factors, a good monsoon and water availability of 40 to 60 percent higher levels in reservoirs over last year and average of last 10 years. “There will be plenty of water available for sowing,” he saidAccording to Tomar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains committed to doubling the income of farmers by 2022. “The agriculture sector has remained unaffected due to the Covid-19 lockdown, but there have been other problems. As soon as the situation improves, we will start working towards the goal,” he saidTomar said his confidence was based on the fact that despite the lockdown, off take of fertilisers had increased by five per cent. The sale of fertilisers in April is expected to be eight per cent higher than last year, he said.Regarding the damage to the crops due to recent weather conditions, the minister said there were provisions available between the states and the Centre to tackle the issue.Recounting the measures taken by the government to aid the sector, like the PM Kisan and increasing coverage of the KCC, he said the Modi government increased the MSP of various crops by 50 to 109.“These measures are helping farmers, agriculture sector, economy and the GDP of the country. Despite the lockdown, the harvesting is in place and what is remaining will be over in the next one week. Everywhere there is good news in the sector. Procurement is in place and people are not facing any problem anywhere,” Tomar said, recounting the steps taken to ensure smooth functioning including transportation trucks.“Agriculture has an important place in the Indian economy and the government is also supporting it well. This is one reason why we produce more than we consume.  If our agriculture gets affected, the economy will also be affected. Our systems are in place even in these difficult times. Agriculture has always been the priority of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Today, what we are seeing is a result of that. There is enough grain, vegetables and milk in the country. The prices have also not increased. The government has always ensured that there is money for agriculture related activities,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-has-not-affected-backbone-of-indian-economy-says-agriculture-minister-78083

29-04-2020|| ||Woman can’t enforce her right to reside in matrimonial home against builder: SC||New Delhi, April 29 A woman can’t enforce her right to reside in matrimonial home against the builder who has redeveloped her husband’s property under a statutory scheme, the Supreme Court has ruled. A Bench headed by Justice Deepak Gupta said the builder’s obligation was only to the extent of accommodating the original owners in the redeveloped portion and a woman married into the owners’ family can’t enforce her right to matrimonial home against such builder, if not allowed into the allocated portion due to strained relations. The verdict came on an appeal filed by a woman—having a strained relationship with her husband and in-laws—asserting her right to reside in the house allotted to her husband under the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act, 1976. The house she used to reside in with her husband and in-laws was demolished and redeveloped by a builder under the Act. During the redevelopment period, the occupants were required to shift to a transit accommodation. While acknowledging the fact that she was dis-housed as an occupier, the Bench noted that her claim to accommodation was based on her status as wife which was not enforceable against the developer. Such claim has to be adjudicated upon by a civil court or a family court or any other appropriate forum available under the law, it said. This right was embedded in her right as a wife and was implicit under Section 18 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, it said. Noting that the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 also recognised the concept of “shared household”, the Bench said alienating an immovable asset to defeat the right of a woman victim under the said Act can constitute domestic violence. Under Section 19 of the DV Act, a Magistrate was empowered to pass an order to protect her from being removed from the shared household, it added. Maintaining that such remedies were available under other legal proceedings and not in a petition against the builder, it gave her liberty to launch appropriate legal proceedings to claim her right to reside in her matrimonial home.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/woman-cant-enforce-her-right-to-reside-in-matrimonial-home-against-builder-sc-78080
29-04-2020||New Delhi||It is as if we are in battle zone: Doctors entering coronavirus ICU||"It is like we were going to a battlefield. I feel like someone from the armed forces. I want to do something for my country," said 27-year-old Senior Resident Dr Ajay Mohan from Department of Surgery, who is currently posted in D6 COVID-19 ICU ward of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi.He told IANS what it is like being posted in the highest contagious disease COVID-19 ICU ward.Doctors are at the forefront of the war against the novel coronavirus. When people across the world are scared to come near a corona patient due to its high level of infectivity, these duty-bound warriors enter the ICU, knowing well hostile environment. Their objective: Do everything to make the patients fit and fine.Speaking to IANS, Dr Mohan said: "In February when I came to know that my name is listed in the institute circular of doctors posted for COVID-19 duty, it filled me wih pride and excitement—I was to be a frontline warrior."He said he and his colleagues were in a unique situation."Very few researches were available then, and we did not know much about our safety during our work while treating this particular disease," said At least six COVID-19 patients and suspects are admitted in the ICU during his 6-hour daily shift.The hours increase the stress levels as many patients come in a critical condition.Talking about his state of mind while donning the complete PPE kit, Dr Mohan said: "It takes around 20 minutes to wear the complete PPE kit. We had workshops on PPE kits in our college." "We have to wear the kit for the entire 6-hour duty. We have to wear it before entering the ICU. Once we are inside the ICU, we are contaminated, so we can not exit before our duty ends. During those 6 hours, we can't eat or drink or even use the washroom. It feels very hot after wearing the PPE and once after doffing, our whole body is full of sweat. Also, it hurts a lot. The shield which we wear, loses visibility due to sweat and moisture in three to four hours, but we have to keep it on".He said doffing the PPE is even more time-consuming as there are high chances of contracting infection from the aerosols while taking off the PPE kit. "Doffing takes more than 30 minutes" he said.Dr Mohan said back in his hometown in Kerala, initially he did not disclose to his parents that he was posted in the COVID-19 ICU."I never shared with my parents that I'm posted in COVID-19 ICU for the initial one week as I knew they would get tense." His brother was posted in a hospital in Wuhan city of China and had seen the devastating conditions there due to COVID-19."My brother is also a doctor who volunteered to work in a Wuhan hospital during the pandemic in December and January. He was brought back by the Indian government in February after his duty was over. He had experienced a lot. Even he was scared to know that I was posted for COVID-19 duty," said Dr Mohan."I get calls thrice a day from my anxious mother," he said."Major depressing factor about this situation is that I can't meet my friends inside my campus during these days as I am expected to maintain strict quarantine measures post duty too. But I follow it as last thing I would want is to spread infection to my loved ones," said the doctor.Talking about health workers getting infected from the coronavirus, Doctor Mohan said: "It is very scary, but most of us are ready to go ahead with our duty as our country needs us".Echoeing similar sentiments, another doctor, Dr. Sayan Nath who is also currently posted in COVID-19 ICU ward at AIIMS trauma centre, told IANS that this is not the first time that doctors are facing a highly infectious virus."There have been many incidents when doctors have contracted diseases like Tubour Celosis from the patients...it's just that we have never spoken about these issues before. This is a professional hazard," said Dr Nath, also a Senior Resident from Department of Anaesthesiology and critical care in AIIMS Delhi.He said doctors were initially very scared of going to the COVID-19 wards, "but this is part and parcel of our profession, so we have to do it anyway"."The knowledge about the coronavirus is so dynamic that there is a lot of information and misinformations about the disease. The area where I am working is a very high-risk area because there is maximum amount of viral load. But most of us are doing our jobs with lots of dedication." Doctor Nath said that earlier he was not much worried about the possibility of virus contraction, but ever since he read reports of even young people getting the infection, he is now worried about his safety."Initially there were reports that young people are in the low-risk category as far as COVID-19 is concerned. But then I read that even young people died from the disease. I was scared," he said.The doctor said he feels nervous while donning the PPE kit. "But the moment I enter the ICU, my entire focus shifts to work and serving the patients. I become so absorbed in the work that I forget all my nervousness and other anxieties," said Dr Nath.About COVID-19 fatality in his ward, he said: "Every death feels like a failure for me, but in the medical profession, doctors have to adapt to these situations because if they don't do so, they will not be able to do justice to the next patient they are treating." — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/it-is-as-if-we-are-in-battle-zone-doctors-entering-coronavirus-icu-78079

Those with high load of Covid-19 cases or having a high growth rate of the disease are marked as hotspots or red zones, while those with considerably fewer Covid-19 cases fall in the orange zone or non-hotspots. Districts with no Covid-19 cases are categorised as green zones.However, a red zone or an orange zone district can be demarcated as green zone if no new Covid-19 case is reported from those places for at least 28 days and 14 days, respectively.On April 15, the Centre had declared 170 districts across 25 states and Union Territories as Covid-19 hotspots. Of these, as many as 123 were hotspot districts with large outbreaks and 47 with clusters.

They are applicable for all institutions alike..."The Bench held there was no violation of rights of unaided/aided minority educational bodies to administer their institutions under Articles 19(1)(g) and 30 read with Articles 25, 26 and 29(1) of the Constitution.Several minority educational bodies, including Christian Medical College Vellore Association, had challenged the validity of National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), contending it violated their right to administer their institutions.The petitioners had argued that the State had no power to compel an unaided minority institution to admit students through a single centralised national examination, i.e. NEET.    Further, they had asserted that they had the fundamental right to choose the method and manner of admitting their students, subject to satisfying the triple test of having a fair, transparent, and non-exploitative process.Earlier, the top court had in 2013 quashed NEET. But in 2016 it allowed review petitions against the 2013 verdict and chose not to put a stay on NEET. Wednesday's verdict made it clear that NEET was applicable to all institutions, including minority-run institutions.The top court rejected minority institutions' contentions, saying the provisions of the MCI/DCI Act and the regulations cannot be said to be ultra vires or taking away the rights guaranteed under Article 30(1) read with Articles 19(1)(g), 14, 25, 26 and 29(1), it said."The regulatory measures are intended for the proper functioning of institutions and to ensure that the standard of education is maintained and does not fall low under the guise of an exclusive right of management to the extent of maladministration," it said.While appreciating good medical professionals produced by various institutions, the top court said, "But, when it comes to the eradication of the malpractices that have crept into the system, we have to take into consideration larger interest of the education countrywide."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/neet-applicable-to-minority-educational-institutions-also-rules-sc-78064

She said there is no report about scarcity of essential medicines, but factories are told to be operating at less than 50 per cent of their capacity.“The distributors may not be able to make supplies of all medicines if the production remains affected at the source level for a long time,” it said. In its first report submitted to the chief secretary, the panel said there is a general shortage of labour for loading and unloading of goods.“The products of some of the prominent Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) are not available at some of the stores, but the goods of alternative brand/homemade brand are generally available,” it said.The nationwide lockdown imposed on March 25 to arrest the spread of coronavirus has been extended till May 3.

A high score is considered a passport for students seeking admission in over 600 B-Schools across India. Conducted quarterly (Feb, May, Sep and Dec) in about 60 cities, about one lakh candidates appear annually for MAT which was so far being conducted in both ‘Paper-Based’ and ‘Computer-Based’ modes.A statement by AIMA said the reliability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based tools had been tested and proven in several high-stake examinations internationally.But AIMA is also prepared to take action against candidates found to be contravening pre-specified behavioural norms during MAT. They would be given a warning and thereafter even disqualified for a repeat contravention. In order to familiarise candidates with the format as well as try out the robustness of the software, AIMA will first schedule a series of mock tests at a nominal extra fee.AIMA plans to extend this technology to descriptive tests it conducts for students enrolled in its distance education management programs such as the PGDM, PGDITM, etc.AIMA is also opening up this technology to help corporates with their recruitments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-aima-to-conduct-mat-by-remote-proctoring-78049

These are the two operative provisions,” Isaac said.The Minister, however, made it clear that 25 per cent of the salary would not be deferred and the state government would go ahead with the earlier six-day cut itself.“The state government has taken the decision on the ordinance as per the Kerala High Court order. We could have gone for an appeal.But, the court said that the government order on deducting salary does not have a legal backing. So, we have decided to make it legal,” he said.He also pointed out that while other states have cut more than 30 per cent salary of it employees salary, Kerala’s ordinance allows to deduct six days’ pay.Earlier, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had said that the deducted amount will be given back to the employees when the financial condition of the state improved.

29-04-2020||---||Former FM Chidambaram asks PM to announce pay cheque protection plan||New Delhi, April 29Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram today asked the Prime Minister to immediately announce a pay cheque protection plan to guard the salaries of people who may face layoffs and retrenchment due to the ongoing lockdown.In a statement today, the Congress veteran repeated his party’s demands for a Rs1-crore wage protection plan and a Rs1-crore credit guarantee plan for micro medium and small enterprises.“Tomorrow is the last working day of the month. More than 12 crore people of India are waiting with bated breath. They want to know if they will be paid their salaries or wages for April,” Chidambaram said.For the non-MSME sector, the Congress leader urged the government to announce a “Paycheque Protection Programme”, similar to the one announced in the United States.“This is not a legislation but a financial assistance package,” he said.IT department data shows there are roughly one crore people with a salary income of less than Rs3,50,000 a year or Rs30,000 a month.“Assuming an average salary of Rs 15,000 a month for these 1 crore people, the total cost comes to Rs 15,000 crore for the month of April. This is not a large sum to protect the livelihoods of 1 crore people who have filed tax returns and paid taxes in the past, and can be easily found. The government must announce a Paycheque Protection Program right away to protect the salaries of these 1 crore employees,” Chidambaram said.He also suggested a waiver of employers’ contributions to the employees provident fund (EPF) and employees state insurance (ESI) on a temporary basis for three months.“This will assist in reducing the payroll costs of employers and retaining the workforce,” he said.“Most would not have worked a single day in the month of April because the entire country was in a lockdown. How will these people feed themselves and their families without an income?” asked Chidambaram, demanding immediate announcement of a package to protect the small industry.Chidambaram also said the government must announce generous financial grants to states which have no money to pay pensions, salaries and handle running expenditure.He said it’s surprising that the government remains non-committal to the demands of states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-fm-chidambaram-asks-pm-to-announce-pay-cheque-protection-plan-78030

There is no plan to promote them without examination.” On Tuesday, Nishank held an important meeting with the education ministers and education secretaries of all the states. Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia, who attended the meeting, had asked to release the results of the students only on the basis of internal examination by not having the remaining board exams of Class 10 and 12.Sisodia had said: “For the next year, the entire syllabus should be reduced by at least 30 per cent and the entrance examinations for JEE, NEET and other higher educational institutions should also be taken on the basis of reduced syllabus.”“It will not be possible to conduct the remaining exams of the CBSE’s Class 10 and 12. Therefore, children should be promoted on the basis of internal examination as the children of Class 9 and 11 have passed,” he suggested.However, both the Union Human Resource Development Ministry and the CBSE rejected this suggestion of the Delhi government. The CBSE said that there are no plans to admit students to the next class without taking board exams. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbse-to-conduct-class-10-12-board-exams-after-lockdown-78022
29-04-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s AIIMS planning to conduct clinical trial of plasma therapy||The All India Institute of Medical Sciences is planning to conduct a clinical trial of the convalescent plasma therapy in the treatment of COVID-19 and modalities of taking approvals from the Drug Controller General of India are being worked out.AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria said the mode of treatment in COVID-19 is still at an "experimental stage" and there is a need for good and well-conducted research trials before its benefit and this mode of therapy can be recommended for routine use in coronavirus patients."AIIMS is working with the ICMR to conduct a clinical trial on the efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19 patients," he said.The doctor said it is necessary for all institutes to take necessary approvals from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Drug Controller General of India and follow proper clinical practice guidelines for this research."In very limited studies, globally, convalescent plasma as an adjunct to other supportive therapies and treatments has shown some benefit in the management of severe patients of COVID-19," Guleria said.He also underlined that plasma has to be tested for its safety and it should have sufficient antibodies to be useful for giving it to COVID-19 patients."Giving plasma from a recovered patient without testing whether it has enough antibody titer or not may cause more harm than good as it can cause transfusion-related reactions," he said.Dr Vivek Nangia, Director and Head, Pulmonology, Medical Critical Care and Sleep Disorders at Fortis hospital here, said the health ministry has made the "right move to dispel any notion attached to plasma therapy" as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and added there is no specific treatment for the disease as of now."One should not be giving false hope to patients," he stated."This is a new virus and no specific treatment for this disease, whether it is hydroxychloroquine or plasma therapy. These are all conjectural therapies or experimental therapies," he said.Dr Neeraj Nischal, Associate Professor in the department of medicine at AIIMS, said that in the absence of any specific antiviral medications for the treatment of COVID-19, convalescent plasma (plasma from patients who have recovered from the illness) is being seen as a promising therapeutic option.But for plasma therapy to be effective, plasma must contain sufficient amount of neutralising antibody against that infection."This therapy is not foolproof and is associated with risks like inadvertent transfer of blood-borne infections and reactions to serum constituents, including immunological reactions such as serum sickness, and may worsen the clinical condition," Dr Nischal said.Plasma constitutes about 55 per cent of the total blood component and has high concentration of neutralising antibodies. When transfused, it acts as a passive immunisation and provides immediate immunity to susceptible or infected persons by neutralising the virus or by dampening the cytokine storm, he said.Plasma therapy has a history going back to 1890s and was the only means of treating certain infectious diseases like diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus prior to the development of effective antimicrobial therapy, Dr Nishchal explained."The convalescent plasma has also been tried in Spanish flu of 1918 and in more recent SARS and H1NI epidemics. It has also been used in the deadly Ebola disease, which affected the African countries," he said.The health ministry on Tuesday said currently plasma therapy is at an experimental stage and there is no evidence yet to support that it can be used as a treatment for COVID-19.It further said the ICMR has launched a national-level study to learn efficacy of plasma therapy in treatment of COVID-19 and till the apex health research body concludes its study and a robust scientific proof is available, plasma therapy should be used only for research or trial purpose."If plasma therapy is not used in a proper manner under proper guidelines, then it can also cause life-threatening complications," Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the Ministry of Health, said at a press briefing on Tuesday.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 1,007 and the number of cases climbed to 31,332 in the country on Wednesday, according to the Union health ministry.

India has asked the NDB to double the amount to $10 billion.In case the $15 billion decided today is apportioned equally, India should get $3 billion. If the $1 billion announced earlier is also added, the NDB with $4 billion (about Rs 30,000 crore) to India is the biggest multilateral loan provider so far.Making the announcement, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, “We also discussed the illegitimate curse of unilateral measures, or so-called sanctions outside the UN charter that puts obstacles to our effort to combat Covid.” Lavrov was referring to US sanctions against Russia and Iran that have not been approved by the UN.A Ministry of External Affairs statement was silent on both aspects but highlighted External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s suggestion for BRICS to support and recognise the efficacy of traditional medicine systems to strengthen immunity. He also emphasised that the current challenge underlined all the more the need for reform of multilateral systems. Jaishankar also spoke about the $23 billion package for the poor and the Arogya Setu app.Lavrov said the “common opinion” at the webinar was that the World Health Organisation was a “very important instrument, a unique platform” that gathered all information and made it available to countries. Asked whether BRICS countries would make up for the shortfall because of the US decision not to contribute its share to the WHO, Lavrov said the US was also the biggest beneficiary.

As much as 88.61 lakh MT wheat has already been procured for the central pool till Sunday, of which major contributors are Punjab (48.27 lakh MT) and Haryana (19.07 lakh MT), it says. However, experts say a bigger question could be whether farmers are able to reap the benefits of a bumper because of the prevailing situation and weather conditions. Agriculture expert Sudhir Panwar says the FCI is procuring but private players are not taking the risk and quite a sizable number is missing from the market. While yield per acre has also been less in some parts of Punjab, Haryana and western UP due to unseasonal rains and hailstorms this year, recent spell may have caused further damage by adding to the grain moisture content that may surpass FCI limits. “The effect of the latest rains will start showing in the next five-six days,” says Panwar. Agriculture and food specialist Devinder Sharma agrees, demanding an additional bonus for farmers. “Due to delayed harvesting and rain, the cost of production has increased. Therefore, what we need to do is provide farmers with Rs 100 per quintal as bonus across the board. They have also stood with us as warriors in this crisis and need to be rewarded,” Sharma says.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-sets-wheat-buying-target-at-400-lakh-mt-77697

In fact, a court case between the two warring firms had brought that huge markup in public view.Factors at play Sources said India would have to depend on China in a big way despite indigenous attempts to come up with inexpensive rapid-testing kits, ventilators and personal protection equipment (PPE).Moreover, in order to remain relevant to the world by being the prime supplier of some Covid-related antibiotics and preventive medicine, India will have to depend on China which supplies almost 90 per cent of the raw material.The Chinese embassy here had tried to salvage the reputation of the two suppliers of antibody rapid test kits by putting forth a variety of explanations after there were embarrassing variations in tests. Several countries have raised quality concerns over Chinese equipment.India, however, is not too worried after energetic diplomatic footwork enables a South Korean company to begin the production of rapid testing kits in India.Chinese embassy spokesperson Ji Rong, however, took exception to branding all Chinese products as faulty. “We hope the Indian side could respect China’s goodwill and sincerity, and resolve issues reasonably and properly,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-bury-virus-test-kit-row-77695
