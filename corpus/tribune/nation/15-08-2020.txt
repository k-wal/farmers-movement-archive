Companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.In a major policy document for Indian-Americans released on the occasion of India’s 74th Independence Day, the Biden Campaign also emphasised its support to family-based immigration system and streamlining processing for religious worker visas.The administration will also take steps to stem the rising tide of hate and bigotry, address the security needs of house of worship, eliminate language barriers and honour the diversity and contributions of Indian-Americans, it said.This is for the first time that a Democratic presidential candidate has come out with an exclusive policy document for Indian-Americans. There are 1.3 million eligible Indian-American voters across eight battleground states. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is scheduled to address the Indian-American community in a video message later in the day.Biden will support family-based immigration and preserve family unification as a core principle of our immigration system, which includes reducing the family visa backlog, his campaign said.“He will increase the number of visas offered for permanent, work-based immigration based on macroeconomic conditions and exempt from any cap recent graduates of PhD programmes in STEM fields,” the campaign said.“And, he will support first reforming the temporary visa system for high-skill, specialty jobs to protect wages and workers, then expanding the number of visas offered and eliminating the limits on employment-based Green Cards by country, which have kept so many Indian families in waiting for too long,” it said.According to the policy document, Biden will restore and defend the naturalisation process for Green Card holders. A Green Card allows a non-US citizen to live and work permanently in America.“He will increase the number of refugees we welcome into this country by setting the annual global refugee admissions target to 125,000 and seek to raise it over time to commensurate with our responsibility, our values, and the unprecedented global need,” it said.“He will also work with Congress to establish a minimum admissions number of 95,000 refugees annually. Biden will remove the uncertainty for Dreamers by reinstating the DACA programme and explore all legal options to protect their families from inhumane separation,” the campaign said.It said Biden will end workplace raids and protect other sensitive locations from immigration enforcement actions.As a largely immigrant community, but in some cases with American roots reaching back generations, Indian-Americans know firsthand the strength and resilience that immigrants bring to the US, the campaign said.“But President Trump has waged an unrelenting assault on our values and our history as a nation of immigrants. It’s wrong, and it stops when Biden is president,” it alleged.“Biden will rescind Trump’s Muslim ban on day one and reverse the detrimental asylum policies that are causing chaos and a humanitarian crisis at our border,” the campaign said.“He will immediately begin working with Congress to pass legislative immigration reform that modernises our system, with a priority on keeping families together by providing a roadmap to citizenship for nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants--- including more than 500,000 from India,” it said.Indian-Americans of all backgrounds---Hindu, Sikh, Muslim, Jain, and others---have been subjected to bullying and xenophobic attacks and need now, more than ever, a reassurance that the US leaders in Washington will have their backs, it said.During the Obama-Biden administration, the FBI expanded its hate crime statistics programme to include Sikhs, Hindus, and Buddhists. As President, Biden will directly address the rise in hateful attacks and enact legislation prohibiting someone convicted of a hate crime from purchasing or possessing a firearm, it said.“Biden will appoint leaders at the Department of Justice who will prioritise the prosecution of hate crimes, and he will order his Justice Department to focus additional resources to combat hate crimes---including religion-based hate crimes---and to confront white nationalist terrorism,” it said.“He will also seek legislation that increases the potential sentence for certain hate crimes that occur in houses of worship and other religious community sites, such as gurudwaras (sic), mandirs, temples, and mosques. And, he will use his executive power to ensure that the Department of Justice pursues such heinous acts of violence against houses of worship to the fullest extent of the law,” the campaign said.Noting that in 2012, the Sikh community suffered a terrible tragedy when a white supremacist opened fire in an Oak Creek, Wisconsin, gurdwara, ultimately killing seven and wounding four, the campaign added that in January 2019, a Hindu temple was the victim of a horrific act of vandalism and destruction, with windows shattered and xenophobic messages spray-painted across the walls.

15-08-2020||Chennai||AIADMK gags cadres, says leadership will decide on ‘CM nominee’||The ruling AIADMK on Saturday asserted that all important policy decisions like the one related to the Chief Ministerial candidate would be taken by the high command democratically and appealed to cadres to work unitedly.Seeking to end the debate on chief ministerial candidate for 2021 Assembly polls and following the flutter caused by posters that clamoured for ‘OPS for CM’, in Theni district, the AIADMK restrained cadres and leaders from expressing their views in the media on the matter.The party said airing views on the issue would “serve no purpose”, and warned of action against those violating the diktat.The gag order followed multiple meetings senior ministers had with chief minister K Palaniswami, who is AIADMKs co-coordinator and Deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam the party’s coordinator, at the two leaders residences here in quick succession.Without explicitly mentioning the CM candidate controversy, Panneerselvam and Palaniswami, in a joint statement, said: “In the past few days, some opinions expressed by party office bearers have become a subject of debate.”They said such remarks were unwarranted and had no background to it.The duo wanted functionaries to avoid such controversies again, and asked them to follow the “military- like” discipline that they had maintained when late Jayalalithaa was at the helm of affairs.Instead, functionaries should, “explain the achievements of the government and the ongoing schemes to the people,” the duo urged.“All important policy decisions of the party (apparently indicating the CM candidate choice for 2021 Assembly polls), the stand in respect of alliances, will be taken by the party leadership by following Amma’s footsteps in a democratic way,” they said, adding such decisions would reflect the voice of the cadres.Also, they asked workers and leaders to work unitedly and avoid giving an opportunity to the “avarice” of rivals.“It is time for everyone to work together to win a series of victories again without giving a chance to the greed of those who think they have defeated us.” The statement has put to rest speculation on the Chief Ministerial candidate for the moment.Over ten ministers, including D Jayakumar, S P Velumani, P Thangamani, Dindigul C Srinivasan, K A Sengottaiyan, held a discussion for nearly one-and-a-half hours with Panneerselvam.The ministerial delegation then called on Palaniswami and had a detailed discussion.The ministers shuttled between the residences of the two leaders and they declined to talk to the waiting media persons.The CM candidate controversy in the AIADMK was triggered by the remarks of Cooperation Minister Sellur K Raju who days ago claimed that AIADMK MLAs elected in the polls would decide their chief ministerial candidate.Dairy minister K T Rajenthra Bhalaji tweeted on August 11 that K Palaniswami would lead the AIADMK in the 2021 election.On Saturday, posters hailing Panneerselvam as the only Chief Ministerial candidate blessed by late party supremo J Jayalalithaa for the 2021 Assembly elections, appeared on the walls at several places in Theni district the home district of deputy chief minister - creating a flutter in the party. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aiadmk-gags-cadres-says-leadership-will-decide-on-cm-nominee-126978
15-08-2020||New Delhi||National Digital Health Mission rolled out on pilot mode in Chandigarh, 5 other UTs||The ambitious National Digital Health Mission (NDHM), unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday, under which every Indian will get a health ID that will ease access to medical services has been rolled out on a pilot mode in six union territories.The National Health Authority (NHA), the apex agency responsible for the implementation of Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, has been given the mandate by the government to design, build, roll-out and implement the NDHM in the country.   The six union territories where the mission was rolled out through a pilot launch are Chandigarh, Ladakh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, Puducherry, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep, the NHA said in a statement.In his Independence Day address, the prime minister said that under NDHM every Indian citizen will get a health ID which will store every individual’s medical records and the Mission will herald a new revolution in the health sector.“From today, a major campaign is being launched in which technology will play a big role. The National Digital Health Mission is being launched today. This will bring a new revolution in India’s health sector and it will help reduce problems in getting treatment with the help of technology,” he said.The health ID will contain information about medical data, prescriptions and diagnostic reports and summaries of previous discharge from hospitals for ailments. The mission is expected to bring efficiency and transparency in healthcare services in the country.Welcoming the historic announcement by the prime minister, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said, “Based on the initial learnings in the UTs, we will gradually work in partnership with the states to launch the NDHM. I seek the whole-hearted support, inputs and cooperation of doctors, healthcare facilities, citizens and state governments to adopt this game-changing scheme.”The NDHM is a holistic, voluntary healthcare programme that will reduce the existing gap between various stakeholders such as doctors, hospitals and other healthcare providers, pharmacies, insurance companies, and citizens by bringing them together and connecting them in an integrated digital health infrastructure, the NHA statement said.The NDHM comprises six key building blocks or digital systems -- HealthID, DigiDoctor, Health Facility Registry, Personal Health Records, e-Pharmacy andTelemedicine -- that will enable access to timely, safe and affordable healthcare through a ‘citizen-centric’ approach, it said.All of these digital products except e-Pharmacy and telemedicine have been deployed and are up and running.Providing details on the key components of NDHM, NHA CEO Dr Indu Bhushan said, “The core building blocks of NDHM such as Health ID, Digi-Doctor and Health Facility Registry shall be owned, operated and maintained by the government of India. Private stakeholders will have an equal opportunity to integrate with these building blocks and create their own products for the market. However, core activities and verifications, for example, generation of Health ID or approval of a doctor/facility shall remain with the government.”Additional components, like Personal Health Record (PHR) and Electronic Medical Record (EMR) solutions can be developed by private players as well, in line with guidelines that will be issued. All such products by private participants shall be as per official guidelines taking care of security, privacy and standards of the NDHM ecosystem, he elaborated. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/national-digital-health-mission-rolled-out-on-pilot-mode-in-chandigarh-5-other-uts-126973
15-08-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Kargil war air strike to be turned into a movie||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, Aug 15Some of the untold aspects of the India-Pakistan air battles will soon become part of celluloid history. Mumbai-based film-maker Kushal Srivastava has announced a movie on the Golden Arrows – the 17th Squadron of the Indian Air Force.The Golden Arrows, raised in 1952, has a long history with the crowning glory being the Kargil conflict in May-July 1999.The squadron (now based at Ambala and flying the Rafale jets) was then based at Bathinda and had been called into Srinagar.The MiG 21 fleet of the squadron moved out of Bathinda on May 18, 1999 and commenced surveillance and combat air patrols on May 21, 1999. The accurate photo reconnaissance missions confirmed the presence of Pakistan-backed intruders on the heights overlooking the Srinagar-Leh highway. Airstrikes commenced on May 26, 1999 at mountain tops in Kargil, Drass and Mushkoh.“Our war film is based on the bravery and brotherhood of the entire Golden Arrows,” Srivastava told the Tribune over the phone.The film is dedicated to Squadron Leader Ajay Ahuja, who went beyond the call of duty and was awarded the Vir Chakra, the country’s third highest battle honour.The Golden Arrows flew the maximum number of reconnaissance and strike missions. The squadron was awarded the coveted ‘Battle Honours’ for its meritorious performance in Kargil code named ‘Operation Safed Sagar’.This prestigious unit also won the maximum number of honours and awards amongst the Air Force units which participated in Operation Safed Sagar, including a Vir Chakra which was awarded to Sqn Ldr Ajay Ahuja posthumously for his gallantry during the conflict.Former IAF Chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa  (retd), who was Commanding the Golden Arrows during the Kargil war, has always seen Squadron Leader Ahuja as a true warrior.On May 27, 1999, Ahuja had veered his jet to look for Flight Lieutenant K Nachiketa whose jet was shot down. Ahuja’s jet also got shot by the Pakistani’s, he ejected and on the ground was killed by Pakistan Army. Nachiketa had ejected and taken Prisoner of War. He was returned to India a few days later.Last year on May 27, the 20th anniversary of Squadron Leader Ahuja, Air Chief Marshal  Dhanoa paid tribute to him by flying a ‘Missing Man’ formation in a MiG-21.Srivastava is looking to focus sharply and replicate what the 1990s movie ‘Border’ did for 23 Punjab, a company led by then Major Kuldip Singh Chandpuri which held back Pakistani Army ground attack at Laungewala in Rajasthan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kargil-war-air-strike-to-be-turned-into-a-movie-126972
15-08-2020||New Delhi||Once we get vaccine, Covid warriors will be first ones to get dose: MoS Health||Scientists are working hard on coronavirus vaccine and if their efforts bear fruit, COVID-19 warriors will be the first ones to get the dose, Union Minister of State for Health Ashwini Kumar Choubey said on Saturday.Interacting with reporters on the sidelines of the Independence Day celebrations at the Red Fort here, he also hailed the National Digital Health Mission unveiled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation.“This is a historic day for the country’s health sector. On the auspicious occasion of our Independence Day, our PM announced this mission. This will bring widespread change in the field of health,” Choubey said.Modi on Saturday unveiled the ambitious National Digital Health Mission under which every Indian will get a health ID that will ease access to medical services and he also announced that the country has made plans for mass-producing COVID-19 vaccine once scientists give a green signal.“Our scientists are working very hard on it. Three vaccines against COVID-19 are in various stages of testing. And, if we do succeed in getting a vaccine, our COVID warriors will be the first one to receive the dose,” the minister of state for health said.Modi in his address said, “When scientists will give us the green signal, it will be produced on a mass scale and all preparations have been made for it.”“So, our PM has spelt it out that this government is determined to fight its way out of the coronavirus crisis,” Chaubey said.Asked about the health ID card for each citizen that will be provided under the National Digital Health Mission, the Union minister said it will facilitate heathcare access to people.“The card will carry the medical history of the patient, and a doctor will be able to access prior information on ailments and treatment, if any, and begin treatment,” he said.Choubey said if a citizen travels from Patna to Bangalore, a doctor in the southern city will be able to access health-related data on the Patna patient, and respond faster.Modi in his address said this mission will bring a new revolution in India’s health sector and it will reduce problems in getting treatment with the help of technology.The health ID will contain information about medical data, prescriptions and diagnostic reports and summaries of previous discharge from hospitals for ailments. The mission is expected to bring efficiency and transparency in healthcare services in the country.On coronavirus vaccine, Modi said the country has prepared a roadmap to ensure that a COVID-19 vaccine reaches everyone in the shortest possible time.He said three vaccine candidates are in different stages of trials in the country.The phase 1 and 2 human clinical trials of two of the vaccine candidates, developed indigenously by Bharat Biotech, in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and Zydus Cadila Ltd, are currently underway.The Serum Institute of India has been permitted to conduct Phase 2 and 3 human clinical trials of the third vaccine candidate developed by the Oxford University.

15-08-2020||Kolkata||IIT Kharagpur researchers develop e-Classroom for teachers||Researchers at IIT Kharagpur have developed a software which can be of immense help to teachers who are currently facing challenges as the entire classroom session has shifted to online mode in different educational institutions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.Prof Raja Datta of Electronics and Electrical Communication Department with his postgraduate students developed the software, the current version of which can be used within a campus LAN, an IIT Kharagpur spokesperson said on Saturday.Talking about the software ‘Deekshak’, Datta said, “It is now a single session platform where the teacher would concentrate on the screen with the teaching materials while being able to view queries on a live chat box where each student can send in their queries.”Students also have access to a doubt box where they can click to “raise their hand” and wait for the teacher to address it, as is done in a physical classroom.Teachers can also share documents with the students through the platform and even update notes on the documents in real-time, Datta said.‘Deekshak’ is a low bandwidth web-based software and can be accessed using any computer or even a cell phone.Teachers can also record attendance of the students on the platform.The software has been tested at IIT Kharagpur during the initial phase of social distancing with about 40 hours of classes being conducted with a total of approximately 300 students.IIT Kharagpur, Director Prof Virendra K Tewari said, “We need platforms for addressing challenges faced by India and Deekshak is designed to cater to Indian academia, be it the bandwidth issue, or user interface or storage.”He said, “Deekshak is one step towards that goal through which the teachers would be able to offer more personalised interaction while focusing better on the act of teaching.”IIT Kharagpur has applied for the copyright registration of Deekshak and is in search of a start-up company for its maintainability.Further development of Deekshak is also underway to improve its features and make it secure so that it can be made available for use in academia, said Datta. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iit-kharagpur-researchers-develop-e-classroom-for-teachers-126953

Prime Minister offered India’s continued support to Nepal in this regard,” the statement said.It said Modi thanked Oli for his telephone call.The telephonic conversation between the two leaders came two days before Indian Ambassador Vinay Mohan Kwatra and Nepal’s Foreign Secretary Shanker Das Bairagi are scheduled to hold talks under a bilateral framework.It is not known whether issues relating to the border row figured in the talks between Modi and Oli.The ties between the two countries came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal protested the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through its territory. Days later, Nepal came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories.In June, Nepal’s Parliament approved the new political map of the country featuring areas that India claims belong to it. In its reaction, after Nepal’s lower house of parliament approved the Bill, India termed as untenable the “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims by the neighbouring country.India said Nepal’s action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks.Oli has been asserting that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura belong to Nepal and vowed to “reclaim” them from India.

This shall be subject to further adjustment upon final adjudication,” the court said.Sen was among those who were arrested following the Pune Police’s investigation into the Elgar Parishad conclave of December 31, 2017, which had been allegedly backed by the Maoists, and the violence near Bhima-Koregaon war memorial the next day. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-orders-nagpur-university-to-pay-rs-5-lakh-to-ex-prof-shoma-sen-126934
15-08-2020||Bhubaneswar||Researchers identify 73 novel variants of COVID-19 strain||A team of genomic researchers from two institutes has identified 73 novel variants of the COVID-19 strain in Odisha.The researchers are from CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi, and Institute of Medical Sciences and SUM Hospital, Bhubaneswar, he said."The research team, which carried out sequencing of 1,536 samples including 752 clinical samples, reported two lineages – B.1.112 and B.1.99 – for the first time in India," Dr Jayashankar Das, lead investigator and director (research) at the IMS and SUM Hospital, said on Friday.If one gets to know the detailed character of the novel coronavirus, it will be very easy to treat patients and cure them, he said.The research team, supported by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), validated the most-advanced COVID-19 sequencing technology. This could be a potential high-sensitivity assay for the detection of SARS- CoV-2 with the additional advantage of enabling genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, Das said.With this study, India has beaten 12 organisations in 10 countries to complete the first field validation and release the data online, he said, quoting a report by sequencing tech giant Illumina.The IMS and SUM Hospital researchers are also undertaking the sequencing and analysis of 500 viral genomes to understand the mild, moderate and critical coronavirus infection along with its transmission capabilities, he said.Besides, the study will help understand the vulnerability of the strains, new therapeutic targets and new mutations in eastern India, especially in Odisha, Das said.The rapid emergence of COVID-19 as a pandemic, which has affected millions of people across the world, has necessitated sensitive and high-throughput approaches for the diagnosis, surveillance and determining the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, which will help in tracking strain information as well, he said.Asked about the difference between RT-PCR test and COVID-19 sequencing tests, Das said, "The COVID-19 sequencing reports give the entire history of the coronavirus, while the RT-PCR tests only determine whether a patient is positive or negative for the infection."

15-08-2020||Washington||Hope Indian professionals are continued to be welcomed in US: Indian envoy||India’s Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu has voiced hope that Indian professionals will continue to be welcomed in America as their talent has contributed significantly to the country’s economy.During a virtual meeting with Governor of Ohio state Mike DeWine, Sandhu on Friday discussed various important issues, including the potential collaborations in the sector of higher education and technology where the talent from India can contribute in a significant way.“During the meeting, Sandhu shared that the Indian talent contributes significantly to the US economy and hoped that Indian professionals are continued to be welcomed in the US,” according to a statement issued by the Indian embassy.In June, President Donald Trump banned the entry into the US of workers in several key non-immigrant visa categories, including the H-1B until the end of the year, arguing that they eat into American jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those affected include the family members of the H-1B, L-1, and certain categories of J1 visas.However this week, the Trump Administration announced certain exemptions in H-1B and L-1 travel ban for those continuing employment with the same employer, a move that could help Indian IT professionals and those working in the healthcare sector.During Sandhu’s meeting with DeWine, the major topics discussed were trade, investment, and people-to-people ties.“Their conversation covered the strong trade, investment and people-to-people ties and areas of economic significance common to India and Ohio,” the Indian embassy said in the statement.They discussed the opportunities for collaboration in higher education and tech sectors, the statement said.Sandhu and DeWine noted the presence of a dynamic Indian community of over 100,000, including professionals and students, in Ohio.Both lauded the contribution of Dr Rattan Lal, an Indian-American scientist at Ohio State University, the recipient of the World Food Prize 2020, for his work in developing an environmentally sustainable soil-centric approach to increasing food production, the statement said.India has a robust economic partnership with Ohio. Total merchandise trade between India and Ohio has grown to USD 2.2 billion (2019). In recent years, about USD 50 million worth of Indian investments have created over 3,000 jobs in Ohio.Indian companies like TCS, Tata Steel, Tech Mahindra, Welspun, Wipro and Persistent Systems have a presence in Ohio. Companies from Ohio in sectors such as consumer goods, automotive, and technology sectors have also established a strong foothold in India, the statement said.

15-08-2020||Beijing||India faces 'twin challenges' of COVID-19, aggression at borders: Indian envoy to China||Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri on Saturday said that 2020 has been a very unusual year for India as it had to face the "twin challenges" of COVID-19 as well as aggression on the country's borders.  Addressing a large gathering of Beijing-based Indian community at the India House here on the country's 74th Independence Day, Misri talked about the problems faced by the Indian expatriates in China. Many family members of the expatriates are stranded in India due to visa-related issues following the COVD-19 pandemic and disruption of flights.  After hoisting the national flag and reading of President Ram Nath Kovind's Friday's address to the nation, Misri touched upon the “aggression at the borders,” in an apparent reference to the situation at the Sino-Indian borders in eastern Ladakh."As you just heard from the President's address, 2020 has been a very unusual year, including for us here in China. We in India have had to face the twin challenges of COVID-19 as well as aggression on our borders," Misri said. "I find that the situation today that faces us, all of us Indians, is not dissimilar to the one that we faced during our struggle for independence. "It is axiomatic therefore that the effort that will be required now by us to overcome the challenges that lie before us is not unlike what our nation and our people and compatriots deployed during the struggle for independence," he said. The same sacrifices too will be required. This is a challenge therefore that one can only face unitedly. All sections of society will need to come together for this, he said. The country has already begun facing up to this challenge, he said.Despite being preoccupied with facing up to the epidemic, the government has not taken its foot off the accelerator in terms of reforms and the last seven months have actually seen a slew of very important reforms in the fields of education, taxation, labour, agriculture and other associated fields, he said."This reform movement and its spirit, I am confident, will help our country overcome present challenges," Misri said.Touching upon the problems faced by Indian expatriates in China, he  offered to help them in whatever possible way.“For us here in China, things have changed also in imperceptible ways and I am sure in certain cases the changes are impacting your daily life,” the envoy said.He said the Indian Embassy and various consulates in the country are ready to help the Indian community. "Any difficulties and problems you have, we are there to help you find solutions to the extent possible in current circumstances,” he said. “The government of China itself is undergoing a time when it is deploying different policies in order to respond to the evolving situation. We have to adjust ourselves to those policies and do the best by our citizens,” he said. “In this moment, many of you are also dealing with pressures of business and with separation of families, with loved ones stranded in India. This is a phase that we have to get over in united fashion. My message to you is - stay strong, stay safe. We are there for you”, Misri said.

15-08-2020||New Delhi||PM launches Project Lion, Project Dolphin on I-Day||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday announced the launch of Project Lion and Project Dolphin for the conservation of the two endangered species in the country using modern technology. According to a MoEFCC spokesperson, Project Lion would involve conservation of the Asiatic Lion, and its landscape. "The project will entail habitat development by engaging modern technologies in management and addressing the issue of diseases in lion and its associated species through advanced world-class research and veterinary care," said the spokesperson. The project would also address the Human-Wildlife conflict. This would involve local communities living in the vicinity of lion landscape, and would also provide livelihood opportunities. Notably, the Asiatic Lion Conservation Project was launched in the NDA's first term with a budgetary contribution of Rs 97.85 Cr from Central Government. The Ministry has approved the project for three financial years—FY 2018-19, FY 2019-20 and FY 2020-21. However, according to the ministry officials, that were related to the finance aspect primarily while the Project Lion was announced by PM "will not only entail enhanced finances and duration, but address all the issues required to conserve a species.""Using the latest technology, the focus will be on health management and holistically providing world standard care, addressing all that is required to conserve a species," they said. Meanwhile, Project Dolphin aims at the conservation and protection of the Dolphins in rivers and oceans of the country. It involves conservation of Dolphins and the aquatic habitat through the use of modern technology—specially in enumeration and anti-poaching activities. It will engage the fishermen and other rivers and ocean dependent population, and will strive for improving the livelihood of the local communities."The conservation of Dolphin will also envisage activities which will also help in the mitigation of pollution in rivers and the oceans," said the ministry spokesperson.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-launches-project-lion-project-dolphin-on-i-day-126914
15-08-2020||Aditi Tandon||Modi’s push for digitisation of citizen health records: What does it mean||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 15Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Digital Health Mission push involves an ambitiousgovernment plan to digitise health records of all Indians by 2022.The mission structure will flow from a plan drafted last year by the National Institute for Transforming India which provides for the creation of a national digital health framework usable by the Centre and the states across government and private sectors, a framework resting on two pillars — national health registry and personal health records of citizens.Titled “National Health Stack: Strategy and Approach”, the paper’s objective is articulated by VK Paul, member (Health), NITI Aayog, says: “The National Health Stack (NHS) represents a holistic platform that supports a multitude of health verticals and their disparate branches, and is capable of integrating future IT solutions for a sector poised for rapid, disruptive changes and unforeseen twists. It is now conceivable to aim for digital health records for all citizens by the year 2022.”The Aayog says the immediate use of NHS is to provide financial protection of Rs 5 lakh annually to 10.74 crore poor families under the Prime Minister’s Jan Aarogya Yojna, adding that it would gradually go beyond the NHPS to enable healthcare provision and data sharing digitally.The mission proposes National Health Electronic Registries “to create a single source of health information and manage master health data of the nation” and personal health records to allow “consent-based flow of citizens’ health records to stakeholders who require this data to deliver value-added services to the user”.Another pillar of the NHS is Personal Health Records (PHR) of health users to be stored, as explained on Saturday by the Prime Minister, who said the digital health card or citizens would contain all health-related information and would reduce physical interface with the help from digital technologies.“Personal Health Record refers to the integrated view of all data related to an individual across various health providers, comprising his medical history, medication and allergies, immunization status, laboratory test results, radiology images, vital signs, personal statistics such as age and weight, demographics and billing information, and multiple health applications. Because health data is sensitive, the design and implementation must ensure the right level of privacy and security for health data, thus, the PHR is maintained in a secure and private environment, with the individual determining rights of access,” says the paper which is the basis for the Digital Health Mission.Personal data privacy is proposed to be ensured through health data fiduciaries (trustees) that will facilitate consent-driven interaction between entities generating health data and those wanting to consume data for better service delivery.The document reads: “The NHS design is geared to generate vast amounts of data resulting in some of the largest health databases with secured aggregated data that will put India at the forefront of medical research in the world.”About the paper, VK Paul says: “Various layers of the NHS will seamlessly link to support national health electronic registries, a coverage and claims platform, a federated personal health records framework, a national health analytics platform and other horizontal components. The stack will embrace health management systems of public health programs and socio-demographic data systems. The population-level base of such an IT system would be individual health record logged through the health and wellness centres in rural areas and corresponding primary health care in urban areas.”Under the NHS, NITI Aayog proposes unique digital health IDs for everyone who registers and also electronic registries of healthcare providers (hospitals, clinics, labs), beneficiaries, doctors, insurers and ASHAs.The paper also reads: “All registries will have open Application Programming Interfaces for publishing and consent-based access by authorised entities.”Niti Ayog’s consultation paper on National Health Stack on privacy“Data privacy is important and will be a critical part of the design of the Stack. All data access must be through API calls to ensure centralized management of security controls. Direct access will be prohibited for internal modules. Sensitive health data about individuals will be encrypted at rest. Tools to enable breach investigations will be present.”Proposed to be storedPersonal health records of users — their medical history, medication and allergies, immunisation status, laboratory test results, radiology images, vital signs, personal statistics such as age and weight, demographics and billing information.Benefits cited for peopleBenefits cited for government||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modis-push-for-digitisation-of-citizen-health-records-what-does-it-mean-126912

15-08-2020||New Delhi||From LoC to LAC, armed forces give befitting replies to those challenging India’s sovereignty: PM||In his Independence Day address from the ramparts of Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday delivered a strong message to China and Pakistan as he said the armed forces had given a befitting reply to those challenging the country’s sovereignty “from LoC to LAC”.Though the reference to China and Pakistan was clear, he did not name the two countries in his 86-minute speech.“From LoC (Line of Control) to LAC (Line of Actual Control), anyone who casts an eye on the sovereignty of the country, the armed forces of the country have responded in the language they understand,” Modi said.His comments came in the midst of India's bitter border row with China along the LAC in eastern Ladakh.There has also been a significant rise in incidents of ceasefire violations along the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan in the last few months, according to officials.“Whether it is terrorism or expansionism, India is fighting both with determination,” Modi said.Referring to the Galwan Valley clash in eastern Ladakh in June, the Prime Minister said respect for India’s sovereignty was supreme and that the world had seen in Ladakh what its brave jawans could do to maintain this resolve.“I salute all those brave soldiers from the Red Fort,” Modi said, adding the whole country was united in protecting the sovereignty of the country.The Indian and Chinese armies have been locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last three months.The tension escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in Galwan Valley on June 15. The Chinese side also suffered casualties but it is yet to give out the details. India and China have also held several rounds of diplomatic and military talks in the last few weeks for disengagement of troops in the eastern Ladakh region. However, the process has not moved forward as expected by India.The Prime Minister said India was connecting with its neighbours through a partnership of security, development and trust.“Today, neighbours are not only those who share the same geographical boundaries but also those who meet our hearts,” he added.During a visit to Ladakh last month, Modi had said the era of expansionism is over and that India’s enemies have seen the “fire and fury” of its armed forces, signalling India’s firmness in dealing with the border row with China.

15-08-2020||New Delhi||Why are people sitting in power scared of naming China, asks Congress||The Congress on Saturday asked why those sitting in power were scared of naming China, which has entered the Indian territory, and said every Congress worker and every Indian was proud of the armed forces.Talking to reporters after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address, Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also said all Indians should ask the government this Independence Day what it was doing to protect the country and push China back.In his speech from the ramparts of the Red Fort, the Prime Minister said India’s soldiers had given a fitting reply to those who had challenged the country’s sovereignty, from “LoC to LAC”. Modi, who did not name China, added that the whole country was united in protecting the sovereignty of the country.“Each and every Congress worker and all 130 crore Indians are proud of our armed forces and have full faith in them. We salute the armed forces for giving China an apt reply every time there has been an attack. But what about those who are sitting in power. Why are they scared of mentioning China's name?” Surjewala asked.“At a time when China has entered the Indian territory, every Indian needs to ask the government what it is doing to push China back and protect the country. On this Independence Day, they should ask this. That is the true sense of democracy,” the Congress leader added.He said it was important to question the government on whether it believed in the mandate of the people and if there was freedom to speak freely in the country.“Does our government believe in democracy? Does our government believe in public opinion? Do we have the freedom to speak, think, to travel, to wear what we like, to earn our livelihood or has that been curbed?” Surjewala said.The foundation of an ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’, he said, was laid by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and our freedom fighters.“But a government which is selling public sector undertakings, handing over railways and airports to private players and attacking everything from LIC to FCI, will that government be able to keep the freedom of this country safe. It is the duty of the government and every citizen to keep the freedom of the country safe,” he added.

15-08-2020||New Delhi||I-Day event at Red Fort scaled down, many seats remain empty||The Red Fort lawns that remains filled to the brim on Independence Day, saw many vacant seats this year with the attendees wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, displaying an image of the "new normal" in times of the coronavirus pandemic.The Independence Day event at the historic Red Fort, where prime minister unfurls the tricolour and delivers a speech to the nation, was scaled down this year. Around 4,000 invites, a quarter of the usual, were issued to officers, diplomats, local leaders and others.Still, a number of seats across all enclosures remained empty. A security official said they expected that a few seats would remain empty considering the COVID-19 situation."The number of invitees was one-fourth the normal. Still, lesser number of people turned up. Adequate arrangements were made to ensure physical distancing and masks, sanitisers and gloves provided to all the attendees," he said.A kit containing a mask, a small bottle of hand sanitiser and a pair of gloves were kept on all chairs which were positioned at a distance of 6 feet to maintain the prescribed distance. A hand towel was kept on the back rest of the chairs along with the programme pamphlet.School children, who would attend the event dressed in the colours of the national flag, were missing this time. Instead, 500 NCC cadets were invited to the event.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who would often venture among the schoolchildren and shake hands with them at the end of the event, said, "Today, our children are not here with us. The pandemic has halted all of us." Colourful carpets in enclosure and aisles contrast seating and walking areas, and posters bearing social distancing norms messages like 'keep six ft distance', 'wear a mask', dot the venue.Senior-most cabinet ministers were seated on the upper dais.Guests, security staff, VIPs, all were sporting masks as prescribed under the safety norms.

From just one corona testing lab, India now had 1,400 labs. “Our policies, our process, our products should be the best,” he said.Asia’s third-largest economy’s main focus would be the creation of a pipeline of national infrastructure projects worth more than Rs 110 lakh crore, Modi said.“About 7,000 projects in different sectors have been identified. This will be a type of infrastructure revolution.”Stating that working in silos in the infrastructure space had ended, he said a large scheme to connect the country through a multi-modal connectivity infrastructure is ready.The National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) project would play a crucial role in pulling the country out of the impact of COVID-19, he said.Vocal for local, re-skill and up-skill campaigns will be the main pillars, he said.“I am confident that India will realise this dream. I am confident of the abilities, confidence and potential of my fellow Indians. Once we decide to do something, we do not rest until we achieve that goal,” the Prime Minister said.On his government’s response to mitigate economic hardships caused by the coronavirus outbreak and ensuing lockdowns, Modi said seven crore families were given free cooking gas LPG cylinders, over 80 crore people got free ration and close to Rs 90,000 crore transferred into bank accounts. The moratorium on the EMI payment during the pandemic period had resulted in a rebate totalling Rs 6 lakh crore over the loan period, he said adding that Rs 25,000 crore fund was created for completion of unfinished real estate projects.“During the corona crisis over 80 crore Indians received free foodgrain, Rs 90,000 crore was transferred into accounts of the needy, a feat unthinkable till a few years ago,” he said.Highlighting his government’s reform measures, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said one nation one tax (GST), insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC) and bank mergers were the cornerstones of the six-year rule.Only five dozen village panchayats were connected with optical fibre in 2014. This has increased to 1.5 lakh in the last five years.“In the coming 1,000 days (less than 3 years), all the 6 lakh villages in the country will be connected with optical fibre network (to bring digital connectivity to rural masses),” he said.Also, Lakshadweep Islands will be connected with submarine optical fibre cable just like Andaman and Nicobar Islands to usher in high-speed internet and mobile connectivity.A blueprint of a national cybersecurity policy is ready to guard the nation against cyber threats, he said without giving details.“One of the main priorities of Aatmanirbhar Bharat is self-reliant agriculture and self-reliant farmer,” he said highlighting the recent announcement of Rs 1 lakh crore Agriculture Infrastructure Fund to create modern agri-infrastructure as well as the reforms that allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.“There was a time when India imported grains, but today, farmers are producing enough not just for the country but also for those in need across the world,” he said adding the farm sector needed to evolve in line with the requirements of the world. “Value addition is required for our farm sector.”Ethanol product has increased from just 40 crore litres five years back to over 200 crore litres, which is being used to mix in petrol, helping cut oil import bill as well as save the environment.“In the midst of the corona pandemic, 130 crore Indians have pledged to build an Aatmanirbhar Bharat,” he said adding that he was confident that India would realise this dream.Modi said India had always believed that the entire world was one family. “While we focus on economic growth and development, humanity must retain a central role in this process and our journey,” the Prime Minister noted.

Seeing the writing on the wall, Opposition BJP dropped its plan to bring a no-confidence motion against Gehlot.After the session, Gehlot said, "Winning the trust vote is a message to the forces that are trying to destabilise elected governments in the country. Their tactics failed in Rajasthan. It is the people's unwavering trust in us and unity of our MLAs that have brought this victory.”The Congress victory came after former Deputy CM Sachin Pilot struck truce with the party. In the Assembly today, Pilot, seated closer to Opposition (his seating was changed after he was sacked as the Deputy CM), said, "I am now closer to the border. You know why -- because the bravest and the strongest soldiers are sent to the border."While the Congress managed to save the day, the BJP feels the truce between Gehlot and Pilot would be short-lived. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sachin-pilot-in-tow-ashok-gehlot-wins-trust-vote-126700
