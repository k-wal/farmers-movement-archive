21-12-2020||Cape Canaveral (US)||Jupiter, Saturn merging in night sky, closest in centuries||Jupiter and Saturn merged in the night sky on Monday, appearing closer to one another than they have since Galileo's time in the 17th century.People gathered to watch the phenomenon on rooftops and open grounds in different parts of Kolkata and West Bengal though the winter fog partially hindered the view.Hundreds of sky gazers assembled at the Birla Industrial and Technological Museum in the city as the leading science museum has made an arrangement for them to view the cosmic event at the south-western part of the sky through a telescope, a BITM spokesman said.Astronomers say so-called conjunctions between the two largest planets in our solar system aren't particularly rare. Jupiter passes its neighbour Saturn in their respective laps around the sun every 20 years.But theis one especially close: the planets were one-tenth of a degree apart from our perspective or about one-fifth the width of a full moon. Toss in the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, the longest night of the year---and the summer solstice in the Southern Hemisphere---and this just-in-time-for-Christmas spectacle promises to be one of the greatest of Great Conjunctions.“What is most rare is a close conjunction that occurs in our nighttime sky," said Vanderbilt University's David Weintraub, an astronomy professor."I think it's fair to say that such an event typically may occur just once in any one person's lifetime, and I think 'once in my lifetime' is a pretty good test of whether something merits being labeled as rare or special.”The Dance of the Giants , The Great Conjunction #SaturnJupiterConjunction #Saturn #Jupiter pic.twitter.com/hiZ4JG3oamGorgeous Saturn.#conjunction pic.twitter.com/y7b5yquBbTSaturn - Jupiter conjunctionAfter 800 years#MasterPongal#Master @actorvijay pic.twitter.com/IAVQxKV3qGThis was the closest Jupiter-Saturn pairing since July 1623, when the two planets appeared a little nearer. This conjunction was almost impossible to see, however, because of its closeness to the sun.Considerably closer and in plain view was the March 1226 conjunction of the two planets — when Genghis Khan was conquering Asia. Monday's conjunction will be the closest pairing that is visible since way back then.The largest planets in our solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, will align into a ‘Christmas Star’ in a celestial phenomenon not seen in 397 years pic.twitter.com/7xegxxLrTQ  Saturn and Jupiter have been drawing closer in the south-southwest sky for weeks. Jupiter---bigger and closer to Earth---is vastly brighter.“I love watching them come closer and closer to each other and the fact that I can see it with my naked eyes from my back porch!” Virginia Tech astronomer Nahum Arav said in an email.Despite appearances, however, the two planets were actually  more than 450 million miles (730 million kilometers) apart. Earth, meanwhile, was 550 million miles (890 million kilometers) from Jupiter.Their next super-close pairing: March 15, 2080. --- Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jupiter-saturn-merging-in-night-sky-closest-in-centuries-187607

However, the construction work was delayed due to some formalities, including the approval of the site map and documents from the CDA and other relevant authorities.Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had allotted the land for the temple.The temple complex will also have a cremation site, apart from the space for separate structures for other religious rites.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.The majority of Pakistan’s Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with Muslim residents.

Senior Congress leader and the party’s top strategist, Ahmed Patel died at a Gurugram hospital on November 25 due to multi-organ failure.Being helpful and accessible, he was considered as a people’s man as his public connect was good.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi described him as a senior-most Congress leader, who had vast administrative and organisational experience, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi said his life is a shining example of public service and unparalleled commitment to the Congress ideology.Vora was born in Nagaur in Rajasthan in 1928, but spent most of his active life in now Chhattisgarh. He was a six-term MLA of undivided Madhya Pradesh assembly. He had served as a Rajya Sabha member four times and as a Lok Sabha member once. Incidentally, his Lok Sabha tenure came after his Governorship. He also served as the president of the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee in 1980s.Considered the last of the Gandhians in the grand old party, Vora was initially a socialist leader.He started his political career as a member of the Municipal Committee of Durg (then part of Madhya Pradesh) in 1968 and later joined the Congress.He was first elected to the MP Assembly in 1972 on a Congress ticket and became a minister of state in Arjun Singh’s Cabinet. He was elevated as Cabinet Minister in 1983. He also served as the Deputy Chairman of Madhya Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation during 1981-84.In March 1985, Vora was appointed Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh by Rajiv Gandhi. He resigned from the post of Chief Minister in February 1988 to join the Union Government.

21-12-2020||---||Plea claims discrepancies in NEET OMR sheets, HC seeks NTA stand||New Delhi, December 21The Delhi High Court on Monday sought National Testing Agency’s (NTA) reply on a plea claiming major discrepancies in the OMR sheets uploaded with regard to the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (UG) 2020 conducted in September.Justice Jayant Nath issued notice to the NTA seeking its stand on the plea by 14 candidates who have also challenged the procedure laid down by the testing agency for challenging the answer key and the OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) sheets.The court had on December 11 allowed the petitioners to examine their OMR sheets and take their photographs.On Monday, Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan and advocates Tanvi Dubey and Avishkar Singhvi, appearing for the candidates, told the court that the inspection revealed that some OMR sheets were blank and in one case a torn end of the sheet was stuck together with tape.They claimed there were other discrepancies in the OMR sheets they had examined and suggested setting up a high-powered committee to look into the matter.The suggestion was opposed by the counsel for NTA who said that allowing it would lend credence to the allegations of the petitioners.He said out of nearly 16 lakh students who registered for NEET only 16 candidates -- 14 by way of instant petition and two others earlier—have approached the court.The NTA’s counsel claimed that students who have not done well in the NEET are now coming to court claiming the OMR sheets were tampered with and sought time to file his reply to the allegations in the petition.The court, thereafter, gave the NTA time till January 4, 2021 to file its reply and listed the matter for hearing on January 8, 2021.The petitioners have contended that on October 5 when the OMR sheets were uploaded on the NTA website, they were shocked to see that answers recorded on these did not tally with answers marked by them at the time of the test and there was an apprehension that the sheets were tampered with.They have also contended that the process to challenge the OMR answer sheets was “arbitrary and unjust” as it requires payment of Rs 1,000 per question “which is beyond the financial capacity of the petitioners and thousands of other similarly placed students”. “It is most humbly submitted that payment of Rs 1,000 per question is unjust and irrational and is also against the fundamental right of the petitioners,” the petition has contended.It has also sought refund of Rs 91,000 paid by one of the petitioners in respect of 91 answers in his OMR sheet which he has challenged.

However, these kinds of accidents as being mentioned in the report, are hopefully a thing of the past. An extraordinary amount of hard work has been put in by the Railways to eliminate such accidents and consequential casualties. Last two years have been the safest in the history of Indian Railways with zero casualties due to railway accidents,” Railway spokesperson DJ Narain said.The NIA has not yet filed a chargesheet in the case.The CRS report also said that its investigation could not establish if the fracture of the tongue rail happened because of material failure or out-lived codal life.The 18448 Hirakhand Express, a scheduled passenger train from Jagdalpur to Bhubaneswar, derailed near Kuneru village in Vizianagaram of Andhra Pradesh on January 21, 2017, killing 40 people and injuring 68 others. The train, carrying 600 passengers, was travelling at a speed of 82 kmph when the accident happened.The NIA FIR had mentioned sabotage by Maoists, who are active in the area, as a possibility. After taking over the case, the NIA had sent broken rail pieces, coach parts and gravel from under the tracks at the accident site to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) at Hyderabad to check for explosives.But no trace of explosives was found by the FSL, an official had said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/railways-probe-finds-rail-fracture-caused-2017-andhra-train-derailment-nia-had-suspected-sabotage-187594

21-12-2020||New Delhi||Tent city: The new go-to lodging spot for protesters at Singhu border||A dip in the capital’s minimum temperature and scores of women joining the ongoing farmers’ protest has resulted in a make-shift ‘tent city’ propping up at a petrol pump in the Singhu border area.While tractor trolleys continue to be the first choice to sleep in for the majority of farmers camping at the Delhi-Haryana highway, the insulated tents are proving to be a welcome addition in providing protection from the winter chill and probable rain.The tents, which more often than not are booked to the capacity, have already crossed the figure of 200 from just 50 on December 12. They come in three different sizes, depending on which they are available for two, three or five adults along with children.While the biggest available tent is said to accommodate five people, the farmers, after staying in trolleys for over three weeks, have now learnt the skill of squeezing in and don’t mind sharing it with more people if required.“We knew we had to pitch in the tents. The issue was always about the space required. That is when we had a word with the owner of the petrol pump, and he readily agreed. The very next day — December 12 — we had installed close to 50 tents and from then on the number is only increasing,” said Jatin Singh, who is managing the space with his team of six people.He said they now have 200 tents which they provide to protesters who pitch them up wherever they find space. A tent is available upon providing a refundable security fee of Rs 1,000, Singh said.The water-proof tents, given by NGO Hemkunt Foundation, come with a set of mattress and blanket. Also, the petrol pump provides water for bathing and has a facility for charging phones or laptops too.Though there is no check-out time, the check-in time set for availing the shelter of the tents is 6 pm.Balveer Singh, 65, who has come from Moga district of Punjab, said it has been a week now since he has been staying here in these tents and has nothing to complain about.“Sona langi jaanda hai aje tak (It has been comfortable so far). I did stay in the trolley also, and then I got to know about these tents and came here. Since it is all covered, you don’t feel very cold here.“I keep my luggage here, go eat langar, meet people putting up in trolleys, talk to them and come back for rest in the afternoon and at night,” said Singh, who is happy to put up with four people in a tent basically meant for two.These tents are also a great boon to the many women protestors who admitted to getting a sense of privacy in them—something which they say was amiss in the tractor trolleys.Ramanpreet Kaur (29) and Sukhwinder Kaur (53), both hailing from Punjab’s Bathinda, were visibly happy to find lodging at one of the tents and said now they can get dressed without worrying about privacy and don’t have to carry their luggage everywhere.“Of course, it is less windy (in the tents) and you don’t get bitten by mosquitoes as you are all covered. More importantly, you can zip this tent up and change your clothes here without worrying about anything,” said Ramanpreet, who has been protesting here since November 30.“This gives you a sense of privacy and safety, which is very important. So yes, I am indeed happy to find myself a tent here,” she said.Tens of thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, are staying put at the national capital’s border points since late November to protest against the three contentious agriculture laws introduced recently by the Central government. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tent-city-the-new-go-to-lodging-spot-for-protesters-at-singhu-border-187588

We will serve Indian and Chinese cuisines and have hired two chefs for the same. I will keep running my old eatery also,” Prasad said.The 80-year-old said he has opened the restaurant at a rented accommodation.Tushant Adlakha, a social worker who also works with Prasad, said the restaurant will start functioning from Wednesday.“Today, it was the opening of the restaurant. Prasad will take two days to set up the kitchen and from Wednesday, they will start serving food to customers. They have both dine-in and take away options. They have hired two chefs and the rest of their family members are helping in the restaurant,” Adlakha said.Prasad had shot to fame after a video of him tearfully talking about the financial distress he faced in the months since the lockdown was shot by a man and shared widely across social media platforms.Nearly a month after his video went viral, Prasad had filed a complaint against the YouTuber for alleged misappropriation of funds.In his complaint to police, Prasad had alleged that the man who shot and published the video “intentionally and deliberately shared only his and his family/friends bank details and mobile numbers with the donors and collected huge amount of donation... without providing any information to the complainant”.

On the other hand we have advanced level of military exercises with India involving all the three services,” he explained.Russian Ambassador to India Nikolai Kudashev said Moscow was committed to sharing “almost everything” with India to realise the vision of Atmanirbhar Bharat. This included taking a close look at the military industrial corridors in UP and Tamil Nadu and unveiling the Su-57 in India next February.Russia is also making a pitch for the T-14 Armata main battle tank, pitched as the first in the world with an uninhabited tower.Kudashev also highlighted the civil nuclear partnership with India, with the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant as its flagship project. Russia, he said, was the “only foreign country so deeply involved in the Indian nuclear power sector”.Moscow is also keen to partner with India to export armaments to other countries but the stumbling block, as in the case of Brahmos missile, was that “there were a lot of mechanisms involved”.   “Russia is a responsible country in the arms control regime. The same is the case with India. Our bilateral military technical cooperation should not bring any threat to the regional balance. This is the driving force of our future partnership,” outlined Kudashev.Asked whether US might sanction India after Turkey for purchasing the Russian S-400, Kudashev described American unilateral sanctions as an “endless story like our relationship”.“It is hard to predict whether the Biden administration does not welcome sanctions as a medium of inter-state relations,” he said while hoping that New Delhi would expedite decisions on manufacturing Ka-226 helicopters and AK-203 rifles in India.Russia is working “very hard’’ with India to jointly produce Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine at Dr Reddy's Laboratories for use in India, Russia and other countries, he said.Moscow was also keen to join the Indian Ocean Rim Association as “we must take advantage of cooperation emerging in this vast region”, said Kudashev.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/russia-allays-indian-concerns-over-its-growing-ties-with-pakistan-187578

21-12-2020||Mumbai||Varavara Rao to stay at private hospital in Mumbai till January 7: HC||Jailed poet-activist Varavara Rao, an accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links' case, will continue to remain at Nanavati Hospital in Mumbai till January 7 next year, as the Bombay High Court on Monday extended his stay at the private medical facility.Rao, 81, has been receiving treatment for various ailments at the private hospital since last month following the intervention of the High Court.A Bench of Justice SS Shinde and Justice MS Karnik extended his stay at the Nanavati Hospital on Monday after adjourning the hearing on his bail plea, seeking release on medical grounds, till January 7.The Bench directed the Maharashtra Government to submit a fresh medical report detailing Rao's health condition on the next date of hearing.Rao's lawyer, Anand Grover, also informed the court that the activist's health condition was improving.Grover told the court that Rao was still being monitored by the hospital staff as his blood pressure continued to fluctuate and he was giddy most of the time.On the instructions from Rao's daughter, Grover also told the HC that Rao's family was "satisfied" with the treatment being provided to him at the Nanavati Hospital.While the Maharashtra Government and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) urged the court to transfer Rao from Nanavati Hospital to the Taloja prison hospital in neighbouring Navi Mumbai, or the state-run JJ Hospital here, the Bench said it could not do so without going through his present medical reports."We find it difficult to discharge him (Rao) from Nanavati (Hospital) and transfer him to Taloja jail. We cannot transfer him today. In the next hearing may be," the HC said."We haven't seen his fresh report. We cannot rely on the previous report," the Bench said.Rao has been in and out of the JJ Hospital and the Taloja prison hospital since his arrest in June 2018.On July 16 this year, he tested positive for COVID-19, after which he was shifted to the Nanavati Hospital.He was discharged from the Nanavati Hospital following a final assessment report on July 30 and sent back to the Taloja prison.Last month, he was admitted to the Nanavati Hospital again following the intervention of the Justices Shinde and Karnik.On November 18, the High Court noted that Rao was 81 years' old, suffered from neurological ailments and also needed post-COVID-19 care after recovering from the viral infection.A person was on death bed and in such circumstances the state government cannot say that he should be treated in the jail, the court had said.Following the court's observations, the Maharashtra Government on November 18 agreed to shift Rao from the Taloja prison to the Nanavati Hospital and also to bear the expenses of his treatment.Besides his bail plea on medical grounds, the Bench is also hearing a writ petition filed by Rao's wife Hemlatha, alleging a breach of his fundamental rights due to his continued incarceration without adequate medical care.Rao and some other Left-leaning activists were earlier arrested for alleged links with Maoists following the Elgar Parishad conclave in Maharashtra's Pune district on December 31, 2017.

21-12-2020||New Delhi||Give vaccine emergency use authorisation after trials on sufficient sample size: Par Panel||Any vaccine against COVID-19 should be granted emergency use authorisation only after proper consideration and conducting its trials on a sufficient sample size, a parliamentary panel chaired by senior Congress leader Anand Sharma has recommended to the government.In a report submitted on Monday to Rajya Sabha chairman and Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs also said there was a need for a comprehensive public health law to keep a tab on private hospitals and check black-marketing of medicines.The report comes even as the government considers applications of at least three firms seeking emergency approval to roll out their vaccines against the coronavirus in India.  The Centre last Tuesday said the applications—by Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of India and Pfizer—filed with the Drugs Controller General of India are being examined by the COVID-19 subject expert committee of Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO).The parliamentary committee report noted that the CDSCO has given no emergency use authorisation in the past, and suggested that all necessary and mandatory requirements must be duly fulfilled and all trial phases completed.“Trials on small animals, human trials should be mandatorily undertaken on a sufficient sample size population…if at all emergency authorisation would be given, it should be given by government with proper consideration and caution and this provision should be used in rarest of the rare cases,” the report reads.The report also noted that government hospitals bore the largest share of the burden of extending comprehensive healthcare during the pandemic, as private hospitals were either inaccessible or not affordable to everyone.Therefore, more fund should be allocated to public hospitals to strengthen the public health Infrastructure so that they can equip themselves appropriately to handle such pandemics in the future, the committee suggested in the report.It also recommended that learning from the experience of the pandemic, there is a need for a comprehensive public health act preferably at the national level with suitable legal provisions to support the government in keeping checks and controls over the private hospitals “as there have been reports about the selling of hospital beds by them”.“And also keep a check on the black marketing of medicines and product standardisation.”         At the same time, the panel said it is also necessary to make people aware through campaigns on cheaper and effective repurposed medicines to prevent them from panicking and spending a huge amount of money on expensive drugs.“The committee recommends that good quality and affordable medicines be provided to everyone, especially at a cheaper or subsidised rate to the marginalised sections of the society especially at the time of pandemic like COVID-19,” the report reads. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/give-vaccine-emergency-use-authorisation-after-trials-on-sufficient-sample-size-par-panel-187552
21-12-2020||---||Farmer leaders say nothing new in govt’s letter, ready for talks but Centre must offer ‘concrete solution’||New Delhi, December 21Farmer leaders on Monday said they are always ready for dialogue as long as the government is offering a “concrete solution”, but claimed that there is nothing new in the Centre’s latest letter to them seeking a date for the next round of talks.Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait said the government, in its letter, mentioned that it wants to hold talks over its earlier proposal of amendments in the new agri laws.“On this issue (government’s proposal), we did not talk to them earlier. We are currently discussing how to respond to the government letter,” Tikait told PTI.The sixth round of talks on December 9 was cancelled.In the letter to 40 union leaders, the Agriculture Ministry Joint Secretary Vivek Aggarwal on Sunday asked them to specify their concerns over its earlier proposal of amendments in the laws and choose a convenient date for the next round of talks so that the ongoing agitation could end at the earliest.“There is nothing new in their letter. We have already rejected the government’s proposal to amend the new farm laws. In its letter, the government has asked us to discuss its proposal and convey a date to it for another round of talks.“Don’t they know our demand? We just want a complete repeal of the new agriculture laws,” another farmer leader Abhimanyu Kohar said.In the letter, the Union agriculture joint secretary said the Centre is making all efforts with “an open heart” to find an appropriate solution to resolve all concerns raised by farmers.The officer said in its draft proposal sent on December 9, the government had proposed to make necessary amendments on at least seven issues, including providing a “written assurance” to the farmers that the existing minimum support price (MSP) system would continue.Thousands of farmers have been camping at several Delhi border points against the new farm laws for the last 24 days.“It doesn’t make sense that the government is asking us for a date. We are basically sitting here all day long waiting for the government to hear us. They are the ones who have busy schedules.“They should give us a date, or they can simply come to our tents here, see how we are living and talk to us,” said farmer leader Kashmir Singh, who is an assistant secretary of the All India Kisan Samiti (Punjab) said.Amarjeet Singh Rarra, general secretary of Dwaba Kisan Committee, said farmers are always ready to meet the government but it has to come to them with a concrete solution.“We have studied their proposals clause by clause, and we have repeatedly told them that we want the laws to be repealed,” Rarra said.The farmer leaders are expected to meet on Tuesday to discuss the next plan of action, said Gurmeet Singh of Krantikari Kisan Union.“We have already sent them our proposals, and pointed out the issues we had with the government’s proposal. They need to respond to what we have already told them.“Tomorrow, there will be a Sanyukt Morcha meeting to decide how and when to respond to the government. We will evaluate the government’s letter and then decide,” Gurmeet Singh said.Asked why the talks with the government have failed to yield any result, he alleged that the three laws were “anti-farmer” and the government was “favouring the corporates” over the farmers and the common man.“We will meet tomorrow, deliberate and then see what has to be done, but our demand remains the same — we want the laws to be repealed or we won’t move,” said Ram Singh, Haryana state president of Ambedkar Sangharsh Morcha.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The government has repeatedly asserted that the MSP and Mandi systems will stay and has accused the opposition of misleading the farmers.

The relevant cooperation is a routine arrangement between the two militaries,” he said.“It is not targeting any third party. We hope that (the) relevant party can view this in an objective manner,” Wang said, without directly naming India.The joint air force exercises, which will conclude in late December, is a project within the 2020 cooperation plan of the two militaries, the Chinese military said earlier.The drills will promote the development of China-Pakistan “mil-to-mil” relationships, deepen practical cooperation between the two air forces, and improve the actual-combat training level of the two sides, it said.Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa on Friday visited an airbase to witness the joint drills and emphasised combat readiness and improved interoperability with China.  All weather friends, China and Pakistan share close military ties with Beijing emerging as a major weapons provider to Pakistan in recent years.China also helps Pakistan to jointly produce JF-17 fighter jets which were recently upgraded with the new Block-3 version.The exercises are being held in the midst of an eight-month-long military standoff between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/take-an-objective-view-on-chinese-pakistan-air-force-drills-china-tells-india-187546

Govt of India has decided that all flights originating from the UK to India to be suspended till December 31 (23.59 hours),” the Ministry of Civil Aviation said.(Click here for the latest developments on Covid-19 epidemic)The ministry said the suspension would start from 23.59 hours, December 22.Consequently flights from India to UK shall stand temporarily suspended during the above said period.The government has further decided that as a measure of abundant precaution, passengers arriving from the UK in all transit flights (flights that have taken off or flights which are reaching India before December 22 at 23.59 hrs) should be subject to mandatory RT-PCR test on arrival at the airports concerned.Meanwhile, the Health Ministry will study the bee strain and issue guidance accordingly.A number of countries like Canada, Turkey, Belgium, Italy and Israel have banned flights from the UK as the British government warned that the potent new strain of the virus was "out of control" and imposed a stringent new stay-at-home lockdown from Sunday.Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Twitter that the passengers who are found COVID-19-positive would be sent for institutional quarantine set up by states or union territories (UTs)."Those found negative should be advised to isolate at home for seven days and will be medically monitored by states/UTs," Puri added.Till date, the rules stated that if an international passenger had a COVID-19-negative certificate from a test done 72 hours prior to the journey, he or she need not undergo a COVID-19 test again on arrival at the Indian airport.Aviation regulator DGCA on Monday said all airlines must ensure that passengers travelling from the UK do not board their flights from anywhere outside the UK to come to India during the suspension period.The regulator said the aforementioned suspension would not be applicable on cargo flights.Vistara spokesperson said the airline will comply with the government's order to suspend UK flights."To minimise inconvenience to our customers, we will enable one-time free-of-charge rescheduling of affected bookings to any date until 31 December 2021," the spokesperson noted.For the last few months, Vistara, Air India, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have been operating a limited number of direct special flights between India and the UK under the bilateral air bubble arrangement between the two nations.While all scheduled international passenger flights have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus pandemic, special flights have been operating under the Vande Bharat mission since May and under air bubble arrangements since July.India has formed air bubble arrangements with more than 22 countries, including the UK. Under an air bubble agreement between two nations, airlines of both countries can operate special flights between their territories with certain restrictions.Nishant Pitti, Co-founder and CEO of EaseMyTrip.com, said the government's decision to suspend flights to and from the UK till the year-end would have a negligible impact on tourist traffic."Due to the current environment of COVID-19 and the quarantine rules and off-season, tourism to the UK in any case had not picked up.

Now, let us rise together," Modi said."Discussions on global growth cannot happen only between a few. The table must be bigger. The agenda must be broader. Growth patterns must follow a human-centric approach. And, be in harmony with our surroundings," he said.Modi also called for keeping humanism at the core of policies."We must make harmonious co-existence with nature as the central pillar of our existence," he said.In his address at the conference, the Prime Minister also proposed the creation of a library dedicated to traditional Buddhist literature and scriptures."We will be happy to create such a facility in India and will provide appropriate resources for it," he said.The library will collect digital copies of all such Buddhist literature from different countries, he said.It will aim to translate them and make them freely available for all monks and scholars of Buddhism, Modi added."The library will not only be a depository of literature. It will also be a platform for research and dialogue - a true Samwad between human beings, between societies, and between humans and nature," he said.Its research mandate will also include examining how Buddha's message can guide our modern world against contemporary challenges, Modi said, noting that Lord Budha's teachings commanded the strength to turn the discourse from enmity to empowerment.

State of Uttar Pradesh and another, reported in (2018) 3 SCC 22 and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, applicant can be released on bail".In Dataram Singh's case, the Supreme Court had held that "grant of bail is a general rule and putting a person in jail or in a prison or in correction home during trial is an exception and presumption of innocence, i.e. person is believed to be innocent until found guilty, is fundamental postulate of criminal jurisprudence. It is not necessary to go into the correctness or otherwise of the allegations made against the accused as this is a subject matter to be dealt with by the trial judge".On November 1, an FIR was registered against Khan under Sections 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups) and other sections of the IPC at the Barsana police station in Mathura.It was alleged that Khan and co-accused Chand Mohammad had offered namaaz on the temple premises without the consent of the priest.Photographs of the incident went viral on social media.Khan was also accused of receiving foreign funds.His counsel argued that the applicant is a social activist, who has revived the 'Khudai Khidmatgar' movement and is working for maintaining communal harmony for the past 25 years.It was in this connection that he undertook a 'yatra' to visit temples.Khan was offered 'prasad' and lunch by the temple's chief priest, who also bestowed blessings on him as is clear from the photographs, the counsel said."The applicant had no intention to disturb the communal harmony of the society and he did not enter the sanctum sanctorum of the temple, rather he offered namaaz outside the temple with the permission of the priest as is clear from the viral photographs,"he added.After hearing arguments, the court granted bail and directed Khan to cooperate in trial and not to tamper with prosecution witnesses.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/allahabad-high-court-grants-bail-to-man-who-offered-namaaz-in-temple-187489

21-12-2020||Aditi Tandon||IIM-Ahmedabad’s founding ‘mother’ who couldn’t be its director||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 20That the premiere Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIMA) had three founding fathers — nuclear scientist Vikram Sarabhai, industrialist Kasturbhai Lalbhai and former Gujarat Chief Minister Jivraj Mehta — is well-documented.What is not known is that the institute also had a founding mother, who, a new research now shows, could never become its Director due to “sexism”.Kamla Chowdhry was IIMA’s first faculty member and its coordinator of programmes between 1962 and 1965. Her colleagues remembered how she was the de facto Director of IIMA as Sarabhai, Honorary Director, was rarely around for routine matters.“But sexism played a defining role in Chowdhry’s professional life almost certainly barring her from becoming the first director of the institute she helped found. Now new archival evidence is showing that she was more central to the IIMA project than has ever been publicly acknowledged,” says Chinmay Tumbe, economics faculty at IIM Ahmedabad, whose work, published on Chowdhry’s birth centenary on December 17, resurrects the obscure scholar to where she belongs.Born in Lahore to a Punjabi Khatri family, Chowdhry did MA in philosophy from Punjab University in 1943 and later a doctorate in social psychology from Michigan University in 1949.After IIMA was founded in December 1961, Sarabhai helped Chowdhry bag a research position at Harvard Business School (HBS), which was to later become the institutional partner for IIMA.In 1962, when IIMA’s administrative office started functioning, HBS didn’t even admit women into its MBA programme.But back home, Chowdhry was practically running IIMA, recruiting faculty, convening faculty meetings and even selecting furniture. She couldn’t go farther than that though.“In spite of the full backing of Sarabhai and Prakash Tandon, chairman of IIMA’s Board of Governors at the time, Chowdhry never became full-time IIMA Director. As de facto director and senior-most faculty, she was the top contender for the post. But a peculiar circumstance put paid to that prospect,” Tumbe says.His research shows that between 1963 and 1964, a doctoral student from HBS, deputed to IIMA, wrote a series of letters against Chowdhry to Harry Hansen, then director of the IIMA project in Boston, saying, “We must see to it that Chowdhry doesn’t become Director or for that matter Deputy-Director, or any other high administrative position.”Tumbe notes it is likely that the correspondence of the doctoral student fuelled misgivings HBS may have had about Chowdhry’s leadership abilities.“Chowdhry was widely seen to be close to Sarabhai, and all communication to him tended to be routed through her. But Sarabhai himself was rarely around, and his absence, in effect, gave Chowdhry powers that were often misconstrued.

Similarly, the agitation is about saving their land,” Manpreet stated.Maintaining that the farm laws were the outcome of the FCI being under heavy debt, Manpreet narrated stories to underline the grit and valour of the Punjabis under adversities and their ability to come right out on top.Panag, who comes from an Army background and has been to the Singhu border to express solidarity with the farmers, said farmers feel short-shifted and there exists a huge trust deficit given the way the farm Bills were brought in and rushed through in Parliament.The moderator, Lok Sabha MP Manish Tewari, urged farmers to widen their base by allowing like-minded people to join them in building pressure on the government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/engaging-stakeholders-in-farm-reforms-only-way-forward-panelists-187333

The joint monitoring group constituted within the Health Ministry will meet with a WHO representative in attendance.Experts on the group said India had not seen any significant/worrisome mutation of the Covid-19 virus so far and this was good news for the indigenous vaccines which are being developed. Mutation of the virus could spell challenges for the efficacy of the vaccines which have already been marketed, such as the Pfizer vaccine in the UK.The PGIMS-Rohtak, meanwhile, is unlikely to complete phase-3 clinical trials of indigenous Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin by December 31 as the volunteers have shown tepid response.The PGIMS was to administer the first dose of Covaxin to 1,000 participants till December 31, but merely 330 have so far been given the shot and only 60 more are in the queue. Sources saidHealth Minister Anil Vij, who was administered the first dose on November 20, contracting infection and the vaccine unlikely to be available this year or early next year were the main reasons behind the lukewarm response.Social activist Mukesh Bagdi said: “One of my relatives wanted to get himself enrolled for the trials, but shelved the plan after the minister got infected days after taking the jab.”Dr Ramesh Verma, a co-investigator of the project, said they were still hopeful of achieving the target. “The first two phases of the trials have been successful. We appeal to the people to get themselves enrolled,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-review-uk-mutation-data-today-187334

In a letter to the union leaders, Agriculture Ministry Joint Secretary Vivek Aggarwal wrote, “I request those previously invited protesting union leaders to provide details of their remaining concerns and doubts and suggest a date as per convenience for the next round of talks.”The earlier five rounds of formal talks between the government and 40 farmers’ unions failed to break the impasse, with the farmers insisting that the Centre’s recent farm laws be repealed.The government intends to convene the next meeting at Vigyan Bhawan here “for resolving the issue so that the ongoing protests end at the earliest,” Aggarwal said.Even as the protesting farmers paid homage to those dead during the stir, PM Narendra Modi on Sunday paid a surprise visit to Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib and paid tributes to Guru Teg Bahadur for his supreme sacrifice. The Ninth Sikh Guru’s death anniversary was observed on Saturday.The PM tweeted after his visit, “This morning, I prayed at the historic Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib, where the pious body of Sri Guru Teg Bahadur ji was cremated. I felt extremely blessed. I, like millions around the world, am deeply inspired by the kindnesses of Sri Guru Teg Bahadur ji (sic).” He also tweeted in Punjabi. The PM’s visit amid the stir by farmers, especially from Punjab, is significant.Meanwhile, the unions announced to observe a daylong relay fast on Monday at all protest sites and to halt toll collection on highways in Haryana from December 25 to 27. Swaraj India chief Yogendra Yadav, addressing the media at the Delhi-Haryana Singhu border, said: “Protesters are being threatened by the Haryana Government. This is against the direction of the Supreme Court. I urge them not to do so.” Senior BKU member Rakesh Tikait announced that December 23 would be celebrated as Kisan Diwas in memory of Chaudhary Charan Singh. “We request the people not to cook lunch for a day”.The protesting farmers paid tributes to the farmers who died during the agitation and lit candles in their memory even as the AIKSCC wrote to various traders’ associations for their support.Centre seeking info on funds, claims BKUChandigarh: Bharti Kisan Union (Ekta Ugrahan) on Sunday said it had been asked by a central agency to submit registration details which allow it to receive foreign funds. “The Centre is using every tactic to defeat our agitation,” union president Joginder Ugrahan claimed.

This roadshow is a reflection of people’s anger against the Mamata Banerjee government. This crowd reflects people’s faith in the agenda of development of Narendra Modi ji,” Shah said while addressing a gathering at the roadshow.He said the yearning was not about changing a political leader but “getting rid of corruption, political violence, extortion and Bangladeshi infiltration”. — PTIState gets first oil, gas reserveAshoknagar: West Bengal found a place on the oil map of India on Sunday as Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan inaugurated an oil and gas-producing field in North 24 Parganas.

Pakistan had occupied it (Bangladesh) and we liberated it. We did not stay beyond 90 days.—Lt Gen SS Mehta The annual event was held virtually in Chandigarh due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Each officer narrated how crossing the Meghna (December 9-15, 1971) was done while the Indian Army approached to encircle Dhaka (then Dacca) from the eastern flank. Interspersed with some thrilling anecdotes of the war and the conduct of 4 Corps Commander Lt Gen Sagat Singh, the session was moderated by Squadron Leader Rana TS Chinna, who is part of the Centre for Armed Forces Historical Research.Dhaka was then the capital of East Pakistan. Indian troops crossed the Meghna using helicopters while tanks forded across the strong current leading to a hasty fall of Dhaka.Lt Gen SS Mehta, who led the first tank troop using PT-76 tanks into Dhaka, termed this as a victory of democracy over military rule and a victory of humanism over barbarism. In his opinion, the Indian Army played for manoeuvre over attrition. “They played to their plan, we played to ours. The result was Dhaka,” he said.“The game changer was the helicopter-lift of troops and the crossing of the Meghna by tanks which forded across the river,” he later told The Tribune.“The war was about liberation over occupation. Pakistan had occupied it (Bangladesh) and we liberated it. We did not stay beyond 90 days,” said General Mehta, who was commanding the 5th independent squadron of his regiment, the 63 Cavalry. The General, then a Major, did the task of making his squadron tanks cross the river using them in an amphibious mode.“We captured Dhaka with just 3,000 troops and 30,000 personnel of the Pakistan army surrendered,” he said, recollecting how his tank squadron was parked in the grounds of Dhaka University and on its edge stood 16th century Gurdwara Nanak Shahi, which was damaged by the Pakistan army that also killed its granthi. The gurdwara was rebuilt and the troops brought a new granthi too. The first speech of new leaders of Bangladesh in their officiating capacity was made from the same gurdwara.Lt Gen GS Sihota, who was air operations pilot tasked with Gen Sagat Singh, described how the operation was planned and how the general himself visited each spot to select the best possible location to cross the Meghna after several air reconnaissance sorties. “Sagat Singh could not accept defeat,” he said.Group Captain CS Sandhu, who was commanding the 110 Helicopter unit of the IAF, was tasked with ferrying troops across the Meghna. He said the unit had 10 Mi-4 helicopters supplied by the then USSR. “In June 1971, I was told that I would be operating with the 4 Corps and asked to go and see General Sagat Singh who advised me to train for night flying. No radio transmission permitted. With just a navigation and a small cockpit light, the task was to coordinate the flying speed of the copters with accuracy to prevent mid-air crashes. The training was done after the monsoon in 1971,” he said.From December 9-15, IAF helicopters lifted 6,000 men from the east bank of the Meghna and dropped them at the west bank for onward march to Dhaka, he said.Maj Chandrakant Singh, who was in the infantry, described the battle of Akhaura as the toughest in the eastern sector. By December 6, the troops were moving towards the river line of the Meghna. “The planning to heli-drop troops was done overnight and it helped us push Pakistan further westwards towards Dhaka. Sagat Singh was clear that he would use helicopters in an offensive role,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/crossing-meghna-led-to-dhakas-fall-panel-187337

In a scenario of the NCP splitting into its old factions, the main opposition — Nepali Congress under Sher Bahadur Deuba — could become more politically relevant, said sources.Deuba-led Nepali Congress last time had logged 35 per cent of the votes in the last Parliamentary elections, but was politically overwhelmed after the two main communist parties merged to form the NCP, said the sources.Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi had brokered peace several times by shuttling between Oli and Prachanda. But a week-long controversy over an executive order by the PM was apparently beyond her abilities. The order had tried to narrow a top committee’s decision-making to just three members instead of the existing rule of arriving at decisions through a consensus. Oli was forced to withdraw the executive order amid clear signs that his faction had lost majority support to the Prachanda-Madhav Nepal-Jhalanath Khanal group. The latest Indian emissary was BJP’s foreign affairs cell Vijay Chauthaiwale. He met Deuba as well as leaders of Madheshi parties, but not Prachanda, Nepal or Khanal, who support warmer ties with China.

From having their own IT cell to training leaders to speak English, the unions are trying to counter the “propaganda war” on three agriculture laws.Kirti Kisan Union vice-president Rajinder Singh delivered his address in English on Sunday. Also, the unions have come out with six posters, explaining in detail how these laws would “finish” the farmers.“We decided to have our own IT cell to abort repeated attempts to defame us by dubbing us as Maoists or anti-national,” said Rajinder Singh. The Bharti Kisan Union on Saturday posted an online advertisement inviting volunteers for video-editing and content writing. “The response has been overwhelming,” said Sukhdev Singh Kokri, general secretary of the union.Back from Singhu, Farmer kills selfBathinda: Gurlabh Singh, a 22-year-old farmer from Dyalpura Mirza village in Bathinda district, whose family was reportedly under debt, consumed poison on his return from the Singhu border.

Citing an anecdote, Gen Malik said in 1996 when he was the Vice Chief of Army Staff, they were not getting permission to celebrate the silver jubilee of the 1971 Indo-Pak war till the last moment. “During a meeting in the cabinet secretary’s office, the first question I was asked was “why do you want to celebrate it? Where is the need? It will upset Pakistan”. Such was the thinking of the government of that time, he said, while mentioning it was the greatest military victories in centuries.“There have been a number of attempts to bring reservation into the Army. Not just during my time but earlier too. All political leaders need to guard against it. When an organisation is working well, why should it be politicised?” he said.Adding a word of caution for politicians promoting division, Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Badal said, “We have studied in principles of science that if you boil water at 100 degree Celsius, it will turn into steam. The statecraft is also like science. If you do A, B and C, the country will progress and if you do X, Y and Z, the country will go down. You need peace to progress.”Col Shantanu Pande, who is serving in the Army, said, “When a soldier from the Jat Regiment stands at the Siachen Glacier, his community, village and the entire country is standing behind him. We (military) are not a melting pot. We don’t try to fuse. We retain flavour.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/military-proud-of-maintaining-unity-in-pluralism-gen-malik-187341
21-12-2020||Bolpur (WB)||Centre has right to summon officers; CAA rules to be framed after COVID vaccination starts: Shah||Slamming West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over the recent attack on BJP chief J P Nadda's convoy, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday asserted the Centre has the right to summon state IPS officers responsible for providing him security for central deputation, and asked the TMC to go through the rules before pointing fingers at the union government.He also said that rules for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are yet to be framed because of the pandemic situation and the matter will be considered once the COVID-19 vaccination starts and the corona chain breaks.Addressing a press conference here, Shah claimed that Banerjee and the Trinamool Congress raked up the "outsider- insider" issue to divert public attention from the failures of the state government and said that a "son of the soil" would lead the state if the BJP is voted to power."The rules of the CAA are yet to be framed as such a massive process could not be carried out because of the corona. As soon as (COVID) vaccination starts and corona cycle breaks, we will consider it," he said.Asked about the summoning of IPS officers of West Bengal cadre by the Ministry of Home Affairs, Shah said that the Centre has sent the letter to state government as per the Constitution and the law."It is according to the federal structure (of the country). They (TMC government) should first go through the rules and then talk to the Centre and the public." The Centre had on Thursday shot off a fresh letter to the West Bengal government to immediately relieve its three IPS officers for central deputation, following which the chief minister branded the move as "unconstitutional and unacceptable".On the attack on Nadda's convoy by alleged TMC activists during his visit to Diamond Harbour on December 10, Shah alleged that political violence and corruption are at peak in the state."The BJP condemns it, and I too condemn it. The BJP believes that in a democracy, everyone should have the right to voice their views. And it is the responsibility of the ruling party to ensure that all parties can have their voice heard."The attack on the BJP chief is not only an attack on him. It is an attack on democracy in West Bengal and the Trinamool Congress is completely responsible for this," Shah said.It was more alarming that after the attack, TMC leaders' statements, in a way, supported it, the senior BJP leader claimed.They must not be under the impression that the BJP will be cowed down by such attacks, he said adding that the party will continue to work to defeat the TMC.On the "insider-outsider" debate, Shah said, "I think Mamata di has forgotten a few things. Did she call Indira Gandhi, Pranab Mukherjee, Narasimha Rao outsiders when they used to come to West Bengal, and she was with the Congress?Does she want a country where people from one state will not visit another?""Someone from Bengal, a bhumiputra (son of the soil), will defeat her and become the next CM of the state." He said.Shah, however, rejected any link between his 'bhumiputra' comment and Suvendu Adhikari, a TMC heavyweight who joined the saffron camp on Saturday."The decision in this regard is taken by the parliamentary board. If we take any such decision, before election we will let you know," he said.Assembly polls are due in the state in April-May next year.Shah also attacked the Mamata Banerjee government over infiltration from Bangladesh."The TMC can never stop infiltration as it believes in the politics of appeasement. Only the BJP can stop it," he said.The Union home minister claimed that the state government was opposing a CAG audit ordered by the Calcutta High Court into the distribution of relief materials after Cyclone Amphan because there was theft of ration after the disaster.He said that the TMC is lending support to the ongoing farmers' protest but it is not ready to provide them with Rs 6,000 available from the PM-KISAN Samman Nidhi scheme."Twenty-three lakh farmers of Bengal have requested online for PM-KISAN Samman Nidhi. Mamata di prevents them from getting it by not giving them actual certification. She is not even sending a list of farmers to the Centre," Shah said.The senior BJP leader also slammed the TMC for the low economic growth in the state."Bengal had a chunk of one-third of India's entire GDP when the country got independence. Today, it has reduced to minimalistic levels after three decades of Communist rule and one decade of TMC rule," he said."Bengal's per-person income was nearly double of Maharashtra's in 1960, but now it is not even half of India's business capital. Who's responsible for this?" Shah said.The TMC is only worried about its nephew, Shah said.PTI JTR PNTNNNN12202257NNNN||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-has-right-to-summon-officers-caa-rules-to-be-framed-after-covid-vaccination-starts-shah-187141

Previous five rounds of formal talks between the government and 40 farmer unions have failed to break the deadlock with the farmers insisting on repeal of the Centre's three laws and camping at various border points of Delhi for over three weeks now.The government intends to convene the next meeting at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi for resolving the issue so that the ongoing protests end at the earliest, Aggarwal said.He said the Centre is making all efforts to find appropriate solution to resolve all the issues raised by the farmers with an open mind.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana, UP and some other states are protesting against the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the mandi system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.
