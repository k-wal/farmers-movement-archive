23-05-2020||New Delhi||Media one of the most adversely affected sectors due to COVID-19: PHDCCI report||Media has been one of the most adversely affected sectors due to the COVID-19 pandemic with a significant decline in advertisement revenues, a research report of the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) said on Saturday.The report was submitted to Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar, by Dr D K Aggarwal, president; Sanjay Aggarwal, senior vice-president; Mukesh Gupta, chairman — Media and Entertainment Committee, PHDCCI.Media had been one of the most badly affected sectors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the report said.“The print media has lost significantly in circulation and also suffered huge advertisement revenue loss. Electronic media also lost heavily in advertisement revenues, the outdoor media got all orders cancelled owing to no traffic on roads due to lockdown and the events business drew a blank as there were no events allowed in this period,” the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry said in the report titled “Outlook of Media and Entertainment Industry in the COVID Scenario”.The COVID-19 pandemic had caused mass disruptions to the nation’s economy, its trade, industry and the lives of citizens, the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry said.There was no industry or sector of the economy that had been left unaffected by this wave, it said.PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry appreciated the government for undertaking continuous reform measures to support industry, trade and economy to break free from the grip of COVID-19 crises, said Dr D K Aggarwal, President PHDCCI.COVID-19 had created opportunities and the Chamber urges the minister to undertake immediate reform measures based on the stated recommendations, the PHDCCI statement said.The report suggests that one of the major impacts of COVID-19 on the media and entertainment industry was the instability caused and the downfall in the advertising revenues across all media segments, it said.Radio, television, print, outdoor (OOH) out-of-home media had seen a significant decline in the advertising revenue, said Aggarwal.This falling advertising revenue trends were expected to pose a significant threat to the industry as advertising was a prime source of revenue for the media, the PHDCCI said.“We urge the government to make a conscious effort towards ensuring full utilisation of its annual advertising budget in the respective financial year. This deliberate move will help the government receive its due credit by effectively publicising the numerous effective and efficient reforms and initiatives undertaken by the government towards nation-building and at the same time will also ensure that the media sail through these tough times with inflows of revenue,” said Gupta.The PSUs, corporates and industry stakeholders should also make a conscious connect with their consumers by reaching out to them through effective advertising campaigns.“We urge the government to direct all other ministries, DAVP, state governments, PSUs to clear all outstanding payments of the entire media industry, which is a significantly large amount,” Aggarwal said.This move would provide the much-needed relief to the industry, which had played a pivotal role in creating jobs and spreading awareness during the crisis of COVID-19, and yet had been grappling with cash crunch and are unable to pay the salaries to their employees, who have been the frontline warriors, he said.As a goodwill gesture and keeping the importance of the media industry’s role in these critical times, the development of economy as well as socio-political fields, the government must pay salaries for the lockdown period for those employees of media who are registered with the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation, Aggarwal said.“While the media and entertainment sector is currently grappling with various challenging issues, with the economic activities returning to normalcy, we are assured that eventually with the allowance of 100 per cent FDI in the media and entertainment industry and effective hand holding by the government, the industry will bounce back and continue to provide to each citizen the much-needed information and entertainment,” he said.

Migrant workers from UPA-ruled Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Maharashtra were not allowed even to return to their native villages," said BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao.Rahul Gandhi has been "indulging in camera politics".He is visiting and speaking to migrants in non-Congress ruled state not with the intention of giving them relief but to indulge in politics of misery, he added.The attack from the BJP on the former Congress president came on a day the opposition party released a documentary film on Rahul Gandhi's interaction with a group of migrant labourers last week.Also read: If Covid won’t get us, hunger will, migrants say in video shared by Rahul GandhiThe Rajya Sabha MP said Gandhi would have heard the woes of migrants in Rajasthan had he ventured there."Alas, Rahul is only interested in politics and not helping migrants. With the entire Gandhi family indulging in politics over migrants, the Congress party is seen by the public as a party fishing in troubled waters and not as a responsible party joining the national effort in mitigating distress of migrants," said Rao.  The Congress has been critical of the handling of migrants issue by the BJP-led Central Government.Rahul Gandhi has demanded justice for such workers who are walking hundreds of kilometres to their homes amid the coronavirus lockdown.At the end of the documentary, Gandhi says the government should immediately give Rs 7,500 to the 13 crore needy families through direct cash transfer.

As a counterpoise to China’s ‘One Belt One Road’ initiative, the US is promoting the ‘Blue Dot’ initiative which was mentioned by US President Donald Trump during his India visit at the end of February.Under this initiative, projects blue-ticked on parameters such as environment and financial sustainability besides quality standards will receive financial and technical handholding by American institutions and firms. The US anticipates direct investment of nearly $1 trillion in the Indo-Pacific region.The paper, however, states that the approach was not premised on determining a particular end state for China.“Rather, our goal is to protect US vital national interests”, including protecting the American people, promoting American prosperity, preserving peace through strength and advancing American influence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-sees-role-for-india-to-reverse-chinas-behaviour-88937

Had the Congress dispensations made arrangements for jobs locally, people would not have been compelled to leave their homes and migrate afar for livelihoods,” Mayawati said.Taking a jibe at the Congress leaders, she said their expression of remorse at the sufferings of the workers and display of videos of their solidarity with them was “sham” and an “act-play”.“It would have been better had they revealed how much they helped the hapless workers materially.”She asked the BJP governments not to follow the example of the Congress, but create avenues for jobs and livelihoods locally for workers, who have returned back to their home states.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mayawati-flays-congress-a-day-after-skipping-opposition-meet-88931

23-05-2020||New Delhi||Future actions to stimulate economy will depend on how COVID crisis pans out: FM||A day after the RBI projected economic contraction for the year 2020-21, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Saturday, said future fiscal policy actions to stimulate the economy would depend on how the COVID-19 pandemic pans out.The government has already announced a Rs 20.97-lakh crore economic package, which includes the Reserve Bank’s Rs 8.01-lakh crore worth of liquidity measures till May 17.Sitharaman said making a “realistic assessment” of economic growth would be difficult at this point of time as there was no clarity on when the pandemic would retreat.“I’m not closing the door at all. I want to keep getting inputs from industry, implement what we have announced and depending on how things pan out we have to respond accordingly. We are only 2-month old in this year, we have 10 months to go,” Sitharaman said in a conversation with BJP leader Nalin Kohli.The Reserve Bank, on Friday, said the impact of COVID-19 was more severe than anticipated and the GDP growth during 2020-21 was likely to remain in the negative territory.It projected some pick-up in growth impulses from the second half (October-March) of 2020-21 onwards.Last week, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced an economic packages in five tranches, which included a Rs 3.70-lakh crore support for the MSMEs, Rs 75,000 crore for the NBFCs and Rs 90,000 crore for power distribution companies, free foodgrains to migrant workers, increased allocation for MGNREGA, tax relief to certain sections and Rs 15,000 crore allocated to the healthcare sector to deal with the pandemic.The package was done in consultation with economists, academicians, ex-bankers, ex-finance ministry officials and industry, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, adding the idea was to make available more liquidity in the economy and revive demand.“The package was designed keeping in mind that we are facing a situation which is exceptional and, therefore, whether the contraction is going to be this much or that much, we didn’t have the luxury of data to guess-estimating them. However, the spirit of that thought has been kept in mind that we have to now look at complete contraction and if we have to stimulate the economy keeping that in mind what is that we have to do,” she said. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the approach had been to go through this route of stimulating the economy through companies, institutions, enterprises and businesses all getting assistance by banks or formulations through which businesses restart.“I’m sure the Indian entrepreneurs are also going to come out after they test the waters post the lockdown...We have come with measures which will get more liquidity in the economy, if there is more liquidity in economy people will get money in their hands and that will kick-start economy, bring more demand,” she said.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman further said the government was working to further speed up FDI clearances by administrative departments, providing policy certainty and easing compliance burden for companies.

To declare heat wave, the criteria needs to be met at least in two stations in a meteorological subdivision for at least two consecutive days, says the IMD.An orange alert means ‘be prepared’, in this case for severe heat wave conditions for more than two days or heat wave for four days or more. It means high health concerns for the vulnerable sections, infants, elderly and persons with chronic illness and a warning to avoid exposure to heat, keep cool and hydrated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/imd-predicts-heat-wave-issues-orange-alert-for-northwest-plains-88924

As soon as they give us clearance, we’ll run trains to West Bengal,” he said.Responding to a question on why certain trains were being diverted to longer routes, Yadav said since most of the migrant special trains were terminating in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the Railways had decided to take decongested albeit longer routes to operate these trains.“This method is employed even during normal times to avoid congested routes,” he said. The Railways will run 100 pairs of special trains from June 1.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rlys-to-operate-2-600-shramik-special-trains-in-next-10-days-to-ferry-36-lakh-home-88923

A two-day journey from Mumbai to Gorakpur is likely to take more than three days as the trains take the circuitous routes.Passengers on board the trains say they were not informed of the changed routes nor the time it would take them to reach their destinations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/migrants-panic-after-shramik-trains-to-up-bihar-diverted-via-odisha-88921

Why is he then infusing more liquidity? He should bluntly tell the government ‘Do your duty, take fiscal measures’,” the former finance minister said in a tweet.“Even after RBI’s statement, is the PM or Nirmala Sitharaman lauding themselves for a package that has fiscal stimulus of less than 1 pc of GDP,” he asked.Chidambaram had earlier said the fiscal stimulus package announced by the government is “hopelessly inadequate” given the gravity of the economic crisis.He also trained his guns on the RSS, BJP’s ideological mentor, on Saturday.“RSS should be ashamed of how the government has dragged the economy into negative growth territory,” he said on Twitter.Painting a gloomy picture of the economy, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had on Friday said the impact of COVID-19 is more severe than anticipated and the GDP growth during 2020-21 is likely to remain in the negative territory.The outlook of inflation also remains “highly uncertain”, Das had said while announcing a 40-basis point cut in the repo rate as part of the monetary measures to deal with the current crisis.It is the second sharp cut in the key policy rate in two months. On March 27, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the rate-setting panel of the RBI, had cut the key short-term lending rate by 75 basis points.

23-05-2020||Sundarbans (WB)||‘Everything gone’: People of Sundarbans stare at bleak future||Pronab Biswas, a resident of Kakdwip in Sundarbans, was happy that that his only son—a migrant labourer—had returned from Maharashtra last week and had planned to buy a dinghy to start a fishing business of his own.But the 50-year-old’s plans were blown away on Wednesday by Cyclone Amphan as their home and cattle got swept away and they lost all their lifelong savings.Biswas, who had a family of six to feed, now plans to accompany his son back to Maharashtra in search of livelihood once the coronavirus lockdown is over.“After (cyclone) Aila in 2009, I had moved to Nashik to work as a mason there,” he said. “But as I was getting old, my son replaced me and started working there for the last four years.”“I had saved Rs 10,000 and had planned to start the fishing business of my own with my son once he returns,” Biswas said. “But now everything is gone, my home, my savings, my cattle.” “Two of my daughters are of marriageable age and I need money,” said Biswas, sitting outside a relief camp in the area.Biswas is in touch with the labour supply agency his son used to work for and has requested them to ensure jobs for both both of them once the lockdown ends.With livelihood lost and homes washed away, observers of the Sundarbans region feel the ecologically-fragile region, which has been under stress due to rising sea levels, would witness a migration surge in the months to come.West Bengal Sundarbans Affairs Minister Manturam Pakhira said the region had suffered losses worth thousands of crores and everything had to be rebuilt from scratch.Embankments in the Sundarban delta—a UNESCO world heritage site—were breached as the surge whipped up by the Amphan inundated several kilometres of the islands.“With the infrastructure badly hit, it will take a heavy toll on the livelihood of the people there,” Sugata Hazra, director, school of oceanographic sciences at Jadavpur University, told PTI.“In months to come, all of us will witness huge migration from the Sundarbans region. Whatever was rebuilt after Cyclone Aila, everything has been lost due to Cyclone Amphan,” Hazra said.The sea-level rise in the delta, which is much higher than average global sea-level rise, had also contributed to migration in the region, said Hazra, who had worked extensively on climate change and migration in the Sundarbans for the past several years.According to Disha Foundation director Anjali Borhade, the cyclone would trigger a new wave of migration from the region.“Whenever there is environmental stress, it will disrupt livelihood and create circumstances that will necessitate migration,” Borhade, whose NGO works among migrant workers, told PTI.For around 40 lakh people of the Sundarbans, spread across North 24 Parganas and South 24 Parganas districts, livelihoods like agriculture, fishing and wildlife tourism are the most predominant, apart from being migrant labourers.With paddy fields being flooded with saline water during Cyclone Aila in 2009, thousands of youths and male members of the families were forced to move out of the region in search of better opportunities.“In the last three-four years, several of them had returned and had started a small-time business of their own. As things started looking bright, Amphan served a deadly blow,” said Ramesh Giri, a member of a local NGO that work towards training women in Sundarbans for self-help groups.Those earning their livelihood in the region hardly earn 6,000-7,000 a month, whereas the income goes up to 15,000-20,000 once he moves out to other cities, Giri said.Since the Cyclone Alia, the region sends a large number of labourers to work in various parts of the country.The ecologically fragile Sundarban region, nestled around the world’s largest mangrove forest, is home to the endangered Royal Bengal Tiger. For the residents of the area, the fight for survival with nature and wildlife is a routine affair.According to a study conducted a few years back, one in every five households of Sundarbans has at least a family member who has migrated.“Earlier, our men used to work here. But after Aila, we lost much of our habitat due to the rising sea levels and they had to move to other states,” said Shamima Mondal.“But this cyclone took away our homes,” said Mondal, standing in a queue for food outside a relief camp with a three-month-old infant and a three-year-old son.“We don’t know what would happen next.”  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/everything-gone-people-of-sundarbans-stare-at-bleak-future-88913

He said that the government will be able to facilitate NRIs, who ordinarily reside abroad but are struck in India to return to where they live, much before international air travel is resumed.Talking about the repatriation exercise the minister said that he was able to meet that objective of ensuring Indians who are now living in India but are ordinarily resident abroad, such as in the EU, Canada, the US, Japan and Australia, to return even before international civil aviation opened up through increasing number of Vande Bharat flights.Puri said that foreign nationals who are stranded in India due to the suspension of international air travel have already been returning in the evacuation flights, which are being organised by their respective countries.While responding to a question whether NRIs will be able to return by August or September, the minister said, “We must have a more ambitious goal. Why not start by mid-June or June end or July”.The minister added that if the situation remains predictable, he was confident of starting a good part of international travel, if not all of it, much before August-September.Puri reiterated that domestic passengers who do not have the symptoms of the Covid-19 and have a green status on the Aarogya Setu app need not be quarantined after reaching their destinations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-try-to-restart-international-flights-before-august-hardeep-puri-88902

23-05-2020||Lucknow||UP DM takes initiative to address social boycott of returning workers||As the terror of COVID-19 is threatening to rupture social and family relations in rural Uttar Pradesh by socially boycotting the workers returning to their villages after facing cruel hardships Basti District Magistrate Ashutosh Niranjan is pro-actively attempting to apply the healing touch.A one-minute animated film developed at the district level in the local dialect is widely being used to censure those indulging in such harassment of the returning workers.In the film, a local ‘Hariya’ is seen calling up the village Pradhan informing him in a conspiratorial tone about Lakhan and Kishun who had returned from the city the previous night. “Please see to it as they don’t spread corona in the village”, he whispers to the Pradhan.The village Pradhan severely reprimands the caller: “Buddhi brashta ho gaya hai kya Hariya tumhara? Jo bhi shahar se ayega usko corona hoga ee kaun bola? Afwaah mat failao.” (Are you out of your mind Hariya? Who told you that everyone returning from the city is suffering from corona? Don’t spread rumours”)The Pradhan than enlightens 'Hariya' that for the safety of their families and the villagers both Lakhan and Kishun are quarantined in their homes. They have returned to the village after completing all the formalities prescribed by the government.“Unke baarey mein koi aisa baat hum bardasht nahi karenge, samjhe ke nahi”, (I will not tolerate such talk about them, understand?) the Pradhan sternly warns HariyaA voice over informs that every person returning from other states is being medically screened and asked to follow the instructions of the COVID-19 protocol. For that reason, such discrimination against them is not correct.“Apno ka rakhenge dhyan, carona se rahenge savdhan” (Will take care of our ones and will be on guard against Carona) is the tagline of the public interest advertisement.Speaking to this reporter Basti DM explained why he felt the need to spread awareness against such socially disturbing behaviour.“I am getting phone calls from returning husbands complaining that their wives are not letting them in their homes. Fathers are discriminating against their sons, such behaviour is rampant today.”“I wanted people to know that the disease is contagious but is curable and only a minuscule minority develop complications. Under such circumstances, the social boycott of the victim may make things worse”, he pointed out.According to him, Basti’s district-level grass-root workers are going around spreading this message in order to prevent a permanent rupture in social and family relations that may continue beyond the pandemic.The animated film was made using indigenous talent. Niranjan said that there were several persons employed in the district primary education department who were IT technology savvy and helped in making the film.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-dm-takes-initiative-to-address-social-boycott-of-returning-workers-88897
23-05-2020||Kolkata||COVID-19 cases to peak in India between June 21-28: Study||India may witness COVID-19 cases peaking between June 21 and 28 with maximum daily positive cases to be around 7,000-7,500 in this period, a study by a team of researchers said.The study has predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases reported daily will show a rising graph till the end of June.“A clear downward trend in the confirmed cases is likely to be observed each day from the second week of July,” Nandadulal Bairagi, a senior professor of Jadavpur University who was involved in the project told PTI.With measures in place and increased testing, a gradual flattening of the trajectory is expected within October, the researcher said.The study was conducted by Bairagi, Professor and Coordinator Centre for Mathematical Biology and Ecology (CMBE), Jadavpur University, and five other researchers.The study, based on a mathematical model approved by the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) of the Government of India, used deep machine learning algorithms along with a mathematical model for analysing and forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic in India with data being taken from the https://www.covid19india.org/state website.“We divided the population of a designated geographical area into seven compartments based on the epidemiological class of Covid-19 and WHO prescribed minimum requirements of infection prevention and control (IPC) strategy to reduce transmission,” he said.Bairagi said, the total number of infected persons since the outbreak of coronavirus in the country “will touch the five lakh figure in first week of October and it will then start showing a perceptible declining trend.”      One of the factors for this high number could be a large number of asymptomatic persons roaming around with each having the potential to transmit the infection to two-three more persons“Just think of it. The contamination was contained after 76 days of lockdown in Wuhan, the origin point of the coronavirus pandemic. But we in India are witnessing a spike in active cases despite the lockdown nearing two months in few days time,” he said.In the absence of any specific drug and vaccine, India must continue its nationwide lockdown to prevent person-to-person transmission of coronavirus while looking for ways to start economic activities, the senior researcher said.“Public transport must be avoided due to difficulties in contact tracing, random testing has to be increased and time for diagnosis has to be reduced for early detection....”         “We have recommended to the government that lockdown may be partially withdrawn in green and orange zones after the last week of June, but it must be continued in red-zone regions of the states concerned. Strict surveillance must be continued after partial withdrawal of lockdown to avoid the second wave of COVID-19,” he said.Asked about their observation on difficulty in contact tracing in case of contamination in public transport, he explained, “In a hospital or similar place where the persons who have contacted the infection can be traced, you can trace the origin and quarantine every body else who came in touch with the primary contact.”But in a bus or train, there can be many asymptomatic persons who will spread the infection and then get down at their stoppages, he said.Apart from Bairagi, CMBE researcher Abhijit Majumder, Dr. Debadatta Adak of MBB University, Agartala, Dr. Tapas Kumar Bala of Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Kusumdevi Sundarlal Dugar Jain Dental College and Hospital, Dr Abhijit Paul and Dr Samrat Chatterjee of Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad were involved in the research.The interim report of the research has already been sent to the SERB, he said.

23-05-2020||Kolkata||Super cyclone: Death toll rises to 85 in W Bengal; protests over power, water supply||The death toll due to Cyclone 'Amphan' in West Bengal has risen to 85, as angry Kolkatans resorted to protest and road blockades in various parts of the city over the administration’s failure to restore normalcy even after three days.With normal life thrown out of gear by the region’s worst weather disasters, the authorities scrambled in various parts of the state to restore normalcy.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is likely to visit cyclone-hit South 24 Parganas district on Saturday and take stock of the situation.Lakhs of people were rendered homeless as super cyclone cut a path of destruction through half-a-dozen districts of the state on Wednesday, flattening houses, uprooting thousands of trees and swamping low-lying areas.According to official sources, around 1.5 crore people of the state have been directly affected and more than 10 lakh houses destroyed due to the cyclone.Although electricity and mobile connection were restored in some parts of Kolkata, and North and South 24 Parganas districts, many areas continued to remain in darkness as power poles had been blown away and communication lines snapped.Several roads and houses in Kolkata, Howrah, and North and South 24 Parganas districts continue to remain waterlogged, as hapless citizens came out on the streets against the administration’s “apathy and ineffectiveness”.People in various parts of Kolkata staged protests and blockades since Friday night demanding immediate resumption of power and water supply, three days after Amphan ravaged the state.Firhad Hakim, chairman of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation board of administrators, assured the people that normalcy would be restored in a week, as government officials were working round the clock to improve the situation.“More than 5,000 trees have been uprooted. We have already cleared several roads,” Hakim said. “We are in touch with the private power supply provider and had asked them to restore supply as early as possible.”  In Kakdwip area of South 24 Parganas district, people complained that they were not given enough tarpaulin sheets to cover the roofs of houses damaged by the cyclone.In Hingalganj block of North 24 Parganas, people claimed they were running out of food, as shops in the vicinity were yet to lift shutters in the aftermath of the calamity.“The entire area is underwater and we are out of food for the last three days. We are yet to get any relief,” said Geeta Mahali, a resident of the area.Several relief camps have come up in the districts, where hapless people have queued up for two squares of meal and shelter after their homes being either blown or washed away.Teams of the National Disaster Response Force and the State Disaster Relief Force have been working on a war-footing to clear the roads blocked by the uprooted trees.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had flown down to Kolkata on Friday and undertook an aerial survey of the cyclone-hit areas along with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.Lauding the efforts of the state government in combating the crisis, Modi announced an advance assistance of Rs 1,000 crore for the state.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/super-cyclone-death-toll-rises-to-85-in-w-bengal-protests-over-power-water-supply-88887
23-05-2020||Chandigarh||New e-tools being developed to trace sources of fake news||With misinformation and disinformation emerging as an issue of increasing concern in the country, the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) is developing new e-tools for tracking and tracing the sources of fake news and fake profiles on social media.The e-tools being envisioned would be able to detect fake profiles and similar profiles across the social media and create social media profiling with detailed metadata of respective user ID so that it can assist law enforcement agencies to trace back the anonymous suspects, an officer familiar with the project said.Set up in 1970 by the Ministry of Home Affairs for modernisation of police forces and evolve contemporary processes and practices in law enforcement, BPRD’s mandate covers research, training, development, analysis and correctional administration.It also engages other research and development organisations, academia and the industry for some of its work or undertaking collaborative projects.The tools would analyze content, posts and comments for offensive text, offensive images and offensive videos across the social media using keywords and indexing trace back to identify the original or proximate profiles that posted the material on the internet.Advanced methods like artificial intelligence and data mining as well as digital forensic tools would also be used to determine whether the content is fake or if an image or video is morphed, edited or tampered with.Tools would also be able to identify the fabricated, morphed or edited portion of the content.Large scale proliferation of the internet and smartphones has led to a spurt in fake profiles on the internet and the use of digital forms of communication for spreading fake news, defaming people or carrying out religious and political propaganda.Some experts have suggested that the problems of disinformation in a society like India might be more sophisticated and more challenging than they are in the West.According to publically available information, the damage caused due to fake news on social media has increased due to the growth of the internet penetration in India, which has risen from 137 million internet users in 2012 to over 600 million in 2019. India is the largest market for WhatsApp, with over 230 million users.According to the police, one of the main problems is of receivers tending to believe anything sent to them over social media due to lack of awareness.The most recent example of the spread of misinformation has been during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with messages when messages relating to incorrect figures, fake official announcements, unverified home remedies and social unrest videos have been in wide circulation.Misinformation and disinformation related to Jammu and Kashmir are also widely prevalent on social media. General elections is another time when a spurt in fake news is witnessed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-e-tools-being-developed-to-trace-sources-of-fake-news-88886

If you can do that for us we would be grateful,” says a woman of the family pointing to a child who had walked more than 100 km from Ambala to Delhi when Gandhi met them last week on Mathura road here.Also read: Rahul Gandhi doing 'politics of misery' over migrants’ issue: BJPEvery member of the migrant household is heard saying they did not receive a rupee in their bank accounts despite promises of cash transfers by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Reminiscing demonetisation, a woman migrant said, “He (the PM) takes impromptu decisions and does not think about how the poorest will cope. Our lives have no value. The rich are sitting comfortably in their homes.”Gandhi, who arranged to send the family to Jhansi and provided for rations to help them start afresh back in UP, is heard saying at the end of the documentary, “Migrants are the bedrock of Indian economy. Each one of them deserves justice and Rs 7,500 should be put into their accounts urgently, now.”The migrants in the video are heard alleging that people in Haryana beat them up to force them to stay inside homes every time they tried to get out for sustenance and hoped to find a way back home.“The police were of course there but even people would beat us up the moment we got out of our houses. There was nothing we could do. With no knowledge of timelines of lockdowns, we had to take the harsh decision to walk home no matter how hard the journey. We told ourselves — let’s start and we will see what happens along the way,” a migrant says.Many migrants walking back home have died on train tracks, some mowed down by heavy vehicles, some simply died of hunger as states where they worked dithered on arranging lockdown sustenance measures forcing poor labourers to return home.Lakhs of migrants are currently undertaking reverse journeys from urban to rural areas as they fight the COVID lockdown consequences.One of them in the video posted by Gandhi breaks down as he says, “If COVID won’t get us, hunger will.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/if-covid-wont-get-us-hunger-will-migrants-say-in-video-shared-by-rahul-gandhi-88879

Ivanka Trump receives backlash on Bihar girl carrying ailing father post||US President Donald Trump's daughter and senior White House adviser Ivanka Trump has praised 15-year-old Jyoti Kumari, who cycled down 1200 km carrying her ailing father during the nationwide lockdown in India, terming her act as a "beautiful feat of endurance and love".Ivanka's post generates a huge buzz online. Tweeple aggressively commented against the tweet. Several requested her "not to glorify poverty", and called the tweet "insensitive".   Stuck in Gurugram in Haryana due to the COVID-19-induced travel restrictions and lockdown, a tenacious Jyoti asked her father to sit on the rear side carrier of her cycle and took him to his native place in Bihar, covering 1200 km in seven days.Ivanka took to Twitter on Friday to highlight the story of the Indian girl, a class eight student, whose journey has become an extensive talking point even on social media where there has been talk about whether she has it in her to pursue cycling as a career."15 yr old Jyoti Kumari, carried her wounded father to their home village on the back of her bicycle covering +1,200 km over 7 days."This beautiful feat of endurance & love has captured the imagination of the Indian people and the cycling federation!" Ivanka said in a tweet.Ivanka, who is advisor to President Trump on job creation, has visited India twice, most recently in February this year along with her father. In 2017, she led the US delegation at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in India.Impressed with the doggedness with which Kumari pedalled her way to Bihar from Gurugram, carrying her ailing father, the Cycling Federation of India (CFI) will invite Kumari to appear for a trial next month, in what could be a life-changing opportunity.15 yr old Jyoti Kumari, carried her wounded father to their home village on the back of her bicycle covering +1,200 km over 7 days. This beautiful feat of endurance & love has captured the imagination of the Indian people and the cycling federation!🇮🇳 https://t.co/uOgXkHzBPz  CFI Chairman Onkar Singh recently told PTI that if Kumari passed the trial, she will be selected as a trainee at the state-of-the-art National Cycling Academy at the IGI Stadium complex here. Jyoti's father, Mohan Paswan, an autorickshaw driver in Gurgaon got injured and the lockdown left him without any source of income. He had to return the autorickshaw to the owner.The father and daughter duo started their journey from Gurgaon on May 10 after buying a cycle with whatever money they had and reached their village on May 16.Netizens reacted to Ivanka's Tweet. The rich see Romanticism in a poor's misery.  Cycle federation? Can you be anymore insensitive?  This wasn't beutiful, it shows that govt doesn't care for the poor and underprivileged. Don't romanticize poverty.  Nobody deserve this!She is poorThis is purely insult.  Cycling federation??? In India poor constitute Cycling federation.  She was just praising the love of daughter for her father. At 15 years of age she has show so much courage and bravery. It's not required to find flaws in everything..  Please , don't glorify the poverty.This is not something to be proud of.

The OCI card gives them a visa-free travel to India.On Friday, the central government allowed certain categories of OCI card holders, who are stranded abroad, to come to the country. Earlier, according to the regulations issued by the Indian government in April, visas of foreign nationals and OCI cards were suspended as part of the new international travel restrictions following the COVID-19 pandemic.This privilege of visa free travel to India was causing distress among a large number of people of Indian-origin and Indian citizens in countries like the US whose children were OCI card holders as they were born in this country.Many Indian parents, several of whom lost their jobs as a result of the economic crisis due to coronavirus pandemic, but were not allowed to take the special evacuation flights of Air India from various US cities, took to social media and urged the Indian leaders to allow them to travel to India.“This is a big relief for the OCI card holders. It was a humanitarian crisis in the making. I am pleased that the Indian Government listened to their voices,” said social activist Prem Bhandari, chairman of Jaipur Foot USA, who has been taking up the cause of the OCI card holders.“(This is a) much needed relaxation to the distressed parents with minors having OCI need to travel back home,” said Geeta Somani.In a family of four, her six-year-old daughter is a OCI card holder and rest are Indian citizens and their US visa is about to expire. But they were not able to travel because of the previous travel restrictions for the OCI card holders. Now they are planning to travel back home.“Many thanks to all of you and the Government of India for understanding our concern,” said a person named Rajesh.Bhandari who for the past few weeks had launched a relentless campaign for the Indian Government to reverse its recent OCI order, said voices of overseas Indians were humanely considered by its leaders, “right from” the top Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan.Flooded with questions on the OCI card issue, Muraleedharan during a webinar last week organised by Federation of Indian Americans (FIA) and Bihar Jharkhand Association of North America (BJANA), assured Indian Americans that the government will soon take a decision.During the webinar, after listening to their concerns, top RSS leader Dr Krishna Gopal “had assured us that he will take up the matter with appropriate authorities in India,” Bhandari said adding efforts made by every-one from inside and outside India helped resolve this emerging humanitarian crisis.“This is great news for the diaspora in need,” said Ranjeet Singh Champawat. “Today is such a great day. The Government of India resolves the big concern for OCI holders,” said Alok Kumar, former FIA president.“Good news for OCI Card holders.... Multiple-entry lifelong visa facility granted to Overseas Citizen of India card holders restored for minor children of Indian nationals abroad and holding OCI cards,” tweeted Oxomiya Jiyori. “Good News for OCI card holders,” said Sunanda Sondhi.At the same time, a number of OCI card holders on Friday sought further relaxation. “Please include OCI kids of OCI parents and parents living in India. It would be a nominal number in the scheme of things,” urged Sunil Kumar. “I am an OCI card holder living in India from 2008 and my son is an OCI card holder stuck in the USA,” he wrote.“Request you to please allow OCI students of OCI parents residing in India for almost 16 years,” urged Uma Sitaraman.

23-05-2020||Yash GoyalOur CorrespondentJaipur||Co-existence of coronavirus with bacterial pathogen a major cause of fatalities||COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. This deadly RNA-virus is taking a toll on millions of lives across the world, since it crept into China in November-December last year, but more so when it co-exists with a bacterial pathogen 'Chlamydia pneumonia', the otherwise, highly infectious, but simple flu-like illness becomes life-threatening.This 'Chlamydia pneumonia' is present in several heart patients, and around 10 per cent of the general population in the dormant stage. When COVID-19 attacks a person— breaking the immunity quotient—a process of blood coagulation initiates in pulmonary arteries leading to a cardiac arrest or Hypoxia in which the patient succumbs to the dual diseases. Whether the SARS CoV-2 claims a life in association with a dormant 'Chlamydia pneumonia'? This is a big question mark in medical science. This project is a new 'hypothesis' too, Dr Jaideep Dogra, MD and in-charge of CGHS in Jaipur and Dr Luvdeep Dogra, DM-F Nephrology at Osmania University said.  Researching 'Chlamydia pneumonia' for over two years on heart patients in Rajasthan, Dr Jaideep also published a paper in the International Journal of General Medicine."Eighty-five per cent of Covid-19 patients having normal Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) symptoms get treated, while 10-15 per cent of patients develops sudden breathlessness and land in an emergency. In such patients, C.penumoniae probably gets activated when COVID-19 breaks down the patient's immunity. This bacterial pathogen has a tendency, it gets activated, causes arterial thrombo (coagulopathy)", they said.Quoting a postmortem study on COVID-19 victims done by Italy, they said: "Autopsy studies on 38 subjects from two hospitals in Italy who died of COVID-19 were systematically analysed. A relevant finding of the presence of platelet-fibrin-thrombosis in small pulmonary arteries, which fits into the clinical context of a ‘Coagulopathy’ was present in a majority of these patients (86.8%, 33 out of 38). And, this was the turning point in the management of COVID 19"."Similarly, 'Happy hypoxia' of COVID-19 disease in which young patients succumb suddenly as their hypoxia goes unnoticed can be explained by the autopsy reports from young soldiers of Korean War and Vietnam War reporting an incidence of 45-77% of Coronary atherosclerosis in the mean age group of 26 years. This indirectly co-relates with the known observation that chlamydia pneumonia is present in young populations too", they hypothesized."However, why only 10-15% of patients develop sudden breathlessness and land in the emergency room is still an unsolved puzzle. Moreover, while on positive pressure ventilation the condition of these patients paradoxically worsened. While those who got simple non-invasive oxygen delivery did show recovery. We may argue that the ventilated patients were inherently sicker but then is there something beyond that too?", they explained. "Evidence has been accumulating on the role of Chlamydia pneumoniae-a species of Gram-negative obligate intracellular pathogen (the link between virus and bacteria) which causes a spectrum of lower and upper respiratory tract infection in humans and has been implicated in etiology/ pathogenesis of artery blockage", the duo said.A widely used anti-bacterial drug Azithromycin for COVID-19 patients is giving positive results, doctors assume it is controlling the virus, but this may be a wrong notion, Dogras said, adding, Azithromycin has been used for 'Chlamydia pneumonia' for long.  Hence, the action of this anti-bacterial drug may lie in not curing a deadly virus (SARS CoV 2), but killing Chlamydia and preventing the mortality associated with the disease, they opined."If Azithromycin is administered in early stages of Corona infection in the optimum doses, the mortality risks of this dreaded disease may be minimised", they further stressed.The two medical professionals are planning to send their 'hypothesis' to an American institution for further research on evaluation and trials of these two medical facts, they hinted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/co-existence-of-coronavirus-with-bacterial-pathogen-a-major-cause-of-fatalities-88867

23-05-2020||New Delhi||India’s COVID-19 tally nears 1.3 lakh; nearly 94k new cases since May 1||The nationwide tally of COVID-19 cases neared 1.3 lakh on Saturday with over 6,000 new cases getting detected. More than one lakh people have tested positive for the deadly virus infection and over 3,000 have lost their lives in the past one month itself.The spike in the numbers has been sharp this week with nearly 5,500 new cases and 160 deaths getting reported on an average every day, according to data of different states and union territories, many of whom have found a large number of new cases among people having returned from other states in special trains and buses being run for taking migrant workers and students to their native places.Sikkim reported its first COVID-19 case as a 25-year-old student who recently returned from Delhi tested positive for the virus, a senior official said. The first case was detected in India on January 30, but Sikkim had managed to stay free of it so far.States have also reported positive cases among people who have returned from abroad in special flights being operated to bring back stranded Indians and expatriates from various countries. Some have already flagged potential risks from the scheduled resumption of domestic flights for the general public from Monday.Union Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said few states wanted the resumption of flights to be delayed, but “some hesitation” was expected while dealing with such a situation and the Centre would try to address their concerns. He also said a good percentage of international passenger flights should resume before August.In its morning update, the Union Health Ministry said the total number of confirmed cases has reached 1,25,101 with the biggest 24-hour spike of 6,654 new cases since Friday 8 am, while 137 more fatalities have been reported in this time period to take the death toll to 3,720.However, a PTI tally of figures announced by states and UTs, as of 9.25 pm, put the nationwide tally of confirmed cases higher at 1,28,840 and the death toll at 3,782. It also showed nearly 54,000 having recovered, leaving the count of active cases at more than 71,000.India is the 11th most affected country right now, but its tally of active cases exceeds those of some top-10 countries, including Spain, Italy, Germany, Turkey and Iran. Also, given its high daily average of past few days, India is fast approaching the overall tally of Iran, which is the tenth most affected in the world at present with nearly 1.33 lakh cases.More than 52 lakh people have tested positive worldwide for the novel coronavirus ever since its emergence in China last December, while over 3.38 lakh have lost their lives. More than 20 lakh people have recovered globally so far.New cases dropped to zero in China on Saturday, though a re-emergence of the outbreak has been seen in various countries in recent weeks after lifting of their lockdowns.A nationwide lockdown has been in place in India since March 25 and will continue at least till May 31, though several relaxations have been given in the ongoing fourth phase that began earlier this week on May 18. Besides, domestic flights are also scheduled to resume in a phased manner from Monday.The COVID-19 data, in the meantime, showed that nearly 94,000 new cases have been detected and over 2,600 deaths have been reported since May 1, when the morning update of the Health Ministry had put the number of cases at about 35,000 and deaths at 1,147.Also, more than one lakh new cases and over 3,000 fatalities have been reported in the past one month since April 24, when India’s COVID-19 tally stood at around 23,500 and the death toll was 723.While Maharashtra has been the worst-hit state, Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are among other badly-affected places.Maharashtra recorded 2,608 new coronavirus cases and 60 deaths on Saturday, taking its total count of cases to 47,190 and the death toll to 1,577. At least 18 police personnel, including an officer, have died of COVID-19 in the state so far.In the national capital, 591 fresh cases were recorded to take its tally to 12,910.

23-05-2020||New Delhi||Can use hydroxychloroquine as preventive medication for asymptomatic Covid patients: ICMR||A revised government advisory on Friday recommended use of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive medication for asymptomatic healthcare workers working in non-COVID-19 hospitals, frontline staff on surveillance duty in containment zones and paramilitary/police personnel involved in coronavirus infection related activities. As was mentioned in the earlier advisory, the drug against the infection is also recommended for all asymptomatic healthcare workers involved in containment and treatment of COVID-19 and household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases.The revised advisory issued by the ICMR, however, cautioned that the intake of the medicine should not instill a sense of false security.The recommendation was made after the Joint Monitoring Group under the Chairmanship of Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) and including representatives from AIIMS, ICMR, National Centre for Disease Control, National Disaster Management Authority, WHO and experts drawn from central government hospitals reviewed the prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the context of expanding it to healthcare and other frontline workers deployed in non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 areas.Three new categories ---all asymptomatic healthcare workers working in non-COVID hospitals/areas of COVID hospitals/blocks, asymptomatic frontline workers such as surveillance workers deployed in containment zones and  paramilitary/police personnel involved in COVID-19 related activities ---have now been included. According to the revised advisory, “at NIV, Pune, the report of the in-vitro testing of HCQ for antiviral efficacy showed reduction of infectivity and log reduction in viral RNA copy of SARs-CoV2”. “The drug is contraindicated in persons with known case of retinopathy, hypersensitivity to HCQ and cardiac rhythm disorders,” it said.The drug is not recommended for prophylaxis in children under 15 years of age and in pregnancy and lactation, the advisory said.Rarely the drug causes cardiovascular side effects such as cardiomyopathy and rhythm (heart rate) disorders, it said."In that situation the drug needs to be discontinued. The drug can rarely cause visual disturbance, including blurring of vision which is usually self-limiting and improves on discontinuation of the drug," the revised advisory said.The drug has to be given under strict medical supervision with an informed  consent, it stated.The National Task force (NTF) for COVID-19 constituted by the ICMR reviewed the use of HCQ for prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection for high risk population based on the emerging evidence on its safety and efficacy. The data on assessment of HCQ prophylaxis among 1,323 healthcare workers indicated mild adverse effects such as nausea (8.9 per cent), abdominal pain (7.3 per cent), vomiting (1.5 per cent), hypoglycemia (1.7 per cent) and cardio-vascular effects (1.9 per cent), the advisory said.However, as per the data from the Pharma covigilance programme of India, there have been 214 reported instances of adverse drug reactions associated with prophylactic HCQ use, it said.Of these, seven were serious individual case safety reports with prolongation of QT interval on ECG in three cases, it added.Highlighting the studies on prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the advisory stated that a retrospective case-control analysis at ICMR has found that there is a significant dose-response relationship between the number of prophylactic doses taken and frequency of occurrence of SARSCoV-2 infection in symptomatic healthcare workers who were tested for coronavirus infection. Another investigation from three central government hospitals in New Delhi indicates that amongst healthcare workers involved in COVID-19 care, those on HCQ prophylaxis were less likely to develop SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to those who were not on it.The benefit was less pronounced in healthcare workers caring for a general patient population. Besides, an observational prospective study of 334 healthcare workers at AIIMS, out of which 248 took HCQ prophylaxis in New Delhi also showed that those taking HCQ prophylaxis had lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection than those not taking it. According to the advisory, the drug has to be given only on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner and it is advised to consult with a physician for any adverse event or potential drug interaction before initiation of medication, it said.Front line workers should use PPEs in accordance with the guidelines issued by the health ministry and they should be advised to consult their physician (within their hospital/surveillance team/security organisation) for any adverse event or potential drug interaction before initiation of medication, the advisory said.If anyone becomes symptomatic while on prophylaxis, he/she should immediately contact the health facility, get tested as per national guidelines and follow the standard treatment protocol, it said.Apart from the symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough, breathing difficulty), if the person on chemoprophylaxis develops any other symptoms, he should immediately seek medical treatment from the prescribing  medical practitioner, it said. All asymptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed cases should remain in home quarantine as per the national guidelines, even if they are on prophylactic therapy, the advisory added. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/can-use-hydroxychloroquine-as-preventive-medication-for-asymptomatic-covid-patients-icmr-88856

It remains to be seen if Pakistan will rise above its narrow-minded approach, as was seen in the case of India’s regional initiative for dealing with Covid and come forward with cooperation on coordinated desert locust control operation with India,” they said.In India, more adult groups and small swarms have arrived from Pakistan in past weeks and reached Jodhpur.“Along with energising existing institutionalised mechanism of Locust Warning Organisation, India offered to supply pesticide to Iran to carry out control operations in its Sistan-Balochistan and South Khorasan provinces. To Pakistan we suggested both countries coordinate locust control operation along the border and also offered to facilitate the supply of pesticide malathion,” they added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-awaits-pakistan-word-on-locust-control-88812

23-05-2020||New Delhi||Notice to Centre on PIL seeking ban on ‘Zoom’||The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice to the Centre on a PIL seeking direction to the Centre to ban Zoom app for both government and private use in view of security and privacy concerns.  A Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde asked the Centre to file its response in four weeks. Widely used for video conferencing, Zoom app practised “data hoarding and cyber hoarding” which included the mass storage of personal data of its users and stores cloud recordings, instant messages and files, petitioner Harsh Chugh alleged. Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) — India’s nodal cyber security agency — too had warned about cyber risks involved in using Zoom and many organisations across the world had already banned it, he submitted. “Zoom is reported to have a bug that can be abused intentionally to leak information of users to third parties. The app has been falsely claiming calls are end-to-end encrypted when they are not,” Chugh said in his petition. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/notice-to-centre-on-pil-seeking-ban-on-zoom-88679

Addressing a webinar organised by the Society for Indian Defence Manufacturers, he said a large number of indigenous industry and micro small and medium enterprises would be given opportunity to fulfil the defence needs of the Army. The General said there was a perceptible shift of dependence of the Army from OFBs to private entities in terms of non-core activities and certain type of critical ammunition. He expressed hope that other ammunition varieties, including those that were being imported currently, based on the response of the defence industry, would also be added to the list of items to be manufactured indigenously. He said 80 per cent of the Army's capability development and more than 92 per cent of its sustenance budget was based on indigenous products and services.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/import-ban-not-on-niche-tech-army-vice-chief-88680
23-05-2020||---||Govt has no lockdown exit plan : Sonia||New Delhi, May 22A group of 22 opposition parties led by the Congress held a first virtual meeting today and demanded resumption of Parliament functioning.The parties, in a charter of 11 demands to the Centre, asked for direct cash transfer of Rs 7,500 a month for six months to the accounts of each non-income tax paying family in the country. Sonia Gandhi‘PM package a cruel joke’The PM Rs20 lakh crore relief package is a cruel joke on the people and the government has no exit strategy out of the lockdown.Assembling at the initiative of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, opposition leaders, including NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, DMK’s MK Stalin and Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren, accused the government of usurping state powers and demanded financial package for states to manage Covid.“The government has failed in discharging its responsibilities. Grand announcements have been made but they do nothing meaningful to help the poor. In fact, the government has unabashedly usurped powers vested in the states, undermining the constitutionally guaranteed federal democracy,” a statement from the opposition said after Sonia, in her opening remarks, said the PM relief package was a cruel joke on the people and the government had no exit strategy out of the lockdown.Among 11 opposition demands are distribution of free 10 kg foodgrain to the needy for six months, 200 work days under MGNREGA, free transport of migrants, safe return of Indians abroad, publication of Covid related information, reversal of labour law amendment, procurement of rabi crops at MSP, release of funds for states and unveiling of exit strategy.“Every leader expressed concern that the Centre has usurped powers of states,” Congress media head Randeep Surjewala said later flagging alleged denial of funds to states, and dilution of state powers and civil liberties in the “garb of Covid”.The parties also sought a revised fiscal package.“Successive lockdowns have yielded diminishing returns. The government also stumbled badly on the testing strategy and the import of test kits. Meanwhile, the pandemic continues to take its toll. The economy has been gravely crippled. Every economist of repute had advised an immediate need for a massive fiscal stimulus,” said Sonia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-has-no-lockdown-exit-plan-sonia-88681
