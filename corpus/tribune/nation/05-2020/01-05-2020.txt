Searches for vitamin C, which grew by 40 per cent in 2019, have surged by over 150 per cent in recent weeks, as have queries for herbs with medicinal properties like giloy (380 per cent rise) and Ayurvedic home remedies like Kadha (90 per cent rise).People are also searching for terms like ‘how to pay electric bill online” (180 per cent rise), ‘electricity bill check’ (80 per cent rise), ‘overnight mutual funds’ (411 per cent rise) and ‘mutual funds to invest now’ (249 per cent rise), showing consumers are now relying on online resources to take care of their long- and short-term financial goals.“As people are jolted out of their routines and forced to re-evaluate decisions that previously required little to no thought, we see dramatic shifts in how people search and what they care about. The report provides early insights on how people’s needs and behaviours might evolve as they seek to regain a sense of balance,” Sapna Chadha, Senior Country Marketing Director, Google India and Southeast Asia at Google said.She added that while some of these trends are likely to be temporary, they may begin to see the value of sticking with them even after the pandemic is over as people are forced to adopt new behaviours.

01-05-2020||---||PM asks for re-sizing of budgeted defence expenditure||New Delhi, May 1Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked for re-sizing the budgeted defence expenditure in order to channelise the savings for the acquisition of strategic but expensive defence equipment.In a series of meetings since Thursday, the PM has taken stock of the aerospace and defence, power, civil aviation and the mines and coal sectors besides brainstorming on measures to boost investments.Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur were present at all the five meetings besides line ministers of the subject under discussion.At the meeting on defence, which was also attended by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and other senior officials, the PM wanted India to enter the defence exports market in a big way by pushing into the global defence product value chain.An environment that encourages Indian R&D and intellectual property (IP) rights ownership will encourage ‘Make in India’, said the PM.A press release from the Prime Minister’s Office said other issues that were discussed at the meeting included the procurement processes, offset policies, indigenisation of spares and transfer of technology.On the power sector, the PM emphasised the need for effective enforcement of contracts for attracting private investments.He also discussed improving the viability of distribution companies and timely release of subsidies along with improved governance.Before the lockdown, distribution companies were saddled with nearly Rs 1 lakh crore of debt which would have increased during the lockdown as consumption from the profit-earning industrial sector was nil.The power sector also accounts for Rs 5.4 lakh crore in sticky loans.The government is poised to introduce smart metres and rationalisation of tariff under ‘Uday 2’ scheme to address the issue.In the meeting on civil aviation, discussions were held on generating more revenue and more efficiency at airports and the Civil Aviation Ministry was asked to accelerate the process of handing over six more airports on PPP basis by starting the tender process in three months.The PM wanted the Indian air space to be effectively used in order to reduce the flying time in co-operation with the Department of Military Affairs.The aviation sector, already low on cash reserves, is looking at a bleak future with low foreign as well as domestic passenger traffic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-asks-for-re-sizing-of-budgeted-defence-expenditure-79038
01-05-2020||New Delhi||Labour Party’s new leadership not to raise Kashmir issue in UK||The Indian Foreign Office can breathe easy with the new leadership of the British Labour Party deciding not to raise issues that are divisive for the South Asian community.The new Labour Party leader Keir Starmer met with Labour Friends of India and said that any constitutional issues in India are a matter for the Indian Parliament.Kashmir, he added, is a bilateral issue for India and Pakistan to resolve peacefully and “we must not allow issues of the sub-continent to divide communities here”.The Labour Party’s relations with the Indian-origin community had become strained after it passed an emergency resolution under then leader Jeremy Corbyn in November last year, criticising India’s actions on Kashmir.The resolution also called for right to self-determination for the Kashmiris and access to international monitors in the Valley to independently judge the situation.Ian Lavery, chair of the Labour Party, subsequently issued a letter clarifying the party’s position.He described Kashmir as a bilateral issue for India and Pakistan to resolve, and confirmed that Labour is opposed to external interference.But the relationship underwent further strains after the Labour Party did not increase the Indian representation from its ultra safe seats from one to two.The differences appear to have been ironed out after Starmer’s meeting with executive team of Labour Friends of India (LFIN) earlier this week where he also described the Labour Party as an internationalist party that “stands for the defence of human rights everywhere”.The statement indicates that while the Labour Party might eschew radical statements on the matter, it will still keep an eye on the human rights situation in Kashmir.Indians account for 2.3 per cent of the British population but are the country’s largest ethnic minority group. In Britain’s ultra-micro electoral constituencies, the Indian vote is a decisive swing factor in several constituencies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/labour-partys-new-leadership-not-to-raise-kashmir-issue-in-uk-79037

01-05-2020||Shubhadeep Choudhury                                                                     ||Police hires ‘dacoit’ to stop people from spitting at public places||Tribune News Service Kolkata, May 1At a time when two Bollywood heroes have exited the world one after the other much to the grief of the film loving public, a long-gone Bollywood villain is making a comeback! Gabbar Singh, played by the late Amjad Khan in the cult classic ‘Sholay’, keeps making appearances in various forms in West Bengal to create awareness about fighting the dreaded novel coronavirus.Gabbar, being a dacoit, was on the other side of law. However, the Kolkata Police – the keeper of law in the eastern metropolis – have knocked his door in their search for a popular character to discourage people from spitting at public places.A Kolkata Police cartoon released today show Gabbar spitting on the ground unrepentantly, even as his three adversaries – Jai, Veeru and Thakursaab – were frowning at him.In ‘Sholay’ (1975) – a Hindi remake of Akira Kurosawa’s classic ‘Seven Samurai’ (1954) – Gabbar was shown addicted to chewing tobacco – a habit that entails frequent spitting. Gabbar most famously spat when Jai and Veeru – the two ‘samurais’ hired by Thakur to avenge the slaying of his family members by Gabbar – were left to his mercy during a raid on Ramgarh village by him on the day of Holi.The Bengali movie industry too has produced many hit films over the years. But Kolkata Police had to borrow a character from Bollywood for making an effective advertisement against spitting in public places.“We could not zero in on any Bengali film character who spat frequently in a movie”, sheepishly explained a police officer when confronted with the question.Saptarshi Biswas, an award-winning poet, however, says that the use of Gabbar in the cartoon shows that the character has made a greater impression on the people of Bengal than any character in a Bengali film.“Maghanlal Meghraj (played by late Utpal Dutt), the villain in Satyajit Ray’s movie ‘Jai Baba Felunath’, could have perhaps also made an equally strong appeal to Bengalis. But, I don’t remember Maganlal spitting in the movie”, Biswas said.Earlier, a theatre group in Raiganj near Siliguri in Wet Bengal used the character of Gabbar in street plays to underscore the importance of social distancing and keeping indoors to avoid contracting Covid-19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/police-hires-dacoit-to-stop-people-from-spitting-at-public-places-79029

All necessary precautions such as prior screening of passengers, maintaining social distancing at station and in the train were followed,” the railways spokesperson said.The spokesperson for the South Central Railway said that all passengers were thermal screened at the station, masks were mandatory and food has been provided on board as the train will have no halts. For social distancing measures, it has allowed only 54 passengers per coach which has a capacity of 72. In coupes, six passengers have been allowed instead of eight, he added.On arrival all the migrants will be taken to a quarantine facility. Other states such as Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Bihar, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Telangana have requested the Union Railway Ministry to run special trains to ferry migrant workers back to their home states.The spokesperson said resumption of normal services was unlikely to take place anytime soon.“It will only happen after the national lockdown is lifted everywhere." The station saw a huge presence of policemen, government officials, managers of companies as the train rolled off the platform at dawn in almost complete secrecy.The workers had reached the station in designated buses during the night and were then provided with food as social distancing was maintained throughout the operation.So far only freight and special parcel trains are running to ensure the supply of essential goods.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/special-train-leaves-hyderabad-with-1-200-migrants-79027
01-05-2020||New Delhi||Newspaper industry could face losses of up to Rs 15,000 cr if relief not provided: INS to govt||The Indian Newspaper Society (INS) has urged the government to provide a strong stimulus package to the newspaper industry which, it said, has lost over Rs 4,000 crore and is likely to suffer further losses of up to Rs 15,000 crore in the next six to seven months, if relief is not provided.In a letter to the Information and Broadcasting Secretary, the INS said the newspaper industry is among the worst affected in India with hardly any revenues coming in from either advertising or circulation amid the nationwide lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.“The newspaper industry has already lost Rs 4000-4500 crore in the last two months. Since economic activity has nearly collapsed and there is no likelihood of advertising from private sector, the losses are expected to continue at the same rate for the next 6-7 months (implying an additional loss of Rs 12,000-15,000 crore over the next 6-7 months) unless a strong stimulus is implemented by the government at the earliest”, the letter signed by INS president Shailesh Gupta said.INS also urged the government to withdraw 5 per cent customs duty on newsprint.The losses already incurred have had very severe repercussions for the 30 lakh workers and staff who are directly and indirectly involved in the newspaper industry—journalists, printers, delivery vendors and many others, said INS, which represents over 800 newspapers.                          According to INS estimates, newspapers provide direct and indirect employment to about nine to 10 lakh people and over 18-20 lakh people, respectively.“For the last several weeks, due to the above severe losses and choking of cash flows, the newspaper establishments are finding it very difficult to even disburse salaries to employees and payments to their vendors,” said the letter dated April 20.“In our various communications we have requested for withdrawal of five per cent customs duty on newsprint. Newsprint cost accounts for 40 to 60 per cent of the total cost for publishers. The removal of the five per cent customs duty on newsprint will have no impact on domestic manufacturers or any ‘Make in India’ efforts,” it said.INS also urged the government to provide two-year tax holiday for newspaper establishments, 50 per cent increase in advertisement rate of Bureau of Outreach and Communication and 100 per cent increase in budget spend for print media.It called for immediate settlement of payment towards all outstanding bills of advertising, from BOC (Directorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity) as well as various state governments.

01-05-2020||Hyderabad||Lockdown blues: Woman walks 130 km to son; father kills daughter||Hardships make people react differently, especially when it comes to taking care of children.In one case, a woman walked 130 kilometres from Nagarkurnool to Hyderabad to meet her son, who was stranded there owing to the lockdown.And in another case, a man slit the throat of his four-year-old daughter in Gongulur village of Sangareddy district because he could not feed her. He has since been arrested.The ongoing crisis during the lockdown has thrown up many situations revealing complex nature of human behaviour in stressful times.Only a few days ago, a burkha-clad woman had travelled 1,400 km on a scooty from Nizamabad in Telangana to Nellore in Andhra Pradesh to bring back her son who was stuck there due to the lockdown.Ramachandramma, mother of a construction worker Ramulu, was stuck in Shaikpet in the city after the government announced lockdown.Since the son called the mother a week ago and told her he was facing some hardship, the mother who lives in Lingala mandal in Nagarkurnool decided to go and check on him.Ramulu received a call from an unknown person asking for his address who also told him that his mother was in the city. Shocked over it, Ramulu gave him his address and two people came to his house to drop Ramachandramma.A jubilant Ramachandramma said that she was worried about her son and unable to reach him on phone.“I left for Hyderabad without informing anyone and stopped at relative’s place in Achampet. I stayed there for a day and started to Hyderabad again resting for a while on the roadside or in villages,” she said.She also said she did not have her son’s address and only had his phone number.“After reaching Chandrayangutta, I did not know where to go and took the help of some persons who tried to call up Ramulu. Since the service to the phone was suspended, they made an online recharge to Ramulu’s number and asked him for address,” she said.The Telangana Police at Chandrayangutta helped Ramachandramma reach her son since all movement was curtailed during the lockdown.While news of the mother’s grit was well received, there was a dampener too.A man identified as Jeevan slit the throat of his daughter Avanthika, the youngest of his three children due to financial constraints.Being a daily wager, he was unable to find work due to the lockdown.Depressed over his financial situation, he killed his daughter when she was asleep.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-blues-woman-walks-130-km-to-son-father-kills-daughter-79023

States are required to purchase electricity from central sector projects, including BBMB, as mandated by agreements with the central government.According to BBMB officials, hydro-electricity is the cheapest source of power and in the days of lower power demand, member states can benefit by reducing purchase of costlier power generated from other sources like thermal plants.BBMB’s primary role in managing irrigation and electricity is the secondary product of its dams. All water being released from BBMB dams at present for irrigation is through the power generation tunnels. Water is being released from dams as per demand from the member states and decisions taken by the technical committee on maintaining the water level in reservoirs.BBMB has an installed capacity of 2918.73 MW—the third largest installed hydro power capacity in India and it also transmits power to the Northern Grid through a widespread network of transmission lines. With its projects lying on the Sutlej and Beas rivers, it has a total of 28 generating units in its six power houses, benefiting five states.After supply to some common pool consumers, balance energy is apportioned amongst the beneficiary states. The Northern Regional Load Dispatch Center, while preparing the drawl schedule of BBMB partners from the central sector projects, adds the scheduled share of partner states from BBMB projects in their respective drawl from the grid.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bbmb-generates-40-per-cent-excess-electricity-amid-lockdown-79022

For decades the area has seen anti Hindu activities,” it added.  “The local MLA belongs to CPM which has a sizeable following in the taluka. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has also a sizeable following in the area and gets support from the Christian missionaries against the parties like BJP and Shiv Sena,” the VHP pointed. Also read: SC seeks status report on Palghar lynching probeAccording to the two senior VHP leaders, “The possibility of involvement of these elements in the mob lynching cannot be ruled out under the circumstances.” “The state government, however, seems to be in a great hurry to explain away the incident on the excuse of a false rumour. As such, it has not ordered any judicial inquiry into the incident. A police officer has been asked to inquire into the matter. Kingpins of murderous mob are still at large,” read the letter.  “In the FIR it has been alleged that the mob lynching was carried out in furtherance of a conspiracy. The state machinery was trying to suppress the truth by giving false excuses. Murder of three innocent persons by armed mob in the presence of policemen is a serious matter but the State of Maharashtra is treating it as just ordinary crime committed due to a misunderstanding,” it added.The VHP claimed that till date main leaders of the murderous mob had not been arrested and efforts were being made to belittle the incident for political considerations and to save the administration from ignominy.“Only departmental action has been initiated against the policemen and no crime has been registered against them despite the fact that in the videos related to the incident the policemen are seen virtually handing over the victims to the mob,” VHP leaders mentioned.“Speedy and impartial investigation of the matter and speedy and efficient prosecution of the case is needed to get the culprits punished as early as possible to restore the confidence of Hindus of the country at large and of the area in particular in the law enforcement agencies," they said.Addressing the RSS cadres recently, Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat had also called it the responsibility of the state government to maintain law and order.“Sanyasis who pray for the wellbeing of humanity were brutally killed in Palghar. What were the police doing? Such an incident should not have happened,” Bhagwat had said.  Two sadhus and the driver of the vehicle they were travelling in were lynched by a mob at Gadchinchale village in Palghar district of Maharashtra on April 16 while they were on their way to attend a funeral in Gujarat.While as per the local administration, the victims were misunderstood as child lifters, VHP said, “Not a single incident of kidnapping was reported from the area and it was not possible that a large number of people would be incensed to the extent of gathering in a mob during the night and mercilessly killing three persons in cold blood under the mistaken belief that they were child lifters.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vhp-writes-to-president-kovind-seeks-probe-in-palghar-incident-79021
01-05-2020||Mumbai||No contest likely as Maharashtra parties agree to get candidates elected unopposed||All the four major parties in Maharashtra have agreed to get their candidates elected unopposed in the elections to the upper house of the state legislature in order to avoid assembling its MLAs in Mumbai, according to sources from the major parties.The Election Commission of India (ECI) had on Friday announced polls to the nine seats in the Maharashtra Legislative Council on May 21.While the Shiv Sena, NCP and the Congress have the numerical strength in the state assembly to get two MLCs elected, the BJP with 105 MLAs is vying for three seats.The number of candidates in the fray is not likely to exceed nine as on May 18, the last date for withdrawal of nominations.“In such a case, all the candidates are likely to be declared elected unopposed thus obviating the need for an election,” says a state government official.The EC announced the elections today after Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari wrote to the body saying the polls should be held before May 28 in order to avoid a constitutional crisis in Maharashtra.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray completes six months in office as on that date and needs to be elected to either house of the state legislature by then.Earlier this week, Thackeray called up Prime Minister Narendra Modi and urged him to step in to avoid a constitutional crisis in Maharashtra when the state is in the midst of tackling the coronavirus.“I hope the uncertainty that was created will end,” Shiv Sena’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut said on Twitter later today.On Thursday, Maharashtra Chief Secretary Ajoy Mehta wrote to the Election Commission that the state government could hold the elections to the council in hygienic conditions by adopting social distancing measures.Mehta also assured the EC that the state government could adhere to other conditions imposed by the EC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-contest-likely-as-maharashtra-parties-agree-to-get-candidates-elected-unopposed-79019

I want to make it clear that we cannot lift the lockdown in red zones like the Mumbai-Pune belt, Kalyan-Dombivlie parts of Nagpur and other areas in the state,” Thackeray said in an online statement today.Thackeray added that the lockdown would be lifted in Maharashtra in a zone-wise manner. “Lockdown will be lifted step-by-step and we will take abundant precautions while doing so,” Thackeray said.While the state government has indicated that economic activities will resume in the areas labelled green zones, Thackeray sounded a note of warning. “Once restrictions are relaxed in some areas, please do not start crowding. Otherwise the rules will have to be made stricter,” Thackeray added.The Chief Minister added that the government aimed to detect cases of people suffering from Covid-19 virus at an early stage. “Babies who are a few days old and 83-year-old people have recovered from the coronavirus and have gone home. Even those who were on ventilators have also recovered. The illness is curable if detected early. Please do not panic,” Thackeray said in his address.So more than 10,000 cases of people testing positive for the virus have been reported from Maharashtra, with most of them from Mumbai, Pune and surrounding areas. The death toll has crossed 400, according to information from the state government.Most of the medium- and small-scale industries in Maharashtra are concentrated in the Mumbai-Pune, Kalyan-Dombivli and Aurangabad areas from where majority of the Covid-19 cases in the state have been reported. All these areas are home to a vast slum population with people living in very congested conditions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-respite-for-mumbai-pune-from-lockdown-as-covid-19-cases-surge-79018
01-05-2020||New Delhi||Sugar production declines; industry expects bulk buying and exports to pick up after lockdown||The sugar production in the country has been less this year largely due to weather conditions, first drought and then floods, in two major sugarcane producing states Maharashtra and KarnatakaThough the COVID-19 lockdown does not appear to have had much effect on the processing by mills, according to industry body ISMA, sales have been affected.Bulk buying by manufacturers of ice creams and confectionery items is also down but ISMA expects the sales as also exports to pick up when the lockdown is over.According to ISMA, sugar mills across the country produced 258.01 lakh tonnes of sugar between October 1, 2019, and April 30, 2020, which is 63.70 lakh tonnes less than 321.71 produced in the same period last year.As compared to 90 sugar mills which were crushing sugarcane on April 30, 2019, 112 sugar mills were crushing sugarcane on April 30, 2020 this year.India’s annual consumption is around 260 LT but there are plenty of stocks available so that’s not really an issue, says ISMA.Compared to last year’s sugar sales in the first five months of the season, the sugar despatches from sugar mills this year was higher by 10.24 LT till February 2020. Due to lockdown, the sugar sales in March and April, 2020, was lower than what was sold last year, by about 10 LT bringing us back to same levels as last year, says ISMA.Sugar mills have reportedly seen an increase in sugar offtake in the last one week or so of April 2020.Further, it is generally expected that sugar demand will increase as soon as the lockdown is withdrawn, especially because of demand from the traders to refill the pipeline, which is almost dry, and also because of the consumption increase coming up due to summer demand for beverages, ice creams, juices etc.The timely reallocation of ethanol by the OMCs to depots in other states like Jharkhand, Bengal, MP, AP, Telengana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Odisha and Assam has ensured that there has not been much disruption and movement of ethanol as per contracts signed between OMCs and ethanol suppliers.In fact, this has given an opportunity to OMCs to test their preparedness in taking ethanol and storing the same in the depots in these states too. It has also allowed us to understand the policies of the state governments towards accepting and giving permissions for moving ethanol to these new locations, which can then be smoothened for better compliance in future, says ISMA.With the objective of assessment of sugarcane availability and crop condition for harvesting in the next crushing season 2020–21, ISMA will obtain satellite images of the sugarcane area across the country in later part of June 2020 to make its preliminary estimates of sugarcane availability and sugar production for 2020-21 season.Meanwhile, UP sugar mills have produced 116.52 LT as on April 30, 2020, 3.72 LT higher than 112.80 LT achieved last year on the corresponding date.  Of 119 mills operating this year, 44 mills have ended crushing. As many as 75 mills are continuing their operations compared to 68 mills as on April 30, 2019. The pace of closure of factories has slowed down a bit during the last fortnight as cane availability increased for crushing in the current season due to premature closure of most of the gur/khandsari units operating in the state.Almost 75% factories have closed in east UP and the remaining are expected to close within 5-8 days. About 30% factories have closed in central UP, and most of the remaining are expected to close in the next 15-20 days.In west UP, three factories have closed so far, some factories are expected to start closing by May 10, whereas several of them may continue till end of this month.In Maharashtra, sugar production till April 30, 2020, was 60.67 LT, compared with 107.15 LT produced last year in the same period, almost 46.5 lakh tonnes less than last year.In the current 2019-20 SS, 143 mills have already closed their crushing operations in the state and only three sugar mills are operating.All the operating sugar mills in Karnataka have closed their crushing operations and have produced 33.82 LT till yesterday.However, few mills might operate in the special season commencing July’ 2020. Last year during the special season, Karnataka mills had produced 1.05 LT.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sugar-production-declines-industry-expects-bulk-buying-and-exports-to-pick-up-after-lockdown-79016

01-05-2020||Aurangabad/Chandigarh||Nanded gurdwara closed, 91 more Punjab pilgrims test positive||Local authorities sealed Nanded’s Hazur Sahib gurdwara on Friday, hours before Punjab reported that 91 more people who returned from the shrine in Maharashtra had tested positive for coronavirus.So far, 197 pilgrims out of the 3,500 brought back from the Maharashtra gurdwara, among the holiest sites in Sikhism, have contracted the infection, according to authorities in Punjab.The returning pilgrims formed the bulk of 105 fresh cases reported in Punjab on Friday.The 197 Nanded pilgrims are a third of the 585 confirmed coronavirus cases reported so far in Punjab. Taking into account the 20 deaths and people who have recovered, they represent about 40 per cent of the “active cases” in the state.In neighbouring Haryana, 18 Nanded pilgrims are in quarantine, officials said.About 4,000 pilgrims from Punjab had remained stranded for about a month at Hazur Sahib gurdwara in Nanded due to the nationwide lockdown to fight the coronavirus pandemic.Gurdwara Langar Sahib on the same premises, which serves food to all visitors, has also been closed, officials said in Nanded.“District and civic officials reached the gurdwara in the morning on Friday and directed that it be closed and the langar service be stopped,” gurdwara superintendent Gurvinder Singh Wadhwa said.The pilgrims heading back to Punjab had made halts at Indore, one of the country’s worst coronavirus-affected cities, Bhilwara and Hanumangarh in Rajasthan, and Bathinda, according to gurdwara functionaries.Baba Balwinder Singh of Langar Sahib said there are still about 175 people from different states in the complex.In a video clip, Akal Takht jathedar Harpreet Singh on Friday claimed there was a conspiracy to “malign” the Sikhs just as the Muslims were after the Tablighi Jamaat episode.The reference by the Amritsar-based jathedar was to the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi in March. Hundreds of people who participated and then returned to their homes across the country had tested positive.“It is being propagated as if Takht Sri Hazur Sahib was the home to coronavirus and these people carried it with them to Punjab,” he alleged.“It is a very big conspiracy,” the jathedar said.He said the pilgrims stayed at the Nanded gurdwara’s “sarai” for over a month, volunteering for the “langar sewa”.“How come they turned coronavirus positive after they reached Punjab? This question comes to the mind of everyone,” the religious leader claimed.Harpreet Singh said there were complaints about the quarantine arrangements made for them and urged Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh to set things right.“A video surfaced in Amritsar where some women are complaining that they are not getting water to drink. Some are being kept in ‘deras’ which is against their sentiments. It appears to be the irresponsibility on the part of the government,” he said.He said the state government should have contacted the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) for arranging the stay and meals for the quarantined pilgrims.Amarinder Singh has asked people not to be worried about the sudden spike in cases, saying most of the new cases are people coming from other states.The state government had already ordered a 21-day quarantine for people coming from outside.

It said, “MoR will issue detailed guidelines for sale of tickets; and for social distancing and other safety measures to be observed at train stations, train platforms and within the trains.”The MHA further noted that the rest of conditions stipulated for movement of persons in its order issued on Thursday will continue to apply to such movements by trains.It is to be noted here that even many state governments, including Bihar, Punjab and Telangana, had also asked the Centre to operate special trains as “Bus journey” as allowed through an MHA order on Thursday would be time consuming and could be suitable only in shorter distance cases only.Officials in the MoR indicated that the Indian Railways is ready with its plan “to operate point-to-point trains” between states with their consent.One-off special train with only general sleeper coaches from Lingampalli (Hyderabad) to Hatia in Jharkhand was chugged off at 4.50 am on Friday on request of the Telangana Government as per the directions of the Ministry of Railways.

01-05-2020||---||SC seeks status report on Palghar lynching probe||New Delhi, May 1The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Maharashtra Government to submit a status report on the probe into the lynching of two sadhus and their driver in Palghar last month.During the hearing conducted via video conferencing, the Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, however, refused to stay the ongoing probe into the crime by the state police.Two saints travelling from Mumbai to Surat were stopped by a mob of over 200 people and killed along with their driver on April 16. The trio allegedly was suspected to be thieves.The Bench, which was hearing a petition seeking a court-monitored probe or a CBI probe into the incident, asked the petitioner, advocate Shashank Shekhar, to give a copy of the petition to the Maharashtra Government counsel and posted the matter for hearing after four weeks.The Bombay High Court is also seized of a petition seeking similar relief.The petitioner accused the police of being complicit in the lynching of Swami Kalpavriksha Giri and Sushil Giri of Juna Akhara, along with their driver Nilesh Telgade.Citing media reports, Shashank Shekhar said there was a breakdown of law and order as the policemen present on the scene of crime remained mute spectators.“The involvement of police in the said lynching not only has shaken the faith of millions in the police forces but has also made it impossible to trust the investigation carried on by the same police officials,” the petitioner submitted.Advocate Shashank Shekhar wondered how police allowed crowd to assemble despite a lockdown being in force due to COVID-19 pandemic.The Maharashtra Government counsel informed the court that the state police CID was probing the case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-seeks-status-report-on-palghar-lynching-probe-78999

01-05-2020||New Delhi||'Significant' increase in cybercrime against women during lockdown: Experts||There has been a significant increase in cybercrime against women, especially sextortion, during the COVID-19-induced lockdown with "caged criminals" targeting them online, say experts.The nationwide lockdown imposed from March 25 to April 14, and then extended to May 3, aims at preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus that has claimed 1,147 lives and infected 35,043 people in the country.According to National Commission for Women (NCW) data, 54 cybercrime complaints were received online in April in comparison to 37 complaints – received online and by post -- in March, and 21 complaints in February.  The panel is taking complaints online due to the lockdown.Cyber experts, however, said the numbers are just the “tip of the iceberg”."We received a total of 412 genuine complaints of cyber abuse from March 25 till April 25. Out of these, as many as 396 complaints were serious ones from women, (and these) ranged from abuse, indecent exposure, unsolicited obscene pictures, threats, malicious emails claiming their account was hacked, ransom demands, blackmail and more," said the founder of the Akancha Foundation, Akancha Srivastava.The organisation works for education and empowerment of people by imparting knowledge on cyber safety.    Srivastava said on an average she has been getting 20-25 such complaints daily, while before the lockdown the number was less than 10 per day. This is a "significant" increase, she said."This is just the frustration and anger that is coming to the fore as there is no other release right now. This is a form of frustration as they (cyber criminals) are caged right now," she said. "Men are morphing images and threatening women. There is a whole racket going on where women are getting these emails that your phone and laptop has been hacked, and if you don't deposit money my account I will send your morphed images, and share it with all your contacts," Srivastava added.Vineet Kumar, founder and president of Cyber Peace Foundation, said specially the cases of “sextortion” have increased during the lockdown. Sextortion is extorting money or sexual favours from someone by threatening to reveal evidence of their sexual activity through means like morphed images."People are getting into relationships online as they are under lockdown and sextortion cases are being reported to us," he said. Kumar said in these times people are connecting through technology but forgetting the security component."Immediately after lockdown, we saw a rise in cases of misinformation, fake news and women getting duped online when they click on malware links which gets all their information on phone, turns on the camera and microphone, and captures their intimate moments. These are then used for blackmailing," he added.Many women do not want to make official complaints in these cases, he said. "Cyber Peace has been receiving complaints through its channels and it has been seen that people are reluctant in filing complaints. They want us to handle things unofficially," Kumar said. "Whatever official figure that is being quoted is just the tip of the iceberg as a majority of women do not report cybercrime because they worry about the social stigma associated with it," he said.Vandana Verma, founder of InfoSec Girls, said when the whole country is locked down, people are working from home and spending a lot of time on the internet. So, even cyber criminals are becoming innovative and craftier in their techniques, she said ."Like sending specific phishing emails or themed emails for the current COVID-19 situation to people and getting their confidential details like address, phone numbers. These emails appear to have come from legitimate sources like the government in the form of advisories when they are not at all related to the government in any form," Verma said."Creation of fake profiles, cyber bullying, online stalking are bigger challenges at this time. Insensitive comments on posts are also intimidating," she said. Verma advised that such cybercrimes can be prevented through education on technology. "How to securely use the digital media, creating strong a password and spreading awareness on phishing emails, fake videos and securely sharing content on the internet can help a lot in safeguarding women," she said.NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma said often it is seen there is lack of awareness among women on where to reach out when something happens."There is cyber police in every district who they can contact. They can reach out to us also if they need help," she said.She advised women to remain careful in the cyber space. "We are talking to women on how to protect themselves in cyber space. We advice women to not share their personal pictures or details on social media as it's not safe.                 Women should realise that at times people known to them can also take advantage," said Verma.CSC e-Governance Services India, which holds the license for providing internet services, recorded an increase in data consumption to 4.7 terabyte (TB) as on March 30 from 2.7 TB on March 10."Based on the growth trend, data consumption on the CSC SPV network is estimated to have increased by close to 100 per cent till date," CSC SPV CEO Dinesh Tyagi told PTI on April 5. He said that a major spike in data consumption has been recorded since the time lockdown started.There are more than 60 crore internet users in India and out of this about 29 crore are in rural areas.

They requested the imam and others not to gather, and asked them to follow the rules on social distancing, the officer said.The team closed a small market that was operating next to the mosque before entering the complex, he said."When the team was about to leave the mosque complex, heavy stone pelting started. This caught our team completely in an off-guard situation," the officer said.Four personnel and the village head received were injured. The police vehicle was also damaged, and the windscreen and side windows were broken.Those injured are Nath, Assam Police constable Karuna Buzarbaruah, CISF personnel Bhumichar Narzary and Saroj Yadav, and village head Abdul Jalil Fareshi. They were immediately sent to a hospital for treatment. Their injuries are not serious, the police said.Senior officials visited the place, which is around 30 km from the district headquarters, late on Thursday night and made announcements in loudspeakers asking people to stay indoors. Heavy police deployment has been made in the village. An FIR has been registered at the Lakhimpur police station against 12 people, including the imam of the mosque, and investigation is underway.When contacted, Lakhimpur Superintendent of Police Rajveer told PTI: "At a time when the entire state is proactively following lockdown norms, such an incident is unwanted and we strongly condemn it. We will take strict actions against the culprits."  Police said a few villagers started offering namaz at the mosque since the holy month of Ramzan began.Village head Abdul Jalil Fareshi and the Village Defence Party told them many times not to visit the mosque and asked them to offer namaz at homes. But nobody listened to him and he was humiliated as well as threatened, another officer said.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-security-personnel-injured-in-stone-pelting-in-assam-78985

01-05-2020||New Delhi||Open up economy in measured way: Raghuram Rajan||Former RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan today said India should open up its economy in a measured way soon to enable people to have jobs and underlined that Rs 65,000 crore should be spent to support the poor during the Covid crisis.In a video conversation with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Rajan said it was all too easy to have a lockdown forever but obviously that was unsustainable for the economy. “We need to open up in a measured way but as fast as possible so that people start having jobs. We do not have the capacity to support people across the spectrum for too long,” Rajan said.On a question from Gandhi about which part of the economy could be opened up, Rajan said, “While trying to bend the curve of infections, we have to start thinking about restarting people’s livelihoods. First, open places where you can maintain distancing, not just at the work places but also distancing to and from the workplace. A lot of work needs to be done both on creating structures, as well as ensuring that the work place is relatively safe.”On opening the lockdown given the country’s limited Covid testing capacity, Rajan said: “We have to be cleverer about opening up. Perhaps do mass testing. Take a mass sample, say 1,000 samples and check if there is any sign of the virus in those mass samples, go deeper.”Rajan answered in the affirmative when Gandhi asked if there was a crisis of centralisation building up.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/open-up-economy-in-measured-way-raghuram-rajan-78706

Expatriates have mentioned that local Indian missions have started collecting data on those willing to return to India.MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastav said the matter was receiving the attention of the government but declined to go into the specifics as it would be “premature to spell out plans”, and consultations and discussions are under way at the highest levels.The MEA acknowledged that in the current situation, Indians stranded all over the world would wish to return and were undergoing inconvenience.It said the social media storm in the Arab world over the Indian media’s targeting of Tablighi Jamaat should not be the sole yardstick to judge India’s relationship with the Gulf countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/help-for-indians-stuck-in-the-gulf-78705

01-05-2020||New Delhi||Government mulls sewage sampling in hotspots||In what could emerge as a critical addition to India’s Covid-19 surveillance modality, the government is mulling the prospects of sewage sampling in certain pockets to rule out the presence of the virus. The possibility is being debated amid emerging evidence of Covid-19 virus being excreted from the human body and being potentially present in sewage.Scientists to evaluateUnion Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday said the prospects of sewage sampling would be presented to scientists for evaluation. If the modality works out, the environmental sampling for Covid-19 detection could be done by India.VK Paul, chairman of one of the 11 Covid-19 empowered groups, said, “Emerging evidence suggesting that the virus is being secreted in human faeces could open the plausibility of virus detection in sewage. A good starting point for us would be to study the presence of the virus in sewage samples in Covid hotspots. We will look at that.”Health Minister Harsh Vardhan also said today the prospects of sewage sampling for the virus would be presented to scientists for evaluation. If the modality works out, the environmental sampling for Covid-19 detection could be done by India.The new thought of environmental surveillance for the virus comes after WHO recently said initial investigations suggested the virus may be present in faeces in some cases. WHO has, however, clarified that there have not been reports yet of faecal-oral transmission of Covid-19 and no evidence to date on the survival of the virus in sewage.The world body, however, in a guideline on water and sanitation practices in the light of Covid-19 said, “Current evidence suggests that infectious Covid-19 virus may be excreted in faeces, regardless of diarrhoea or signs of intestinal infection. Approximately 2 per cent to 27 per cent people with confirmed Covid-19 have diarrhea and several studies have detected Covid-19 viral RNA fragments in the faecal matter of these patients throughout their illness and after recovery.”To date, only one study has cultured the virus from a stool specimen and there have been no reports of faecal-oral transmission.Experts, however, say there is a case for sewage sampling to determine the spread of Covid-19 and rule it out in the environment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/government-mulls-sewage-sampling-in-hotspots-78702

The trend portends negative implications for April that witnessed a complete lockdown throughout, as against March that witnessed a similar situation for just over a week.Figures released by the government said the fall was precipitated by poor performance of crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertiliser, steel, cement and electricity sectors.A press note from the PMO said Modi discussed the development of a scheme promoting “plug and play” infrastructure in existing industrial lands, along with necessary financial support.Infra sector dives into red in MarchThe Modi government had first aired the “plug and play” scheme when Arun Jaitley presented the Budget in 2015. The PM’s renewed call today for developing a new scheme suggests it has not made much headway over the past five years.
