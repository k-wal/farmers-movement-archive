05-05-2020||---||Phase I of evacuation by Air India disappoints north India||New Delhi, May 5The first phase of the operation to evacuate distressed Indians has left many north Indians disappointed as most of the flights are headed for either southern or western states. The naval operation, currently involving two ships, is also focused on bringing back residents of Kerala from the Maldives.On the first day of Air India’s operations, only two of the 10 flights will be headed to north Indian destinations — one from Dhaka to Srinagar, and the other from Kuala Lumpur to New Delhi. On day two, one flight will land at Delhi from Kuala Lumpur while the other eight will go to southern and western India.Of the nine flights the next day, there will be one flight from Riyadh to Delhi and another from Sharjah to Lucknow. Subsequently, a few flights will land in Delhi while Amritsar’s turn will come on the last day with a fight from Dubai.While a huge number of Indians, stuck in countries other than the dozen announced today, expressed disappointment, sources said the aim was to bring back genuinely distressed Indians for which nine categories have been framed.The priority will be for the elderly and the pregnant, medical emergencies and bereavement in India.Sources said after the Home Ministry issued the terms and conditions for taking the flight back home, many have dropped out. Some have been dissuaded by higher fares and the requirement to pay for a 14-day mandatory quarantine in India.But that still leaves Indian diplomats with the task of sorting out couple of hundreds of truly deserving from the tens of thousands who have applied. In the UAE, registrations have crossed two-lakh mark, and in Qatar, it has touched as high as 40,000.Diplomats are also battling local problems concerning Indians as well as trying to get around the lockdown restrictions in many countries. Saudi Arabia, for instance, has allowed partial relaxation but not allowed visa offices to reopen.The Indian missions in the UK and Kuwait are even trying to counter scammers who have spoofed the mission’s number and are contacting people for donations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/phase-i-of-evacuation-by-air-india-disappoints-north-india-80772

The trains will run for one week.The state will make all travel arrangements for trains leaving from Hyderabad, Warangal, Khammam, Damaracharla and other places in the state.The CM held review meeting on the problems being faced by the migrant labour in the state due to lockdown.Medical and Health Minister Etela Rajender, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, DGP Sri Mahender Reddy and others attended the meeting.KCR said he had spoken to SC Railway General Manager Gajanan Mallya and requested him to arrange for 40 special trains from Tuesday.Earlier the state government had appointed senior IAS officer Sandeep Sultania and senior IPS officer Jitendra as special officers to oversee the travel of migrant workers.KCR said the higher percentage of those affected with and dying due to coronavirus were in Hyderabad its neighbouring three districts and hence there was a need to further tighten and implement lockdown in Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Medchel and Vikarabad districts.“In the state, so far 1,085 were affected with the virus. Among these, so far, 585 persons were discharged. 29 died and 471 were under treatment. The virus spread is more in Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Medchel and Vikarabad districts. Of the total 1,085 positive cases, 717 (66.08 per cent) belong to these four districts. Among those dead, 82.21 per cent belongs to these four districts. For the past 10 days the highest number of cases reported from these districts only.“The situation is not at all good in these districts. Hence, please do not given any relaxations in these four districts. Continue lockdown as it is, if need be, more strictly. The situation has improved in other districts. Containment zones number also decreased there. In those districts red zones are becoming orange zones and orange zones are becoming green,” the chief minister said quoting a report submitted by the medical and health department.The Cabinet meeting, which will be held later tonight, is expected to discuss at length on the report submitted by the medical and health department.There is a possibility that the Cabinet would discuss whether to continue the lockdown conditions, or give some relaxations and what should be done in the districts where the coronavirus spread is more and other issues and take a decision.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/special-trains-take-migrants-home-from-telangana-and-andhra-pradesh-80771
05-05-2020||New Delhi||Bihar received most workers through Shramik Specials, WB the least: Data||Bihar has received the most number of migrant labourers through special trains so far and West Bengal the least, data accessed by the PTI shows, with officials indicating that the latter was “stalling” the movement of its workers stranded in other states.Trinamool Congress Member of Parliament and leader of the party in Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien said the West Bengal government was doing “all it takes” and accused the Centre of playing politics.The data shows that most migrant labourers have gone from Gujarat to their home states in 35 Shramik Special trains so far, followed by Kerala from where 13 such trains have left.Each train has a maximum capacity of about 1,200 passengers. So far, the Railways has run 67 such trains carrying 67,000 migrant labourers to their home states.Among the receiving states, Bihar has accepted 13 trains, with 11 more currently on the journey and six in the pipeline, the data shows.Neighbouring Uttar Pradesh has received 10 such trains and five more trains are on their way and 12 are in the pipeline, the data shows.The West Bengal government has, however, given clearance to only two trains—one each from Rajasthan and Kerala—and they are on their journeys to the state, the data shows.A senior official said: “While other states which have their migrant workers in other parts of the country are accepting their labourers, West Bengal is stalling. Two trains from Thane to Shalimar and another from Bangalore to Howrah which were supposed to run today did not get clearance from the state despite Karnataka and Maharashtra goverments trying to push for it”.“Rajasthan has also been slow in accepting migrants with just three trains ferrying its workers back to the state, which are currently on their way,” the official said.TMC MP and leader of the party in Rajya Sabha, Derek O’Brien accused the Centre of playing politics.“The states, including Bengal, are going all out—fighting corona. Unfortunately, the central government is going all out—fighting and badmouthing non-BJP states using its different ministries."“States are the implementing authorities. We are all doing all it takes. This is not the time for politics. Or we too can ask: why was a 21-day lockdown announced with four hours notice?” he asked.According to figures from 2011 census, West Bengal ranks fourth among states from where people migrate for work and employment.Between 2001 and 2011, nearly 5.8 lakh people migrated from the state looking for work, which is fewer only than Uttar Pradesh (37.3 lakh), Bihar (22.6 lakh) and Rajasthan (6.6 lakh).The railway data shows that Jharkhand accepted four trains, while five trains are on their way to the state. Two more Shramik Special trains are in the pipeline.Odisha received seven trains and five are on their way to the state with one more in the pipeline, the data shows.

These are equipped with hospital beds for doctors and medicines. However, in this case the ships will be going to a port. Each such ship can ferry some 600 persons.This is the first major ship-based evacuation since Op Rahat in March 2015 when a total of 3074, including 1291 foreign nationals, were evacuated from Yemen after Saudi Arabia launched air strikes against Iranian-allied Houthi rebels.The operation to Maldives is named “Samudra Setu” -- meaning “Sea Bridge”.The INS Jalashwa, an LPD, and INS Magar, an LSTL, are presently en route to the port of Malè, to commence evacuation operations from May 8.The Indian Mission at Maldives is preparing a list of Indian nationals to be evacuated by naval ships and will facilitate their embarkation after requisite medical screening.A total of 1000 persons are planned to be evacuated during the first trip.The ships have been suitably provisioned for the evacuation operation. The evacuated personnel would be provided the basic amenities and medical facilities during the sea-passage. The evacuated persons will be disembarked at Kochi, Kerala.Sources said plans are for the other two LSTL’s, namely INS and INS Airavaat, to sail to the United Arab Emirates. The destination is still being finalised.These LSTL’s are based along the east coast and far east (Andaman and Nicobar Islands). These have been diverted to set course westwards. Meanwhile, at least 30 aircraft of the Indian Air Force along with 11 more ships of the Navy are on standby for deployment to various countries for evacuation, said the sources.Earlier the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Monday said the evacuation of lakhs of Indians stranded abroad will begin from May 7 in a phased manner.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/navy-despatches-two-warships-to-maldives-for-evacuation-80766

One steel super structure bridge of 100 metre length across river Chandra on the North Portal of the tunnel is also under construction. The work was halted for 10 days due to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, a statement issued today said.Director General Border Roads, Lt Gen Harpal Singh, had taken up the matter with Himachal Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur. This resulted in resumption of work on April 5, 2020 with on-site labour in coordination with the state government. Works in Atal Tunnel are being executed with all necessary COVID-19 precautions in place to ensure its completion in September 2020 as planned.Atal Tunnel on the Manali-Leh highway is being constructed since the route to Ladakh remains closed for six months every year due to the Rohtang Pass being completely snow bound between November and May.The tunnel will connect Manali to Lahaul Valley throughout the year and will reduce the road length of Manali-Rohtang-Sarchu-Leh road by 46 km. Besides connecting the people of Lahaul to rest of India throughout the year, the tunnel will aid the forward connectivity offering the security forces a major strategic advantage.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bro-aims-to-complete-rohtang-tunnel-by-sept-despite-lockdown-80763

05-05-2020||Mumbai||India’s unemployment rate soars to 27 pc amid COVID-19 crisis: CMIE||The COVID-19 crisis has led to a spike in the country’s unemployment rate to 27 per cent for the week that ended on May 3, up from the under 7 per cent before the start of the pandemic in mid-March, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) has said.The Mumbai-based think tank said the rate of unemployment was the highest in urban areas, which constitute the most number of the red zones due to COVID-19 cases, at 29 per cent, as against 26 per cent for rural areas.Analysts have been warning about the spectre of unemployment ever since the country was put under a lockdown on March 25 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to arrest the spread of COVID-19 infections.Scenes of migrants fleeing urban centres such as Delhi and Mumbai only confirmed the long-held concerns on their employment as every economic activity came to a grinding halt.The government has, so far, announced income and food support to the vulnerable people as part of the Rs 1.70 lakh crore fiscal stimulus to the economic, financial and possibly humanitarian crisis, and is also mulling a second round of measures soon.The United States has seen a huge spike in unemployment as over 26 million people have claimed for state support because of losing their jobs. Experts often rue the absence of a good gauge of jobs in India, which is predominantly an unorganised-sector led economy.The CMIE’s weekly series of data pointed to a steady increase in unemployment since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, with the week to March 29 showing the sharpest spike to 23 per cent.As per the CMIE’s data, the monthly unemployment rate in April stood at 23 per cent, up from March’s 8 per cent.As of the end of April, Puducherry in South India had the highest rate of unemployment at 75 per cent, followed by neighbouring Tamil Nadu at 49 per cent, Jharkhand at 47 per cent and Bihar at 46 per cent.Maharashtra’s unemployment rate was pegged at 20 per cent by the CMIE, while the same for Haryana stood at 43 per cent, Uttar Pradesh at 21 per cent and Karnataka at 29 per cent.Hilly states had the lowest incidence of unemployment as of April, the think tank said, pointing out that the rate in Himachal Pradesh stood at 2 per cent, Sikkim at 2 per cent and Uttarakhand at 6 per cent.

No court should take cognisance of any complaint or FIR relating to it, he demanded.The Republic TV Editor-in-Chief also sought adequate security for his family and colleagues.Goswami is already facing probe in another case registered against him at Nagpur and transferred to Mumbai in connection with his alleged remarks against Congress president Sonia Gandhi during his shows on Republic TV on mob-lynching of two Hindu saints in Palghar, Maharashtra.The Supreme Court had on April 24 stayed all coercive action against Goswami for three weeks in connection with multiple FIRs but allowed probe into the Nagpur FIR.Arnab's fresh petition comes a day after Maharashtra Government alleged before the Supreme Court that he was attempting to “browbeat” the Mumbai Police by “creating a fear psychosis”. It also accused Goswami of abusing the protection from coercive action given by the court. It had urged the court to issue directions to insulate the probe agency from any pressure, threat or coercion from Goswami and to enable it to carry out its lawful obligations.Accusing the Congress ecosystem of trying to build a fake narrative of a fabricated migrant crisis in Mumbai, he said his channel was the first media outlet to report about involvement of political interest groups.Alleging that the FIR was "politically motivated", he submitted that it was registered as the Mumbai Police harboured "ill will" against him.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arnab-goswami-moves-sc-for-quashing-of-second-fir-80744

05-05-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 curve remains flat, but steady rise in cases cause concerning: AIIMS director||The COVID-19 curve has remained relatively flat so far but the continued rise of cases at a steady rate is a cause of concern, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria said on Tuesday.        Different modelling experts have predicted that a peak in number of cases of novel coronavirus infection may occur in the next four to six weeks, that is by the end of May or middle of June, Guleria said stressing on the need to be extra vigilant and to make efforts to reduce the number of cases in the hotspots.He also said: “The country may see a rise in COVID-19 cases during the winter again but that time will only tell”.     These remarks come amid several state governments giving relaxations and opening up liquor shops in accordance to the guidelines issued by the Home Ministry.“The curve has remained relatively flat so far because of the implementation of the lockdown and other containment measures and this has given us time to prepare our health infrastructure and ramp up testing facilities in the country.“However, the number of cases continues to rise at a steady rate and this is a cause of concern. Every citizen should understand his responsibility and sincerely follow the principles of lockdown and social distancing, especially if they are in hotspots or containment areas,” Guleria, a pulmonologist, said.He stressed on focusing on areas having a high case load of COVID-19 so that there is no further transmission of virus there.Simultaneously, he emphasised on stepping up surveillance in green zones which have reported no cases so far so that they continue to remain infection-free.   On Tuesday morning, the death toll due to coronavirus rose to 1,568 and the number of cases rose to 42,836 in the last 24 hours, according to Union Health Ministry data.

05-05-2020||New Delhi||SC refuses to entertain plea against salary cut of policemen during Covid-19||The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, refused to entertain a plea seeking direction for withdrawal of orders by some states which proposed salary cut of police personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic, saying these are “policy matters” and it is for the government to consider the issue.A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan was hearing the plea through video-conferencing. The plea also sought Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) for all police personnel and their families on the ground that the police were serving on the frontline making them vulnerable to COVID-19.While observing that it would not entertain the plea, the bench, also comprising Justices S K Kaul and B R Gavai, allowed the petitioner to give a representation on the issue to the appropriate authority.The bench was hearing a plea filed by retired Assistant Commissioner of Police Bhanupratap Barge, who had sought directions to the Centre and states to make provisions for payment of ‘risk and hardship’ allowance, incentives in the form of bonus and additional salary to police officers who were presently serving on the frontline during the lockdown situation.The counsel appearing for the petitioner told the bench that they were not raising the issue of risk and allowance, but the salary of police officers was being deducted in some states.The counsel argued that aged police officers were being asked to report on duty, but they should not be deployed on any duty which comes in direct contact with COVID-19 infected patients.The plea had referred to the death of the police personnel due to the virus at some places and said it indicated that “even a protector needs protection and safety” and the government must take effective measures and steps to ensure good health and safety of cops across the country.It had also sought directions to the authorities to identify policemen above 48 years of age and those having existing medical conditions such as diabetes, and not to deploy them on duty where they might come in direct or indirect contact with COVID-19 patients.

05-05-2020||Bhopal||23 deaf and mute persons rescued from Delhi amid lockdown||Technology such as social media, messaging and video-calling apps helped Madhya Pradesh authorities rescue 23 deaf and mute persons, who were stranded in Gurgaon and Delhi ever since the COVID-19 lockdown was imposed in March.Deaf and mute persons employed with private firms and hotels in Delhi and Gurgaon were stuck because of the lockdown and were finding it difficult to survive, Gyanendra Purohit, director of Indore-based NGO Anand Survey Society said on Tuesday.“Our initial attempts to convince officials to rescue them failed. However, when it was announced that the lockdown would enter the third phase, people became restless and just wanted to come home,” he said.The NGO had been highlighting the plight of these people on social media and the residents of Haryana, namely Dr Hemant Atri, arranged to provide essentials to them, Purohit said.The organisation subsequently approached additional chief secretary ICP Keshari who set the ball rolling for the rescue, he said.Communicating with deaf and mute persons was a major challenge, he said, adding that text messages and video calls with sign language were the only means to stay in touch.With the help of Prakash Unhele, additional resident commissioner of MP in Delhi, as many as 23 deaf and mute persons were transported to a place in Haryana, and after several video calls, they were rescued and reached Gwalior on Monday.“Majority of them are employed with Amazon and other private companies,” he said, adding that the organisation was getting several calls from disabled persons from the state who were stuck in other parts of the country as well.Meanwhile, when asked if similar efforts would be taken for other stranded migrants, Keshari said, “We are not against bringing people back, but their numbers should be at least enough to arrange buses for them. Our priority right now is to rescue migrants who were stranded on roads without any means to survive.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/23-deaf-and-mute-persons-rescued-from-delhi-amid-lockdown-80718
05-05-2020||---||Air India, Navy launch first phase of operation to extricate Indians||New Delhi, May 5Air India will operate 64 international flights from May 7 to May 13 to bring back some of the stranded Indians from a dozen countries, including the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries, Singapore the US and the UK.Passengers will have to pay for their tickets which, as per initial announcements, from Indian missions in two countries, are at least 25 per cent higher than the normal fare. The government had also pegged the rail fare for migrants on the higher side to account for empty berths due to social distancing and the empty return of the train.However, unlike the trains, some of the flights will not go empty and may carry those who are in India but have long-term visas and work opportunities outside and want to return. Last time, Air India and the Indian Air Force had not charged passengers for extricating them from China and Japan.A passenger on the London-Delhi flight would be charged Rs 50,000 while a passenger on the Dhaka-Delhi flight would Rs 12,000, the Aviation Minister said.On arrival from abroad, all passengers would be screened and put under quarantine for a period of 14 days as a COVID-19 precautionary measure, Puri added.Making the announcement, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri held out the hope of private airlines joining in the extraction of Indians stranded in several other countries.The Civil Aviation Minister’s hint about involving private airlines will not just lift the spirits of stranded Indians, but also provide business to them. All domestic airlines have shelved operations since March 25 leading to losses worth several crores.If the world-wide lockdown on international flights continues, India may have to mount several hundred flights to evacuate just the most distressed of its nationals.For comparison, the UK, a much smaller country, has evacuated its nationals from India in an almost equal number of flights.The first phase of the evacuation in most countries will give priority to the elderly, pregnant women, patients with urgent medical cases and those facing bereavement in India.The initiative is being coordinated by the Ministries of Defence, External Affairs, Home Affairs and Health besides various other agencies of the Government of India and State governments. The MEA will appoint senior nodal officers for all states. Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla will hold a video conference with state Chief Secretaries to firm up the subsequent arrangements.The Indian Navy has launched ‘Operation Samudra Setu’ by sending two ships to the Maldives to bring back some of the emergency cases under Phase I. On their return, both ships will dock at Kochi and the returnees will be entrusted to the state government.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-india-navy-launch-first-phase-of-operation-to-extricate-indians-80715

05-05-2020||New Delhi||India registers biggest spike yet, records over 4,000 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours||India on Tuesday witnessed the highest single-day surge in COVID-19 cases and deaths since the infection was reported in the country on January 30 this year.In its daily briefing, the Health Ministry noted the “highest increase in both new infections and deaths” calling for community support and shared responsibility to fight the disease.Ministry spokesperson Lav Agarwal said the country has seen 4,100 new cases since yesterday and 210 new deaths. Corresponding cases for a single day on Monday were 2,573 and deaths were 83.Cases have increased nearly by 40 per cent and mortality has more than doubled over the past 24 hours.The central government attributed sudden surge to previously data-cagey states beginning to report cases and deaths.West Bengal had been particularly lax in full case reporting, which had led the government to send a central team to the state to assess the situation.“This sudden rise that you see is due to states beginning to report cases. Some states were not reporting cases earlier and there were gaps. Those gaps have now been addressed. Timely reporting of COVID cases is very important so that contact tracing and containment can then begin,” Agarwal said.He also said community would need to step up precautions as the government starts relaxing the lockdown conditions.“We need community ownership of the battle. Government responsibility after easing the lockdown has increased and so has that of the community,” Agarwal said as India’s disease graph started to take an upward curve after linear growth for many days.Health Minister Harsh Vardhan also chaired the 14th meeting of the COVID group of ministers to take stock of containment and availability of essential equipment.Total COVID cases in India are now 46,711, recoveries 12,726 and deaths 1,583.Daily cases have now been surging to new highs for the past four days in a row.'No community transmission'The latest number also come within hours of Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan insisting that India has so far been able to stave off community transmission of Covid-19.The nation in a post-coronavirus future could well look back on the pandemic period as a “blessing in disguise” if Indians imbibe hand, respiratory and environmental hygiene and practise it in their everyday lives, the minister said.Underlining the importance of the lockdown, which has been extended till May 17, the minister said health should be on the radar just as much as the economy.“The government has to do a balancing act,” he said.He added that India has so far been able to keep itself from “slipping into the stage of community transmission of the novel coronavirus”."By now we know that fighting coronavirus is no rocket science. If behavioural changes such as hand, environmental and respiratory hygiene, which are being practised more rigorously during this period, get imbibed in society it will become the new normal," Vardhan said.Such practices will bring down the instances of communicable diseases and society will evolve for the better, he said.Other than small pox and polio, no other viral infection has been completely eradicated from this country. Other diseases keep recurring, the minister said, indicating that Covid-19 might be here for the long haul.“But every cloud has a silver lining,” he said.The situation posed by the Covid-19 pandemic can be seen as an opportunity to shore up health infrastructure and indigenous production of medical equipment and protective gear under the 'Make in India' initiative, the minister explained."We have ramped up the production of COVID-19 protective gears like PPE (personal protection equipment) and N-95 masks. Testing facilities have been scaled up significantly,” he said.Efforts are also on to ramp up the production of APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients), the raw material for pharmaceuticals, Vardhan added. "Thus, this pandemic can be seen as an opportunity to boost the indigenous production of such items, thereby reducing India's dependency on foreign countries for them which are in high demand globally due to the pandemic," he said.The minister also discussed the chaos outside liquor vends across the country on Monday as several states relaxed the lockdown in accordance with guidelines from the Union Home Ministry and people in several places jostled and shoved to stock up on their alcohol without any thought to social distancing norms."We have to weigh every decision objectively and predict their consequences before implementing them to ensure there is no spike in cases." He said the doubling rate of cases in the country has been showing regular improvement and stands at over 12 days now as against three days before March 25, when the nationwide lockdown began.---- With PTI inputs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-registers-biggest-spike-yet-records-over-4-000-new-coronavirus-cases-in-24-hours-80711
05-05-2020||New Delhi||Fear of Covid-19, hefty corona fee on liquor fail to deter tipplers||Undeterred by the threat of coronavirus infection or the 'special corona fee' of 70 per cent levied on alcohol, hundreds of tipplers queued up outside liquor vends in the national capital for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, keeping the police on their toes.Long queues were formed outside the vends in Krishna Nagar and Vishwas Nagar, and a large number of policemen stood outside to manage the crowd and ensure social distancing.At some places, like the Gole Market in central Delhi, although the liquor shops were shut, baton-wielding paramilitary personnel were also deployed to keep the crowd at bay.About 150 government-run liquor shops have been allowed to open from 9 am to 6.30 pm as per the latest lockdown relaxations allowed by the Ministry of Home Affairs.On Monday, many liquor shops downed their shutters after crowds turned unruly, showing little care about social distancing. Late in the night, the Delhi government levied a 70 per cent 'special corona fee' on the sale of liquor. The new rate is applicable from Tuesday.The special branch of Delhi Police has also prepared a report suggesting extending the timings of the liquor sale in Delhi after chaos outside shops on Monday.To ensure that he gets his stock of liquor, Bharat Kumar, a resident of Burari, stood outside the liquor shop since 8 am -- the shop opens at 9. But there were many even ahead of him."I was in the queue for liquor since 8 am. Despite this, it took me one and a half hours to buy three liquor bottles," he said.Asked about the government's decision to impose a hefty 'corona fee' to discourage tipplers, he said, "It will not affect us. People will get liquor from Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad."But there were many who still could not manage to buy liquor for the second day."I searched for some shops in Krishna Nagar but there were long queues of around 400-500 people. Here, the shop has not been opened and policemen are sending us back. It's not fair, the government has raised the price so much and still there are problems if one tries to buy it," said Raj Kumar, 38, who had come to a liquor shop in Shakarpur in east Delhi.Ramesh, who declined to share his second name, said he was trying his luck after failing to buy liquor bottles from nearby shops because of the huge crowd."Yesterday, I waited for two hours in a queue outside a shop but the police closed it after the crowd became unruly," Ramesh said.Rajbir Singh, in his late 40s, tried his luck at a liquor vend behind Regal Cinema in central Delhi, but failed."I have only one peg every fortnight. But I have not had even that for long," Singh said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fear-of-covid-19-hefty-corona-fee-on-liquor-fail-to-deter-tipplers-80710
05-05-2020||New Delhi||#BoysLockerRoom: Delhi schoolboy nabbed for shocking insta group chat that spoke of planning minors 'gang-rapes'||Soon after the Delhi Police started questioning a prominent South Delhi school student in connection with the ‘Boys Locker Room’ controversy probe, 22 others linked to the mess went underground on Tuesday.The Cyber Cell of the Delhi Police earlier detained one teenager in connection with the Instagram chat group where rapes were glorified and photos of underage girls were shared and they were objectified.The one who has been nabbed so far is a 15-year-old student of a prominent school in South Delhi. "22 other boys have also have been identified and they would be called for investigation," the police said on Tuesday. The detained accused would be produced before the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB).Based on the information provided by the minor during questioning, police teams have been set to various parts of the National Capital Region. After the police registered the case, many students in the group have gone underground.Leaked screenshots of the private Instagram chat group stirred up a storm over rape culture in India after numerous boys were allegedly seen sharing photos of underage girls, objectifying them, and planning "gang rapes".A case was registered under Section 465 (forgery), 471 (using forged document), 469 (Forgery for purpose of harming reputation), 509 (intending to insult the modesty of any woman) of the IPC and 67 and 67A of the Information Technology (IT) Act at cyber cell of the Delhi police.Earlier on Monday, the police received a complaint from the principal of a prominent school in South Delhi's Saket at the Saket police station requesting for a probe into the matter, the same was forwarded to the Cyber Cell thereof.Apart from this, another complaint was filed at a police station in North Delhi by a parent in connection with this Instagram group.On Monday, the police had asked photo sharing app Instagram to share the details of all the participants of the said group where photos of underage girls were being shared and they were being objectified.Speaking to IANS over the phone Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Cyber Crime, Anish Roy said, "We have asked Instagram to share the details of the members and admin of the said group, including their name, IP addresses etc."The incident came to light after a girl from South Delhi shared the screenshot over social media exposing the said groups and scores of similar group.She wrote, "A group of south delhi guys aged 17-18 types have this ig gc named "boy's locker room" where they shit on, objectify and morph pictures of girls their age. 2 boys from my school are a part of it. MY FRIENDS AND I ARE FREAKING OUT THIS IS SO EWWW AND NOW MY MOM WANTS ME TO QUIT IG."The girl also shared the screenshot of the list of participants of the group and that of their chats where the said persons are seen sharing pictures of girls and passing comments over it.The Delhi Commission for Women too swung into action and issued a notice to the Delhi Police and Instagram over the issue. "I saw screenshot of "Boys Locker Room" group on Instagram. This is a clear example of a gruesome criminal and rapist mindset," Delhi Commission for Women Chief Swati Maliwal said. "We are issuing a notice to Instagram and the Delhi Police. All the boys in this group should be arrested," she added.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/boyslockerroom-delhi-schoolboy-nabbed-for-shocking-insta-group-chat-that-spoke-of-planning-minors-gang-rapes-80709

05-05-2020||---||Covid-19: SC dismisses former UP DGP's PIL seeking quashing of lockdown violation FIRs||New Delhi, May 5The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed former Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police Vikram Singh's PIL seeking quashing of more than 75,000 FIRs registered under Section 188 of the IPC and other provisions for violation of Covid-19 lockdown. "You want there should be no FIR and this (Section 188 IPC) should not be invoked...then how can the lockdown be enforced? We are wondering why such kind of petitions are coming to this court?" a three-judge Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan said while dismissing Singh's PIL.On behalf of Singh, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan said if the law didn't permit registration of FIRs then the NDMA law cannot be allowed for registration of FIRs. Cases had been registered against migrants and those withdrawing money from ATM, he added.But the Bench chose to dismiss the petition.Singh, who filed a PIL in his capacity as the Chairman of a think-tank -- Centre for Accountability and Systemic Change (CASC) -- had urged the top court to issue directions under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, to state governments to refrain from filing complaints/registering FIRs under Section 188 of the IPC or for other petty offences during the lockdown.Noting that coronavirus had caused a global pandemic in which every person was suffering, he said, "The situation needs to be handled humanely, and it will be best to avoid adding aspects of criminality, wherever possible."He said as per Section 195 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, as well as many judgments of the Supreme Court and various high courts, no FIR can be registered under Section 188 of the IPC."The illegal police action, and increasing police brutality through frequent lathicharge during lockdown cannot be allowed to be normalised and institutionalised," Singh submitted.The registration of FIRs u/s 188 IPC is grossly illegal and antithesis to Rule of Law, and violates (right to equality and right to life and liberty) guaranteed under Article 14 and Article 21 of the Constitution respectively, the petitioner submitted.Singh, however, sought to clarify that he was in no way promoting violation of the lockdown."The petitioner is only seeking effective action as per due process of law. The petitioner submits that stringent action must be taken against all deliberate violations of lockdown, in accordance with law," he submitted. The former UP DGP said on the one hand, the Supreme Court itself directed release of prisoners from jails to reduce overcrowding and on the other hand, police were continuing to burden the criminal justice system through FIRs in petty offences in unlawful manner, which at the most mandate a jail term of six months.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-sc-dismisses-former-up-dgps-pil-seeking-quashing-of-lockdown-violation-firs-80700

At the moment we are using the parking lot for the isolation facility," Mumbai Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said in a video call with journalists here.The facility will house Covid-19 patients who have been categorized as asymptomatic, Pardeshi said.Home department officials from the state government say the entire 225 acres of the verdant racecourse could be acquired to house Covid-19 patients if required.Office-bearers of the Royal Western India Turf Club (RWITC), which comprises the city's elite including several industrialists, had initially objected to the racecourse being used as an isolation facility. Top bureaucrats who frequent the races were told by the club members that grounds did not have enough toilet and sanitation facilities if property was turned into an isolation centre.The Maharashtra government has pointed out to the RWITC that the land was owned by the state and was leased out to the club for conducting races.However officials from the disaster management cell of the Maharashtra government have planned installation of mobile toilets and oxygen lines for patients who develop complications from the virus.The Maharashtra government has fast-tracked construction of facilities at a number of venues across the city, including the Nehru Planetarium, the Nehru Science Centre, open grounds owned by various entities amidst estimates that the number of people testing positive for the virus would touch 70,000 by the middle of this month.Though the BMC estimates that Covid-19 cases would peak at around 35,000 in Mumbai, the central government has warned of the figures being double the number.Estimates by the central government say more than 63,000 of the people who test positive in the city would be asymptomatic but most would require to be isolated from their congested homes.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbais-iconic-racecourse-to-become-isolation-facility-for-covid-19-patients-80697

While on a video call to her, he again asked her to come back.The family told police that the couple had a strained relationship. They had an argument during the video call. In order to threaten her that he would end his life if she refused to return, the man stood on a cot and tied a noose around his neck and tied the other end of the rope to the fan.However, while threatening his wife he slipped and accidentally hanged himself.Police shifted the body to the government hospital at Kovvur and registered a case. A police officer said they had taken up the investigation based on the video call recorded in Ganesh's mobile phone and the couple's conversation. Police were also questioning the family.While there have been a few incidents of people killing themselves during video call with their spouses or lovers, this was a freak incident in which the man's attempt to threaten suicide proved costly for him.In April last year, a youth in Tirupati while enacting a prank suicide over a video call fell victim to it. The 25-year-old had made a video call to his friend living in the same town saying he was going to commit suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling fan. As the youth was addicted to liquor, his friend did not take him seriously. While tying a noose with a sari round his neck, he accidentally hanged himself.

The sale would have been  higher in villages, but there too, money may have been a constraint.” Meanwhile, Bhoosreddy said that a cap on individual purchase on liquor had been imposed to prevent hoarding.A person will not be allowed to purchase more than one bottle (750 ml), or two halves (375 ml each), or three quarters (180 ml each), or two bottles of beer or three cans. This is being implemented only for the first 2-3 days, he said.Bhoosreddy said liquor production had started about two weeks ago and supply to wholesalers would remain uninterrupted.The official said: “Wearing of face masks has been made compulsory. People without masks will be pulled out of the queues. Shops have also been directed to keep hand sanitizers.”—IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tipplers-day-out-up-liquor-sales-over-rs-100-cr-on-day-one-80690

The state will make all travel arrangements for trains leaving from Hyderabad, Warangal, Khammam, Damaracharla and other places in the state.The trains would leave for Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, West Bengal and other states.The CM held a review meeting on the problems being faced by the migrant labour in the state due to lockdown. Medical and Health Minister Etela Rajender, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, DGP Sri Mahender Reddy and others attended the meeting.KCR said he had spoken to SC Railway General manager Gajanan Mallya and requested him to arrange 40 special trains from Tuesday. Earlier, the state government had appointed senior IAS officer Sandeep Sultania and senior IPS officer Jitendra as Special Officers to oversee the travel of migrant workers.KCR said the higher percentage of those affected with and dying due to corona virus were in Hyderabad and its neighbouring three districts and hence there was a need to further tighten and implement lockdown in Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Medchel and Vikarabad districts.“In the state so far 1,085 people were affected with the virus. Among these, so far, 585 people were discharged, 29 died and 471 were under the treatment. The virus spread is more in Hyderabad, Rangareddy and Medchel and Vikarabad districts. Of the total 1,085 positive cases, 717 (66.08 per cent) belong to these four districts. Among those dead, 82.21 per cent belong to these four districts. For the past 10 days, the highest number of cases were reported from these districts only. The situation is not at all good in these districts. Hence, please do not give any relaxations in these four districts. Continue lockdown as it is, if need be, more strictly. The situation has improved in other districts. Containment zones number also decreased there. In those districts red zones are becoming orange zones and orange zones are becoming green,” the chief minister said, quoting a report submitted by the Medical and health department.The Cabinet, which will hold a meeting later on Tuesday, is expected to discuss at length on the report submitted by the Medical and health department. There is a possibility that the cabinet would discuss whether to continue the lockdown conditions, or give some relaxations and what should be done in the districts where the corona virus spread is more and other issues and take a decision.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-to-run-40-trains-daily-to-send-migrants-home-80687

05-05-2020||Aditi Tandon||Covid-19: India needs a larger stimulus package, says Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 5Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee today said India needed a large stimulus package to revive the economy amid an evolving Covid-19 pandemic and enhancing spending was the best way to do that.Over a 25-minute conversation with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi today, Banerjee also said the Government should give money to the bottom 60 per cent of the population to spur demand and also issue temporary ration cards to everyone who needs one.A conversation with Nobel Laureate, Abhijit Banerjee on the economic impact of the COVID19 crisis. https://t.co/dUrok8Wm3Q  The top economist didn’t favour a hasty retreat out of the lockdown and advised caution saying the decision to lift the lockdown should depend on the time path of the disease.“We should try to be optimistic about the survival of the overall wellbeing of the country. We need a stimulus package. That’s what the US, Japan is doing. We haven’t yet decided about a large stimulus package. We are still talking about one per cent of the GDP. US has gone for 10 per cent of the GDP,” he said.Noting that Aadhar-based universal PDS entitlement would have been the best at this time and would have saved a lot of misery, Banerjee said India should not worry about targeting and should put money in the hands of people or at least a promise that they will have the money to spend whenver the lockdown is lifted.On Gandhi’s suggestion of doing a large revival package for MSMEs as a solution to sour economic activity, the ace economist had his doubts.“Debt payments of MSME should be permanently cancelled for this quarter but beyond that It’s not clear that targeting the MSME channel is the right channel. It is more reviving demand, putting money in the hands of people so that they go and buy stuff. Spending is the best way to revive the economy,” he noted.When Gandhi spoke of a minimum income guarantee plan to the poorest as another solution right now, Banerjee advocated a broader base of people rather than just the poorest.“Targeting is extremely costly. Give the bottom 60 per cent of the population. Nothing bad will happen. It would work as a stimulus package,” he said.Banerjee said demand must be spurred fast and the government should not worry about checking everyone‘s locus standi.The economist also added India shouldn’t induce a mismatch of demand and supply by giving people spending power where we have shut down the entire retail sector in the red zone.“You should get the money when you can go and buy. You should get a promise that you will get the money when you can go and spend. If people were reassured that they would have some money on hands once the lockdown is lifted they would be more willing to spend. You shouldn’t rush into it,” he said.On the lockdown, the economic expert said lifting of the lockdown depends very much on the disease. “You don’t want to lift when a lot of people are getting sick. We have to be aware of the time path of disease before taking that decision,” he said adding that there should have been more centralisation in handling the migrant issue.Asked to comment by Gandhi on the overall impression that it needs a strong leader to take on the virus, Banerjee said, “That has been disastrous. US and Brazil are messing up right and left. These are led by strong men pretending they understand everything. Even what they say everything is laughable. If anyone wanted to believe in the strong man theory this is the time to disabuse themselves of that belief.“||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-india-needs-a-larger-stimulus-package-says-nobel-laureate-abhijit-banerjee-80682

"It all depends on the situation on the ground. But with such intensive containment efforts and positive results there is good reason to hope for a normal schedule," they say.Moreover, several important legislative work and Bills are pending which can only be cleared during the session.While the government needs to clear the legislative business, it is expected to face storm over the Covid-19 management, especially on the hardships faced by migrant workers due to the sudden announcement of the countrywide lockdown by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24. The subsequent side effects, the state of the economy, job-losses and other issues that the Opposition is expected to corner the government on.Last year, the Monsoon Session started around June 17 and carried on till August 7.The 2020 Budget Session was cut short due to the pandemic, much ahead of its scheduled date even though Prime Minister Modi said it would continue as per schedule.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-budget-session-curtailed-government-hopes-for-normal-monsoon-session-80678
05-05-2020||Washington||Covid-19: Special evacuation flights for Indians stuck in US to operate this week||Special evacuation flights for Indians stranded in the US due to the global travel restrictions put in place to contain the coronavirus pandemic are most likely to begin from San Francisco this week, according to officials.While no exact dates have been announced yet, the flights could take off from San Francisco, New York, Chicago and Washington DC, the officials said.Given that a large number of Indian students and visitors are stranded in the US because of the strict travel restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, more flights are likely to be scheduled in the coming weeks.Community leaders have welcomed the move of the Indian government which on Monday announced that special flights facilitating the return of Indian nationals stranded abroad on compelling grounds would begin in a phased manner from May 7.The Indian embassy and its consulates in the US last week started preparing a list of Indians planning to travel back home. The list is being prepared through an online registration form.“This is for the first time in my memory that such an evacuation effort is being carried out by the Indian government for its citizens in the US,” Jaipur Foot USA Chairman Prem Bhandari said as he thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the efforts.Bhandari, who had been receiving calls from various stranded Indians, sometimes from students seeking accommodation, or visitors who had run out of medicine, last week wrote a letter to Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla and Civil Aviation Secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola, bringing to their attention the grave situation.In the letter, he said: “There are a large number of students who have run out of money. They don't have a place to stay. What is more worrisome is the fact that this uncertainty is having a toll on their mental and physical health.”A large number of Indian visitors, in particular senior citizens and parents of those working in the US, have run out of their essential medicines.To get them medicine, even with a traveller's health insurance, is often not affordable. “The evacuation flight is the need of the hour. This shows how much this government cares for its citizens,” Bhandari said.Over the past few weeks, several Indians have been reaching out to Indian Ambassador in the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu and the helpline established by it seeking an early repatriation back home.“Please start some flights for Indian citizens on humanitarian grounds. We have critically ill senior citizen parents who are alone and have to be looked after. Please understand our plight and bring this to the notice of the Indian government,” one of them tweeted last week.“Please look after students those who are under 22 years, they are alone in Penn State college want to come back home please arrange airlift and give priorities to students and old people,” one student Asha Tiwari wrote on Twitter.Some Indian origin people having Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cards have also sought help in travelling back to India.“Please also take care of OCIs as well. I am a resident of India and working in India. My family is in India too. I visited US for a month and got stuck here,” wrote Kranthi Borra.In a separate letter last week, Bhandari requested Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to waive the visa extension fee of USD 455 given the exceptional circumstances due to the coronavirus pandemic.“The visa extension fee of USD 455 (including biometric service fee of USD 85) imposed by the US Department of State is further hitting these visitors real hard. As the Government of India is working tirelessly on expeditious repatriation of its citizens, I sincerely urge you to reconsider the visa extension fee and waive these charges on humanitarian grounds and as a gesture of compassion,” he said.The Indian government in a statement said medical screening of passengers would be done before the flight.“Only asymptomatic passengers would be allowed to travel,” it said. During the journey, all these passengers would have to follow the protocols, such as the Health Protocols, issued by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Civil Aviation.On reaching the destination, everyone would have to register on the Arogya Setu app, the official statement said.Everyone would be medically screened. After scrutiny, they would be quarantined for 14 days, either in a hospital or in an institutional quarantine on payment-basis, by the state governments concerned. COVID-19 test would be done after 14 days and further action would be taken according to health protocols, it said.The Ministries of External Affairs and Civil Aviation would soon share detailed information.The coronavirus pandemic has infected over 1.2 million people and killed nearly 70,000 in the US, the worst affected country in the world.

There is no study to suggest that “it is a magic bullet” or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, he said.Dr Vivek Nangia from Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.Professor Rajesh Malhotra from AIIMS, said there iwa no concrete evidence of this therapy’s usefulness. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plasma-therapy-no-magic-bullet-experts-80569
05-05-2020||Aditi Tandon||It’s ‘physical’ distancing in govt communication||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 5Gearing up for Covid-19 long haul, the government on Monday began correcting its messaging after evidence that many of the current narratives were fuelling stigma and fear.The first term to be dropped from official jargon was “social distancing” with the Ministry of Health replacing it with a simpler phrase “physical distancing”.“As we transition into the new normal, we must continue wearing masks or face covers in public spaces, practise physical distancing all the time, including when buying essential items,” Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said today.The communication shift followed warnings the government got from stakeholders about the term social distancing causing stigma with people literally shunning those at risk, patients and their families and frontline health workers.The government's aim is to prevent Covid-19 patients from going underground due to stigma – the trajectory HIV/AIDS followed. There are concerns among health experts about growing stigma and negative perceptions about Covid-19 preventing people from reporting their infection.The Ministry of Health’s surveys on people’s perception on messaging find the disease is being perceived as elitist and urban, triggering migration from cities to villages and people are viewing quarantine centres as prisons.“There is hesitancy for getting tested for Covid-19 in case symptoms are exhibited. The reason is fear of sickness or fear of being taken away for isolation and quarantine. Quarantine centres are viewed similar to prisons where individuals are locked up away from family and friends,” the government survey finds, adding that people not exhibiting symptoms are far more lax about physical distancing norms and don’t seem to have absorbed the official message that even asymptomatic people could be Covid-19 carriers.Quarantine centre issue was recently partly addressed with the government allowing home quarantine of very mild cases if they have a residential facility.To counter stigma, a new set of messaging has begun rolling with principal taglines being – “If Covid-19 does not discriminate, why should we?”; “Fight the disease, not the diseased”; “Anyone can get Covid-19”; “Stop stigmatising, start empathising”; “Most people who get Covid-19 will recover”.The new narrative on quarantine centres says, “Quarantine is meant to protect the family and community and quarantine centres are designed to prevent rapid spread of the disease and are the safest places for Covid-19 patients to be.”NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said on Tuesday, “Physical distancing is our only vaccine against Covid-19 at the moment. The need of the hour is to be more sensitive in the way we communicate, be more compassionate in our messaging and to understand that there is no need to panic.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/its-physical-distancing-in-govt-communication-80570

While swine flu can spread from animals to humans, swine fever does not, and therefore is not a public health threat.“The National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, has confirmed that it is African Swine Fever (ASF). The Central Government has informed us that it is the first instance of the disease in the country,” Bora said. According to a 2019 census by the department, the pig population in the state was 21 lakh which has increased in recent times to around 30 lakh, he added. “We have discussed with experts if we can save the pigs without culling them,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/african-swine-fever-kills-2-500-assam-pigs-80574

The process started under which a limited number of stranded migrant labourers had been transported.Yet on the social media, people put out an order that stipulates states to collect fares from workers on completion of journey, while some flashed a photo of a ticket with fare on it. As Rahul Gandhi joined issue, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra responded with the Home Ministry guidelines saying state governments could pay for the ticket, just as MP was, since it was the responsibility of states to clear the price for 1,200 tickets given by the Railways for each special train.Already under attack from the RJD that offered to underwrite cost of trains for five days, Bihar CM Nitish Kumar said the state government was not charging either students or migrant workers.The government was paying to the Railways for student while it would reimburse the workers after completion of mandatory quarantine period, he said after RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav mocked Kumar for expressing inability to ferry stranded workers in buses like other states.Migrants take to streets in Ludhiana2 cops hurt in Y’nagar, migrants hurl stonesIn Surat, workers clash with police||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-puts-centre-on-spot-with-rail-fare-offer-80487

"Covid has shown us the limitations. In the post-Covid world, we need a new template of globalisation, based on fairness, equality, and humanity,’’ he said at a videoconference of Non-Aligned Movement’s (NAM) Covid Contact Group, organised by Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev.We need to promote human welfare, and not focus on economic growth alone. India has long championed such initiatives. — Narendra Modi, PM"We need to promote human welfare, and not focus on economic growth alone. India has long championed such initiatives,’’ he said while citing the Indian initiatives of International Day of Yoga, the International Solar Alliance and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure which has organised disaster management drills in the region and beyond.The PM also asked his NAM colleagues to call on the international community and World Health Organisation (WHO) to focus on building health capacities in developing countries."We should develop a platform for all NAM countries to pull our experience, best practices, crises management processes, research and resources. In the founding spirit of movement let us aim today to come together and not grow apart,’’ he advised at the conference where about 40 NAM leaders besides heads of UN, WHO, European Union and the African Union spoke.Pakistan fielded its health minister while presidents of Iran, Cuba, Indonesia, Egypt and Venezuela were among the other prominent speakers.India, under PM Modi, sent the Vice President to the two previous NAM summits. The last Indian Prime Ministerial representation to a NAM summit was in Tehran eight years ago. However, PM Modi put faith in the ability of NAM to promote global solidarity as it has often been the "world's moral voice". To retain this role, NAM must remain inclusive, he added.While the summit of G-20 and that of the Foreign Ministers of BRICS countries was an exercise in restraint, at the NAM summit, Iran, Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua accused the US of crippling their response to the pandemic by imposing unilateral sanctions.Iran President Hassan Rouhani described the US slashing its funding to WHO as "untimely, unjustifiable and irresponsible" which has deprived the WHO of much-needed finances. "One couldn’t have expected otherwise from this administration which has time and again withdrawn from international accords and violated its national laws,’’ he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-nam-summit-pm-calls-for-reforms-in-post-covid-world-80568
