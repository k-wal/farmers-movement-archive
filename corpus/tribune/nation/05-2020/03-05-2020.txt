Hence, it is imperative to make police personnel aware of the precautions to be taken while performing their assigned tasks in order to ensure that the strategy adopted for containing COVID-19 spread remains sustainable,” it said.In view of such cases, it is considered expedient to issue the guidelines to reiterate the precautions and measures to be taken, it said.The home ministry said police authorities may take necessary precautions to sanitise the physical environment at the place of duty of police and security personnel.Police or security personnel may be advised to keep themselves safe by practicing proper hygiene and physical distancing, it advised.Police authorities should also take care of safety and hygiene of its personnel by providing all necessary materials like hand sanitizers, soaps, masks, face shield, gloves, safe food, etc. and also train the personnel in their proper usage and disposal, the ministry said.It said home guards, civil defence, NCC cadets, Scouts and Guides and Student Police Cadets may be utilised in areas where there are not imminent law and order issues.They can especially be of help in maintaining order at the relief centres and in facilitating the maintenance of supply chain and for coordinating other essential services, according to the ministry.While performing COVID-related duties, police and security personnel should help general public and deal with them with empathy and compassion especially with the weaker sections of the society.  They should monitor religious and social congregations during festivals to ensure social distancing, it said.Police should also be watchful of migrant labourers and slums to contain any unexpected and undesirable mass movement, it said, adding most state polices have already set up Control Rooms.It is reiterated that control rooms are the nerve centres of policing and must monitor, round the clock, the minutest concerns of policing during the pandemic, it said.The control rooms may be expanded, resourced and designed to incorporate special COVID-19 Cells, to exclusively look after all issues relating to the pandemic.The staff manning these cells should be trained on elementary modules relating to the epidemic and briefed about appropriate responses to help engage with issues and scenarios they are likely to be confronted with, the ministry said.Such cells should be adequately equipped with men and material, including drones which may be used for aerial reconnaissance, if required on urgent basis. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-centre-asks-states-to-prepare-second-line-of-defence-with-home-guards-ncc-cadets-79892
03-05-2020||New Delhi||Rly SOP for Shramik Special trains draws flak for asking states to collect fare for services||The Indian Railways has issued a set of guidelines for Shramik Special trains being run to ferry the migrants stranded across the country, saying the trains will ply only if they have 90 per cent occupancy and the “states should collect the ticket fare”, inviting fierce criticism for charging for their services.A provision in the SOP, which drew a good deal of flak, said: “The local state government shall handover the tickets for these passengers cleared by them and collect the ticket fare and hand over the total amount to the Indian Railways.”“If you are stuck abroad during this COVID crisis, this government will fly you back for free, but if you are a migrant worker stranded in another state, be prepared to cough up the cost of travel (with social distancing cost added). Where did ‘PM Cares’ go? Like I said earlier, you were better off getting stranded overseas & flown back home!,” tweeted NC leader Omar Abdullah.In the SOP, the Railways said the responsibility for food, security, health scanning, providing tickets to the stranded would be with the state from which the train is originating. It has, however, taken the burden of providing one meal to passengers whose journey would be of 12 hours or more.While the Railways has refused to comment on the issue of payments, stating it was a state matter, sources said Jharkhand, which had received two trains till now, had paid its dues. Originating states such as Rajasthan and Telangana are also paying for the travel of workers in their states.Gujarat, the sources said, has roped in an NGO to pay for part of the services.However, they said, Maharashtra was making the migrants pay some amount of the fare. In fact, Maharashtra Minister Nitin Raut wrote to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, requesting him to bear the cost of the ticket.The Railways is charging the fare of sleeper class tickets, plus a super-fast charge of Rs 30 and an additional charge of Rs 20 for the Shramik Specials.Hitting out at the Union Government for burdening the states, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the situation with migrant workers was a result of the Centre’s abrupt announcement of the lockdown.“It is very unfair that the entire responsibility has been shifted to state governments. This problem was not caused by states. In the Parliament, the government said it bore the entire cost of repatriating Indians stuck abroad. In the same manner, the migrants should have been sent back. Anyway, thousands of crores have been directed to PM-CARES,” Yechury said.The Railways rolled out the special trains on Friday. Normally, it said in the guidelines, the trains would be run for distances more than 500 km and would not stop at any station before the destination. Each train with full-length composition with social distancing (not counting the middle berths) could carry about 1,200 passengers.“The originating state shall plan the group of travellers accordingly. The occupancy of the train should not be less than 90 per cent. Railways shall print train tickets to the specified destination, as per the number of passengers indicated by originating state and hand them over to the local state government authority. The local state government authority shall handover tickets to passengers cleared by them and collect the ticket fare and hand over the total amount to Railways,” the guidelines added.The state government would issue food packets and drinking water at the originating points, it said. It would be mandatory for all passengers to wear face covers, the guidelines added. “The originating state will encourage all passengers to download and use Aarogya Setu App,” it said.At the destination, passengers would be received by state government authorities, who would arrange for their screening, quarantine, if necessary, and further travel.“Railways reserves the right to discontinue Shramik Special train operations if safety, security and hygiene protocols are flouted at any stage,” the guidelines issued to all zonal general managers said.The Railways has denied charging the migrants and said they were dealing only with state governments. And officials said it was not possible to waive these charges as the national transporter was incurring running charges as well as the cost of meals. “Our trains are coming back empty. The charges we have levied are nominal,” an official said.However, criticising the decision to charge for the travels, SP leader Akhilesh Yadav said exploiting the poor during a disaster is the “job of money lenders, not the government”.“The news of the BJP government taking money from the poor, helpless labourers going back home by train is very shameful. It has become clear that the BJP, which pardons billions to capitalists, is with the rich and against the poor. Exploiting during a disaster is the job of money lenders, not the government,” he tweeted in Hindi.Karnataka Congress president DK Shivakumar said his party was ready to provide aid to the state government for payment of the train fare.“Giving Rs one crore cheque to the KSRTC from the KPCC for ensuring free transport to our working class and labour people who are suffering to reach home because of the rates being charged by the Karnataka government. Govt should let us know if they need more, the KPCC will fulfil that as well,” he tweeted.The Railways ran five trains on Friday, the first day of operations of the Shramik Specials, followed by 10 on Saturday. For Sunday, it has planned 25 trains. However, a consolidated list of trains that ran on Sunday is still not available. On Monday, it will run its first train to West Bengal.

03-05-2020||New Delhi||Covid-19: Lockdown 3.0 begins from Monday with ‘considerable relaxations’||India prepared for the third phase of the national lockdown from Monday with “considerable relaxations” in several districts but curbs will continue in containment areas even as Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said people will have to be ready to live with coronavirus and that time has come to re-open the city.As coronavirus cases jumped by 2,487 in the highest ever 24-hour spike and the fatalities rose by a record 83, officials cautioned against any violation of the lockdown curbs so that the gains achieved so far in the battle against COVID-19 are not “squandered away”. The lockdown was imposed on March 25 and is slated to last till May 17 after two extensions putting the total period of restrictions at 54 days.Retailers and traders expect to re-open more shops under the new relaxed guidelines although they are still seeking clarity from local authorities.As he announced the implementation of all lockdown relaxations prescribed by the Centre for the ‘Red Zone’ in the national capital, Kejriwal said coronavirus is going nowhere and it is impossible that the positive cases in the country will be zero.According to the Union Health ministry on Sunday, the death toll stood at 1,306 while the total cases climbed to 40,263 on Sunday. The recovery rate was nearly 25 per cent.Health Minister Harsh Vardhan urged people to observe the extended two-week period of lockdown in letter and spirit and treat it as an effective intervention to cut down the chain of transmission of COVID-19.According to the health ministry, as on Friday, there were 130 ‘Red’ zones, maximum of 19 in UP, followed by 14 in Maharashtra. The number of ‘Orange’ Zones was 284 and ‘Green’ was 319.According to the data received on Sunday, for the past three days, the doubling rate of the virus is 12.0, for seven days it is 11.7 and for 14 days it is 10.4, the minister was quoted as saying in a statement.Retailers Association of India (RAI) said it will have to be seen how the third phase of lockdown works out at the ground as there is confusion, and many states are yet to come up with guidelines to follow the Centre’s decision.Similarly, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) also claimed they will be in a “dilemma” as there is confusion over “what constitutes a neighbourhood shop and a standalone shop”, while organised retailers such as Future Group and V-Mart Retail said they are also seeking permissions from local authorities.“Some parts of the businesses will reopen. What we see is that there is the possibility of opening of some standalone stores...We will open wherever we can and we will talk to the local authorities to open. We will have to see how it works out.Expressing similar concerns, CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said, “The traders will be in a dilemma”.National General Secretary of the Federation of All India Vyapar Mandal, V K Bansal said, “The biggest problem with the guidelines is that it all depends on the states. The states frame their own policies and do not want to take any responsibility. The Centre wants relaxation but states are restrictive”.Fighter jets and transport aircraft of the Indian Air Force (IAF) carried out fly-pasts over major cities and towns while military choppers showered petals on leading hospitals across the country as part of a mega exercise to express gratitude to lakhs of doctors, paramedics and other front-line workers battling the coronavirus pandemic.Prime Minister Narendra Modi  hailed the mega exercise, calling  It a great gesture.

03-05-2020||Lucknow||Opposition accuses Lucknow admin of ‘naming’ coronavirus hotspots after mosques||Opposition parties here have accused Lucknow administration of targeting Muslims by “naming” some coronavirus hotspots after local mosques, a charge rejected by officials who said the authorities were just following a set practice.In the initial list of hotspots in the Uttar Pradesh capital, eight mosques were mentioned by the administration while identifying the areas.For example, the list in Hindi said, “In police station Kaisarbagh, area around Phoolbagh Masjid.” “The administration has named hotspots after mosques in Lucknow. This is unfortunate,” state Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu told PTI.“This is a pandemic which did not attack a particular religion. It has nothing to do with a particular religion or sect. The government should focus on increasing testing facilities. The government is hiding its failures with such moves,” he said.Samajwadi Party legislator Rajpal Kashyap also criticised the administration.“What message does the administration want to give to the people by naming the hotspots after mosques,” he asked.“Coronavirus did not target any particular community. The focus should be on treating patients, making people aware and taking measures like sanitisation to check the spread,” he said.He alleged that the way the list was made is “discriminatory” and “suits the political agenda of the government”.Officials, however, rejected the charge that a particular community was being targeted. They said the mosques were mentioned because coronavirus cases were detected in their vicinity.“This is just to pinpoint an area where more cases have been found, nothing else. This is an old practice and there is no political colour to it,” a senior official said.Lucknow has so far reported 226 cases and one death due to coronavirus.The mosques named to identify areas around them include Masjid Ali Jaan in Sadar Bazar, Mohammadiya Masjid in Wazirganj, Khajoor Wali Masjid in Triveni Nagar, Nazarbagh Masjid in Kaiserbagh and  Rajauli Masjid in Gudumba.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had on Saturday blamed Tablighi Jamaat members for the spread of COVID-19 after their return from a congregation in New Delhi.“Being infected with a virus is not a crime but to hide it is definitely one,” he said.According to official figures, 1,138 coronavirus cases out of the 2,579 detected in the state so far are linked to Tablighi Jamaat members and those who came in contact with them.

It was extended up to May 3 and again till May 17. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/relaxations-for-movement-during-lockdown-given-to-migrant-workers-only-not-for-others-mha-79880
03-05-2020||New Delhi||Lockdown 3.0: Confused home owners, uncertain domestic help await clarity on relaxation||Babita Rai, a 35-year-old domestic help from Zamrudpur in south Delhi, has been without work for over 40 days now. With her depleted savings and an additional loan of Rs 20,000 coming to an end, Babita and her husband are uncertain about their future even as the country readies to get some relaxation from the ongoing lockdown.The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had issued new guidelines on Friday to ease some of the restrictions on essential and non-essential services during the third phase of the lockdown, which starts from Monday.While the ministry asked the resident welfare associations (RWAs) to take a call regarding allowing the movement of outsiders, several house helps were either told to not come or are not aware about the RWAs’ decisions.“No one has asked me to come back for work. I am without any work for over 40 days now. I did call them to check whether we can resume our work, while most denied one family, who are putting up on rent, said the owners of the house are not allowing them,” Rai told PTI.Before the lockdown came into effect on March 24, Babita was working in three houses in Greater Kailash, earning anything between Rs 6,000-10,000 per month.On Sunday evening, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal cleared the confusion and announced that “self-employed” persons will be allowed to work.“The self-employed people like technicians, plumbers, electricians, mechanics, sanitation workers, domestic help, and people involved with laundry and ironing are allowed to work,” Kejriwal said.Another worker, Rekha from Vasundhara, Ghaziabad, is afraid to step out fearing the police may reprimand her and has not heard about any RWA decision in this regard.“There is no work and whatever money I had saved is almost gone. I do not know if societies may allow us to work from tomorrow. I do not know how we will survive if we do not go back to work,” she said.Rekha had returned to Ghaziabad from her daughter’s wedding in Bihar just in time before the lockdown restricted inter-state movement.Not just domestic helps, but home-makers are also in the dark as they await to hear from their RWA secretaries.“We were told that there will be an RWA meeting today about allowing maids to come in, but we have not heard anything so far. While it would be of great help if they are allowed, we will still have to be careful,” said Aniket Sharma, a resident of a gated society in Ghaziabad.The movement restriction has hit the lower income class groups hard as another domestic worker Pinky from Noida sector 39 rued that the lockdown has rendered her jobless and her family hungry.“All my employers had told me that they would call when they wanted me to come to work, but I have not heard from anyone yet. Running the household has become extremely difficult. We are eating one meal a day because I have not got my salary for the last two months,” Pinky said.The confusion over permission to domestic workers has not spared the RWAs either.Nivedita Upadhyay, a home-maker from Greater Noida, was told by the Resident Welfare Association of her area that they are awaiting instructions from the state government.“The RWA has told us that they are awaiting guidelines from the state regarding the relaxation. Our society had restricted the entry of maids, drivers, newspaper vendors etc from March 25 itself. Besides, allowing maids to work here is risky since most of the domestic help comes from Aicher village, which of late has recorded a lot of COVID-19 positive cases,” she said.On the other side, Anindyo Sengupta, a homeowner from Gurgaon, was relieved to know that her domestic help can resume work, but only after briefing her on all precautionary measures.“I am actually quite relieved that she will be returning. My husband and I had shared the workload, but it was getting very difficult to manage the household without her. “Since my mother lives with us, I have briefed her on all precautionary measures like keeping her nose and mouth covered, and washing hands and feet before getting started,” Sengupta said.

03-05-2020||New Delhi||Time has come to re-open Delhi; people will have to be ready to live with COVID-19: Kejriwal||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, on Sunday, said the time had come to re-open Delhi, and people would have to be ready to live with COVID-19, as he announced the implementation of all lockdown relaxations prescribed by the Centre for the red zones in the national capital.Addressing an online media briefing, Kejriwal said the Delhi government would suggest to the Centre that only containment areas in the city be declared as red zones and not the entire district.At present, all 11 districts in the city have been declared as red zones.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said COVID-19 was going nowhere and it was impossible that cases of COVID-19 would be zero.“It is impossible that there will be no cases of COVID-19 because it has not happened across the world. We will have to be ready to live with the virus. We will have to get used to it,” he said.Delhi has been under lockdown since March 23.He said the government’s earnings and economy had been badly affected due to the COVID-induced lockdown, adding that Delhi was ready to relax full lockdown restrictions.He cited figures saying in April 2019, the government earned Rs 3,500 crore while in April this year, it only received Rs 300 crore.He said people were losing jobs and traders were suffering because there was no business, adding “we will not be able to continue this for long because of no revenue generation due to the lockdown.”“The Centre has put the entire Delhi under the red zone, owing to which markets, malls cannot open. We have suggested the Centre to seal those areas where cases of COVID-19 have been reported and the rest can be allowed for operation of all activities,” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said.“The time has come to re-open Delhi and we are ready for it. We are in touch with the Centre. We hope that markets will start operating soon in Delhi. It may cause a rise in the number of cases, but we are ready to deal with the situation,” he said.Kejriwal said the Delhi government would also take strict action against those who spit in public. He added that the movement of people from 7 pm to 7 am would not be allowed, as suggested by the Centre.Kejriwal said the government and private offices would open from Monday, but the suspension of travel by flight, metro and bus would continue.Delivery of essential goods through e-commerce portals would continue in the national capital, he said.Delhi government offices, engaged in essential services, would function with full strength while offices of non-essential services and private offices can operate with 33 per cent strength.“Malls, cinemas, salons, market complexes and Delhi Metro will remain shut while shops selling essentials will continue will be open,” he said, adding that 50 people would be allowed in a marriage function.He said funeral-related gatherings would ensure social distancing, and the maximum numbers allowed would not be more than 20.According to the government, manufacturing units of essential goods, including drugs, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and their raw material would be allowed.Jute industry with staggered shifts and social distancing and manufacturing of IT hardware and manufacturing units of packaging material would continue to be permitted.Services provided by self-employed persons such as electrician, plumber, lift technician, AC mechanic, vehicle mechanic, generator mechanic, TV mechanic and Dish TV are among those to be allowed from Monday.Movement of individuals and vehicles is allowed only for permitted activities, with a maximum of two persons (besides the driver) in four-wheeler vehicles, and with no pillion rider in the case of two-wheelers.

03-05-2020||New Delhi||Rate of growth of new COVID-19 cases steadying for a while: Centre||Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Sunday said the rate of growth of new COVID-19 cases has been steadying for a while and the recovery rate improving, adding that India is on the path of success and will win the war against the pandemic. He said around 10,000 COVID-19 patients have recovered so far.“The recovery rate of COVID-19 patients has steadily increased which shows that more and more of these patients are getting better and going back home,” he said.“The rate of growth of new cases has also been steadying for a while,” Vardhan said. According to the data received on Sunday, for the past three days, the doubling rate of the virus is 12.0, for seven days it is 11.7 and for 14 days it is 10.4, the minister was quoted as saying in a statement.“We have crossed over 10 lakh tests till date and are performing over 74,000 tests in a day presently,” he said.The minister added that the government has distributed around 20 lakh PPE kits all over India and supplied medicines [both Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and Paracetamol (PCM)] to more than 100 countries. He said India is on a “better footing” as compared to other nations, adding the country is capable to pull off any eventuality with more than 2.5 lakh beds in dedicated COVID-19 hospitals and health centres. Vardhan also urged the people to observe the extended period of lockdown 3.0 (till May 17) in letter and spirit and treat it as an effective intervention to cut down the chain of transmission of COVID-19. “We are on the path of success and we will win this war against COVID-19,” he asserted.The health minister urged people to not ostracise the doctors treating COVID-19 patients or stigmatise the patients who have won the battle against the deadly disease.“They are our heroes and need a worthy treatment,” he said. The minister also had a word of praise for the “corona warriors”. “Today, the Indian Air Force is acknowledging these warriors, throughout the country, by sprinkling them with flower petals through helicopters,” he said.Fighter jets and transport aircraft of the Indian Air Force on Sunday carried out fly-pasts over major cities and towns, while military choppers showered petals on leading hospitals across the country as part of a mega exercise to express gratitude to lakhs of doctors, paramedics and other front-line workers battling the coronavirus pandemic.Vardhan said the fight of India with COVID-19 is “lauded not only by WHO, but by the whole world in unison”. He also paid a visit to the Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC), one of India’s oldest and established medical colleges, to review the status of COVID-19 management. At the COVID-19 block in the hospital, Vardhan spoke through video call to two intern doctors who got infected with the virus while treating patients at LHMC, and were admitted at the facility. He also interacted with two patients admitted in the COVID-19 ward through the digital platform, who, in turn, apprised him about the facilities in the coronavirus ward. “In last few days, I have been visiting various hospitals like AIIMS (Delhi), LNJP, RML, Safdarjung, AIIMS Jhajjar, Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty and now LHMC to review the preparedness of COVID-19 and I am satisfied with the arrangements made by these hospitals to deal effectively with the outbreak,” he said. He said there are 130 Hotspots Districts, 284 Non-hotspots Districts and 319 Non-infected Districts.According to the health ministry, the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country is 39,980.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rate-of-growth-of-new-covid-19-cases-steadying-for-a-while-centre-79876

03-05-2020||New Delhi||Sewage could spread Covid-19, monitor discharge points, say environmentalists||Environmentalists in the country have voiced concerns over reports about Covid-19 spreading through less-explored route of domestic sewage discharge and into inland water bodies.Various environmental networks which are currently debating the issue are referring to recent CPCB guidelines advising sanitation workers to use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to back their claim.Though the risk of transmission of virus through sewerage systems is believed to be low, environmentalists claim SARS-CoV2 is detectable in sewage in affected areas even before the detection of any clinically confirmed case. “Thus, it is clear that monitoring sewage discharge points can work as an early warning system and help faster and more information based containment, rather than random wide-spread lockdowns,” says environmentalist Soumya Dutta.“We really don't know the extent of threat, but must start monitoring,” Dutta says, adding that environmental networks are collating information and will  soon write to the Centre and the States to flag the “serious concern”.  “If found happening, it will present a new threat for the community transmission of the virus at a large scale,” warns Dutta, drawing attention to some international reports claiming presence of the virus in sewage discharges in Paris and Amersfoort  and also some “RNA of the virus being found in Chennai sewage”. “Several advanced countries have reported the detection of SARS-CoV2 virus in the sewage of their major cities, which have advanced sewage treatment systems. They include Paris and Amersfoort. If we test, we will find it in sewage of most cities and towns sewage affected by Covid-19. “European and Canadian cities that tested and found the virus in their untreated sewage have a robust sewage treatment infrastructure. Roughly 50% of municipal liquid waste or sewage is discharged untreated to mostly inland water bodies and coastal waters. These will be seeing contact with millions of people once lockdown is lifted,” he says."Given that Indian urban sewage handling systems are not as robust the threat of partially treated or untreated sewage from affected areas carrying viruses into water bodies remains. Indians in rural India use these waters directly or after simple mechanical filtration.   "Even many town's and municipalities draw these waters for their simple mechanical municipal water purification setups, without any means of killing possible virus loads. These can possibly lead to future outbreaks once the lockdown is lifted and people go out and come in contact with contaminated water” are the worries the networks are planning to flag to the government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sewage-could-spread-covid-19-monitor-discharge-points-say-environmentalists-79873

The officials deputed from MoRTH in the MHA control room will assist in complaint/grievance resolution relating to the Transport sector/Drivers. The MoRTH officials would also compile the daily report on such complaints received,” the statement noted.Noting that that movement during the lockdown is governed by the MHA orders and guidelines, it is further clarified that the ministry provides for “redressal of complaints by drivers and transporters on passage of goods carriers including empty trucks and inter-state movement of the driver/cleaner from their residence to and fro to the truck parking area”.In the statement the MHA hoped that this mechanism “is expected to greatly address the issues/hurdles” in the movement of goods across States/UTs during lockdown aimed at curbing COVID-19 pandemic in the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-mha-control-room-to-directly-resolve-truck-drivers-woes-79871
03-05-2020||Naveen S Garewal||They seek little caring, not just flower petals||Tribune News ServiceHyderabad, May 3At a time when the entire nation is facilitating corona-warriors by showering flower petals over hospitals and playing drums to recognise their efforts to keep “duty over self”, there is a group of sanitation workers at the Gandhi Hospital at Hyderabad, who have made their workplace home.It’s not because they want to stay away from loved ones, they have been forced to take this step because of the village where they live fears that they will bring the virus back with them.Mostly they are residents of the Medipally village near Chengincherla in Medchal district on city outskirts, these sanitation workers have been ostracised since these workers are exposed to COVID-19 at Gandhi Hospital, where most of the virus victims are being treated.As a consequence this, sanitary workers have decided to turn a shelter home on campus as their home. This facility is otherwise use by relatives of the admitted patients.Earning barely Rs 7,000 per month as salary, these workers are risking their lives on a daily basis. But all they receive in return is scorn and ostracism. “Recently, a COVID-19 patient vomited in the ward, causing everyone to panic. It was one of us who cleaned it risking our own health,” says one of the workers on conditions of anonymity.There is no particular arrangement for food for the workers at the temporary make shift home. Either some staff nurses or attendants of patients leave them food on which they are surviving. “Our families tell us that the villagers have said we would be allowed back home if we get a certificate from the hospital stating we tested negative for COVID-19”, one of them said.Kanaka Durga, a nurse working from at Gandhi hospital for past 13 years says the ground situation for nurses is no different. “While the nation is encouraging the corona-warriors by flying planes and showering flower petals, the reaction of the people is very different. Mostly our neighbours have started avoiding us. Even if they talk it is to express concern that we would be putting them at risk.”Apart from Kanaka, there are 18 other nurses staying in the hostels of the medical college due to various issues being faced by them at theirhometowns and colonies. Another nurse who is a lactating mother is not allowed to feed her infant baby back at home. The baby is surviving only on Ceralac and other milk products as the father is afraid that the baby will get infected through the mother’s milk, disclosed another nurse.“Staff is getting body rashes after wearing those PPE kits for the whole day to treat COVID-19 patients. We are finding it difficult to make time to eat or even take breaks to relieve ourselves,” Durga told the media.Most of the nurses had gone on protest demanding regularisation for those who had been working at the hospital for over 15 years. However, they had come back to work after just a day, seeing the plight of the patients.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/they-seek-little-caring-not-just-flower-petals-79869

The suicides are followed by 51 migrants dying in accidents on their way back home. Deaths associated with withdrawal symptoms are reported as high as 45 while those related to starvation and financial distress stand at 36.“There have been a staggering number of suicides, caused by fear of infection, loneliness, lack of freedom of movement, and alcohol withdrawal during the lockdown. For instance, unable to handle withdrawal (a medical condition), as many as seven people have died after consuming aftershave and sanitiser lotions. A large number of migrant labourers stuck in quarantine facilities, away from family, died by suicide, fearing infection, and sometimes even the stigma attached to the disease,” the group said in a statement.Other causes of the “non-COVID deaths” were exhaustion (24), including workers travelling long distances on foot or queuing for ration; 11 died from police atrocity/state violence; 12 lockdown-related crimes have been reported, including vigilantism for violating rules; and 38 were denied medical care.“There are also 41 cases where the specific cause is not clear. An example of such an incident would be where there is a conflict between the account of the state and family/friends of the deceased about the cause of the death,” said Aman.“Also, it must be understood these deaths were likely an underestimate — only a fraction of deaths as per reported by the media and we may have missed some deaths reported in local media as well.”The group tracked newspapers and web portals in a handful of languages – primarily English, Hindi, and a few vernaculars (Kannada, Marathi, Tamil, Bengali, Odia, and Malayalam), and social media to compile the data.According to the latest Union Health Ministry data on Sunday morning, the COVID-19 death toll in the country rose to 1,301. The number of cases climbed to 39,980.The nationwide lockdown began on March 25 and will last till May 17.

03-05-2020||New Delhi||Rise in coronavirus cases expected to stabilise anytime soon: Niti Aayog member||The continuous rise in the number of people testing positive for coronavirus is expected to stabilise anytime soon, Niti Aayog member V K Paul said on Sunday.He also said the rationale behind the government’s decision to extend the lockdown by two more weeks after May 3 is to consolidate the gains of the first and second phase of restrictions.In an interview to PTI, Paul said sudden spurt in number of coronavirus cases is still amenable to containment strategy.“The rationale (behind extending the lockdown till May 17) is that the gains of lockdown need to be consolidated in the country...Real goal of lockdown was to suppress the chain of transmission of the virus. So, we will lose that, if we abruptly end it,” he said.Paul, who is heading an Empowered Group on medical equipment and management plan to tackle coronavirus outbreak, said at the same time where situation is good, the opening will take place with caution and care.Replying to a question that whether India has slipped into community transmission stage, he said, “Essentially, we think it (continuous rise in coronavirus cases) is still amenable to containment strategy”.He also noted that India is nowhere close to the kind of escalation of coronavirus cases that it witnessed during the pre-lockdown phase.“In the pre-lockdown stage, we were doubling our number of cases in every five days. Before that even at every 3 days. Now, we are doubling in 11-12 days.“So, overall the rate of spread has diminished but yes the number still has not stabilised. But we expect it to stabilise anytime soon,” the Niti Aayog member said.Reacting to criticism that India is not doing enough tests, Paul said India’s testing strategy has been fine-tuned from time to time based on the stage of coronavirus disease.On what will be the new normal after the lockdown ends, the Niti Aayog member said working from home wherever possible, will become a new normal until pandemic is totally extinguished.“After the lockdown ends, our new normal is going to be very different. There will be no big collection of people, there will be no religion congregation or big events.“We will have to wear masks. Lots of things will change until the pandemic is totally extinguished,” he observed.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 1,301 and the number of cases climbed to 39,980 in the country on Sunday, according to the Union Health Ministry.The Centre has extended the lockdown by two more weeks after May 3, when the second phase of these restrictions was scheduled to end.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had first announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown from March 25, which was later extended by two more weeks to contain the virus spread.However, several experts have cautioned that the lockdown is severely impacting the economy and many rating agencies and industry bodies have forecast a sharp dip in the country’s economic growth rate for the current fiscal. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rise-in-coronavirus-cases-expected-to-stabilise-anytime-soon-niti-aayog-member-79862
03-05-2020||New Delhi||Post ICJ, India tried to persuade Pak through back channel to release Kulbhushan: Harish Salve||India had hoped it might be able to persuade Pakistan through “back channel” to release retired Indian Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was sentenced to death by a Pakistan military court on charges of “espionage and terrorism” in 2017, senior advocate Harish Salve has said.Salve was the lead counsel for India in the Jadhav case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which had last year ruled that Pakistan must review the death sentence awarded to the retired naval officer after a closed trial.During an online lecture series organised by the Akhil Bharatiya Adhivakta Parishad, affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) on Saturday, Salve from London said the Indian side has kept on asking how do Pakistan propose to carry out the ICJ judgement and give effective review and reconsideration, but no answer has been forthcoming.“We were hoping that through back channel, we may be able to persuade Pakistan to let him go. If they want to say on humanitarian ground or whatever, we want him back. We said let him go. Because it has become a big ego problem in Pakistan. So, we were hoping that they will let him go. They haven’t,” he said, while answering a question on the current situation in the matter.“We have written four-five letters. They just keep on denying,” he said.“I think we have reached a point where we have to now decide whether we want to go back to ICJ for consequential directions because Pakistan has not moved ahead.”         Salve said that following the ICJ order, Pakistan had granted consular access but it was too late and “we have now been in a tussle with Pakistan to get them to set up machinery”.“Pakistan believes, first of all they told the whole world they have won the case, good for them. And now, they keep saying that you have to file a proceeding in a Pakistani court or take Pakistani proceedings,” he said.“We keep saying how you propose to carry out the judgement of ICJ and give effective review and reconsideration. They refuse to answer that question. We have had exchanges backward and forward. I think the Government of India has been writing to them and who knows the way things are going, we may have to go back in the ICJ someday, trying to get justice for Jadhav,” Salve said.He said till date, Pakistan has refused to share the case details such as the FIR, the chargesheet or the judgement of the military court in the matter.Responding to a question about the alleged offensive languages used by lawyer representing Pakistan at the ICJ, Salve said the Pakistan’s lawyer had used very “strong language” against India.“In the ICJ, we never used words like these. I did the word check and worlds like disgusting, lying and dishonest have been used by Pakistan many times,” he said.Salve said that he did not want to stoop to the Pakistan’s level as Indian traditions did not allow him to use such bad words and, moreover, he respected the ICJ and its portal.

Only five shops selling non-essential goods will be allowed to open in a single lane under the new rules, said Mehta.Maharashtra government would, however, be reviewing the new rules and might make changes if required, Mehta added.As of now, 14 districts in Maharashtra have been categorised as red zones, of which five are in the Mumbai and Pune metropolitan regions, and Malegaon.Tighter restrictions in Mumbai and Pune will mean that one to two people, and a driver, will be allowed to use personal vehicles in exceptional circumstances. Only industries in special economic zones (SEZs) and export-oriented units will be allowed to commence operations in the red zones while construction activities will be permitted with workers present on the sites.The government has also decided to tighten restriction on movement of people from the red zones.

Several brewers in Gurgaon have started draining beer as the plants need electricity to maintain a specific temperature for keeping the beer fresh, he said.According to Craft Brewers Association of India, all plants storing about eight lakh litres of fresh beer have remained shut due to the nationwide lockdown and if a solution is not found at the earliest, lakhs of litres of brewed beer will go down the drain.As the Centre has further extended the lockdown for two weeks, the association has demanded that microbreweries should be allowed to start take-away facility with the help of beer growlers so that their business is not affected.“Several relaxations have been given in latest guidelines, but beer bars and clubs have not been given any relaxation.“We should be allowed to start take-away facility with beer growlers. By doing this, social-distancing can strictly be followed,” Nakul Bhonsle, president of Maharashtra Craft Brewers Association of Indian, told PTI.Bhonsle said that in around 35 countries such a facility is in place for years and people take away fresh beer in growlers.Sibi Venkataraju, who runs brewpub Toit in Bengaluru and is the national officer bearer of Craft Brewers Association of India, said that there are 250-odd microbreweries in the country and they provide employment to around 50,000 people.He said that the beer plants have remained shut since the lockdown came into force on March 25.Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) general director Vinod Giri said they have estimated that around 1.2 million cases of IMFL are stuck due to the lockdown in northern states, except Delhi.“This stock worth Rs 700 crore was to be finished by the end of previous financial year, but the nationwide lockdown came into force on March 25, so we could not clear it.“We will need approval of state governments to sell the old stock of 1.2 million cases of IMFL” in the new financial year, Giri told PTI.According to the latest lockdown guidelines issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, sale of liquor, paan and tobacco will be allowed from Monday after ensuring a minimum six feet social distancing with not more than five persons at one time at shop.These shops should not be located in markets and malls in urban areas.All shops in rural areas, except in malls, are permitted to remain open without any distinction of essential and non-essential.

Despite that, the complaints were highest since August last year, the NCW data showed.During previous months, the complaints included those received online and those received by posts.NCW Chairperson Rekha Sharma has said the high numbers can be attributed to the lockdown - imposed since March 25 - which has locked the abuser and the victim together.The NCW has launched a WhatsApp number -- 7217735372 -- to report cases of domestic violence.It shared a few case studies of the kind of domestic violence complaints they have received during the lock-down period.In one of the cases, a girl complained that she is being beaten up by her parents and forced to get married.        The NCW contacted the police following her complaint and she was shifted to a shelter home.In another case, a man in Tripura complained to NCW that his sister was being physically abused in her in-laws home and she is not able to step out due to lockdown.“We coordinated with the police which rescued her,” an NCW member said.Another set of cases relate to women getting locked out of their in-laws home.“Each case is different and whatever the requirement is we act accordingly,” the member said.In a bid to facilitate women to reach out to seek aid, a number of helpline numbers have been launched for reporting crimes against women, especially domestic violence.A total of 800 complaints were received by NCW of various crimes committed against women, the NCW data showed.While domestic violence constituted nearly 40 per cent of the total, the other offence which saw a significant rise in the month of April was cyber crime.Experts have attributed the rise to the ongoing lockdown which has resulted in “caged predators” attacking women online.According to the NCW data, 54 cyber complaints (online) were received in April in comparison to 37 (online and by post) in March and 21 (online and by post) in February. Due to lockdown, only online complaints were received in April.India is currently under the world’s biggest lockdown with around 1.3 billion people asked to stay home in view of the coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed over 1,300 lives and infected 39,980 people in the country. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-ncw-receives-315-domestic-violence-complaints-in-april-79834

To get a disease is not a crime but to hide a disease which is infectious is definitely a crime. And this crime has been done by those associated with the Tablighi Jamaat.”          “In Uttar Pradesh and other places where the spread of the coronavirus has been seen, Tablighi Jamaat is behind it. Had they not hidden the disease and went about like its carriers, then perhaps we would have controlled the coronavirus outbreak to a large extent,” he had said.A Tablighi Jamaat congregation held in March in Delhi’s Nizamuddin area significantly contributed to the doubling of coronavirus cases in India. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/adityanath-blames-tablighi-jamaat%C2%A0-members-for-spread-of%C2%A0-covid-19-79806

However, during the process, the team was subjected to heavy volume of fire by the terrorists. In the ensuing firefight two terrorists were eliminated.”Five security personnel — two Army officers, two Army soldiers and one JK Police Sub-Inspector — were killed in action.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/handwara-martyr-had-won-two-gallantry-awards-within-18-months-79805

We will win this war against COVID-19,” he said after visiting the Lady Hardinge Medical College Hospital (LHMC) in Delhi to review the status of COVID-19 management.He said around 10,000 people have been cured of the disease so far.“The recovery rate of COVID-19 patients has steadily increased, which shows that more and more patients are getting better and going back home. The rate of growth of new cases has also been steadying for a while,” he said.According to data received on Sunday, for the past three days the doubling rate of the virus is 12 days, for seven days it is 11.7 and for 14 days it is 10.4, the minister was quoted as saying in a statement.“We have crossed over 10 lakh tests and are performing over 74,000 tests in a day presently,” he said.The government has distributed around 20 lakh PPE kits all over India and supplied medicines, both hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and paracetamol (PCM), to more than 100 countries, Vardhan added.He said India is on a “better footing” compared to other nations in managing the pandemic, adding that with more than 2.5 lakh beds in dedicated COVID-19 hospitals and health centres, the country is capable of pulling off any eventuality. The health minister urged people not to ostracise doctors treating COVID-19 patients or stigmatise those who have survived the deadly disease.According to the Health Ministry’s evening update, the number of active COVID-19 cases stood at 28,070, while 10,886 people have recovered and one patient has migrated.The total number of cases also includes 111 foreign nationals.Of the 83 deaths reported since Saturday evening, 36 were from Maharashtra, 26 from Gujarat, 11 from Madhya Pradesh, three each from Rajasthan and Delhi, two from Telangana and one each from Tamil Nadu and Bihar.With 521 fatalities, Maharashtra accounts for the maximum of the nationwide 1,306 deaths. Gujarat comes second with 262 deaths, followed by Madhya Pradesh 156, Rajasthan 65, Delhi 64, Uttar Pradesh 43, and West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh 33 each.The death toll reached 29 in Tamil Nadu, 28 in Telangana, while Karnataka has reported 25 fatalities due to the respiratory disease.Punjab has registered 20 COVID-19 deaths, Jammu and Kashmir eight, Kerala, Bihar and Haryana have reported four deaths each.

Of them, 10,661 have been cured and discharged.There has been a lag in the Union Health Ministry figures, compared to the aggregate of numbers announced by different states, which officials attribute to procedural delays in assigning the cases to individual states.Vardhan, in his remarks, said India’s fight against COVID-19 is “lauded not only by WHO, but by the whole world in unison”.At the COVID-19 block in the Lady Hardinge Medical College Hospital, Vardhan spoke through video call to two intern doctors who got infected with the virus while treating patients and were admitted at the facility.He also interacted with two patients admitted in the COVID-19 ward through the digital platform, who, in turn, apprised him about the facilities in the ward. “In last few days, I have been visiting various hospitals like AIIMS (Delhi), LNJP, RML, Safdarjung, AIIMS, Jhajjar, Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty and now LHMC to review the preparedness of COVID-19. I am satisfied with the arrangements made by these hospitals to effectively deal with the coronavirus outbreak,” Vardhan said. He also said there are 130 COVID-19 hotspots districts, 284 non-hotspot districts and 319 non-infected districts in the country.

But they never did get there.Some bought cycles with their little savings and others just set off on the long walk, in shoes with paper thin soles or flip flops, their few belongings packed into backpacks or unwieldy bundles.On Friday night, the first special train ferrying over 1,200 stranded migrants from Telangana reached Hatia in Jharkhand from where the state government took them to their respective districts in sanitised buses in accordance with Covid-19 protocols. Sometime around then, 32-year-old Dharamveer was declared brought dead at a hospital in Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh. He began cycling, along with other labourers like him, from Delhi to Khagaria in Bihar, about 1,200 km away, on April 28, police said."When Dharamveer's condition deteriorated, the labourers took him to the medical college where he was declared brought dead," Circle Officer (city) Praveen Kumar said. The day before, 50-year-old Tabarat died in Sendhwa in Madhya Pradesh after cycling over 390 kilometres to get home from Bhiwandi in Maharashtra to Maharajganj in Uttar Pradesh, about 1,600 km away. "He died on Thursday near Sendhwa in Barwani possibly due to fatigue and heart attack,” said Ramesh Pawar who was with him.The unprecedented move to stem Covid spread triggered possibly the biggest movement of people since Partition.Insaf Ali, 35, was even closer. He reached his village in Uttar Pradesh's Shravasti district but did not make it home. Ali walked or hitched 1,500 km from Mumbai to Shravast. He worked as a helper to a mason in Mumbai before the lockdown and reached Mathkanwa village where he was quarantined early on Monday morning this week. By noon, he was dead. The media recorded several such stories, of workers desperate to be with their families in the uncertain days of a pandemic but dying before they reached their destination.The first reported casualty of this exodus was 39-year-old Ranveer Singh, who worked as a delivery boy for a restaurant in Delhi and died in Agra after walking for over 200 km to Morena in MP. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-deaths-of-those-who-never-reached-home-79614

These industrial districts should be classified as containment, orange and green with economic activity permitted in varying degrees.The top districts could be identified on the basis of their contribution to GDP or presence of industrial estates or registration of enterprises, it has suggested in a strategy paper submitted to the government on resuming economic activities in industrial areas. The CII has also asked for the removal of distinction between essential and non-essential items, besides permission to all factories to restart operations. “Such an approach will help enterprises remain financially sustainable while averting job losses,’’ argues CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/let-all-units-run-in-industrial-districts-cii-79610

While Omar’s PSA detention was quashed on March 24 and he walked free from royal era palace Hari Niwas, exactly 11 days after his father and also former Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah was set free after having spent more than seven months under the PSA detention, Mehbooba was kept incarcerated.The sources told The Tribune that Mehbooba’s detention under PSA would be reviewed by an advisory board constituted by the government, as part of the mandatory review of the PSA detainees after three months ahead of May 5, when she completes three months of detention.“During the review, it would be discussed whether the grounds for slapping the PSA on her were justified now as well or her case should be considered against the backdrop of that many PSA detainees, including Abdullahs, who have been set free,” they said.“There are chances that her PSA detention may not be extended and she would be a free person again,” highly placed sources said, with a rider that the final decision would be taken by the advisory board.It is being felt that Mehbooba cannot be meted out a different legal treatment than the Abdullahs, especially when the Covid has inflicted a body blow to political activities in Kashmir, where the tally of the positive cases touched 606 on Saturday.Mehbooba was kept in a hut in Chashme Shahi in Srinagar from August 5 to November 15, 2019. She was shifted to a house in Transport Nagar, Srinagar, on November 15, and thereafter she was restored to her official residence as former Chief Minister Fairview on Gupkar Road on April 7.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mehboobas-psa-detention-to-be-reviewed-may-be-released-79609

With the extension of the lockdown, rural poor face real prospects of starvation. The elderly across many areas are already starving. The most hit by hunger are the disadvantaged older persons. Agricultural labourers are also at risk because Covid struck at the end of the agricultural season with the crop still in the field and foodgrain stocks with farm labourers having exhausted.”Cherian, a regular participant in web meetings the government has been holding with NGO partners, said food was not reaching many districts. “Our field volunteers have evidence that access to food is a major challenge in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar. We have even documented pockets of hunger in Delhi and shared details with the Delhi Government. Lockdown extension is bound to worsen the hunger situation, which could lead to starvation,” Cherian said.Relief distribution44% either having smaller meals or skipping a meal daily31% respondents admit to receiving government reliefHe said the biggest hurdle to food security was restrictive distribution of rations under government’s lockdown package.“Free ration and foodgrain are being given only to those with white ration cards who fall below the poverty line. The rest, who may not be BPL but are equally vulnerable to food insecurity on account of lockdown constraints, are neither getting free foodgrain nor government pension,” said Cherian.In surveys across rural India, HelpAge has also found that the government’s principal anti-Covid messaging of “social distancing” is isolating the already vulnerable elderly, who are facing maximum stigma being at a disproportionate risk of Covid death. Government analysis has shown that more than half of all 1,200 plus Covid deaths in India are among 60 plus people.“In villages the term social distancing is being understood as ‘samaajik doori’, which means no one is helping the elderly who continue to lie around without pension and food,” said Cherian.Several NGOs have urged the government to replace the term social distancing with physical distancing.HelpAge head Cherian today said the only way to avoid a potential starvation situation in rural India was to distribute rations to all Aadhaar cardholders universally.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rural-poor-staring-at-starvation-elderly-most-vulnerable-ngo-79608

Several bridges have been repaired and among the many tasks, the long-disused foot overbridge at Ludhiana has been removed.Machinery at workAround 500 modern machines along with overhead equipment maintainers have worked regularly to complete overdue maintenance of 12,270-km track.In Ludhiana, 100-year-old twin foot overbridges had been closed to passenger use since 2014. However, dismantling of the old bridge, which had overhead electric supply line running under it, meant closure of 10-12 hours for several days, which was not feasible on the New Delhi-Amritsar route.Apart from ensuring supply chains, the Indian Railways executed these long-pending maintenance works during the lockdown when passenger services were suspended due to Covid, the Railways said in a statement.The Railways focused on several long-pending overdue maintenance works requiring traffic block of long durations.
