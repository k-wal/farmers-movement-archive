18-05-2020||New Delhi||Entire office building needn’t be closed if 1 or 2 COVID-19 cases are reported: Health Ministry||The entire office building need not be closed if one or two cases of COVID-19 are reported there and work can resume after it is disinfected as per protocol, the Union health ministry said on Monday.However, if there is a larger outbreak, the entire building will have to be closed for 48 hours. All staff will work from home till the building is adequately disinfected and is declared fit for re-occupation, it said in the guidelines on preventive measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 in workplace settings.The document outlines the preventive and response measures to be observed to contain the spread of COVID-19 in workplace settings.It stated that any staff reportedly suffering from a flu-like illness should not attend office and seek medical advice from local health authorities. Such persons, if diagnosed as a suspect or confirmed case of COVID-19 should immediately inform office authorities, it said.“Any staff requesting home quarantine based on the containment zone activities in their residential areas should be permitted to work from home. DoPT guidelines with respect to organizing meetings, coordinating visitors shall be scrupulously followed,” the guidelines stated.The high-risk exposure contacts will be quarantined for 14 days and they will follow the guidelines on home quarantine and undergo testing as per ICMR protocol while low-risk exposure contacts shall continue to work and closely monitor their health for next 14 days, the ministry stated in the guidelines.It stated that since offices and other workplaces are relatively close setting with shared spaces like corridors, elevators and stairs, cafeteria, meeting rooms and conference halls, coronavirus infection can spread relatively fast among officials, staff and visitors.“Thus there is a need to prevent importation of infection in workplace settings and to respond in a timely and effective manner in case a suspect case of COVID-19 is detected in these settings so as to limit the spread of infection,” the ministry said in the document.The basic preventive measures include maintaining physical distancing of at least 1 metre, mandatory use of face covers or masks, practising frequent hand-washing for at least 40-60 seconds even when hands are not visibly dirty and use of alcohol-based hand sanitisers.Respiratory etiquettes such as covering mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing with a tissue, handkerchief or flexed elbow and disposing of used tissues properly should be strictly followed besides self-monitoring of health by all and reporting any illness at the earliest, the guidelines state.As for offices, guidelines with respect to preventive measures specific to offices issued by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) should be followed, it said.The ministry, however, stated that, despite taking the measures, occurrence COVID-19 infection among the employees working in the office cannot be ruled out.“If there one or two cases are reported, disinfection procedure will be limited to places/areas visited by the patient in the past 48 hrs. There is no need to close the entire office building/halt work in other areas of the office and work can be resumed after disinfection as per laid down protocol,” the guidelines noted.When one or a few persons who share a room or close office space are found to be suffering from symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, the ill person should be placed in a room or area where they are isolated from others at the workplace and should be provided a mask or face cover till such time he/she is examined by a doctor.Central or state health authorities concerned should be reported about such cases and a risk assessment will be undertaken by the designated public health authority, and accordingly, further advice shall be made regarding the management of a case, his/her contacts and need for disinfection, the guidelines stated.If a suspected case reports very mild or mild symptoms on an assessment by the health authorities, the person would be placed in home isolation, subject to fulfilment of criteria laid down in Health ministry, it stated.The rapid response team of the district concerned shall be requisitioned and will undertake the listing of contacts. The necessary actions for contact tracing and disinfection of the workplace will start once the test report of the patient is received as positive, the guidelines said.“If there are large numbers of contacts from a pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic case, there could be a possibility of a cluster emerging in a workplace setting. Due to the close environment in workplace settings, this could even be a large cluster. “The essential principles of risk assessment, isolation and quarantine of contacts, case referral and management will remain the same. However, the scale of arrangements will be higher,” the ministry said.Contacts are those who have been exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 case anytime between 2 days prior to onset of symptoms and the date of isolation or maximum 14 days after the onset of symptoms.High-risk contact are those who have touched body fluids of the patient, had direct physical contact with the patient, including physical examination without PPE, touched or cleaned the linens or dishes of the patient and was in close proximity (within 1 meter) of the confirmed case without precautions and travelled in same environment but not having a high-risk exposure. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/entire-office-building-neednt-be-closed-if-1-or-2-covid-19-cases-are-reported-health-ministry-86512
18-05-2020||---||New LAC flashpoint won’t be another Doklam: Chinese daily||New Delhi, May 18.An influential Chinese newspaper on Monday indicated the opening of another flashpoint on the Sino-India border but played down the possibility of serious tensions as had happened at Doklam in 2017Global Times, that advocates a hardheaded foreign policy approach, quoted unnamed military sources as saying that Chinese border defence troops have made necessary moves in response to “India’s recent, illegal construction of defence facilities across the border into Chinese territory in the Galwan Valley region.”The media outlet put its own spin for discounting the build-up of tensions in a sector that was last in the news during the 1962 conflict. “India is merely seeking to divert its domestic attention due to unsuccessful handling of Covid pandemic, and China has a military advantage there. So, the Indian military won’t escalate the incident,” it said quoting Chinese analysts.The paper accused India of crossing the boundary line in Galwan Valley region of Ladakh and entering Chinese territory. “The Indian side built defence fortifications and obstacles to disrupt Chinese border defence troops’ normal patrol activities, purposefully instigated conflicts and attempted to unilaterally change the current border control situation.”Indian media too has been reporting tensions in this sector for the past one week.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has not commented on this flare-up but it reacted to troop face-offs last week in two sectors by expressing confidence in the ability of the existing mechanisms to resolve the issue.The MEA also suggested that the face-offs were not part of a grand strategy by explaining that they occasionally occur due to difference in perception of the alignment of the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “Situations have arisen on the ground that could have been avoided if we had a common perception of the LAC,” MEA spokesperson Anurag Shrivastav had then said.The spokesperson also noted that the India-China border has largely been peaceful because PM Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping have “directed their militaries to earnestly implement various confidence building measures agreed upon between the two sides”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-lac-flashpoint-wont-be-another-doklam-chinese-daily-86511

18-05-2020||Naveen S Garewal||Telangana can have higher number of Covid-19 cases than being reported||Tribune News ServiceHyderabad, May 18The lower figures of COVID-19 in Telangana may be indicative of lower testing as compared to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, according to data made available by the state government.Telangana made data public after drawing a lot of flak for keeping the testing data hidden.Till May 16, the state has released data that shows testing of 23,388 samples, of which 1,388 were positive – by Monday the cases have risen to 1,551.On the other hand, Andhra Pradesh had conducted 2.01 lakh tests till May 14 and the number of positive cases reported as on Monday stand at 2,407.Andhra Pradesh is conducting on an average about 9,000 tests every day. In comparison, Telangana is testing only about 225 samples a day.Telangana’s Director, Department of Medical and Health, G Srinivasa Rao has said the cumulative number of samples tested as on May 16 was 23,388. Out of that figure, 947 males tested positive and 14,256 tested negative, 566 females tested positive and 7,619 tested negative.Last week Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao had said most of the Covid-19 cases in Hyderabad were restricted to only four zones in the city – LB Nagar, Karwan, Malalpet and Charminar.Medical professionals are however suggesting that the lower number of cases in Telangana may be due to less aggressive testing. After the discharge of 992 patients there are only 525 active cases in Telangana, while 34 persons have succumbed to the infection so far.Senior health officials have expressed doubts over the state’s Covid-19 positive cases on the grounds that there could be many more if the testing numbers were higher. “There are many people who are showing symptoms of Covid-19 and we need more tests,” said a doctor who did not want to be identified.“It is very unlikely that out of Telangana’s 33 districts 25 haven’t reported any fresh cases over the last 14 days. There is a likelihood that this is due to low testing. There are many people who are asymptomatic, so they are not tested,” said another official.On April 28, Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender, while addressing a press conference, had disclosed that a total of 19,303 tests had been conducted till then. The figures have rose to 23,388 till May 16, suggesting only 4,085 tests were conducted during this period that averages up to 226 cases per day.It is suspected that if aggressive testing is started in Telangana, the numbers might raise substantially.The Chief Minister is holding a cabinet meeting later on Monday where the future course of action during lockdown 4.0 will be discussed and a strategy formulated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-can-have-higher-number-of-covid-19-cases-than-being-reported-86493

SARI case is defined as one with acute respiratory infection with fever more than 38 degree C and cough and needing hospitalisation.All testing in the above categories is recommended by real time RT-PCR test only.Revised guidelines came as India’s daily case growth peaked to a record 5,242 infections taking the total COVID load to 96,169 with 3,029 deaths and 36,282 recoveries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-severe-pneumonia-patients-to-be-tested-for-covid-says-centre-86489

18-05-2020||New Delhi||HC asks police to expeditiously probe 'Bois Locker room' incident||The Delhi High Court on Monday directed the police to expeditiously conduct its investigation into the incident of “Bois Locker Room”, an Instagram group, in which obscene messages and morphed pictures of underage girls were shared.A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Talwant Singh, which conducted the hearing through video conferencing, noted that an FIR had already been lodged by the Delhi Police Cyber Crime Cell and the probe was going on.The High Court directed the police, represented through Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra and advocate Chaitanya Gosain, to conclude the investigation expeditiously in accordance with the law and file the final report before the concerned trial court.The court disposed of the petition seeking Special Investigation Team (SIT) or Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe in the “Bois Locker Room” incident and to arrest the offenders.The participants of the chat room were mostly young teenage boys from Delhi who allegedly shared lewd and objectionable content pertaining to minor girls. The chat room was used to make comments and share compromising and allegedly morphed images of minor girls.Petitioner Dev Ashish Dubey had also sought protection for the girls and women who have highlighted the crime of Delhi school students so that they cannot be harmed by the members of the group.The plea, filed through advocates Dushyant Tiwari and Om Prakash Parihar, also sought direction to the authorities to arrest all the members of the chat group immediately.“The entire issue needs to be investigated by the SIT or CBI as these students belong to high profile families and there is an apprehension that the investigation or enquiry conducted by the local police will be influenced and wrongdoers will never be arrested and punished,” the plea alleged.It said instead of being apologetic or fearful after the vulgar comments and obscene photos posted by them came into public domain, the boys openly threatened the girls and the offence committed by these students through the Instagram group was illegal and amounts to violation of various laws.Earlier, two advocates had written a letter to the Delhi High Court Chief Justice to take suo motu cognisance of the incident.Delhi Police's Cyber cell have arrested the 18-year-old admin of the chat group. He appeared for his Class XII board examinations this year.Police have said he was a student of a school in Delhi-NCR and four group members, who all are majors, above 18 years, had joined the probe.The juveniles, who are part of the group, are being quizzed at their home in the presence of their parents and members of NGOs. A juvenile member was apprehended.The Delhi Commission of Women (DCW) had issued a notice to Instagram and Delhi Police, taking cognisance of the matter.

He urged the people to learn to cope with coronavirus by changing the habits and attitudes towards life and fellow humans, if the virus stays for a longer period.Among the 12 points are living in harmony with the nature and fellow beings; knowing that safety and security of lives are interconnected; rationally analysing the impact of every movement or action on the spread of virus; stop impulsive responsive to the situation and keep faith in science which can come up with a solution to the problem, he said in a Facebook post.The suggestions also include strict adherence to the behavioural changes like wearing mask, maintaining physical distance and ensuring hygiene; preventing stigmatisation so that the infected volunteer for treatment; checking disinformation and prejudices against fellow citizens as carriers of the virus; and, replacing a sense of collective helplessness by the spirit of interconnected living.Asking people to ‘’Live differently and Live Safe’’ the Vice President stressed on the need for new attitudes towards life and humanity amidst indications of the virus likely to stay for longer than earlier expected. The Vice President also urged media to disseminate correct and scientific information about the virus and the disease and not present it as a catastrophe.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/need-to-adjust-to-live-with-new-normal-in-post-covid19-period-v-p-naidu-86476
18-05-2020||New Delhi||India supports move at WHO to seek origin of coronavirus||India on Monday joined nearly 120 countries at a crucial conference of the World Health Organisation in pushing for an impartial and comprehensive evaluation of the global response into the coronavirus crisis as well as to examine the origin of the deadly infection.The two-day 73rd session of the World Health Assembly (WHA) of the WHO began in Geneva amid growing calls, including by US President Donald Trump, to investigate how the virus originated in China's Wuhan city and subsequent action by Beijing.Another flash point between China and the US has been over the Trump administration's push for inclusion of Taiwan in the WHO. China has been strongly opposed to the move as it considers Taiwan to be part of its territory.The WHA is also expected to delve into pooling in additional resources to deal with the pandemic that has killed over 310,000 people and infected nearly 4.7 million besides wrecking the global economy.A draft resolution pushed by the 27-nation European Union and supported by a large number of countries for deliberations at the WHA called for a step-wise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation of the WHO-coordinated international response to COVID-19.It, however, did not mention China. The coronavirus pandemic was first reported in Wuhan, a port city in China in December last year. Since then, it has spread to over 180 countries.The resolution sought scientific and collaborative field missions to trace the origin of the coronavirus, saying such an exercise will enable targeted interventions and a research agenda to reduce the risk of similar events in future.It also called for continuing to work closely with the World Organisation for Animal Health, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN and other countries as part of the "one-health approach to identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population.The resolution says possible role of intermediate hosts should also be evaluated. It has been uploaded on the website of the WHO.Besides India, the countries which supported the draft resolution included Australia, Bangladesh, Belarus, Bhutan, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Maldives and Mexico.Montenegro, New Zealand, North Macedonia, Norway, Paraguay, Peru, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Moldova, Russia, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine and the UK and Northern Ireland are also backing the resolution, according to the WHO.The African Group comprising around 50 countries are also supporting the resolution. Surprisingly, the US has not figured in the list of countries backing the move.The draft resolution also pitched for making recommendations to improve global pandemic prevention mechanism including through strengthening the WHO's health emergencies programme.Indian officials said Health Minister Harsh Vardhan would represent India at the WHA video-conference.

Beijing claims Tibet has been part of China for centuries, but many Tibetans say they were largely independent for most of that time.Tibet’s capital Lhasa has seen a massive influx of Chinese migrants and the entire region is under a heavy security lockdown, tightened considerably since bloody anti-government protests in 2008 that spread through many Tibetan areas in western China.Despite appeals from the United Nations and foreign governments and organisations, China has never provided any solid information on the condition or location of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima and his family, saying only that they were being looked after and did not wish to have contact with the outside world.The 10th Panchen Lama was imprisoned by China and died under what some consider suspicious circumstances in 1989 after making speeches calling for greater religious and social freedoms for Tibetans. — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tibetans-demand-china-disclose-fate-of-boy-taken-away-in-95-86467

It is only for Rs 1,86,650 crore. That’s 0.91 per cent of the GDP. Remember that number and we will know the truth in course of time.”The former FM also demanded an immediate meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on finance to scrutinise the fiscal stimulus package of the government and said attempts were being made to sidestep the parliament.The fiscal stimulus package is not for Rs 20 lakh crore. It is only for Rs 1,86,650 crore. Remember that number and we will know the truth in course of timeChidambaram spoke a day after his colleague Anand Sharma termed the package as 1.6 per cent of the GDP and not 10 per cent as the Prime Minister had said while announcing it.Chidambaram also said the package had fallen way short of expectations of the poor, vulnerable and migrants and sought a comprehensive package in excess of budget provisions.“The stimulus is totally inadequate given the seriousness of the economic crisis. We request the government to reconsider the package. The government is being opportunistic by resorting to reforms. We demand a comprehensive stimulus of not less than Rs 10 lakh crore of real additional expenditure which is equivalent to ten per cent of the GDP,” said Chidambaram.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-downgrades-economic-package-further-says-it-is-only-0-9-per-cent-of-gdp-86457
18-05-2020||Lucknow||UP accepts Cong offer to deploy 1,000 buses for migrants after initial denial of permission||After two days, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has accepted Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s offer of 1,000 buses to ferry migrants from Noida and Ghaziabad back to UP.Referring to Priyanka Gandhi’s May 16 letter, Additional Chief Secretary Awanish Awasthi addressed his reply to her private secretary accepting the offer and requesting a list of the names and contact details of the drivers and conductors of the buses.After dragging its feet for two days, UP Government clearly decided to give permission after adverse media reports of the mammoth crowds of migrants turning up at Ghaziabad to get themselves registered to return home in UP..@myogiadityanath जी महामारी के समय इंसान की जिंदगी को बचाना, गरीबों की रक्षा करना, उनकी गरिमा की हिफाजत करना हमारा नैतिक दायित्व और अधिकार है। कांग्रेस इस कठिन समय में अपनी पूरी क्षमता और सेवाव्रत के साथ अपने कर्तव्यों का पालन कर रही है।ये बसें हमारी सेवा का विस्तार हैं। 1/3On May 16, the day when 25 migrants had died in a road accident in Aurraiya, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had written a letter to CM Yogi offering to bear the cost of 1,000 buses to bring back migrants to UP.She had pointed out that despite the state government’s announcements migrants from various parts of the country were walking down to their homes.She had pointed out that this had caused 65 of them to die on the road that was more than the COVID-19 tally in the state.Underlining the need to provide them a safe mode of transport, Priyanka had offered the UP Government 1,000 buses the cost of which would be borne by the AICC.She said 500 buses were being parked at Ghazipur border in Ghaziabad and another 500 buses at Noida.“The nation-building workers cannot be left like this to fend for themselves. The Congress party is committed to help them,” she had declared in her letter to the CM.After the UP Government accepted her offer, she thanked it in a tweet.Earlier in the day in a series of tweets, she had criticised the UP Government for the mismanagement at Ghaziabad’s Ram Lila ground where a large unruly crowd of migrants had collected and were jostling and pushing each other, ignoring social distancing, to get themselves registered to return home.“If this exercise had started a month ago the migrants would not have had to undergo such hardship. I had offered 1,000 buses and had parked them at the UP border but the UP Government kept playing politics and did not give permission. The UP Government is not helping those hit by this pandemic and is neither allowing others to do it,” Priyanka had said in her tweet.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-accepts-cong-offer-to-deploy-1-000-buses-for-migrants-after-initial-denial-of-permission-86455
18-05-2020||Pune||Pune auto driver uses money saved for wedding to feed migrant labourers||In a novel gesture, a 30-year-old auto-rickshaw driver, who saved Rs 2 lakh for his marriage but postponed the ceremony due to the lockdown, is now using the money to feed migrant labourers and those in distress on Pune streets.Akshay Kothawale is not just stopping at that, but also helping senior citizens and pregnant women by offering them free rides to clinics in his vehicle, and also going around the city creating awareness on how to stay protected against the coronavirus.With the help of his friends, Kothawale is using the money he saved for his wedding to prepare food for nearly 400 people every day. They then go around the city streets and distribute the food among migrant labourers and poor people.Talking to PTI, Kothawale, who comes from a humble background, said he feels happy to be able to help others in this time of crisis.“While working as an auto-rickshaw driver, I could save around Rs 2 lakh for my marriage, which was scheduled on May 25. But due to the lockdown extension, we thought it would not be appropriate to have the ceremony now, so my fiancée and I decided to postpone the marriage,” he said.During the lockdown, Kothawale was pained to see several poor people, especially migrant labourers, facing hardships due to no work and no income.“I saw several people on roads who could not even afford to have one meal and were struggling to survive. I and some of my friends then thought of doing something to help the daily wagers and needy people,” he said.“I decided to use my savings for the cause and some of my friends also chipped in,” said Kothawale, who is a resident of Timber market area in the Maharashtra city.They then set up a kitchen and started preparing ‘chapatis’ and ‘sabji’ (flat bread and vegetables), which they have been distributing at places where migrant labourers and needy people gather.“Using my auto-rickshaw, we distribute one-time meal among people at Maldhakka Chowk near the railway station, Sangamwadi and Yerawada areas,” he said.Since his cash flow is also drying up fast, Kothawale and his friends have now decided to replace ‘chapati-sabji’ with ‘pulao’, masala rice or ‘sambhar’ rice, he said.“But, we are continuing distribution of food among the migrant labourers and those in need,” he said.The group intends to continue providing food to people at least till May 31 with the help of the funds they have.Kothwala has also put up a loudspeaker on his auto-rickshaw through which he and his friends have been creating awareness among people about the coronavirus and how to stay protected against it.The group has also distributed masks and sanitisers to roadside dwellers.“Amid the lockdown, I am also offering free rides in the auto-rickshaw to senior citizens and pregnant women who need to visit a doctor,” Kothawale said.During the Sangli-Kolhapur deluge last year, he and his associates had sent food and other relief material for the flood-affected people, he added.

These states are already doing it,” Pradhan said.The NDRF has already deployed a total of 37 teams in the two states apart from others that have been kept on standby.In its latest forecast based on meterological analyis around 5.30 am, the IMD said Amphan in the past six hours moved with a speed of 13 kmph and lay centred as on today, May 18, over west-central and adjoining central parts of South Bay of Bengal about 790 km south of Paradip (Odisha), 940 km south-southwest of Digha (West Bengal) and 1060 km south-southwest of Khepupara (Bangladesh).It is very likely to intensify further into a super cyclonic storm during the next 12 hours. It is very likely to move north-northeastwards across northwest Bay of Bengal and cross West Bengal — Bangladesh coasts between Digha (West Bengal) and Hatiya Islands (Bangladesh) during afternoon/evening of May 20 as a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm with maximum sustained wind speed of 155-165 kmph gusting to 185 kmph. The IMD has warned squally wind speed reaching 45 to 55 kmph gusting to 65 kmph along and off south Odisha coast from Monday evening, extending to, along and off north Odisha coast from Tuesday morning and along and off West Bengal coast from afternoon."The wind speed will gradually increase becoming gale wind speed reaching 75 to 85 kmph gusting to 95 kmph from May 20 morning along and off north Odisha and West Bengal coasts. It will gradually increase thereafter along and off West Bengal coast becoming 100-120 kmph gusting to 135 kmph May 20 afternoon.""Sea conditions will very high over southwest and adjoining central BoB today will become phenomenal over southern parts of central BoB from tonight, over northern parts of central and  adjoining north BoB on 19th May and over north BoB on May 20," it said, advising fishermen not to venture out till May 20.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/severe-cyclonic-storm-to-make-landfall-on-may-20-ndrf-dg-86441
18-05-2020||New Delhi||Covid-19: Centre lists parameters for states to delineate red, orange, green zones||Parameters laid down by the Union Health Ministry such as active COVID-19 cases, doubling and fatality rates and cases per lakh population have to be taken into consideration by states and union territories while categorising areas into red, orange or green zones.The ministry also issued guidelines for delineation of containment and buffer zones and outlined actions that have to be implemented in those areas to break the chain of transmission of the disease.In a letter to states and union territories, Union Health Secretary Preeti Sudan said states might categorise districts or municipal corporations into hotspots, red, orange and green zones.They, however, may also choose to categorise sub-division, ward or any other appropriate administrative unit into the colour-coded zones after detailed analysis at their end, duly taking into consideration the geographical spread of cases, contacts and their zone of influence in terms of the disease spread, the letter said.This comes after the Ministry of Home Affairs issued guidelines for the fourth phase of the nationwide lockdown, giving power to states and union territories to delineate red, green and orange zones as per the COVID-19 situation taking into consideration the parameters shared by the union health ministry.In her letter, Sudan elaborated that demarcation of the zones would be based on total active cases, cases per lakh population, doubling rate calculated over a seven-day period, case fatality rate, testing ratio (number of tests per lakh population) and sample positivity rate.The benchmarks or thresholds for critical and desirable levels for total active cases would be more than 200 and zero or no reported case in the last 21 days, respectively.For active cases per lakh population, the critical threshold would be when more than 15, while for doubling rate calculated over a seven-day period, the critical level would be less than 14 days and desirable when more than 28 days.As for case fatality rate, more than six per cent would be considered critical and less than one per cent desirable. The critical threshold for testing ratio (number of tests per lakh population) would be less than 65 while the desirable level would be more than 200, according to the letter.Sample positivity rate would be considered critical if it is more than six per cent while less than two per cent is desirable.The health ministry, however, underlined that the benchmarks or thresholds for critical and desirable levels are dynamic and may be revised by the Centre as per the evolving situation at the field level.The letter mentions that the guidelines are issued following the video-conference of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with chief ministers on May 11, and taking into consideration the feedback received from them."The most important task once the zones are identified is field action in terms of implementation of containment plan of action. This entails identification of containment and buffer zones inside the red, orange and green zones from where cases have been primarily reported."A containment operation (large outbreak or cluster) is deemed successful when no case is reported in the last 28 days from containment zone," the letter stated.According to the guidelines, containment zones are delineated based on mapping of cases and contacts, geographical dispersion of cases and contacts, area having a well-demarcated perimeter and enforceability of perimeter control."It is reiterated that this is the primary area where intensive action is to be carried out with the aim of breaking the chain of transmission. This area should, therefore, be appropriately defined by the district administration/local urban bodies with technical inputs at local level.""The effective containment, it is advisable to err on the side of caution," the letter said.The guidelines stated that once the containment zone is delineated the perimeter will be defined and there would be strict perimeter control with establishment of clear entry and exit points.No movement should be allowed except for medical emergencies and essential goods and services, no unchecked influx of population to be allowed and people transiting to be recorded and followed through integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP).Stringent action needs to be initiated within these containment zones in terms of an active search for cases through physical house-to-house surveillance by special teams formed for the purpose, testing of all cases as per sampling guidelines and contact tracing, identification of local community volunteers to help in surveillance, contact tracing and risk communication and strict enforcement of social distancing, among others, it said.Sudan said a buffer zone also has to be delineated around each containment zone."Buffer zone will be primarily the area wherein additional and focused attention is needed so as to ensure that infection does not spread to adjoining areas. For effective containment, it is of paramount importance that the buffer is sufficiently large," the letter stated. The focus areas of action in the buffer zone include extensive surveillance for cases through monitoring of ILI/SARI cases in health facilities, among others, the guidelines stated.

In the first accident on Sunday morning, a bus taking migrants from Himachal Pradesh to Motihari in Bihar, hit a truck on the national highway near Mahuawa Kanta under Patherwa police station.Around a dozen migrants were injured in the accident of whom six were serious. They have been admitted to Community Health Centre (CHC), Fazilnagar. The four serious patients have been referred to the Kushinagar district hospital.Later, a dozen migrants were injured when another private bus carrying 40 migrants from Sector 5 Noida to Navgachiya town in Bhagalpur district in Bihar hit an onion-laden truck on the same highway under the same police station at Doomarbhar village at around 9 pm on Sunday.The injured were admitted to the Tumkahi CHC where those with minor injuries were later sent to Bihar in another bus.Seven of the seriously injured have been referred to BRD Medical College Hospital in Gorakhpur.A bus carrying 27 migrants from Pune to Siddharth Nagar met with an accident  in Ayodhya---the fourth accident on Monday.

18-05-2020||New Delhi||India’s COVID-19 tally crosses 1-lakh mark; death toll past 3,000||The nationwide tally of COVID-19 cases crossed one lakh on Monday with more people testing positive for the deadly virus in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and other states, even as a much-relaxed fourth phase of the lockdown began with restarting of market complexes, autos, taxis and inter-state buses in various parts of the country.The death toll due to COVID-19 crossed the 3,000-mark too.With an aim to reboot numerous locked down economic activities, authorities across the country ordered reopening of markets, intra-state transport services and even of barber shops and salons in some states, barring in containment zones. However, schools, colleges, theatres, malls and religious gatherings are among those that would remain shut, at least till May 31.India has been under a lockdown since March 25, which was first supposed to be for 21 days or till April 14, but was later extended till May 3, then further till May 17 and now for another two weeks till May 31.However, a number of relaxations have been given in the current fourth phase, while states and union territories have also been granted significant flexibility for deciding the red, orange or green zones in terms of the quantum and severity of the virus spread.In its morning 8 am update, the Union Health Ministry put the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases 96,169 and the death toll at 3,029. It also said 36,824 people have so far recovered from the infection.However, a PTI tally of figures announced by different states and UTs as of 9.40 pm put the number of those having tested positive for the infection at 1,00,096, with a death toll of 3,078 and recoveries at 38,596 across the country.Maharashtra topped the nationwide tally with over 35,000 confirmed cases and 1,249 deaths, followed by Tamil Nadu with 11,760 confirmed cases and 81 deaths. Gujarat has also reported 11,746 confirmed cases, while its death toll is higher than that of Tamil Nadu at 694.Delhi has also crossed the 10,000 mark in terms of the number of confirmed cases, while its death toll has now reached 160.The nationwide count of confirmed infections incidentally crossed the crucial one-lakh mark on a day when the fourth phase of the nationwide lockdown kicked in with several relaxations for economic and public activities, barring in containment zones or areas identified as serious hotspots of the virus infection.Revising its strategy for COVID-19 testing, ICMR also said on Monday that returnees and migrants who show symptoms for influenza-like illness will be tested for coronavirus infection within seven days of ailment and stressed that no emergency clinical procedure, including deliveries, should be delayed for lack of testing.India also joined nearly 120 countries at a crucial conference of the World Health Organisation in pushing for an impartial and comprehensive evaluation of the global response into the coronavirus crisis as well as to examine the origin of the deadly infection.Since the first case of the deadly coronavirus was reported in China last December, more than 47 lakh people have tested for this virus across the world and over 3 lakh have lost their lives. India is the 11th most affected country, while the US tops the chart with over 14.9 lakh confirmed cases so far.China’s official tally of confirmed infections is less than 84,000, while it has reported more than 4,600 deaths. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-covid-19-tally-crosses-1-lakh-mark-death-toll-past-3-000-86418

These may have been BMS statements but can a Sangh affiliate say anything so scathing about another member without the backing of the parent organisation (RSS)? observers wonder.BMS president Saji Narayanan says the organisation appreciates the government whenever it takes good decisions. “But if the government does something wrong, it is our duty to point it out,” he adds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/experts-see-rss-bjp-rift-amid-bharatiya-mazdoor-sangh-flak-86286
18-05-2020||---||Lawyers oppose dilution of labour laws||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 17As many BJP-ruled states are diluting labour laws to attract investment, the Indian Association of Lawyers (IAL) has opposed it, saying it’s contrary to constitutional goals and would put the workers in a state of slavery.“No doubt Covid-19 has created an extraordinary situation warranting extraordinary measures to deal with it, but that does not mean governments can suspend/abrogate/ abuse laws so as to curtail the constitutionally guaranteed rights to the people,” the IAL said in a resolution.“The IAL registers its protest against these undemocratic actions, which in fact will hurt the economy in the longer run due to conflicts,” it said. It also expressed displeasure over the SC’s handling of PILs during Covid-19 crisis. “It is distressing to note the manner in which the SC has failed to act promptly, decisively and effectively in many PIL cases,” it said.The IAL has appealed to the government to take urgent steps for initiating large-scale welfare measures to save the poor from hunger, deprivation and malnutrition.“Huge public investment is required forthwith to save the people on one hand and to bring the economy back on the rails. Indecision and delay in this regard has caused huge suffering to the people and damage to the economy,” the IAL said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lawyers-oppose-dilution-of-labour-laws-86287
18-05-2020||---||Question mark over timing of govt step||New Delhi, May 17The government’s intention to change laws relating to essential commodities and selling of agriculture produce has been questioned for its timing.Though several economists, led by Ashok Gulati, have appreciated the Modi government for biting the bullet and hailed the decision to dilute the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) Act, others are not so sure.Besides questioning the purpose of making futuristic police announcements when the need of the hour is cash transfer to farmers and a bonus on their rabi crop, experts are apprehensive about the contours of an alternate structure that will be imposed without consultations with farmers and traders.Bihar abolished the APMC Act over a decade back. Logically, farmers should be discovering new price highs in the absence of a system cited by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as exploitative and monopolistic. “But why is it that in this season wheat production in Haryana is subdued? Or more rice comes to Haryana mills than is produced in the state?” asks noted agriculture expert Devinder Sharma, before answering the question: it is because the MSP in Haryana and Punjab are higher.Sharma felt the pandemic should not have been the time to push for such far-reaching reforms that require extensive consultations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/question-mark-over-timing-of-govt-step-86288

18-05-2020||Satya Prakash||Right to religion can’t override citizens’ fundamental rights||Relationship between religion and State has had a chequered history. As organised institutions, both have always attempted to dominate each other — be it India, Europe or any other part of the world. Common people often side with one or the other to safeguard their own interest as they cautiously avoid offending either.The Allahabad High Court’s recent verdict on Azan — the Islamic call to prayer — only highlights this delicate relationship.A Bench headed by Justice Shashi Kant Gupta held “that Azan may be an essential and integral part of Islam but recitation of Azan through loudspeakers or other sound-amplifying devices cannot be said to be an integral part of the religion, warranting protection... under Article 25 of the Constitution…”Ruling that Azan can be recited from minarets of mosques by human voice without using any amplifying device, the HC directed the UP administration not to cause hindrance in it on the pretext of Covid-19 guidelines, unless violated. Often over-emphasised, right to religion is the weakest fundamental right as it is subject to public order, morality and health and other fundamental rights.That’s why the HC gave primacy to citizens’ fundamental rights, saying “One cannot disturb others’ basic human rights and fundamental rights. Use of loudspeakers can cause hearing loss, disturbance of sleep, interference with communication, annoyance etc. and other diseases... Right to sleep is not only a fundamental right but it is to be conceded to be a basic human right.”It goes on to say, “No person has right to take away the right of others...religious freedom cannot abridge or take away or suspend others’ right under Article 19(1)(a) regarding their freedom of speech and expression... No one has got the right to make other persons captive listeners,” the HC said. Right to freedom from noise pollution was a fundamental right protected by Article 21 (right to life).Of late, courts have been flooded with issues relating religious practices. Many such issues have been referred to a seven-judge Constitution Bench. It was in the 1950s that the Supreme Court evolved “essential practices test” to judge the validity of such practices. The Allahabad HC verdict underlines that the test still remains a useful constitutional tool.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/right-to-religion-cant-override-citizens-fundamental-rights-86291

Bangladesh, Belarus, Indonesia, Mozambique, Moldova, Russia, Turkey and Zambia are some of the co-sponsors whose interest in WHO are more wide-ranging.However, there will be considerable heat as all heads of delegation will address the Assembly. It will also consider a proposal relating to electing a new DG.The probe sought by over 60 countries is one among large number of proposals mentioned in the exhaustive seven-page resolution. The resolution has at times applauded the WHO’s efforts and appreciated its role in controlling the pandemic in developing countries, especially Africa, whose 53 countries have tended to back Ghebreyesus, an Ethiopian.The resolution has also sought details of actions of the WHO and its timelines for the Covid.

I am questioning the FM, disputing the PM announcement and challenging the govt to disprove me on the numbers.—  Anand SharmaSitharaman said the government intended decriminalising a dozen categories of offences under the Companies Act. It has also initiated steps for ease of doing business and extended relief to MSMEs and corporates from insolvency proceedings.Faced with the criticism of not doing enough for migrants, Sithraman said Rs 40,000 crore funds under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) would be besides the Rs 61,000 crore allocated this year to generate an additional 300 crore man-days of employment in the villages.In another major declaration of intent to open up strategic sectors, Sitharaman described the contours of a public sector enterprise (PSE) policy that would not allow more than four PSUs in each such sector and permit the private sector in all of them. In her fourth press conference on Saturday, she had mentioned the opening up of atomic energy and space sectors. “We shall define the areas where their presence will be impactfully felt. There will be notified sectors where at least one PSE will be present while the private sector will be allowed to play a role,’’ she explained.For states, the Centre had devolved Rs 46,038 crore in April and given revenue deficit grant of Rs 12,390 cr on time. States also used Rs 11,092 crore from the state disaster relief fund. Now, the government has allowed states to borrow up to five per cent of their respective GDPs from the existing three per cent subject to four conditions.In health, Sitharaman promised an all-round upgrade and said this was an ongoing process with the Health Ministry having released Rs 4,113 crore for direct funding of anti-Covid activities.The minister dwelt on major changes in three matters related to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code: debts incurred due to Covid shall not be considered as default, there will be no fresh insolvency proceedings for one year from the present six months and a special insolvency framework will deal with MSMEs. The government will issue an ordinance to raise their threshold limit from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1 crore.It has also been decided to issue an ordinance to decriminalise technical and procedural defaults under the Companies Act instead of waiting for Parliament to pass a pending Bill.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-sectors-open-to-private-players-but-govt-to-stay-in-strategic-areas-86270

I don't think its net effect is going to be very positive for Punjab and Haryana. While I need medicine today you are telling me that you will make a cold storage, keep my medicine and give it to me later. — Lakhwinder Singh, ExpertThe “futuristic” measures had nothing for the distressed sector, they said. Besides, they also expressed apprehension, viewing them as an indication of the apprehended possibility by wheat and rice farmers in the states — minimising procurement under the MSP.“What we saw yesterday were just credit facilities. I don’t think the net effect of the announcements is going to be very positive for Punjab and Haryana. Infrastructure is good for the economy, but today it is the matter of life and livelihood for crores of small farmers and labourers dependant on the sector. While I need medicine today you are telling me that you will make a cold storage, keep my medicine and give it to me later,” said Lakhwinder Singh, Director of the Centre of Development Economics and Innovation Studies, Punjabi University.Agricultural policy expert Devinder Sharma believes the reforms government is suggesting are essentially aimed to “dilute/dismantle” the existing system of APMC, MSP regimes. “The marketing system and infrastructure are both well established in Punjab and Haryana. It is here that the FM’s announcements will have impact. Punjab has already amended the marketing act, allowing setting up of private mandis and entry of private players in the existing mandis. These developments appear to be hinting towards limiting procurement and doing away with the responsibility of MSP,” he adds.A recent recommendation by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Price (CACP) to the Centre generated widespread debate regarding review of the open-ended procurement policy.The CACP in its price policy for Rabi crops, the marketing season 2020-21, said: “The open-ended procurement policy for rice and wheat has led to mounting food stocks and adversely affected crop diversification. These excess stocks create storage problems and high storage and financing costs will lead to high food subsidy burden. The commission recommends that open-ended procurement policy should be reviewed.”Meanwhile, appreciating the FM’s efforts, CACP chairman Ashok Gulati said farmers and consumers, including in Punjab and Haryana, would gain from the measures.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/reforms-may-dilute-msp-regime-86283
