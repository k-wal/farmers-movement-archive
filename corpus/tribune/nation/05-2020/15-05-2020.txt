It was a normal delivery, the Indraprastha Apollo Hospital said in a statement.All immediate family members of the woman have also tested positive for COVID-19 and the woman was refused admission by some hospitals before she was brought to the facility, the statement added.Pregnant women are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 as compared to other adults, Dr Ajay Sinha, senior consultant, Internal Medicine, said.“Though not all have serious complications if affected by coronavirus and only experience mild to moderate flu-like symptoms, it is important that extra care and precautions are taken for treatment and management of pregnant women who are COVID-positive, for the wellbeing of the mother and the unborn child,” he said.“In this case, she was tested positive after going through a compulsory COVID-19 test pertaining to the current situation, few days before her due delivery date,” Sinha said.Dr Kiranabala Dash, Consultant, Gynaecology, said the woman was COVID-positive and hence, the staff had to be extra cautious to ensure that no harm was caused to either the mother or the child.“All measures were taken to ensure the child does not contract any virus,” Dash added.The mother and the child have been kept under observation in isolation and both of them are doing well, the doctors said.“The patient and her kid are being looked after by the hospital staff as her entire family has tested positive for COVID-19. The patient initially had health complications post-delivery such as low BP but is doing fine now,” the hospital said in the statement.

15-05-2020||---||Former US Vice-President Biden for relocating Afghan Sikhs, Hindus||New Delhi, May 15US Presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden has expressed concern over the targeting of Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan, especially after the attack on Gurdwara Har Rai Sahib, and suggested they will be given refugee status in America if he was elected President.“If I am elected President, my administration will renew our commitment to refugees….I will raise the annual global refugee admissions cap to 1,25,000,’’ he declared in a statement issued on a day when a US panel, frequently in the cross-hairs of the Ministry of External Affairs for its observations on Kashmir and Islamophobia in the Indian media, also made common cause on the Sikh issue.The influential Sam Brownback, head of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), described the attacks on the Sikhs in Afghanistan as a “terrible tragedy’’ for a “wonderful, peaceful religious group’’ that has been virtually decimated in Afghanistan with just a thousand left.Brownback, a Donald Trump ally, was more guarded on the issue of resettling the Sikh of Afghanistan and said he had heard talks about re-settling them in US, Canada, India or Pakistan. “We’ve been inquiring, as others have, of possible places for the remaining Sikhs in Afghanistan to go to be able to be safe. I don’t have anything publicly that I could say,’’ he added.Biden recalled when, in the mid-1990s, the Taliban sought to make Sikhs and Hindus wear yellow to identify them as non-Muslims. The recent attack against Afghanistan’s Sikh community demonstrates once again the dangerous conditions for religious minorities, he said, while accusing Trump of ending America’s refugee policy of welcoming people fleeing violence and persecution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-us-vice-president-biden-for-relocating-afghan-sikhs-hindus-85271

15-05-2020||New Delhi||World Bank approves USD 1 billion loan to support India’s fight against COVID-19||The World Bank on Friday approved a USD 1 billion loan to support India’s efforts for providing social assistance to the poor and vulnerable households, severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.The “Accelerating India’s COVID-19 Social Protection Response Program” will support the government’s efforts towards a more consolidated delivery platform – accessible to both rural and urban populations across state boundaries.This takes the total commitment from the World Bank towards emergency COVID-19 response in India to USD 2 billion.A USD 1 billion support was announced last month towards immediate support to India’s health sector.The multilateral lending agency is also in discussions with the government to provide assistance to the country’s micro, small and medium enterprises, said World Bank Country Director in India Junaid Ahmad in a webinar with media.The response to the COVID-19 pandemic around the world has required governments to introduce social distancing and lockdowns in unprecedented ways, he said.These measures, intended to slowdown the spread of the virus have, however, impacted economies and jobs – especially in the informal sector. India with the world’s largest lockdown has not been an exception to this trend.Of the USD 1 billion commitment, USD 550 million will be financed by a credit from the International Development Association (IDA) – the World Bank’s concessionary lending arm and USD 200 million will be a loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), with a final maturity of 18.5 years including a grace period of five years.The remaining USD 250 million will be made available after June 30, 2020.The programme will be implemented by the Union Ministry of Finance.In a release, the World Bank said the new support will be funded in two phases – an immediate allocation of USD 750 million for fiscal year 2020 (fiscal year starting July 1, 2020) and a USD 250 million second tranche that will be made available for fiscal year 2021.Ahmad further said the COVID-19 pandemic has also put the spotlight on some of the gaps in the existing social protection systems.This platform draws on the country’s existing architecture of safety nets – the PDS, the digital and banking infrastructure, and Aadhaar – while positioning the overall social protection system for the needs of a 21st-century India.“What COVID-19 had done is that it has actually gotten the government to create linkages between the system and begin to move the social protection system of India, what I think will be the 21st century system.“It is in this context we have put in USD 1 billion following USD 1 billion in health and in anticipation of a thrid programme which will be around the small and small enterprises...,” he said.Ahmad further said the World Bank was in the process of discussing a MSMEs programme with the government.He said liquidity has come into the market through the monetary and fiscal policies and “the challenge now is to take that liquidity and bring it into the hands of the MSMEs... We will be coming in to support that. Where exactly and how much is something that we are in discussion with the government”.Replying to a query on the Rs 20-lakh-crore package announced by the government, Ahmad said it is a “very important statment by the government”.“In terms of emerging economies, India is largest in terms of fiscal and monetary response... Absolutely important that the government made a statement in terms of direction and the fact that it is a big programme,” he added.On the latest USD 1 billion support, the World Bank said the first phase of the operation will be implemented countrywide through the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY).It will immediately help scale-up cash transfers and food benefits, using a core set of pre-existing national platforms and programs such as the Public Distribution System (PDS) and Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT); provide robust social protection for essential workers involved in COVID-19 relief efforts; and benefit vulnerable groups, particularly migrants and informal workers.In the second phase, the programme will deepen the social protection package, whereby additional cash and in-kind benefits based on local needs will be extended through state governments and portable social protection delivery systems, it added.World Bank further said social protection is a critical investment since half of India’s population earns less than USD 3 a day and are precariously close to the poverty line.Over 90 per cent of India’s workforce is employed in the informal sector, without access to significant savings or workplace based social protection benefits such as paid sick leave or social insurance.As per the release, over 9 million migrants, who cross state borders to work each year, are also at greater risk as social assistance programmes in India largely provide benefits to residents within states, without adequate portability of benefits across state boundaries.Importantly, in an urbanising India cities and towns will need targeted support as India’s largest social protection programs are focused on rural populations.

The decision to quarantine the security personnel deployed for the court’s security had been taken after contact tracing exercise revealed that they had come in contact with the said employee.The top court has been functioning in a restricted manner via video-conferencing since March 24. During the lockdown, the top court is taking up only urgent matters via video conferencing with judges and lawyers sitting in in their chambers at their respective homes. They are connected through VIDYO app for hearing via video conferencing.Earlier, an employee of a Delhi court had died after testing positive for COVID-19 and an additional sessions judge is under treatment for novel coronavirus.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-judge-family-quarantined-after-cook-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-85258

These programmes were being conducted without any formal recognition from the NCTE,” the Union Minister said.“It was brought to my notice that some institutions had inadvertently admitted students in the teacher-education courses which were not recognised by the NCTE. This rendered invalid the qualification acquired by these students for the purposes of employment as school teachers,” it added.The Ministry clarified that amendment only allowed retrospective recognition up to the academic session 2017-2018, thereby only regularising the qualifications acquired by students in the past.“It does not propose to leave it open for institutions to run unrecognised courses in future and thereafter approach for ex-post facto regularisation,” an official said.The NCTE legally grants formal recognition to academic institutions for conducting any of the recognised courses meant for pre-service teacher education. It is only after qualifying any of these NCTE-recognised courses that a person becomes legally eligible for appointment as a school teacher in India.

15-05-2020||Vibha Sharma||Centre’s relief package fails to impress farmers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 15“Farmers have become poorer and more indebted and migrants left stranded during the lockdown, but it seems policy planners in the Narendra Modi government are either ignorant of farm economy or insensitive to farmers’ plight”. This appears to be general impression of farmers, their leaders and organisations who are clearly unimpressed with “futuristic” proposals and agri-reforms listed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as part of the 20 lakh crore relief package announced by the Prime Minister.“It is an eyewash,” said BKU General Secretary Yudhvir Singh. Expecting something simpler, specific and sustainable, like the relief being provided by countries like the USA and Canada, Yudhvir Singh said direct money should have been given in hands of people, particularly the poor. "However, the government is behaving like a banking service/loan lender. Farmers are in no position to borrow any money. I (farmers) am dying and I need help now. What they have announced is for future, most of which will benefit big people involved in agri-business. Cold storage, supply chain, etc… it has nothing for farmers," he said. According to agriculture expert Sudhir Panwar, measures like extension of two months moratorium on crop loan, increased credit flow, etc… may be of advantage in future but at present it just shows that “policy planners in the government are either ignorant of farm economy or insensitive to farmers’ plight”. “After today’s announcement relating with farmers, it is clear that government is in no mood to accept and compensate losses the sector suffered because of disruption of supply chains during 50 days of lockdown,” said Panwar."The Finance Minister enumerated several incentives for food processing industry, supply chains, agri-markets reforms already announced in the Budget and other forums. These initiatives may prove good in long run but are of no use for farmers who lost their crop and want immediate help,” Panwar added.Meanwhile, calling it a “fake" relief package, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee said it would observe 'Kisan Samman Diwas' at 9 am on Saturday in every village.The committee called FM's announcements an “admission” by the government that “it will do nothing to address concerns of farmers and working people” and demanded “waiver of all agricultural loans”.The committee also sought, “Immediate declaration that old KCC is annulled and grant of new KCC for kharif sowing without interest and reduction of prices of diesel to Rs 22 per litre as has been done in the case of Air Turbine fuel which is at Rs 22.54 per litre.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centres-relief-package-fails-to-impress-farmers-85254

15-05-2020||New Delhi||Not even a single penny for farmers in Centre's economic package: Congress||The Congress, on Friday, accused the government of being “insensitive” towards farmers and demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman apologise for neglecting them in the COVID-19 economic package.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the so-called Rs 20-lakh crore package for offsetting the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic had proved to be a “jumla package” and reflected the “voodoo economics” being followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.He said the government had not put a single penny in the pocket of farmers or farm labourers through the package and claimed that farmers had lost over Rs 50,000 crore this rabi season.“One thing is absolutely clear that the so-called Rs 20-lakh crore economic package has proved to be a ‘jumla package’. It reflects the ‘voodoo' economics’ being followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman,” Surjewala said at a press conference through video-conferencing.The Congress leader noted that the package, which was now being declared in instalments by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, “has proved to be only 13 zeros”.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman only talked big things and indulged in headline management, but had done nothing concrete for farmers or any other section of society.Surjewala said farmers had lost Rs 21,000 crore by distress sale of wheat far below the minimum support price (MSP) and an equal amount through other crops such as ‘chana’, ‘sarson’ and ‘masoor’, while another Rs 10,000 crore was lost through distress sale of vegetables and fruits.He claimed that since the markets were shut and farmers have to sell at distress prices as the government was buying only 26.5 per cent of the rabi crop at MSP.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman were trying to befool farmers and this was not in the national interest. They should apologise to them for betraying them by not giving even a single penny in their pocket, he noted.Former finance minister P Chidambaram said in their estimate, the fiscal stimulus part of the second tranche of announcements was Rs 5,000 crore with which analysts agree.“In today’s tranche, it is close to zero. Even Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman declined to answer how many of the amounts mentioned today were already part of the Expenditure Budget and how many are additional sums of money.”His colleague and former union minister Jairam Ramesh tweeted, “Madam Finance Minister, one simple question. What is the ADDITIONAL cash you are putting into the system over the next 6 months? The announcements you made today are mostly contained in your budget presented on Feb 1. Another case of repackaging and remarketing.”He also asked Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman if she would shed light on the basics of ‘atmanirbhar arthashastra’.“On Feb 1, 2020, she projected Centre’s expenditure at Rs 30.42 lakh crore for year 2020/21. Now with ‘atmanirbhar bharat’ package what is the REVISED expenditure figure for 2020/21? Everything else is dramabaazi,” he said on Twitter.The Congress leader said it was unfortunate that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had not given anything even to the MSMEs as their own minister Nitin Gadkari had exposed the entire set of contradiction and lies by saying that the government and the PSUs owed over Rs 5 lakh crore to them.Unfortunately, he said, neither of them even chose to express concern, much less implement any decision qua that, and “that is where the MSME minister’s statement becomes relevant and exposes the entire set of contradiction and lies on part of Union Government”.Surjewala said the attempt of the Finance Minister to repackage the budget and befool the people is “insensitive and inhuman” and needed to be condemned.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Friday, gave details of the third tranche of the Centre’s economic package, announcing relief for agriculture and allied industries.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, earlier this week, announced a cumulative package of Rs 20 lakh crore (nearly 10 per cent of GDP) to provide relief to various segments of the economy battered by coronavirus lockdown.

15-05-2020||New Delhi||Media bodies slam authorities for ‘curtailing’ press freedom||Media bodies, on Friday, raised concerns over incidents of alleged misuse of the law by authorities in India to “intimidate” journalists and “curtail” press freedom.The Press Council of India, on Friday, expressed concern over the alleged threat of criminal prosecution and questioning of an Indian Express journalist by the Delhi police and asked its commissioner to submit a report on the matter.Since the matter affects the free functioning of the press while taking suo-motu cognisance of the matter, a report on facts of the case was being called for from the Commissioner of Police, Delhi, the print media watchdog said in a statement.The Press Club of India, meanwhile, condemned the slapping of sedition charges on an editor of a Gujarati news portal and the reported filing of 10 FIRs against six journalists in Himachal Pradesh, saying such actions are a “blot on our democratic aspirations”.In a statement, the Press Club of India said going on the basis of a “string of seemingly malafide actions” against journalists by BJP-run states and the Centre-controlled Union Territories, it calls on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda to step in to bring “sanity to the proceedings”.The Vienna-headquartered International Press Institute (IPI), a global network of editors, media executives and leading journalists for press freedom, also expressed “grave concern over the misuse of the law by authorities in India to intimidate journalists and curtail press freedom”.“The rapid decline in India's press freedom is alarming,” IPI Director of Advocacy Ravi R Prasad said.The Indian government had resorted to various tactics to prevent independent media from criticizing the government and reporting about the pandemic, the IPI alleged.The Editors Guild of India, on Wednesday, had condemned the slapping of sedition charges on the editor of the Gujarati news portal and the Indian Express journalist being asked by the Delhi Police to join the probe into Tablighi Jamaat leader Maulana Saad’s audio clip, saying the Central and state governments should desist from misusing the law to threaten free press.In a statement, the Guild had said it notes with concern a growing pattern of misuse of criminal laws to intimidate journalists in different parts of the country.The Guild had first highlighted the incident of Dhaval Patel, editor and owner of a Gujarati news portal, “Face of Nation”, being booked for sedition and detained by the state police on May 11 for publishing a report suggesting the possibility of a leadership change in the state due to criticism over rising coronavirus cases.The second instance of “egregious and high-handed action” has come from Delhi Police, it had said.“On May 10, the Delhi Police sent a notice to Mahender Singh Manral, Special Correspondent, The Indian Express, through the City Editor and Chief Reporter, The Indian Express, requiring the journalist, who had reported that police investigations found the possibility of the audio clip of Tablighi Jamaat leader, Maulana Saad, being doctored, to join a probe on this matter on May 10,” the statement said.“While Manral wasn’t charged under any law, he was threatened that failure to join the probe could result in legal action under Section 174 of the IPC with a punishment of a prison term and fine,” it had said.The Press Club of India had also condemned the questioning of Indian Express journalist by the Delhi Police.The Press Club of India, in its statement on Friday, said the latest media victims of deplorable police actions “evidently in cahoots with the ruling party- emerge from Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh”.The Press Club said in Himachal Pradesh, six journalists from various districts of the state have reportedly had as many as ten FIRs registered against them.“The reason for this unwanted police attention is that the journalists in question have reported on the plight of migrant workers and on the shortcomings of the state authorities in dealing with relief in the fight against COVID-19,” it said.These are legitimate areas of enquiry for journalists and examples of high-handed and irregular behaviour by those in authority, the Press Club said.“Before these cases in Gujarat and HP, the administration and police in Uttar Pradesh, J&K and Delhi had already presented shocking examples of suppression of the media so that their questionable actions do not get to be known to the wider world,” it said.“We condemn such actions. They are a blot on our democratic aspirations,” the statement said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/media-bodies-slam-authorities-for-curtailing-press-freedom-85244
15-05-2020||New Delhi||NIA arrests key conspirator in Visakhapatnam espionage case||In a major success, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday arrested the key conspirator in the Visakhapatnam espionage case related to alleged leaking of sensitive information to Pakistani intelligence agency ISI.Mohammed Haroon Haji Abdul Rehman Lakdawala (49), a resident of Mumbai, is one of the key conspirators in the case that NIA took over in December last year, an official of the agency said.On December 20, Indian intelligence agencies busted the espionage racket linked to Pakistan with the arrest of seven Indian Navy personnel and a hawala operator.With the arrest of Lakdawala, a total of 14 accused have so far been arrested, including 11 Navy personnel and one Pakistani-born Indian national Shaista Qaiser.“Investigation revealed that Lakdawala had visited Karachi (Pakistan) on many occasions to meet his handlers under the guise of conducting cross-border trade. During these visits, he came in contact with two Pakistani spies  namely Akbar alias Ali and Rizwan, who directed him to deposit money into the bank accounts of Navy personnel at regular intervals. The same was done through different means,” the official said.During searches at the house of Lakdawala, a number of digital devices and incriminating documents were seized by NIA, he said, adding further investigation in the case was underway.“The NIA has arrested the key conspirator in the Visakhapatnam espionage case related to an international espionage racket involving individuals based in Pakistan and at different locations in India,” the official said.Pakistan-based spies recruited agents in India for collecting sensitive and classified information regarding locations and movements of Indian naval ships and submarines, and other defence establishments.“Investigation revealed that a few Navy personnel came in contact with Pakistani nationals through various social media platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp and were involved in sharing classified information in lieu of monetary gains. The money was deposited into the bank accounts of the Navy personnel through Indian associates having business interests in Pakistan,” he said.

15-05-2020||New Delhi||1,640 foreign Tablighi Jamaat members were in India, only 66 contracted COVID-19: Jamiat||As many as 1,640 foreign Tablighi Jamaat members from 47 countries were in India at the time of the Nizamuddin Markaz gathering, of whom only 64 tested positive for COVID-19 and two more died of the virus, prominent Muslim organisation Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind said on Friday.Jamaat president Maulana Arshad Madani said the “highlighting” of Tablighi Jamaat cases while talking about the total number of cases in the country had allegedly created an atmosphere of hatred against Muslims.Maulana Madani said now when there were more than 78,000 cases of COVID-19, the Tablighi Jamaat figures were not being highlighted.Citing data compiled by his organisation through various embassies and the Nizamuddin Markaz, Madani said there were 1,640 members of foreign Tablighi Jamaat from 47 countries in India at the time of the Markaz incident. Of them, 64 tested positive for the virus and two died due to it.All 64 people had now recovered, he added.The foreign Tablighi Jamaat members included those from Indonesia, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Sudan, Singapore, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Philippines, Russia, Sri Lanka, US, Syria, Belgium, Brazil, Australia, and Afghanistan.Of the total foreign Tablighi Jamaat members, 739 were in Delhi and the rest were in other states, the Jamiat said.Maulana Madani said COVID-19 spread had nothing to do with the Tablighi Jamaat, but it was portrayed by vested interests to be the case to create ill-will against Muslims at large.Hundreds of Indians and foreigners attended a Tablighi Jamaat congregation in the Nizamuddin area of Delhi in March, ignoring warnings by the government against large gatherings in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.A number of people who attended the event were later found to be suffering from COVID-19.Earlier, government sources said foreign nationals, who attended the congregation would face punitive action if they were found to have participated in the gathering violating visa rules.

Interstate transactions also remain an issue.  Sandip Das from ICRI (Indian Council for Research in International Economic Relations) says when interstate trade is facilitated across all ‘mandis’ through e-NAM platform, farmers will get benefit of the price discovery mechanism.“Traders and buyers would have to be provided with single license to conduct trade across ‘mandis’ in a state. With so many ‘mandis’ coming on board, the government should ensure seamless trading of agricultural commodities across states,” he adds.Aiming to create a unified national market for agricultural commodities to promote uniformity in marketing by streamlining procedures, removing information asymmetry between buyers and sellers and promoting real time price discovery based on actual demand and supply, e-NAM remains the key focus of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to strengthen the sector amid the COVID-19 crisis, say officials.Launched on April 14, 2016, in the COVID-19 scenario the platform is being used to transform trading of all farm-related commodities, including seeds, fertilisers and agro-chemical plant protection inputs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/increasing-e-nam-footprint-with-38-new-mandis-on-board-centre-achieves-target-of-1-000-on-online-trading-portal-85240

The company had introduced a proto-type in March shortly after the country went into the lockdown mode."SkanRay/Mahindra ventilator, especially designed for Coronavirus, is ready for production. Thankfully there is no demand. Despite the ingenuity and many weeks of hard work by our engineers, we hope the machines never have to leave our factories," Pawan Goenka, Managing Director, M&M, said in a tweet this morning.In another tweet, Goenka said the Mahindra team consulted a team of 10 doctors and a few biomedical engineers who helped the company design and manufacture the low-cost ventilator.He added that Mahindra was making the designs available to anyone who wants to manufacture the device.Later company chairman Anand Mahindra thanked his team and medical device company SkanRay Technologies which provided the knowhow for the manufacture of the ventilators.Goenka also put out a 16-second video on Twitter explaining the functioning of the ventilator.In March, Mahindra had announced that its ventilators would be much cheaper than imported ventilators priced at between Rs 5 and 10 lakhs.The company had also said it was working on an Ambu Bag ventilator used in emergency cases when patients are being brought to hospitals in cardiac care ambulances.Following the lockdown, the Mahindra group had offered its resorts for care facilities to patients suffering from the Covid-19 virus.

Compensation must be recovered on the formula already laid down. It will be appropriate that Chief Secretary, Delhi calls a meeting of all concerned within one month from today and oversees preparation of an appropriate SOP for fixing responsibility on the subject," the bench said.The Ministry of Jal Shakti may also take necessary steps in the matter, the bench added.The tribunal had earlier constituted an independent Monitoring Committee, headed by former Delhi high court judge, Justice SP Garg, to look into the issue.The Committee had found that 14,231 borewells were illegally operating in Delhi and 15 per cent of the groundwater had reached below 40 meters."Depleting of groundwater was also affecting the flow of the river Yamuna,” the committee said and suggested that subsidy in the form of free water was being misused and to avoid payment of water charges for more than 20,000 litres free water, groundwater was being freely extracted without any remedial action by the authorities.The tribunal was hearing a plea filed by city resident Rakesh Kumar alleging that water filling plants were being operated without license and supplying contaminated water to the residents at the Kashmere Gate here.

However, nothing happened for a long time,” they said.Ghormore said, “As there was no solution in sight, we decided to start our journey on foot till our village in Lanjhi with my daughter Anuragini in my arms.”However, after some distance my wife was unable to walk further, he said.“After that, I created a handcart with the help of bamboo and other locally-made material, including wheels and a lever made of the tube to pull it,” he said.When they reached Rajegaon on the MP-Maharashtra border, the authorities stopped them and enquired about them, where the couple shared their story.Bhargava said that as per Ghormore’s account, he walked over 700 km for 17 days with his family on the cart.“The man had made a handcart on which his wife and daughter were sitting. He came pulling them from Hyderabad,” the official said.After they reached the MP border, they were provided with food.“A private vehicle was arranged for them to send them back to their home in Kunde village in the district, which is about 18 km away from the border,” Bhargava said.A police official said that besides this family, nearly 400 other labourers also reached Rajegaon from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana on foot.“They were medically examined, provided food and pain-killers. They were later sent to their destinations,” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/migrant-walks-from-hyderabad-to-mp-pulling-wife-kid-on-cart-85221

15-05-2020||---||No coercive action against private companies for non-payment of wages during COVID-19: SC||New Delhi, May 15The Supreme Court, on Friday, ordered that no coercive action could be taken till next week against private companies not complying with the March 29 notification mandating them to pay full salary/wages to employees/workers during the COVID-19 crisis.“No coercive action shall be taken in the meantime,” a Bench headed by Justice LN Rao said while issuing notice to the Centre on petitions filed by the Indian Jute Mills Association and an association of factory owners from Punjab.The Supreme Court asked the government to respond to the petitions within a week.The order came on petitions challenging the validity of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) notification mandating payment of full wages to workers during the COVID-19 lockdown.“How long can the government expect companies to pay?” the Bench wondered and went on to pass the interim order after Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta sought further time to respond to the petitions.While hearing another petition filed by Ficus Pax Limited, the Supreme Court had, on April 27, given two weeks to the Centre to place on record its policy on the MHA notification directing payment of full salaries/wages to employees/workers by private companies during the lockdown.The Ludhiana Hand Tools Manufacturer Association’s counsel argued that companies were shut and they were under the threat of prosecution for non-payment of wages. No coercive action should be taken against the companies for non-payment of wages, he demanded.The association also challenged the validity of Section 10(2)(i) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005.The provisions of this Act cannot “impinge upon express provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, and take away the right to lay off workmen during the times of natural calamity,” it said.Terming the MHA order under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, as arbitrary, it said the order violated the private companies’ right to carry on any occupation, trade or business guaranteed under Articles 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.“Government has not taken any steps for the workforce, but has instead put the burden on the employers to pay full wages,” the association submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-coercive-action-against-private-companies-for-non-payment-of-wages-during-covid-19-sc-85217

15-05-2020||Kolkata||Bengal COVID warriors worry over size of PPEs||One size doesn't fit all, and   many doctors and other medical staff on the frontline of the fight against COVID-19 in West Bengal are learning this the hard way.Donning and doffing the armour - the PPE - their defence against the disease, has become a daily struggle for them, with some complaining that their colleagues got infected with the coronavirus because of the wrong size of the battle gear.Some from the medical fraternity, including those serving in government hospitals, said putting on the personal protective equipment (PPE) and removing it, particularly the latter, in an incorrect way, exposes them to the risk of contracting the disease."There is a process of correctly donning and doffing the PPE. Non-adherence to that process can put a medical staff at risk,” said a doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.Insisting that he should not be named, the doctor said the coveralls supplied to them often did not match their size."We need PPE that match out height and body mass which we don't always get. At times we have to squeeze ourselves into the coveralls and there are times when they hang loosely over us. A little carelessness can leave us sick with the virus," the doctor claimed.The doctor said the virus sticks to the outer surface of the coverall and incautious removal of the gear could transfer it to the human body.Around 150 frontline COVID fighters, including doctors and nurses, have fallen sick with the virus in West Bengal so far.The doctor said some training was required before a medical professional can wear and remove the air-tight and stifling synthetic clothing correctly.A PPE consists of a mask or respirator, goggles or face shield, gloves, coverall/gowns (with or without apron), a head cover and a shoe cover. All frontline health workers treating COVID-19 patients should necessarily wear it."The causative agent for COVID-19 is transmitted human-to-human mainly through respiratory droplets generated when people cough or sneeze, and also by touching contaminated objects... So PPE is very important for us, and proper donning and doffing is even more important to avoid contamination," said another senior doctor at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital.Two doctors in the acute respiratory infections section of the Institute of Child Health could not get PPE because they were too tall, while three lady doctors at NRS Medical College and Hospital treating COVID-19 patients had to make do with oversized personal protective equipment.Another doctor at RG Kar Medical College Hospital said wearing a tight coverall was risky as even a small tear could let the virus in."First, for almost a month we did not get any PPE and then what we are getting is not fitting us. How can you expect us to take the risk? I have purchased at least seven PPE from the local market at a very high cost. My safety is my priority now," said a senior gynaecologist at Basirhat Hospital in North 24 Parganas.Most of these doctors are using PPE for the first time, said a doctor at Beleghata Infectious Diseases Hospital.In the absence of training on how to don and doff the coveralls, some medical professions have turned to YouTube for help, he said."Correctly doffing the gear is very important as it's then that the chances of getting infected are high. As soon as the patient care tasks are over, careful removal of the PPE and discarding it in the receptacle is very crucial,” said the doctor."While removing them we must pay attention to avoid self-contamination or contaminating the environment with infected equipment. The PPEs must be opened inside out," he said.West Bengal faced acute shortage of PPEs during the early days of the outbreak and decided to get them manufactured in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the state. It still has to depend on other states for the PPE.According to a government health bulletin, the state had manufactured 8 lakh PPE till May 14, while orders for 8.50 lakh were pending delivery.

15-05-2020||London||Over 5,80,000 surgeries in India may be cancelled due to COVID-19||More than 5,80,000 planned surgeries in India might be cancelled or delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a study conducted by an international consortium.The study, published in the British Journal of Surgery, has projected that based on a 12-week period of peak disruption to hospital services due to COVID-19, around 28.4 million elective surgeries worldwide will be cancelled or postponed in 2020.This will lead to patients facing a lengthy wait for their health issues to be resolved, according to the research conducted by the CovidSurg Collaborative, a research network of over 5,000 surgeons from 120 countries focused on the impact of COVID-19 on surgical care.The study is led by members based in the United Kingdom, Benin, Ghana, India, Italy, Mexico, Nigeria, Rwanda, Spain, South Africa and the United States.The modelling study indicates that each additional week of disruption to hospital services will be associated with a further 2.4 million cancellations.The researchers, including those from the University of Birmingham in the UK, collected detailed information from surgeons across 359 hospitals and 71 countries on plans for cancellation of elective surgery.This data was then statistically modelled to estimate totals for cancelled surgery across 190 countries.The researchers project that worldwide 72.3 per cent of planned surgeries would be cancelled through the peak period of COVID-19 related disruption, adding that most cancelled surgeries would be for non-cancer conditions.In India, as many as 5,84,737 patients may face surgery cancellations or delays over a 12-week period around the time COVID-19 peaks, according to the study estimate.Orthopaedic procedures would be cancelled most frequently, with 6.3 million orthopaedic surgeries cancelled worldwide over a 12-week period, the researchers said.The study also projected that globally 2.3 million cancer surgeries would be cancelled or postponed, they said.“During the COVID-19 pandemic, elective surgeries have been cancelled to reduce the risk of patients being exposed to COVID-19 in hospital, and to support the wider hospital response, for example by converting operating theatres in to intensive care units,” said Aneel Bhangu, from the University of Birmingham.“Although essential, cancellations place a heavy burden on patients and society. Patients’ conditions may deteriorate, worsening their quality of life as they wait for rescheduled surgery. In some cases, for example cancer, delayed surgeries may lead to a number of unnecessary deaths,” said Bhangu.Dmitri Nepogodiev, also from the University of Birmingham, noted that each additional week of disruption to hospital services results in an additional 43,300 surgeries being cancelled.Therefore, it is important that hospitals regularly assess the situation so that elective surgery can be resumed at the earliest opportunity, he said.

15-05-2020||New Delhi||CBSE to introduce arts-integrated project work for Class 1 to 10 from this session||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has decided to introduce arts-integrated project work for Class I to X from this academic session to make teaching and learning competency-based and joyful.“As part of this, at least one art-integrated project in each subject shall be taken up by all students of Class IX and X from the academic session 2020-21, and students of Classes I to VIII will also be encouraged to take at least one art-integrated project (trans-disciplinary project) in a given academic year,” the board said in a letter to schools.The CBSE has directed schools that for students of Class I to VIII, art-integrated projects should be of trans-disciplinary nature.In at least one project, students across classes till Class X will have to integrate an art form of the paired state or UT, as defined under the ‘Ek Bharat Shrestha Bharat’ Programme.For example, students in Delhi schools must take up a project that is based on the art form of Sikkim. The list of paired states and UTs is available on the CBSE website.The education board had last year announced the mandatory introduction of art-education or arts-integrated learning for all classes.“It has been decided to introduce arts-integrated project work for Class I to X to promote art-integrated learning in schools to make teaching and learning competency-based and joyful,” the CBSE said in the letter.“The project work can include more than one subject and this can be considered for internal assessment in the subjects concerned. Students of Class IX and X will take up the art-integrated project work as a subject enrichment activity in all subjects for internal assessment,” it said.The board has clarified that projects had to be taken up in an economical-friendly manner, using local resources without any financial burden to parents or guardians.“The topics for art-integrated projects should be a new topic that has not been taken up in the classroom yet. Subject teachers and art teachers are to give proper guidance to students about their projects. The projects selected should be doable by students and subject teachers without the assistance of art teachers, artists or others,” the letter said.“The assessment techniques should be relevant and age-appropriate and will be communicated to students along with maximum marks before the commencement of work on the project. The marks awarded for these projects, as part of subject-enrichment activities of class 10, will be collected by the Board at the time of uploading of marks of internal assessment,” it added.

15-05-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Third tranche of economic measures focuses on agriculture, allied activities||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 15Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, at her third press conference to detail the PM’s Rs 20-lakh Covid stimulus, announced steps to usher barrier-free agricultural trade, a Rs 1 lakh-crore NABARD-anchored fund to set up modern cold chains and storage centers besides thrust to fisheries, animal husbandry and dairying sectors.Several of the proposals, she conceded, were aired in previous budgets.The Centre also intends bringing in a Central law to remove all barriers on inter-state trade and allow farmers to sell to anyone. It is also looking at a framework law to ensure the farmer gets predictable prices.Addressing the disappointment due to absence of direct cash injections, Sitharaman said the government’s philosophy behind focusing on liquidity measures and infrastructure building initiatives was to empower people rather than give doles. “Entitlements, where due will be given, but the focus is on making sure that India is helped to stand up on its own by the creation of skills and development of logistics,’’ she explained.That is why most of the announcements were to set up infrastructure on the ground, she added. The PM Matsya Sampada Yojna, announced in the last Budget, allocates Rs 11,000 crore for marine, inland fisheries and aquaculture and Rs 9,000 crore for the development of infrastructure such as fishing harbours, cold chains. A refurbished scheme to vaccinate all cattle will cost Rs 13,000 crore. Another Rs 4,000-crore package is for herbal corridors along the Ganges but it is not clear if it will be dovetailed with a similar component in the Namame Gange programme.A two per cent interest subvention scheme for dairy cooperatives will cost Rs 5,000 crore and government dairies purchased milk of Rs 4,100 crore that otherwise would have been thrown due to lockdown.A Rs 10,000-crore fund will help local micro enterprises go global with their specialty products such as saffron in Kashmir, ragi in Karnataka and Makhana in Bihar.Sitharaman acknowledged that no amount of relief would be adequate to people who had lost their incomes. But as soon as the lockdown was announced, the government had provided money and gas and relaxed EPF rule to help those who could benefit from early withdrawals. “We are trying as much as possible to extend relief. I am not saying there enough has been given but we are doing that,’’ she explained.She refuted former Finance Minister P Chidambaram’s criticism that most of the provisions were to provide liquidity. Senior Finance Ministry officials pointed out that stimulus packages the world over were a combination of fiscal outgos and liquidity provisions.On the Rs 1 lakh-crore NABARD fund, Sitharaman said the aim is to help entrepreneurs procuring from farms but cannot reach out to global markets because of absence of storage infrastructure. The Rs 10,000 crore fund is for making global brands out of local herbal, wellness and healthy nutrition related products.In a step towards administrative reforms, cereals, edible oil, oil seeds, onions and potatoes will be completely deregulated and taken out of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. Stock limits will be subject to the installed capacity and this facility will also be extended exporters.HIGHLIGHTSAnnouncements related to infrastructure, capacity buildingSitharaman's third tranche of economic measures focused on agriculture and allied economic activities.She announced 11 measures in all---eight related to strengthening infrastructure and remaining concerning governance and administrative reforms.---Rs 10,000 crore for food enterprises to be executed on cluster-based approach. Health and well-being, nutritional, wellness-related, herbal products, forest-based produce will be included.---Providing Rs 1 lakh-crore for aggregators, FPOs, primary agriculture cooperative societies or for strengthening farm gate infrastructure.---Top-to-total yojana extended for next six months. Will be seen as a pilot for six months.---Rs 500 crore for bee-keeping to benefit 2 lakh bee-keepers. ---Rs 4,000 crore outlay for national board for promotion of herbal and medicinal cultivation.

15-05-2020||---||Nepal protesting at someone else’s behest: Army Chief||New Delhi, May 15Amid an ongoing India-Nepal diplomatic row, Indian Army Chief General MM Naravane on Friday said there had never been an issue about the tri-junction (of India-China-Nepal) and added that Nepal might have raised the issue at “someone else’s behest”.Though he did not name China, the hint was amply clear as Beijing was the only interested party to it.Nepal has been protesting after India on May 8 opened a road till the Lipulekh pass in Uttarakhand for connecting India with Kailash Mansarovar in Tibet, China.General Naravane was answering questions after a talk on “COVID and Indian Army: Responses and Beyond” at Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA).He was asked a question by Vice Admiral Sekhar Sinha (retd) on why was Nepal protesting on “our road” across the Lipulekh and why had it decided to set up a border post at the spot.“Do you see a link between Lipulekh and the recent clashes between the Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh and Sikkim?” the Admiral asked.The Army Chief said there was no contradiction in Lipulekh. “We have made a road west of the Kali river. Nepal has accepted its territory is to the east of Kali river. There has never been an issue about the tri-junction (Nepal is protesting that the Lipulekh pass is not with India),” said Naravane.“Nepal may have raised the issue at someone else’s behest,” he added. However, he saw no connection between the face-offs and any other events.‘Technology to drive battlefield’Earlier during his 30 minute talk, the General stressed upon technology saying, will the tanks and large aerial platforms be needed in the future or should we be looking beyond?The rate of change in technology will drive the battlefield. Because of technology we will have to shift from man power intensive to technology intensive, there could be 10 to 15 per cent reduction in manpower. The human being will be needed to take the tactical decision, he said.After the Balakot strikes (February 2019) and surgical strikes (September 2016), it shows that attacks like these would be short of conventional war. “We are working at having strategy,” he said.On the forthcoming joint commands, the General said, the integrated air defence command would be up soon. It would be followed by maritime command. Then the Army is looking at the western theatre and the Northern theatre. Don’t get bogged down with names, he said. “We have had a couple of brain storming sessions and matters are being dealt as per operational necessity to suit our peculiar requirements,” said the Army Chief.On the Integrated Battle Groups (IBG), he said it’s based on very clear operational imperatives. “It will not cause any change to operational readiness or reduce combat potential. It is an idea whose time has come due to better weapons, improved mobility and communication.”  On Covid impacting the Army, the Army Chief said none of the Army units in operational areas in Northern Command and Eastern Command had a case of the virus. “This is because at the borders, we are free from any interaction with outside population,” the Chief of the Army explained.“We cannot have social distancing in an ambush or inside a tank, it’s impossible,” he said.On impending budgetary cuts, he said, “No cuts will be imposed at the cost operational efficiency or readiness”.There will be budgetary constraints, how much we cannot say, he said.Budgetary investment in safety is investment in growth, he gave the example of how the Sensex grew after Balakot strikes.He gave another example saying forces spend Rs 1,000 crore per annum in and around Bathinda Cantt.Areas have been identified for budget saving. Some 100 units which were slated to move from one peace location to another, will not move. Only those from high altitude of counter insurgency operations will be relieved, he said.The Army may not have large formation training in Rajasthan, the Chief added.On being asked about the two-front war he said it was now “two front plus half in Counter Terrorists and add another half for Covid”.However, he said “Both fronts will not be 100 per cent active. There will be priority front and secondary front, the latter will be kept as dormant. Two front would not be just military offensive but a diplomatic effort too.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-protesting-at-someone-elses-behest-army-chief-85200

The monsoon normally sets over Kerala on June 1 with a standard deviation of about seven days.The IMD has been issuing operational forecasts for the date of monsoon onset over Kerala from 2005 onwards using an indigenously developed state-of-the-art statistical model with a error of ± 4 days, say officials.The six predictors used in the models are minimum temperatures over northwest India, pre-monsoon rainfall peak over south peninsula,  outgoing long wave radiation (OLR) over South China Sea, lower tropospheric zonal wind over southeast Indian Ocean, upper tropospheric zonal wind over the east equatorial Indian Ocean, and outgoing long wave radiation over the south-west Pacific region.IMD’s operational forecasts of the date of monsoon onset over Kerala during the past 15 years (2005-19) were proved to be correct except in 2015, they add.In the Indian monsoon region, initial rains are experienced over south Andaman Sea and the monsoon winds then advance north-westwards across the Bay of Bengal.As per the new normal dates of monsoon onset/progress, the southwest monsoon advances over the Andaman Sea around May 22.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/imd-says-monsoon-to-arrive-over-kerala-on-june-5-skymet-predicts-it-by-may-28-85195
15-05-2020||New Delhi||Can’t stop or monitor movement of migrant workers on roads, says SC||The Supreme Court Friday said it is impossible for courts to monitor or stop the movement of migrant workers across the country and it is for the government to take necessary action in this regard.The Centre told the top court that migrant workers across the country were being provided transportation by the government to their destinations but they have to wait for their turn, rather than starting walking on foot amid coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic.A Bench headed by Justice L Nageswara Rao refused to entertain an application seeking a direction to the Centre to ask all District Magistrates to identify stranded migrant workers and provide shelter, food to them before ensuring their free transportation to native places in view of the recent incident at Aurangabad in which 16 workers were mowed down by a goods train.The Bench, which also comprised Justices S K Kaul and B R Gavai, asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta whether there was any way to stop these migrants workers from walking on the roads.Mehta said states are providing inter-state transport to the migrant workers but if the people start walking on foot instead of waiting for transportation, then nothing can be done.He said authorities can only request these people not to start walking on foot as using any force to stop them would be counter-productive.Mehta told the Bench, which was hearing the matter through video-conferencing, that subject to the agreement between state governments everybody would get a chance to travel to their destinations.Advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava, who had filed the plea, referred to recent  incidents of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh where migrant workers were killed in accidents on highways.“How can we stop it?,” the Bench observed, adding that states should take necessary action on these issues.The Bench, which said it was not inclined to hear the plea, observed that it is impossible for the court to monitor who is walking and who is not walking.Srivastava had filed the plea soon after the Aurangabad incident in which 16 migrant workers, who were returning to Madhya Pradesh and had slept on railway tracks, were mowed down by a goods train.The interim application, filed in a disposed PIL, had said that the deceased labourers belonged to Shahdol and Umaria Districts of Madhya Pradesh and were walking from Jalna in Maharashtra to Aurangabad Railway Station to board trains to reach hometowns. After walking for several kilometers, they decided to take rest on the railway tracks between Satana and Karmad and were mowed down by a goods train, it had said.  Earlier, the top court had disposed of the PIL seeking migrant workers’ welfare during the pandemic and consequential lockdown saying that the Centre and states are taking appropriate steps to provide them relief. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cant-stop-or-monitor-movement-of-migrant-workers-on-roads-says-sc-85190
15-05-2020||New Delhi||Mobiles can be potential carrier of coronavirus in healthcare institutions: Doctors||A group of doctors from AIIMS, Raipur have recommended restrictions on the use of mobile phones in healthcare institutions amid the COVID-19 pandemic, warning that such devices can be a potential carrier of the virus and lead to infection among healthcare workers.In a commentary published in the BMJ Global Health journal, the doctors stated that mobile phone surfaces are a peculiar 'high-risk' surface, which can directly come in contact with the face or mouth, even if hands are properly washed and one study indicates that some healthcare workers use phones every 15 minutes to two hours.Though there have been many significant guidelines from various health organisations like WHO and CDC focusing on prevention and control of disease, the commentary highlighted "there is no mention of or focus on mobile phones in these guidelines, including the WHO infection control and prevention guidelines, which recommends the use of hand washing".In healthcare facilities, phones are used to communicate with other health care workers, look up recent medical guidelines, research drug interactions, understand adverse events and side effects, conduct telemedicine appointments and track patients among others, stated the document.The document has been authored by Dr Vineet Kumar Pathak, Dr Sunil Kumar Panigrahi, Dr M Mohan Kumar, Dr Utsav Raj and Dr Karpaga Priya P from the Department of Community and Family Medicine."In their tendency to come in direct contact with the face, nose or eyes in healthcare settings, mobile phones are perhaps second only to masks, caps or goggles. "However, they are neither disposable nor washable like these other three, thus warranting disinfection. Mobile phones can effectively negate hand hygiene... There is growing evidence that mobile phones are a potential vector for pathogenic organisms," the authors said.It is the need of the hour to address proper hygienic use of mobile phones in healthcare settings. In a study in India, almost 100 per cent of health workers of a tertiary care hospital used mobile phones in the hospital, but only 10 per cent of them had at any time wiped their mobile phones clean, the commentary published on April 22 said."The safest thing to do is to consider your phone as an extension of your hand, so remember you are transferring whatever is on your phone to your hand," Dr Pathak said.Amidst the ongoing pandemic, two biggest mobile phone companies have uploaded their user support guidelines, saying that 70 pc isopropyl alcohol or Clorox Disinfecting Wipes can be used to gently wipe the exterior surface of phones in switched-off mode.However, in doing so, the use of bleach or entry of moisture through any of the openings must be avoided, and any harsh chemical may damage the oleophobic screen, leading to damage in the touch screen sensitivity of the phone, the article stated.Mobile phones are one of the most highly touched surfaces according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), along with counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables.The doctors recommended restriction on mobile phone usage in healthcare settings like ICUs and operation theatres, while advocating use of headphones to prevent contact with the face while talking. There should be no sharing of mobile phones, headphones or headsets of any kind. In addition, where available, the use of interdepartmental intercom facility though telephones may be promoted. AIIMS, New Delhi, Resident Doctors' Association (RDA) General Secretary, Dr Srinivas Rajkumar T said even outside health care settings, people should pay special attention to usage of mobile phones as they carry them to all places."Phone and computer peripherals like keyboard, mouse, etc should be covered with transparent plastic covers which can be cleaned without interfering with their function. Cleaning hands by soap or alcohol-based hand sanitizer before and after contact with phone and between contact with other surfaces can decrease the risk of potential transmission. "Using handsfree headset, dedicated operator/assistant per ward handling the communication via common line in hospitals while on duty can enable communication without compromising safety," Dr Srinivas said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mobiles-can-be-potential-carrier-of-coronavirus-in-healthcare-institutions-doctors-85189
15-05-2020|| ||SC stays Gujarat HC order setting aside Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama’s election||New Delhi, May 15The Supreme Court on Friday stayed a Gujarat High Court order setting aside state’s Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama’s 2017 election from Dholka Assembly constituency for electoral malpractices. A Bench headed by Justice Mohan M. Shantangoudar asked Congress candidate Ashwin Rathod—on whose Chudasama’s election was set aside by the high court—to respond to the petition.On behalf of Chudasama, senior advocates Harish Salve and NK Kaul argued that the HC should have examined the Returning Officer to see if the rejection of 429 votes was done properly or not. Their submission was opposed by senior advocate Kapil Sibal who represented Rathod.In his appeal, Chudasama urged the top court to stay the operation of the high clourt’s order till pendency of his appeal in the top court. The HC order came on an election petition filed by Congress candidate Ashwin Rathod who had challenged Chudasama’s election from Dholka Assembly constituency by a margin of mere 327 votes. The high court held that Returning Officer “illegally rejected” 429 postal ballots during the counting of votes, while the victory margin was only 327. It had rejected Chudasama’s request for a stay to enable him to file an appeal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-stays-gujarat-hc-order-setting-aside-minister-bhupendrasinh-chudasamas-election-85188
15-05-2020||New Delhi||SC asks Centre to apprise it about accommodation to quarantine doctors near hospitals||The Supreme Court Friday asked the Centre to apprise it about steps taken for quarantining doctors and medical staff engaged in fight against coronavirus in accommodations near the hospitals itself.A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and B R Gavai, which took up the matter through video conferencing asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, to take instructions and apprise it by next week.During the hearing, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for doctor-petitioner Arushi Jain, said that resident doctors in government hospitals, after completing 7/14 days on duty, are supposed to be quarantined.He said these doctors are quarantined in places where they have to share rooms, bathrooms but it should be done in places, where social distancing can be maintained.Rohatgi said this type of arrangements would defeat the purpose of quarantining and corona warriors will fall down.He said the government should requisition such hotels and guest houses where proper facilities are available and social distancing could be maintained.He said he was not seeking any adversarial order but is only asking for suitable accommodation with necessary facilities near the hospital for the doctors and medical staffs, who are in forefront of dealing with Covid-19 pandemic.He added that there must be some standard operating procedures as doctors are also facing problems in travelling from their residences to the hospitals, facing trouble in housing societies and the government should help them, or these frontline warriors will fall down.Mehta said that Centre has issued directions to all state governments to requisition hotels and guest houses for the doctors and medical staffs, which include budget hotels and five-star hotels.He said that necessary steps are already being taken but if there are any aberrations in any particular instance, it can be brought to the notice of the government and it would be resolved.Mehta said that government is taking every steps to protect the warriors and directions have been issued and it is now a criminal non-bailable offence to attack doctors or asking them to leave the house or housing society.The bench asked Mehta, to consider the suggestions given by the petitioner for providing doctors accommodations nearby the hospital for quarantining. Mehta said that some advisories are under considerations of the government and this would be one of them.Rohatgi intervened and said that what the Solicitor General is saying is too few too little as directive is fine but it should be told as how many hotels or accommodations are there.He said there should be a helpline for doctors and medical staffs to complain about any problem they are facing. Mehta said that Rohatgi’s client does not have knowledge of pan India and these kinds of debates are demoralising as for government protection of corona warriors is first priority.The bench asked Mehta as to why can’t the government consider requisitioning other places with better facilities near the hospital itself?Mehta replied that it was a fair suggestion and would be considered. He said that as far as helpline is considered there already exists one.The bench, then told Mehta that it would take up the matter next week and by then he should take instructions on quarantine facilities for doctors and medical staffs nearby the hospitals.  On April 8, the top court had observed that the doctors and medical staff are the “first line of defence of the country” in the battle against COVID-19 pandemic, and directed the Centre to ensure that appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) are made available to them for treating coronavirus patients.While passing a slew of interim directions to ensure safety of doctors and healthcare professionals, the apex court had expressed concern over the recent incidents of attack on them and directed the Centre, all states and Union Territories to provide necessary police security to the medical staff in hospitals and places where patients, who are either quarantined, suspected or diagnosed with COVID-19, are housed.The top court had directed that “states shall also take necessary action against those persons who obstruct and commit any offence in respect to performance of duties by doctors, medical staff and other government officials deputed to contain COVID-19”.The court had passed the order on three petitions including that of Arushi Jain seeking protective kits, other requisite equipment and safety measure for doctors and healthcare workers amid the coronavirus pandemic.The apex court had directed that police security be extended to doctors and other medical staff, who visit places to conduct screening of people to find out symptoms of the disease.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-asks-centre-to-apprise-it-about-accommodation-to-quarantine-doctors-near-hospitals-85186

Rai is survived by two sons.Born into a Tulu-speaking Bunt family in Dakshina Kannada's Puttur town, Rai entered the crime world at a very young age.Karnataka police issued arrest warrants against Rai in eight cases, including murder and conspiracy.In 2002, Rai was deported to India from the United Arab Emirates.On arrival, he was questioned by various investigation agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and Intelligence Bureau (IB), and by the Karnataka police.

Even a quarantine centre had to be sealed in Manipur.On the other hand, large numbers of cases continued to get detected in big urban clusters. Maharashtra, the most-affected state, reported 1,576 new cases to take its tally to 29,100, while its death toll rose to 1,068. Tamil Nadu crossed the 10,000 mark with 434 new cases, while Gujarat saw 340 more people testing positive to push its tally to 9,932.According to the Union Health Ministry, 30 municipal areas account for 79 per cent of India's coronavirus infection caseload.At a meeting of a group of ministers chaired by Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, it was stressed that the focus of COVID-19 management strategy needs to be on the states with the highest number of confirmed cases and fatalities. Also, focus is needed on treatment and case fatality management, for which timely detection and contact tracing were the best way forward.The Finance Ministry in the meantime unveiled the third booster dose, mainly consisting of measures aimed at helping farmers and for reforms in agriculture and allied sectors, of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Rs 20 lakh crore 'special package' for making India self-reliant in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Modi said the third tranche would help the rural economy and boost farmers' income.India has been under a lockdown since March 25, which was initially scheduled to end on April 14 but has got extended twice -- first till May 3 and then till May 17 with some relaxations.A final decision on the fourth phase is expected soon, but officials said there could be greater relaxations and more flexibility for states and union territories while measures being explored include gradual reopening of the railways and domestic airlines.Schools, colleges, malls and cinema halls may not be allowed to open anywhere in the country, but salons, barber shops and optical shops may be allowed everywhere barring COVID-19 containment areas. E-retailers may be allowed to deliver non-essential items too.Final guidelines will be issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs after going through the suggestions of various state governments. During his last interaction with Chief Ministers, Modi had asked them to submit their suggestions by May 15.According to officials, Punjab, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Assam and Telangana want the lockdown to continue, while some states have sought powers to decide the zoning of districts -- green, orange and red -- as per the COVID-19 situation.This request of the state governments may be accepted so that they can restrict or allow movement of people or economic activities in a particular place depending on the ground situation, an official told PTI.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation on Monday, had said that the lockdown 4.0 would have a "completely different form", with new rules."No state wants complete withdrawal of lockdown but all want gradual resumption of economic activities," the official said.Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka are among some states which are not in favour of complete resumption of train and air services, at least till May-end.The railways have already started special trains to 15 destinations from Delhi and have been running several hundred 'Shramik Special' trains from different parts of the country to various places for transportation of migrant workers stranded due to the lockdown. Air India is also engaged in evacuation of thousands of Indians stranded abroad during the lockdown under the 'Vande Bharat Mission'.However, there have been cases of people testing positive after reaching their native places using these trains and flights.Officials said local trains, buses and metro services might start running with limited capacity in non-containment areas of red zones. Autos and taxis are also expected to be allowed in all zones with restrictions on the number of passengers, barring areas identified as 'containment zones'.Maharashtra has favoured strict lockdown measures in Mumbai, its suburbs and Pune, and a complete ban on inter-state and inter-district transport.However, Gujarat wants resumption of economic activities in major urban centres. Delhi, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala have also favoured opening up of economic activities.Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha, which have seen a spike in the COVID-19 cases after arrival of migrant workers, want the lockdown to continue with strict curbs on movement of people.Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has urged Modi not to open state boundaries for the next few months, except for migrants or essential services.Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said the state had written to the Centre urging extension of the lockdown by two more weeks.Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said the Centre might announce many relaxations in the lockdown after May 17.The Arunachal Pradesh government has decided to resume state transport bus service to various destinations from May 18, while the Haryana Roadways has already resumed bus services on select routes within the state.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-india-surpasses-china-tally-with-85-000-confirmed-cases-85162
15-05-2020||---||India-US collaboration needed more than ever: Taranjit Singh Sandhu||Washington, May 15The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the importance of strong India-US collaboration, India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu has said.Noting that India’s partnership with the US in health sciences and technologies is longstanding, the senior diplomat said research and innovation institutions of both the countries have been engaged in understanding important chronic and infectious diseases and in developing therapeutics and diagnostics.“COVID-19 has made us recognise the need for collaborations more than ever before. Our Prime Minister has emphasised a global coordinated response to deal with the challenges even as we work to strengthen our domestic capacities to deal with this crisis,” Sandhu said during a virtual interaction with eminent Indian-American scientists on Thursday.India and the United States have closely collaborated in combating diseases such as tuberculosis; cancer; HIV; eye diseases and environmental health research, he said.There are over 200 ongoing NIH-funded projects in India, involving 20 Institutes from the NIH network and several eminent institutions in India.“A recent successful example of our co-operation is the development of the ROTAVAC against rota virus. Such collaborations will be critical in the fight against COVID-19,” Sandhu said.“From the initial days of the outbreak, our scientists and institutions have been actively engaged in exchange of information. Even as both our countries are focused on combating the disease domestically, NIH and Indian Council for Medical Research have come together and announced a call to support collaborative research and training through India-US partnership to understand the disease,” he said.The India-US Science and Technology Endowment Fund has called for proposals that would enable scientists to carry out joint research and work towards development of new technologies, tools, safety, outreach and also support public-private virtual networks to fight COVID-19, he added.Indian pharmaceutical companies are global leaders in producing affordable low-cost medicines and vaccines and will play an important role in the fight against this pandemic, Sandhu said.“As I speak here today, there are at least three ongoing collaborations between Indian vaccine companies with US-based institutions. These collaborations would be beneficial not just to us, but for the billions who would need to be vaccinated against COVID-19 across the world,” Sandhu said.Asserting that innovation will be the key driver in pandemic response and recovery, the Indian diplomat said that the tech-companies and start-ups have already begun to take the lead in this direction. Telemedicine and telehealth will evolve as will other digital platforms across sectors, he noted.India, he said, takes immense pride in the contribution of doctors, scientists, academicians of Indian-origin, who came to the United States in the pursuit of academic excellence and have distinguished themselves in diverse fields.“Your contributions are widely acknowledged and deeply appreciated by the political leadership in the United States,” he added.The online interaction was attended by Dr Chandan K, Sen J Stanley Battersby Chair and Professor of Surgery and Director of the Indiana Center for Regenerative Medicine and Engineering, Pawan Sinha, professor of vision and computational neuroscience in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Professor Shivaji Sondhi, professor of physics at Princeton University, known for contributions to the field of quantum condensed matter, Professor Aseem Chair of the Department of Chemical Biology and Therapeutics, St. Jude Children’s Hospital and Dr Sanjay Kumar Jain, Professor of Pediatrics, Radiology and Radiological Science.“The scientific community has a critical role to play in the unprecedented circumstances that we face today. As doctors, you are at the frontlines of the fight against COVID-19, as scientists and biotech experts, you are at the forefront of global efforts to find a cure for COVID-19,” Sandhu said in his remarks. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-us-collaboration-needed-more-than-ever-taranjit-singh-sandhu-85161
15-05-2020||New Delhi||The decorated CBI officer who brought Vijay Mallya down||“Painstaking and meticulous” investigation and countless visits to London by CBI officer Suman Kumar finally bore fruit after three long years in the bank fraud case against flamboyant businessman Vijay Mallya.Mallya, the high-flying owner of now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines, on Thursday lost his application seeking leave to appeal his extradition to India in the UK Supreme Court, setting a 28-day clock on his removal from the UK.The extradition case pertains to the alleged bank fraud of Rs 900 crore in IDBI Bank. The embattled liquor baron also faces probe in another case related to alleged fraud amounting of more than Rs 9,000 crore in a consortium of banks led by State Bank of India.Kumar was assigned the case against Mallya, known for his ostentatious lifestyle and who had made his way to the Indian Parliament as a Rajya Sabha member, as the DSP of Banking Frauds and Security Cell, Mumbai in October, 2015. Kumar is now an additional superintendent of police in the country's premier investigation agency.Mallya was facing the media heat as his failing aviation company was finding it difficult to pay staff salaries and retain premium services it had promised to its customers with clamour for booking him increasing day by day, sources in the agency had said.It was a tricky situation for the CBI as the lending banks did not file any complaint against Mallya in spite of serious allegations of fraud against him, they said.The agency decided to go ahead and used its source-based information to register the first FIR against Mallya related to Rs 900 crore alleged loan fraud against him. And Kumar was entrusted with the probe.The officer, who joined the agency as a 23-year-old sub-inspector, by then had an impeccable record as an ace investigator of white-collar crimes winning the CBI gold medal for best investigating officer in 2002 handed over by then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2004.Fifty-five-year-old Kumar, honed in traditional CBI style of investigation, had also received the Police Medal for Meritorious Service in 2008, outstanding investigator in 2013 and the President's Police Medal for Distinguished Service in 2015 when he took over the case.In 2016, Mallya escaped the country causing an embarrassment to the agency and triggering an uphill legal battle in the courts of the United Kingdom to bring him back.The then Additional Director, Rakesh Asthana, took over reins of the case as the Chief of the Special Investigation Team. He and Kumar proved to be a potent team investigating the case, making rounds of London to ensure not a single hearing is missed and coordinating with the Crown Prosecution Service which was representing the case in courts in London.The job was difficult as India had an abysmal record in succeeding in extradition cases in Europe, especially the United Kingdom. The case was fought by the Crown Prosecution Service with active support from the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate.Kumar ensured a concrete case of fraud is established and a charge sheet is filed in India to make a strong case for Mallya's extradition. It was imperative that India had a case against Mallya which was punishable in laws of the United Kingdom.Through his exhaustive probe, Kumar managed to establish alleged fraud and money laundering in his probe for which charge sheets were filed in India."We were not contesting a trial there. We had to convince the courts that a prima facie case is made out to justify extradition to India," a senior officer said.The findings reached by Kumar in his probe managed to achieve a conclusive argument in support of extradition of Mallya to India which culminated in the UK High Court denying him the leave to approach the Supreme Court to challenge his extradition. Kumar was lauded by the CBI for his efforts in the case. “CBI appreciates the painstaking investigation, the hard work and the meticulous efforts of Investigating Officer Suman Kumar, Additional SP, CBI in successfully pursuing investigation and extradition proceedings against the fugitive," the agency spokesperson said.

15-05-2020||Washington||US’s 18-point plan to hold China accountable for corona includes deepening 'military ties with India'||A top US senator has unveiled an 18-point plan, including enhancing military ties with India, to hold the Chinese government accountable for its "lies, deception, and cover-ups" that ultimately led to the global COVID-19 pandemic.The prominent suggestions are moving manufacturing chain from China and deepening military-strategic ties India, Vietnam and Taiwan."The Chinese government maliciously covered up and enabled a global pandemic that has caused misery for so many Americans. This is the same regime that locks up its own citizens in labour camps, steals America's technology and jobs, and threatens the sovereignty of our allies,” said Senator Thom Tillis, presenting his detailed, 18-point plan on Thursday."This is a major wake-up call to the United States and the rest of the free world. My plan of action will hold the Chinese government accountable for lying about COVID-19; sanctioning the Chinese government while protecting America's economy, public health, and national security," he said.The plan seeking to create a Pacific Deterrence Initiative and immediately approve the military's request for USD 20 billion in funding. It also calls for deepening military ties with regional allies and expand equipment sales to India, Taiwan and Vietnam.Encourage Japan to rebuild its military and offer Japan and South Korea sales of offensive military equipment, it said."Move manufacturing back to the US from China and gradually eliminate our supply chain dependency on China. Stop China from stealing our technology and provide incentives to American companies to regain our technological advantage. Strengthen cybersecurity against Chinese hacks and sabotage," the plan stated."Prevent American taxpayer money from being used by the Chinese government to pay off their debt. Implement the US ban on (Chinese technology company) Huawei and coordinate with our allies to implement similar bans,” it added.The plan seeks restitution from the Chinese government and imposition of sanctions for lying about the virus. It further said China should be sanctioned for their atrocious human rights record.Senator Tillis' plan urges the Trump Administration to formally request the International Olympic Committee to withdraw the 2022 Winter Olympics from Beijing."Stop China's propaganda campaign inside the United States. Treat Chinese government-run media outlets as the propaganda proxies that they are," the plan stated.Urging the government to investigate the Chinese government's cover-up of the spread of COVID-19, the plan also seeks to investigate America's reliance on China's supply chains and threats to public safety and national security."Ensure the independence of the WHO through investigations and reform. Expose and counter China's predatory debt-trap diplomacy targeting developing countries. Increase intelligence sharing on potential pandemics and lead the creation of a watchdog organisation to monitor foreign governments' handling of deadly viruses," Tillis said in his suggestions.The coronavirus, which first emerged in China's Wuhan city in December last, has killed over 3,00,000 people with 4.3 million confirmed cases across the world. More than a quarter of all confirmed COVID-19 cases are from the US.There has been increasing pressure on the President Trump, in the last several weeks, to take action against China as lawmakers and opinion-makers feel that the COVID-19 spread across the world from Wuhan because of Chinese inaction.Meanwhile, Senator John Barrasso, in a speech on the Senate floor on Thursday, highlighted the need to update the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) legislation that was put on hold by the coronavirus pandemic."The virus could have been contained had it not been for the Chinese Government's unscrupulous cover-up. China knew the risk months before the rest of the world; yet Chinese communist leaders destroyed key evidence, they under-reported the number of coronavirus cases, and they misled the world about its deadly, rapid spread," he said.Asserting that the virus should have been contained in Wuhan, he said tens and tens of thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of people worldwide have died as a result of China's failure.Barrasso said the US should encourage its companies to create American and western supply chains. "That way our frontline workers have what they need in the time of crisis," he said."Not again, not ever will we be exclusively sourced for critical drugs from China. We should diversify supply and bring home as much of our supply chain as possible," he added.Congressman Troy Balderson introduced bicameral legislation with Congressman Doug Collins and Senator Lindsey Graham that will hold China accountable for deceptive actions taken by its leaders that led to the spread and subsequent global pandemic.The COVID-19 Accountability Act authorises President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on China if it fails to cooperate with a full investigation led by the US or its allies into the events that lead to the COVID-19 outbreak."The number of Ohioan lives needlessly claimed by this pandemic could have been significantly reduced had China taken appropriate measures to control the virus' spread and disclose its severity," said Balderson."The United States can't look the other way when China so recklessly compromised worldwide health and the global economy. China and its Communist Party leadership must be held accountable," he said.

The attire comprises a red-coloured full body suit consisting of a face shield and a face mask."While AirAsia India will have face shields, masks, gowns, aprons and gloves as a part of their PPE attire for cabin crew members, Vistara would have a lap gown, face mask and face shield as the new dress code," a source said.Once commercial flights resume, each IndiGo's crew member will have to wear a surgical mask, gloves, face shields along with a gown or a body suit, sources said.Air India, which is currently conducting repatriation flights under the Vande Bharat Mission to bring stranded Indians home from abroad, will have its crew members wear a body suit, gloves, face shield and face mask even in scheduled commercial passenger flights, whenever they restart, sources said.The virus has infected more than 78,000 people and killed more than 2,500 in India.Earlier this month, the Civil Aviation Ministry asked Indian airlines and airports to give their comments on a draft Standard Operating Procedure regarding the post-lockdown commercial flight operations.On May 12, the ministry said on Twitter that it had received comments from the stakeholders and is yet to issue the final SOP.

Union Law and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Abhay Thipsay, the judge who served in the Bombay and Allahabad high courts and was now a Congress member, had given “questionable, legally unsound opinion to influence the court and save Nirav Modi at the behest of the Congress party”.“We condemn this attempt by the Congress to save Nirav. This shows the real face of the party and its leaders. A retired judge is giving a judicial certificate. Is he some big professional (lawyer) or an arbitrator? It is an attempt to give questionable legal validity to influence the court at a time the country is trying to bring Nirav back,” Prasad said, adding that the country will leave no stone unturned to bring him back.Thipsay recently told the London court that charges levelled by the CBI against Nirav, which include criminal conspiracy, cheating and dishonestly inducting delivery of property, would not stand up under Indian law.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-trying-to-save-nirav-says-prasad-84913

15-05-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Free foodgrain to migrants for 2 months||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 14Migrant workers a priority: NirmalaThe government is not sitting idle. It has kept in mind and prioritised migrant workers. If I have not spoken about something, it is not as if the government has not planned for it. It will be there in the next package.The second tranche of the economic stimulus announced today by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman sought to alleviate the lockdown-induced misery of migrant labourers and street vendors, extend more credit to farmers and ease the repayment worries of the smallest borrowers in banks.In monetary terms, the largest announcement was for farmers. The government will extend Rs 2 lakh crore of concessional credit to benefit 2.5 crore farmers. In addition, NABARD will provide emergency working capital fund of Rs 30,000 crore in addition to its budgeted refinance support of Rs 90,000 annually.For the migrants, even with no ration cards, Sitharaman announced free supply of 5 kg foodgrain and 1 kg pulses per month for the next two months. The government has estimated the number of migrants at 8 crore and the cost for this exercise at Rs 3,500 crore. However, the onus is on the states for tracing these migrants. She said states had been asked to enrol migrants returning to their villages in MGNREGA work for which the government had earlier enhanced the wage floor from Rs 182 to Rs 202 per day. MGNREGA has already generated work till May 13, which is 40 to 50 per cent more than that conducted in May last year, she noted.However, the other two measures will benefit migrants in the long term. The first is to make ration cards nationally portable which Sitharaman hailed as “one classic example” of the Prime Minister’s accent on technology-driven systems. This will benefit 67 crore beneficiaries in 23 states. But Sitharaman was unable to convincingly explain how this system will work if two out of four people on the ration card migrate and the others stay back. While this portability will be implemented by March 2021, the other proposal of providing affordable housing to migrants is still a blueprint. Sitharaman said the government was considering three options under the PPP (public-private partnership) mode of building rental and affordable accommodation.For the middle income group, the government has extended an income credit-linked subsidy scheme for simple, affordable houses by a year to March 2021. Three lakh families have benefited so far under this scheme in the last three years and Sitharaman expects 2.5 lakh families to take up this offer in the Covid-affected year.The government has allowed states to use Rs 6,000 crore of afforestation funds for providing work, she said.Street vendors will get a special credit facility of Rs 5,000 crore within a month and Shishu Loans under the Mudra scheme have been given interest subvention on loans worth Rs 1.62 lakh crore for one year.

Condemning “complete burial” of labour laws by some states, including BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, it is threatening nationwide agitations unless there is a rollback.Senior BMS functionaries Saji Naraynan and Virjesh Upadhyay said their objection was not about a particular party or a state. It was about this “gross violation” of laws by governments, whichever party they belonged to, they said.They said it was all for economy boosting measures, but not through means and methods like “anti-worker” ordinances brought by UP, MP and Gujarat and increase of working hours by Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Goa and Odisha.According to BMS president Saji Naraynan, workers’ problems had aggravated during the Covid-19-triggered lockdown mainly because of “gross violation” of laws by most states. Regarding this being perceived as a sign of a rift between the RSS and its political arm, the BJP, Naraynan said whenever the government does good things the BMS always appreciates, “but if they do something wrong, it is also our duty to point it”.The BMS president said the main focus of the Labour Secretary should be job losses and non-payment of wages.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-affiliate-bms-on-warpath-over-burial-of-labour-laws-85022
