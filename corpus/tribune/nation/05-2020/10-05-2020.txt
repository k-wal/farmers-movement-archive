From just 47,000 items being produced annually, the output has gone up to about two lakh per day.Stating this on Sunday, Dr G Satheesh Reddy, Secretary, Defence Research and Development Organisation and Chairman, DRDO, said coronavirus has also provided a lot of opportunity for research and development and industrial production, but cautioned that delays in development is of no use.He was addressing scientists and staff members at the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Mohali, via video conferencing on the occasion of the centre’s 32nd foundation day. Directors and senior scientists from various laboratories of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and other institutions also participated in the conference.He also spoke about medical ventilators produced by the industry with assistance by DRDO, which though low cost ranging from Rs 1.5 to 4 lakh were world class products and also have export potential.Dr Reddy said C-DAC, an autonomous body under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, will be considered as an “extended arm” of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) for undertaking applied research. He said that in today’s environment different organisations cannot function in silos and there were many areas in which both the establishments would work together.Lauding the role of the Mohali centre in research and development in the electronics and information technology fields, he said artificial intelligence tools developed by it would be required in almost all fields.Dr PK Khosla, Director C-DAC, Mohali, gave an overview of the work done in the organisation’s four verticals – healthcare technology, cyber security, e-governance and education and training. He also spoke about four new areas that C-DAC is now focusing upon. These include artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual, robotics and quantum computing. He said that several new projects have been initiated in these domains.C-DAC is a research and development organisation of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology engaged in strengthening national technological capabilities in the context of global developments and responding to change in the market needs. It has 11 centres across the country, including Mohali.Director General C-DAC, Dr Hemant Darbari, spoke about-eSanjeevniOPD, a recently launched national level telemedicine project rolled out by C-DAC Mohali, to bring medicare to people’s doorsteps in these times of lockdown.

10-05-2020||New Delhi||What is happening to migrant labourers is greatest human tragedy of our times: Cong||The Congress, on Sunday, urged the government to show more empathy to migrants and protect them during a crisis, saying what is happening to them is “perhaps the greatest human tragedy of our times”.Instead of presiding over the plight of migrant labourers, the government should rescue them as they had been left with no choice but to walk hundreds of kilometres to return home, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said.She said almost 50 days into the COVID-19 lockdown, “we continue to wake up to see heart-wrenching visuals” of people without footwear and food walking to their homes.Visuals of pregnant women, little children, people atop a goods truck, those crushed to death while walking home on railway tracks had been deeply worrying, she said.“What is happening to our migrant labourers is perhaps the greatest human tragedy of our times,” Shrinate said.At an online press conference, she asserted that migrant labourers were hit the worst by the pandemic as they were given only a four-hour notice for the lockdown.The Congress leader said the migrants were forced to stay where they were, had lost jobs and did not have money or food.“There were millions of migrant workers who were left stranded all across the country, no measures were taken to rescue or protect them. And even today, we see many of them walking home. How can we Indians be fine with the worst human tragedy unfolding right before our eyes? On last count till May 8, as many as 42 migrant workers had lost their lives, who is responsible for this?" she said.Shrinate said at a time of crisis, this “most insensitive government” decided to charge jobless migrant workers money for rail tickets as well.“The BJP has continued to play petty politics and both the Railway Ministry as well as the Central Government have tried to block the assistance offered by Congress,” she said.“We urge the government to earnestly announce proper rescue and relief measures for migrant labour,” she said.Raising questions on the government’s actions, she asked: “Why is the government not doing anything for migrants?”“Why has the PM-CARES Fund been put in quarantine instead of using the money for those who are most adversely impacted? How much has been collected in the fund and when will it be used? It’s time this insensitive government wakes up to the plight of migrant labour and decisively acts to protect them,” the Congress leader said.

Owing to poor visibility through the PPE inside the ambulance, I decided to remove the goggles and face shield, and then re-intubated the patient as any delay would have led to the imminent death of the patient,” he said.Majeed did not think twice before taking full-blown aerosol exposure from the patient and got exposed to the highest possible viral load just to deliver his duty, Rajkumar said.It is important that people of this country understood that we had a common enemy in COVID-19 and we had to be united against it and not fight among ourselves. Have empathy for patients, fellow workers, healthcare providers and every living being around you, the official said.“Zahid Abdul Majeed has been a compassionate doctor dedicated to his work. The RDA AIIMS appreciates the dedication of all residents, who have stood in solidarity in the fight against the virus in spite of the shortcomings and less than ideal work conditions all over the country.“Senior doctors should appreciate their work and keep their morale high, take their feedback seriously and improve the working conditions,” Rajkumar added.

The doubling rate for the last three days is 12 (days). The recovery rate has crossed 30 per cent. Of around 60,000 COVID-19 patients, about 20,000 have recovered and gone home,” Vardhan said.“Our mortality rate is still at 3.3 per cent....

Once the sanitisation is done, the system goes in sleep mode, hence the operator need not wait or stand near the device.“It is developed by DRDO’s Research Centre Imarat (RCI) lab and works on contactless operation, which is very important to contain the spread of the virus,” the Ministry noted.The Ministry noted that the DRUVS had been designed to sanitise mobile phones, iPads, laptops, currency notes, cheque leafs, challans, passbooks, paper, envelopes, etc.India has been under a lockdown since March 25 to curb the spread of COVID-19, which has infected more than 62,900 people and killed around 2,100 in the country to date.

10-05-2020||New Delhi||IIT, Singapore medical school develop model to assess COVID-19 situation in states||Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati and Singapore’s Duke-NUS Medical School have come up with an alternative model to analyse and predict the number of COVID-19 infected people in 30 days in different states of India. The data-science model, developed by the team, is a combination of all three different models being used in the country at present.The model predicts the cases as per logistics method and exponential method (prediction if the situation turns severe).The states are divided into three categories—moderate, severe and controlled. The model follows a different categorisation than the currently adopted Green Zone, Orange Zone and Red Zone classification.According to the team, India will have 1.5 lakh COVID-19 cases in next 30 days as per logistic method and 5.5 lakh cases as per exponential method.“A report solely based on any one model can potentially mislead us. In an attempt to guard against this possibility, we have considered the exponential, the logistic, and the Susceptible Infectious Susceptible (SIS) models, along with the model-free daily infection-rate (DIR) using open-source data. We have interpreted the results jointly from all models rather than individually,” Palash Ghosh, Assistant Professor, IIT Guwahati told PTI.The report is based on the growth of active cases in recent times, along with the daily infection-rate (DIR) values for each state. “We have labelled a state as ‘severe’ if a non-decreasing trend in DIR values is observed over the last two weeks along with a near exponential growth in active infected cases, as ‘moderate’ if an almost decreasing trend in DIR values is observed over the last two weeks along with neither increasing nor decreasing growth in active infected cases, and as ‘controlled’ if a decreasing trend in the last two weeks’ DIR values is observed along with a decreasing growth in active infected cases,” Ghosh said.“While analysing the novel coronavirus infection data, considering our entire country to be on the same page may not reveal the right picture. This is so because the first infection, new infection-rate, progression over time, and preventive measures taken by various state governments and the common public for each state are different. We need to address each state separately. It will enable the government to utilise the limited available resources optimally,” he added.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 2,109 and the number of cases climbed to 62,939 in the country on Sunday, registering an increase of 128 deaths and 3,277 cases in the last 24 hours, according to the Union Health Ministry. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/iit-singapore-medical-school-develop-model-to-assess-covid-19-situation-in-states-83024

We are in regular contact with the Indian embassy,” he added.All 181 passengers, including 15 pregnant women and children, had already reached the Doha airport by 11 am to take the flight as they were directed.According to a Revathy, a passenger, who was booked on the cancelled flight, said it was disappointing that after the long wait they could not take the flight.Only after relatives of some passengers from Kerala called them and enquired, Doha airport officials told them that the flight had been cancelled, she told a television channel.India has started the repatriation of its citizens stranded in various countries, especially expatriates from Kerala in Gulf nations, since Friday, and around 1,500 people have already arrived in the state by air and sea route.In anticipation of the arrival of the flight, the airport and district authorities here conducted the third mock drill on Sunday morning and completed all preparations to receive the passengers from Qatar, returning home after being stranded there due to the COVID-induced lockdown.The collector said they had not received details, as of now, on why the landing permission had not been received.The flight was to have left from Kozhikode airport around 1.30 pm to Doha and reach the state capital at 10.45 pm.Meanwhile, Congress MP Adoor Prakash shot off a letter to Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri stating that the last-minute cancellation of the flight was “disappointing”.“The reason for the last-minute moment cancellation of this flight is not clear. It is very disappointing for our citizens including, pregnant women and those who require immediate treatment stranded in Qatar,” Prakash said in the letter.He also wanted immediate steps for operation of the flight from Doha without further delay.

10-05-2020||Mumbai||Wadhawans’ bail plea rejected, sent to judicial custody||A special court here, on Sunday, rejected the interim bail plea filed by DHFL promoter Kapil Wadhawan and his brother Dheeraj, arrested in connection with the Yes Bank scam, and sent them to judicial custody.As the CBI custody of the Wadhawan brothers ended on Sunday, they were presented before the court, which sent them to judicial custody.After that, they applied for a temporary bail citing the COVID-19 outbreak and the risk it posed to jail inmates. The court, however, rejected their plea.The Wadhawans’ lawyer argued that they were susceptible to contracting COVID-19 due to their health issues.“After what has been reported in the newspaper with respect to the Arthur Road jail having positive COVID-19 cases and ‘taloja’ (prison) saying that it will take the accused inside only after conducting tests, it would be in their interest that they get bail for some time,” he told the court.The Right to Health was one of the integral aspects of Right to Life. Therefore, they should be granted interim bail, he added.The court, however, refused to grant any interim relief to them.At least 77 inmates of Arthur Road Jail in central Mumbai have tested positive for COVID-19.The duo was arrested last month from a Mahabaleshwar-based quarantine facility, nearly 50 days after the CBI booked them in a case of alleged bribery also involving former Yes Bank CEO Rana Kapoor.The Wadhawan brothers had been named accused in the CBI FIR pertaining to alleged swindling of money by Kapoor and others, officials said.The agency has alleged that Kapoor (62) entered into a criminal conspiracy with the Wadhawans for extending financial assistance to DHFL through Yes Bank in return for “substantial undue benefits” to himself and his family members through companies held by them.According to the CBI FIR, the scam started taking shape between April and June 2018 when Yes Bank invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term debentures of the scam-hit Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL).In return, the Wadhawans allegedly “paid a kickback of Rs 600 crore” to Kapoor and family members in the form of loans to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Private Limited held by the wife and daughters of Kapoor.Besides the CBI, the duo was also being probed separately by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with the Yes Bank scam.

10-05-2020||New Delhi||Promote all school students next year or use internal assessment mechanism instead of exams: Kapil Sibal||With uncertainty looming over the 2020-2021 academic session of schools in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, former Human Resource Development Minister Kapil Sibal, on Sunday, said either all students, barring those in Class XII, be promoted or an internal assessment mechanism be put in place to save children in Class X and other levels from examination stress.The senior Congress leader also suggested that courses could be reduced both in schools and universities, and the teaching time lost in the 2020-21 session due to the pandemic could be made up in the next year with extra effort from both the teacher and student communities.Various universities would also have to take a decision on whether or not to delay the academic session and they had the autonomy to take a call and a decision could not be forced on them, Kapil Sibal said during an interview.The University Grants Commission (UGC) has issued guidelines to universities that the new academic session for freshers will begin from September while for the existing students from August.However, it has said the guidelines are advisory in nature and varsities may chalk out their own plans according to the COVID-19 pandemic prevailing in their areas.Asked about the uncertainty looming large over the 2020-21 academic session in schools, which are shut and holding online classes, Kapil Sibal said going forward there could be two options that can be considered for school students barring those in Class X.One way was to promote everybody and take some extra classes when the pandemic was over as well as ensure students to complete their course in the next class, Sibal said.“The other way is that if you are confident that your teachers will make an objective assessment of the student community which a majority of them might, then you leave it to them and the school to make the internal assessment and promote those to Class XI, who have done well (or to the next class for students of other classes),” he said, asserting that it would save students from examination stress.He, however, cautioned that internal assessment might throw up problems of subjectivity and objectivity had to be ensured.It was finally up to the Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry to decide on such issues, he added.Innovative ways should be found so that students were not punished for what they were not in control of, said Sibal, who was the HRD Minister from May 2009-October 2012 in the UPA-II government.As the HRD minister, Sibal had spearheaded a reforms process in the education sector under which it was decided to abolish compulsory CBSE Board exams for Class X. However, in 2018 the CBSE reverted to the mandatory examination for Class 10.When asked about pending Class X and XII CBSE as well as other board exams, the Rajya Sabha member said: “I think as far as Class X board exams are concerned, there should be a re-think. For Class XII board exams, I think that in the light of the pandemic, the university calendar for the year should change, and in that context let’s hope for the lockdown to be over and then the exams can be conducted.”On competitive examinations such as the JEE and the NEET, Sibal said the current situation of the pandemic had put students from the poor and marginalised sections of society at a disadvantage.“Remember that there is a divide in this country and it always works against the poor and the marginalised. When you have these competitive exams and there is already this divide, it hurts the poor and the marginalised even more,” he said.Engineering entrance JEE-Mains is scheduled from July 18 to 23, while medical entrance exam NEET is scheduled on July 26. The JEE Advanced will be held on August 23.“Whether they should be held in July, I can’t say, it is for the HRD Ministry to decide.... But I believe you will further reduce the chances of those whose chances are already minimal in these exams,” he said.Kapil Sibal also asserted that difficulties would be aplenty going forward as social distancing in packed schools was almost impossible and the lack of digital connectivity across the country would result in online teaching putting the poor and rural populace at a disadvantage.“We are in a big bind. If this pandemic were to last for a year and a year-and-half, the student community is going to be distressed further.... I don’t think the kind of social distancing that we are talking about is possible in our school environment,” the senior Congress leader said.There is lack of digital connectivity and, therefore, it is not possible for students to be educated through the digital mode, Kapil Sibal said.Digitisation would give advantage to those privileged schools that have connectivity, he said.In this context, Sibal said he had suggested as the then HRD Minister, the introduction of the Aakash tablet, which was to be made available to students in educational institutes across the country, with the idea of making students digitally savvy and provide schools with fibre-optic connectivity to allow access to new sources of knowledge.“If this concept had been accepted and this government in the last six years had invested in connectivity as far as education is concerned, we would not have been faced with this problem today,” said Kapil Sibal.Digitisation is a “non-starter” now as the poor and the marginalised do not have access to digital connectivity.Kapil Sibal said a nuanced approach looking at the concentration of the COVID-19 spread should be kept in mind while opening up educational institutions.

Planning should be done in such a way that crops should be cultivated based on the food needs of people in the state and the crops, which are in demand in the markets in other regions,” Rao said.To improve the lot of the farmers in the state, where agriculture is a major occupation, the chief minister said the state should play a pro-active role in suggesting alternative crops to farmers, so that they get better support price and there is no glut in the mandis.In a meeting with department officials late Saturday night, the chief minister said, “The Agriculture department should prepare an inventory and record details on the assets, buildings of the department and other such relevant information.”“Collect proper information from farmers in a format. Very soon I will discuss about the comprehensive agriculture policy through a videoconference,” Rao said.Agriculture Minister Niranjan Reddy, Civil Supplies Minister Gangula Kamalakar, were among those who attended the meeting. The new agriculture policy will be put in place soon as Telangana is fast becoming a major food producer in the country.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telanganas-new-agriculture-policy-will-tell-farmers-what-to-grow-83019
10-05-2020||Kathmandu||Kalapani issue would be resolved through diplomatic initiatives: Nepal FM||Nepal’s Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, on Sunday, said efforts were on to resolve the border issue with India through diplomatic initiatives, a day after Nepal raised objection over a crucial link road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand.Gyawali made the remarks in the Parliament after the ruling Nepal Communist Party lawmakers tabled a special resolution in the House demanding return of Nepal’s territory in Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh.In the resolution, the lawmakers asked the Nepal government to take necessary steps to get back around 400-sq km land east of Mahakali river, a border river, which they claimed was being encroached.Gyawali claimed that the territories belonged to Nepal as it was mentioned in the Sugauli Treaty of 1816 and three supplementary documents subsequently exchanged between the Nepal government and then British India government, and no other agreement was signed to change the status.He assured the Parliament that the issue would be resolved through diplomatic initiatives and efforts are on towards that direction.Speaking on the occasion, lawmakers advised the government to hold consultation with the Chinese side too, as the matter was trilateral issue.They also advised the government to start the highest-level dialogue between Nepal and India to resolve the matter.Gyawali said Nepal had raised objection to the construction of the strategic link road by the Indian government connecting Darchula in Uttarkhand with the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China via the Lipulekh Pass.On Saturday, Nepal’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, in a statement, said the government “has learnt with regret” about the inauguration of the link road connecting to Lipulekh pass, which Nepal claimed to be part of its territory.The 80-km long strategically crucial road, at a height of 17,000 feet, along the border with China in Uttarakhand was thrown open by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh last week.Lipulekh pass is a far western point near Kalapani, a disputed border area between Nepal and India. Both India and Nepal claim Kalapani as an integral part of their territory — India as part of Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district and Nepal as part of Darchula district.

Shubh Yatra,” the Indian High Commission in London said in a statement on Sunday.The Indian mission has urged all passengers to follow the norm of “Do Gaj Doori, Bahut Hai Zaroori” as far as possible, with Air India providing passengers with a kit containing meals, snacks, sanitizer, mask and gloves.On landing, they will be directed to the relevant state government organised quarantine venues for their 14-day self-isolation.The aircraft, which will land in Bengaluru later on Sunday, comes a day after the first repatriation flight landed in Mumbai in the early hours of Sunday.The next set of flights over the next week in phase one of the Vande Bharat Mission for the UK will cover Hyderabad (Monday), Mumbai (Tuesday), Ahmedabad (Wednesday), Chennai (Thursday) and New Delhi (Friday).Organisers have said that further flights are planned from the UK to other cities of India as well in phase two of the repatriation mission.The schedule is being coordinated by the Indian High Commission in London, with payments made directly to Air India by confirmed passengers. The first set of flights to India will prioritise Indian passport holders on vulnerability and health grounds.On their way from India to the UK, these flights will also be bringing back some expatriates and UK visa holders wanting to fly back to London’s Heathrow Airport.

10-05-2020||New Delhi||Region experiences widespread thunderstorm, rain||The Western Himalayan Region and plains of northwest experienced widespread rains and thunderstorm accompanied with squally, gusty winds on Sunday ---a weather condition the IMD expects to continue over the next 36 hours.It may ease around May 12, although a fresh Western Disturbance is likely again around May 14, the IMD said.  Under its influence a fresh spell of rains and thundershowers has been predicted by the weather office for the WHR and adjoining northwest plains over the next day or two.Also, due to a trough and wind discontinuity, isolated to scattered rain and thundershowers are very likely over central and south peninsula during the next four to five days. Rains and thundershowers are also likely to continue over northeast in next 4-5 days, with peak activities between May 12 and 14.THE IMD said a combination of factors is contributing to the weather conditions across the country. In the north, a Western Disturbance persists over central Pakistan and neighbourhood along with a cyclonic circulation over north Rajasthan and neighbourhood. A trough is running from the cyclonic circulation over north Rajasthan to north Chhattisgarh across south Haryana and northeast Madhya Pradesh.Meanwhile a trough or wind discontinuity is now running from south Vidarbha to south Tamil Nadu coast across Marathwada, Madhya Maharashtra, Interior Karnataka and interior Tamil Nadu. In the east, a cyclonic circulation persists over northeast Bangladesh and adjoining Meghalaya along with one over south Andaman Sea and adjoining Sumatra coast, the IMD said.The fresh Western Disturbance over the Western Himalayan Region on May 14 is expected to result in lightning, hail and gusty winds (speed reaching 30-40 kmph) at isolated places over Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, West Rajasthan, Jammu and  Kashmir and Ladakh.The IMD, which has been issuing weather bulletin for Gilgit-Baltistan and Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir for some time now, has predicted similar weather for its this meteorological subdivision as well.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/region-experiences-widespread-thunderstorm-rain-83015

10-05-2020||New Delhi||Liquor makers, restaurants pitch for home delivery of booze||The liquor industry along with restaurants, bars as well as some online food aggregators have urged the government to permit home delivery of alcohol, saying this will not only ensure social distancing but also be a lifesaver for sectors ravaged by the COVID-19 crisis.The All-India Brewers’ Association (AIBA) has suggested creating a “special license for private e-commerce companies (such as Flipkart, Amazon, Grofers and others) and food delivery companies (such as Zomato, Swiggy and others) to take orders and fulfil the demand from the existing licensed retailers and wholesalers in states.”It also mooted setting up an online ordering platform for liquor, to be owned by the state excise departments.Restaurants and hotels, which are sitting on a liquor stockpile of around Rs 3,000 crore, are asking state governments to allow them to sell the stock lying with them due to the COVID-19 lockdown.“We request every state government to allow us an opportunity to sell our liquor stocks, preferably through a home delivery model. This will help us deplete our stocks, raise some money to take care of urgent people needs and will still be compliant to social distancing norms. We understand that this may require some amendments to the law but I am sure it can be carried out under the current extraordinary circumstances,” National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) president Anurag Katriar said.Online food ordering platforms are ready to start such services if permitted by the government.As per industry sources, discussions are underway between various authorities and e-commerce players such as Swiggy for online sales and home delivery of liquor.“Governments should consider institutionalising home delivery as a separate channel administered online. We will give all necessary assistance and cooperate fully in this,” Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) director-general Vinod Giri said.“Currently, most exercise-related processes such as approval, licensing, registration, permits, EVCs etc are physical in nature needing human interaction. With today’s technology, a lot of these can be easily made online thus cutting down the human-to-human interface. Besides reducing virus transmission risks, it is also a good step forward against possible corruption,” he added.According to the AIBA, COVID-19 has the potential to disrupt business for the rest of the year.“Several epidemiologists predict that the pandemic will come in multiple waves. Given the threat of infection resurfacing in one part of the country or the other, this will lead to multiple lockdowns and disruptions for business. In this environment, it is imperative that the state Excise Departments introduce policies that facilitate home delivery of beer, wine and alcohol,” it said.Several states allowed reopening of liquor shops with the easing of some lockdown restrictions from May 4. However, many places saw heavy rush and flouting of social-distancing norms, forcing authorities to close the outlets.Some states also imposed additional taxes of up to 75 per cent to control demand as well as shore up their depleted revenues.“Some states, including Andhra Pradesh, Haryana and West Bengal, have already reported a price hike. However, we also feel that if the price increase isn’t well thought through, the government may lose out on a significant chunk of revenue due to prohibitive price,” Radico Khaitan Chief Operating Officer Amar Sinha said.Radico Khaitan is one of the largest manufacturers of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL).“As a company, we are not averse to the idea of a price hike but a calculated increase factoring in the purchasing power of the consumer is the way to go about it. It should ensure that the consumer could afford or buys his preferred brand instead of switching to a cheaper or spurious brand,” he added.“At this point, liquor companies are also facing cost inflation and it is time that the government also considers re-looking at manufacturers viability and consumer affordability alongside the price hike,” said Sinha.The Beer Cafe founder and CEO, Rahul Singh, said liquor sales in India took place through three licenced verticals — retail, HORECA (hotels, restaurants and catering) and canteen stores department.The total HORECA licenced places are around 30,000 in the country and “at any given time, the stock in hand would be for one month, which means that due to the lockdown, the total unsold inventory lying at various HORECA outlets across India would be around Rs 3,000 crore,” he added.While retail sales of liquor were opening, the service industry continues to be in limbo, he said.According to the associations, the liquor industry contributes around Rs 2.5 lakh crore revenue to the state governments. States have lost revenue of around Rs 25,000 crore in the 40-odd days when liquor trade was closed.The Supreme Court had, on May 8, asked states to consider non-direct contact or online sales and home delivery of liquor during the lockdown period to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on account of crowding at the shops. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/liquor-makers-restaurants-pitch-for-home-delivery-of-booze-83013
10-05-2020||New Delhi||India needs ‘whole-of-govt approach’ to confront strategic uncertainties: Army Chief||The time has come for India to adopt a “whole-of-government approach” in decisively confronting the “strategic uncertainties” looming on its horizon as well as non-traditional threats like pandemics, Army Chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane has said, strongly pitching for broadening the country’s national security doctrine.Talking about complex geo-political power play in India’s neighbourhood, Gen Naravane said the Indian armed forces are determined to “cement” the country’s reputation as a net security provider in the region.“There is an entire spectrum of strategic uncertainties that looms on the horizon and a whole-of-government approach is the need of the hour to deal with them,” the Army Chief told PTI.Though Gen Naravane did not elaborate, his comments came in the backdrop of Pakistan-supported Taliban’s aim for a role in power structure in Afghanistan and China’s persistent efforts to expand military ties with countries like Sri Lanka, Nepal, Myanmar and the Maldives.“In dealing with issues of global nature, the armed forces with their inherent capabilities and capacities will cement India’s reputation as a net security provider in the region, taking security as a holistic concept,” Gen Naravane said.India is learnt to have been worried over the extremely fragile and dynamic situation in Afghanistan after the US sealed a historic deal with the Taliban providing for withdrawal of American troops from the war-ravaged country.The Army Chief further said India needs to broaden its understanding of national security and must examine non-traditional threats like pandemics “de-novo” as they have the potential to inflict severe damage on the country.“We need to act and prepare ourselves accordingly.” He said the “traditional threats” facing India remained “unabated” and the armed forces are fully geared up to deal with them.Gen Naravane said there has been no let up in Indian Army’s “posture” while guarding the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China because of the coronavirus pandemic. The LAC is the de-facto border between the two countries.“Along the LAC, patrolling continues as before though we have put the ceremonial border personnel meetings on hold. There is also greater reliance on hotlines,” he said.The Chief of Army Staff said the effort has been to adhere to the directives issued by both the governments following two informal summits between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping.“As far as our deployment along the border with China is concerned, the focus is on mutual understanding and respect for the sanctity of LAC and ensuring that no untoward incident takes place due to our differing perceptions of the LAC,” he said.“Our focus has been to ensure all misunderstandings are mitigated amicably through discussions and existing mechanisms,” Gen Naravane said.The India-China border dispute covers 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it.Both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.Gen Naravane said troops deployed along borders in remote and high-altitude areas are at minimum risk of getting infected by the coronavirus as the areas are inaccessible to ordinary people.He said only troops who are medically validated as being coronavirus-free are being allowed to replace the personnel deployed in key formations and frontiers.“You have to keep in mind that in most of these places, due to the nature of deployment and living arrangements, social distancing is not feasible. However, wherever possible, social distancing and hygiene measures are being strictly enforced,” he said.Gen Naravane said ensuring safety of his force from the pandemic is his foremost priority as the Army will be able to assist the country in dealing with the challenge if the troops are fighting fit.“The need for maintaining social distancing and hygiene norms assumes significant importance in the forces because of the higher density of personnel living inside barracks and the increased attendant possibility of the virus spreading within the forces,” he said.He said all the units and formations have been issued comprehensive instructions to maintain social distancing wherever feasible and adhere to highest hygiene standards.

10-05-2020||Yash Goyal||60 to 70 % population will get coronavirus, if vaccine not developed in 2 yrs: US prof||Jaipur, May 10Nearly 60 to 70 per cent of population will get coronavirus infection, if a vaccine is not developed in next 2 years, a Public Health Professor of Johns Hopkins University in USA, David Bishai said at a webinar on Saturday.COVID-19 outbreak would not end until up to 70 per cent of population becomes immune to the virus as it may take between 18 and 24 months to develop a vaccine, Bishai, who is professor at Bloomberg School, said while interacting with six panel speakers and 722 participants in webinar organised by IIHMR here. “If vaccine will not developed in next 2 years, it will impact Indian economy dramatically, particularly the health sector because there will be less money and the human resource available to run the existing programmes will not be enough. Immediate need is to recover small business post Covid-19 by ensuring that the credit should reach them regularly by banks so that employment can be created,” he cautioned. Speaking on the topic of ‘Effect of Covid-19 on Indian Economy: Policy and Programmatic Implications’, Narain Sinha, Professor of University of Botswana and Renowned Economist of Asian and African Regions, focused on issue of migrant labourers saying they are the backbone of Indian economy. “During lockdown, 92 per cent of labourers have lost 1 to 4 week of their work and wages or have got less wages. The contribution of MSME to Indian GDP is 28 per cent and this sector is highly affected by the lockdown. The government should make immediate policies according to local demographic, social and economic fabric,” he said.  Tamal Bandoyapadhyay, author and Consulting Editor of Business Standard, underlined that the government and RBI should come up with monetary solution to decrease fiscal deficit. “The Rs 1.7 trillion relief package for the poor announced by the government is quite far from reality. The money transferred to Jan Dhan accounts and food/ration provided to daily wage earners is not enough for their survival. The Government and banks are adopting conservative approach towards spending money during this crisis. If the government and RBI would not come up with monetary solution, the fiscal deficit will certainly go up post Covic-19 as this crisis is different from what we have observed in 2008,” Bandhoyapadhyay warned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/60-to-70-population-will-get-coronavirus-if-vaccine-not-developed-in-2-yrs-us-prof-83005
10-05-2020||Mumbai||COVID-19 set to dampen Ganesh festival in Mumbai||The Maharashtra government may not permit public celebrations of the Ganesh festival this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to officials here.The 10-day Ganesh festival falls on August 22 this year. However, work on the giant idols of the elephant-headed god, which usually begin from May has not been taken up so far because of the pandemic. “The big mandals have not yet placed orders for the idols as we do not know whether the government will allow public celebrations this year,” says Naresh Dahibavkar, president of the Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti, the umbrella body of the Ganesh pandals.Sources in the state government say permissions, if given at all, would be just weeks before the actual festival depending on how the pandemic is tackled in Mumbai.Organisers of Ganesh pandals say it would be too late for them because finalising designs of the idols, placing orders, and collecting sponsorships would all take several months.“Many of office-bearers of the Ganesh mandals are professionals and small businessmen whose incomes have been badly hit by the lockdown,” says Sameer Patil, a Ganesh mandal organiser from Borivali in suburban Mumbai.According to craftsmen in Maharashtra’s Pen taluka, where scores of small idols installed at homes are crafted, work has begun on a small scale in many villages.“We are planning to put up pandals as we expect the lockdown to be relaxed in the coming weeks,” says Subash Natu, who put up a small banner at Borivali in suburban Mumbai. Natu hopes to ferry in a few idols by road by July for sale to residents in the suburb.However health department officials warned that social distancing during the immersion of the idols could be a problem as huge crowds throng water bodies.Meanwhile, several organisations in Mumbai are asking people to pray indoors like it was done during the bubonic plague of 1896.“The public festival was cancelled that year and people prayed indoors,” says Dahibavkar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-set-to-dampen-ganesh-festival-in-mumbai-83001

10-05-2020||K V Prasad||PM Modi to interact with CMs on Monday with focus on economy||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 10With a week left the third phase of the lockdown to end, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold a meeting with Chief Ministers of various states on Monday afternoon to discuss boosting economic activities and the next course to be adopted by the Centre and the state governments in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.This will be the fifth meeting through video-conferencing by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Chief Ministers on the collective fight against the spread of COVID-19 amid an increase in the number of positive cases registered in various states.Already, a few states are favouring an extension of the lockdown as studies indicated success in curbing the spread through preventive country-wide stay-at-home policy, which has been in force since March 25.While the Centre has already granted a number of relaxations for the movement of people to enable the stranded migrant workers, students and others to return to their home states, the saga of struggle for those stuck in various parts of the country continues to pour in.For over a week now, the Railways has been running Shramik Special trains to ferry the stranded migrants even as a political tussle broke out over the passenger fare being collected from travellers, with many states announcing to underwrite the costs.Yet, with a ceiling of 1,200 passengers per train and attendant formalities, there are reports from various states that migrant workers are opting for a more arduous journey by foot.The efforts to open sectors such as agriculture bore fruits with procurement going on in many states, while others, including manufacturing in other permitted areas, are yet to resume in the manner the government may want them to operate. This is both on account of the strict social-distancing norms as well as lesser availability of skilled labour.One of the major concerns for the Central government is the approach adopted by many states which are hindering the movement of doctors, nurses and paramedics — the frontline warriors against the pandemic.The Union Health Ministry already suggested that the presence of virus amidst people was a reality that society would have to live with it while taking precautions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-to-interact-with-cms-on-monday-with-focus-on-economy-82992
10-05-2020||Guwahati||African swine fever kills over 13,000 pigs in Assam||The outbreak of African swine fever (AFS) has claimed more than 13,000 pigs in the last few days in parts of Assam, affecting the livelihood of hundreds of people involved in the animal husbandry in the state, an official said.The infection has spread rapidly as the deaths have been reported from nine districts in Assam, he said.A total of 13,013 pigs have died in the last few days due to the ASF, which was first detected in Assam in February this year, a spokesperson of the animal husbandry and veterinary department said.“The infection has spread from six districts to three more, namely Majuli, Golaghat and Kamrup Metropolitan,” he said in a release.The outbreak of the disease was initially detected in Dibrugarh, Sivasagar, Jorhat, Dhemaji, Lakhimpur and Biswanath districts.Assam Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Minister Atul Bora had on Saturday visited the Kaziranga National Park and reviewed the steps taken to protect the wild boars from the deadly disease.A six-foot deep and two-km long canal was dug inside Agoratoli range to deter the wild boars from going to nearby villages and the domestic pigs from entering the park, he said.Bora said the state has been apprising the Centre of the situation regularly.Earlier, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal had directed officials of the veterinary and forest departments to work in coordination with the National Pig Research Centre (NPRC) of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) to save the animal from the disease.According to a 2019 census by the department, the pig population in the state was 21 lakh, which has increased to around 30 lakh, Bora said.Despite the go-ahead from the Centre, the state government has decided not to cull the pigs immediately and chosen an alternative option to prevent the spread of the disease, he said.

10-05-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus: 28 states, UTs ban smokeless tobacco products, spitting||Over 25 states and union territories, including Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Assam and Delhi, have banned the use of smokeless tobacco products and spitting in public places in view of COVID-19, official sources in the Union health ministry said.The ministry had on April 1 asked all states to prohibit the use and spitting of smokeless tobacco in public places to prevent the spread of coronavirus."Chewing smokeless tobacco products, paan masala and areca nut (supari) increases the production of saliva followed by a very strong urge to spit. Spitting in public places could enhance the spread of the COVID-19 virus," the ministry had said in a letter to chief secretaries of all states and UTs."22 states and six UTs have banned the use of smokeless tobacco products and spitting in public places during the COVID-19 epidemic," an official source said. Public health experts have welcomed the move by the central government to ban the use of tobacco products and spitting in public places to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection."We applaud the government of India for taking the timely step of imposing a ban on the use of tobacco products and spitting in public places to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 virus," said Bhavna Mukhopadhyay, Chief Executive, Voluntary Health Association of India.  "To protect their health and reduce risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms, we urge all smokers and tobacco users to quit, especially at this critical time,"  Mukhopadhyay said. There is growing evidence that smoking increases the risk of contracting COVID-19, Prof Pratima Murthy, Professor and Head, Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences said, adding smoking worsens lung function and reduces immunity.  "Smokers who develop COVID-19 infection have more complications and greater risk of fatality. Even if a person is not affected by coronavirus infection it is a good time to stop smoking. This improves immunity and can improve lung function within a few months," Murthy said.States like Assam, Chandigarh, Delhi, Jharkhand,  Haryana, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh among others are also penalising violators for spitting tobacco in public places. "The ministry of health and state health departments should promote quitting tobacco maximally through electronic and social media to take advantage of the situation in which tobacco users are away from their usual triggers to use tobacco- shop, co-workers, stress, etc. and being at home, the majority have the social support needed to quit," said Dr Rakesh Gupta, Consultant working for Tobacco Cessation. "Hence, an opportunity exists to increase the quit rate for the country amid COVID-19 crisis," he said.

The Air India flight from Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey will fly on Sunday, taking back Indian nationals to Mumbai and Ahmedabad under India’s biggest ever repatriation exercise named ‘Vande Bharat Mission’.Another flight from Newark will fly on May 14 to Delhi and Hyderabad. All passengers will be required to undergo medical screening before boarding the flight and only asymptomatic passengers will be allowed to travel.All passengers on arrival in India will be medically screened and would have to download and register the Aarogya Setu app.Further, all passengers will need to undergo a 14-day mandatory quarantine on arrival in India in institutional facilities on payment basis as per the protocols framed by Government of India.Highly placed sources in the Indian Consulate in New York said that it “has been a relentless and non-stop work” to coordinate the repatriation exercise and authorities “are going out of their way to make sure not even one seat on the flight goes vacant” since a large number of Indians are stranded in the US due to various reasons and they are “desperate” to go home.Priority is being given to stranded passengers, terminally-ill patients, passengers with medical concerns and students.The sources said that while flights from New Jersey were only supposed to take passengers from states that fall under the jurisdiction of the Consulate in New York, special arrangements have been made to ferry four terminally-ill patients from Houston.Apart from the two flights from New Jersey, two flights have been scheduled from Chicago on May 11 (to Mumbai and Chennai) and May 15 (Delhi and Hyderabad).The solo flight from Washington DC on May 12 will fly to Delhi and Hyderabad.Sources said that some people who had initially registered to return to India on the flights later balked and changed their plans as they did not want to undergo the two-week mandatory quarantine on arrival in India.Sources said the repatriation exercise could be expanded to countries where there is high demand.Under the ‘Vande Bharat’ Mission, India has already repatriated its citizens from the Gulf and the UK. Nearly 15,000 Indians are expected to return on special Air India flights from 12 countries in the coming days. The sources said efforts were being made to reach out to the Indians stranded in the US.The Indian Consulate here has been assisting several students by helping them with accommodation and essential services after their university and college dormitories closed down.Indian Consulate sources said they were facing a number of challenges in the repatriation exercise.People share credit card details with pizza companies but now they are reluctant to share details when the Consulate and Air India authorities are working round-the-clock to help them, the sources added.

Driver sent back to Mumbai. 2 are at JMCH since their arrival in Jorhat,” he tweeted.This created a long stream of reactions by his followers on both the platforms, who said the step was “totally not justified” and asked why the driver was allowed to leave Assam when he was still likely to spread the infection.“Actually the driver left for Mumbai and we allowed him to go as he was asymptotic. Now on our request he has been stopped in Bihar for hospitalisation,” Sarma said, defending the decision.Julin Boruah, one of his followers on Facebook, said, “I am worried about the respected driver of the ambulance... He became the pride warrior of #Covid19... If he really send back then it’s totally not justified on our state Government".“Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma Dangoria please look into the matter with immediate effect. Our state should try to cure the pride warrior.”       A user named Urmee_D expressed surprise and asked whether the ambulance carrying two women had valid documents and whether these were properly checked at Sagalia and Srirampur—the entry points into Assam.“The ambulance entered Assam with proper permission to bring back one blood cancer patient from Jorhat who happens to be son of one of the +patient. We do not have Covid-19 testing facilities on our border,” Sarma replied.Jojneswar Sharma tweeted to the minister, “This incident cautions us to check health status of driver if he is hired in red zone such as Mumbai before they are allowed to undertake such journey; even ambulance could carry virus; in this case driver should not have been allowed to leave Jorhat till report was available”.Sarma said, “Then we will end up detaining thousands of truck drivers coming from different states to Assam”. Identifying himself as an orthopaedic surgeon, Ananta Saikia said: “Why was the driver sent back? He should have been treated here as he took all the risks to drive our brothers back home, please look into the matter sir, one or two cases don’t make any difference, we’re all prepared to face it”.“Sir, why the driver sent back to Mumbai?? We could have given utmost care, treatment at Jorhat. We request you to provide him all support, assistance. Tcr of urself too,” Madhurjya Protim Borah said to Sarma on Facebook.One Twitter user said: “Please treat and take the best care of the driver here in Assam itself. He took all the risk and brought the ppl back to Assam. It is our moral responsibility to ensure best treatment is being provided to him”.    Another said: “It was so inhumane to send the driver back, he is mentally and physically unfit to travel all the way back to Mumbai in this state of health. Please take necessary measures for the driver”.The total number of COVID-19 cases has gone up to 62 in the state, of which 34 have been discharged.The state Health and Family Welfare Department said in its daily bulletin that two persons have died due to the COVID-19.

10-05-2020||Thiruvananthapuram||For ex-IAF pilot, fighting coronavirus is tough, not the flying||A 54-year-old former Air Commodore B. Balachandran AVSM VM is getting ready to fly after a gap of nearly two months, when he revs up the engine of the Air India Express flight that leaves here on Monday, to Bahrain to bring back around 180 people to Kozhikode.He feels the challenge is to fight the invisible enemy—the coronavirus and not the flying.The highly decorated pilot, by now has over 5,500 hours of flying experience which includes 3,300 hours in the Indian Air Force, where he has flown various variants of MIGs, Kiran and Iskra and since June 2016 after taking premature separation from service from the IAF after a 29-year career, he joined Air India Express and by now he has flown over 2200 hours.But he admitted that this is the first time he would have to keep track of the invisible enemy, and he has never been in such a situation in his illustrious career.Awarded an AVSM (Ati Vishisht Seva Medal) in 2015, soon after managing the September 2014 Srinagar floods as he was the Air Officer commanding Air force Station Srinagar, Balachandran told IANS, the first real cheer is he is happy to get back to his job after a two-month gap and since this gap was there, there will be four pilots, two will do the leg from here to Bahrain and the return to Kozhikode by the other two."One cannot make a fair comparison of the experience in IAF and Monday's operation. The Srinagar flood operation was the toughest that I have had in my entire career. For two weeks we were on tenterhooks as communication was gone and the floods happened in the Srinagar city. We air-lifted over 50,000 people and had to manage over 25 helicopters and numerous aircraft. The more difficult task was that there was no government, as the state secretariat was also underwater," recalled Balachandran.He points out, today the scenario is totally different as now all are fighting the invisible enemy—coronavirus which is a bit tough, but not flying."This being a special flight, there will be a lot of curbs for the free interaction with the passengers. Like always, our prime concern will be safety, to bring back each and every passenger on board to Kozhikode. All the Covid-19 protocols will be there to be followed and would be done," added Balachandran.Once landing at Kozhikode all the crew will undergo a COVID test and will be sent home.Then, there will be another test after five days and if the 'invisible enemy' has not attacked, Balachandran will be back in the cockpit.

Forty-six more trains are in the pipeline, it said. Every Shramik Special train has 24 coaches, each with a capacity of 72 seats. However, only 54 people are allowed in a coach to maintain social distancing norms and the middle berth is not allotted to any passenger. While the railways has not yet announced the cost incurred on the special services, officials indicate the national transporter has spent around Rs 80 lakh per service.                       The government had earlier stated that the cost of the services has been shared on a 85:15 ratio with states. Since the Shramik Special train service started, Gujarat has remained one of the top originating stations followed by Kerala. Among the receiving states, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh remain the top states. Earlier, the railways drew flak from opposition parties for charging for these services. In its guidelines, the railways have said the trains will ply only if they have 90 per cent occupancy and the “states should collect the ticket fare”. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/350-shramik-special-trains-run-so-far-around-3-6-lakh-migrants-ferried-railways-82968

Menon said luckily, the huge deer seemed to have escaped any visible injuries.Even the tenement dwellers, who were sleeping barely a couple of feet away from where it crashed were unhurt, and there was no damage to household articles like the fan, TV, gas, cupboards, bed, etc."The deer appeared shocked and shaken but remained calm, motionless, watching the strange surroundings, and was later taken away without much fuss," Menon added.During the ongoing lockdown, Mumbaikars have witnessed a lot of hitherto invisible wildlife like flocks of peacocks, kingfishers, dolphins, deers, foxes, mongoose, large snakes, etc., as the roads are largely free of traffic or human crowds.

10-05-2020||New Delhi||FM to meet PSU bank chiefs on Monday; to review credit flow||Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will hold a review meeting with CEOs of public sector banks (PSBs) on Monday to discuss various issues, including credit offtake, as part of efforts to prop up the economy hit by the COVID-19 crisis.The meeting, to be held via video-conferencing, will also take stock of interest rate transmission to borrowers by banks and progress on moratorium on loan repayments, sources said.The RBI had on March 27 slashed the benchmark interest rate by a massive 75 basis points and also announced a three-month moratorium to be given by banks to provide relief to borrowers whose income has been hit due to the lockdown.                Earlier this month, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das held a meeting with heads of both public and private sector banks to take stock of the economic situation and review implementation of various measures announced by the central bank.      The deployment of excessive funds by banks under the reverse repo route may also come up for discussion on Monday, sources said.Besides, progress under the targeted long-term repo operations (TLTRO) for the NBFC sector and micro finance institutions (MFIs), and sanctions under the COVID-19 emergency credit line will also be reviewed.Under the emergency credit line, borrowers can avail a maximum of 10 per cent of the existing fund based working capital limits, subject to a cap of Rs 200 crore.Public sector banks have sanctioned loans worth Rs 42,000 crore to the MSME sector and corporates since the start of the lockdown. The finance minister had on Thursday said as many as 3.2 crore borrowers have taken advantage of the three-month moratorium scheme on repayment of loans announced by the Reserve Bank.“PSBs complemented RBI on loan moratorium. Their effective communication & proactive actions ensured that over 3.2 cr. a/c availed 3-month moratorium. Quick query redressals allayed customer concerns. Ensuring responsible banking amid #lockdown,” she had tweeted.Sitharaman also said state-owned banks have sanctioned loans worth Rs 5.66 lakh crore to borrowers during March and April, and disbursement will start soon after the lockdown is lifted.She said the banks sanctioned loans worth Rs 77,383 crore between March 1 and May 4 to provide sustained credit flow to non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies.Besides, under TLTROs, total financing of Rs 1.08 lakh crore was extended, “ensuring business stability and continuity going forward”, she had said.Meanwhile, MFI association Sa-Dhan, in a communication to the finance minister, said the sector expects to lend close to Rs 50,000 crore over the next six months, mostly by way of emergency or top-up loans to existing borrowers. However, it expressed concern that there is a possibility of shortfall of collections of over 30-40 per cent by September and a potential default by MFIs to their lenders to the extent of 10 per cent.There is likely to be a surge in demand from microfinance borrowers, given they urgently need credit to rebuild their lives and stabilise their incomes.However, field collections will be affected given the negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on clients’ incomes as well as uncertainty in operations post lockdown in many districts, Sa-Dhan said.Many of the mid and small MFIs will struggle to meet their operational expenses in full, with a potential shortfall of Rs 1,500-2,000 crore. The industry employs close to two lakh urban and rural youths, and sustaining their jobs is also an obligation for the sector, it added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fm-to-meet-psu-bank-chiefs-on-monday-to-review-credit-flow-82961

Helping a friend in need is the motto of cooperation between our two countries,” he said.According to a report in the Gulf News, the arrival of the nurses was facilitated in a tie-up with Aster DM Healthcare group, with the support from the Indian Consulate and the UAE’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.India’s Consul General Vipul said, “It is yet another example of strong India-UAE bilateral ties and reflects deep understanding of problems faced by expatriates as well as UAE nationals in the UAE.”             “We feel extremely proud to be a part of this joint initiative in providing relief for COVID-19 patients in different facilities,” he said.Azad Moopen, Founder Chairman and Managing Director of Aster DM Healthcare, said, the group felt duty bound to assist UAE by bringing their medical professionals from India for best possible healthcare delivery to citizens, residents and visitors during the COVID-19 situation.Humaid Al Qutami, Director-General of the Dubai Health Authority said, “This initiative is testimony to the relationship shared by the two nations and it highlights the close collaboration between the government and the private health sector.The Indian nurses, who specialise in working in the intensive care unit, said that they are happy to be part of the initiative, the report in Khaleej Times said.Royin Mathew Thomas, one of the nurses in the delegation, said it is his duty to serve people, and so is happy to help the UAE battle the pandemic as part of this special delegation from India.Dipika Suraj Khavale had to leave his 2-year-old child back in India to be part of the team.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-first-batch-of-88-nurses-from-india-arrive-in-uae-82954
10-05-2020||Mumbai||Javed Akhtar calls to end azaan on loudspeakers, says it causes discomfort to others||Azaan is an integral part of the faith, not the gadget, says veteran writer-lyricist Javed Akhtar, asking that the Islamic call to prayer on loudspeakers should be stopped as it causes "discomfort" to others.In a tweet on Saturday, Akhtar wondered why the practice was 'halaal' (allowed) when it was, for nearly half a century in the country, considered 'haraam' or forbidden."In India for almost 50 years Azaan on the loud speak was Haraam. Then it became Halaal and so halaal that there is no end to it, but there should be an end to it. Azaan is fine but loud speaker does cause of discomfort for others. I hope that atleast this time they will do it themselves (sic)," Akhtar tweeted.In India for almost 50 yrs Azaan on the loud speak was HARAAM Then it became HaLAAL n so halaal that there is no end to it but there should be an end to it Azaan is fine but loud speaker does cause of discomfort for others I hope that atleast this time they will do it themselves  When a user asked his opinion on loudspeakers being used in temples, the 75-year-old writer said everyday use of speakers is a cause of concern."Whether it's a temple or a mosque, if you're using loudspeakers during a festival, it's fine. But it shouldn't be used everyday in either temples or mosques."For more than thousand years Azaan was given without the loud speaker. Azaan is the integral part of your faith, not this gadget," he replied.Earlier in March, Akhtar had supported the demand to shut mosques amid the coronavirus outbreak in the country, saying even Kaaba and Medina have been closed due to the pandemic.He had also appealed to the Muslim community to offer prayers from home in the holy month of Ramzan, which began on April 24."I request all the Muslim brothers that now that Ramzan is coming, please say your prayers but make sure that this doesn't cause problems to anyone else. The prayers that you do in the mosque, you can do that at home. According to you, the house, the ground, this all has been made by Him. Then you can do your prayers anywhere," he had said.

We somehow took him out and showed him his father’s body before the final rites were completed,” Manideep’s aunt, who was tending to him in the hospital, said.The child’s mother is now recovering in hospital from the breathlessness she suffered due to the vapour leak on Thursday.Another heart rending tale is that of nine-year-old N Grishma’s family.She died in the mishap even as her parents lay sick on hospital beds.“Grishma died on Thursday itself but we could not break the news to her mother till today.After post-mortem, the body was handed over to us this morning and it was then that we finally told her about the tragedy, a wailing uncle said.Grishma’s brother too suffered the effects of the vapour, but recovered quickly and was sent to his relative’s house.Grishma’s mother Lakshmi was inconsolable but she accompanied her daughter’s body to their village Venkatapuram on Saturday.She jumped over the LG plant gate and made her way to the Director General of Police D G Sawang as he was inspecting the unit and fell at his feet, pleading that the LG management be brought to book immediately.With folded hands, she pleaded that the plant be shut down immediately.Police tried to console her, but she came out of the factory and poured out her grief.The King George Hospital in Visakhapatnam swarmed with grieving relatives as members of many families were bed-ridden and provided treatment for ailments like shallow breathing, nausea, sore eyes and gastro-intestinal problems.Over 200 people were still undergoing treatment in the KGH, but their condition was said to be stable.Visakhapatnam district in-charge Minister K Kanna Babu, who visited the hospital and spoke to some of the victims, said all the patients were fast recovering.“As a precautionary measure, we are not allowing the people to return to their villages.

10-05-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Indian, Chinese troops clash in Ladakh, Sikkim; several injured||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 10Troops of nuclear-armed neighbours, India and China have physically clashed at two separate locations along the disputed and un-demarcated frontier between the two countries.Details are emerging of an ongoing development in Eastern Ladakh that is much bigger in scale and has wider ramifications than the clash in North Sikkim on Saturday.Sources have confirmed that on the night intervening May 5 and May 6, a clash ensued at a spot called ‘finger 5’ on the northern bank of the Pangong Tso (Lake) in Eastern Ladakh.  It was one of the spots were pitched battles were fought during the India-China war (Oct-Nov) 1962.In an earlier incident in 2017 near the same spot, troops had hurled stones at each other.In the latest incident Indian and Chinese troops have been injured, confirmed a senior official while with holding back confirmation of either the nature of injuries or the numbers of those injured.The Northern Army Commander was apprised of the event and he has reviewed the situation. Sources said as a precautionary measure forces have been substantially reinforced on both sides, however, they ruled out any escalation for now. The Northern Army Commander has visited the spot. It all started on April 27, when troops of both sides came face to face. The tension was brewing on the night of May 5 and 6. The Chinese clashed with the Indian troops, more than 250 men were involved in the fracas at attitude of 14,000 feet. This has been simmering since then. A meeting of senior commanders had been conducted, matters flared up again.India and China have an un-demarcated 3,448-km boundary called the Line of Actual Control (LAC) running all along the Himalayan ridgeline in an east-west alignment.The Pangong Tso, a 135 km-wide glacial-melt lake, straddles both countries. It has boat patrols from either side.  Eastern Ladakh — a land of barren tree-less landscape dotted with high mountains and equally high passes — has been virtually militarily “tailored” to prevent a repeat of 1962 — when China, with exceptions like Rezang La, literally overran the Indian military defences.Elsewhere in North Sikkim, a clash on Saturday led to injuries to troops, including four from the Indian side. Aggressive behaviour and minor injuries to both sides took place, sources confirmed. Some 150 troops are believed to be involved in the fracas in which blows were exchanged. “Troops disengaged after dialogue and interaction at local level,” Army officials confirmed Sunday morning. At least four Indian and seven Chinese troops are said to be injured.The incident occurred Saturday in what is the ‘Naku La sector’ ahead of Mugathang, a pass at an altitude of more than 16,000 ft.As per existing protocol, when troops of either side come face-to-face along the disputed sections of the LAC, they ask either side to return.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-chinese-troops-clash-in-ladakh-sikkim-several-injured-82949

10-05-2020||Lucknow||First coronavirus patient to receive plasma therapy in UP dies of heart attack||The first patient to receive plasma therapy as an experimental treatment for coronavirus infection in Uttar Pradesh died following a heart attack on Saturday.The patient, a 58-year-old doctor, was admitted at the King George's Medical University (KGMU) here.The doctor, who was on ventilator since the last 14 days, died on Saturday evening following a heart attack, KGMU Vice-Chancellor M L B Bhatt said.Since he had high blood pressure and diabetes, he was under the continuous observation of doctors in the isolation ward, Bhatt said.“The patient was in a stable condition. His lungs had improved, but he later developed urinary tract infection. Two reports of his samples came out as negative (for COVID-19) today,” the Vice-Chancellor said.“He, however, suffered a heart attack around 5 pm. Despite all efforts, he could not be saved,” he said.The doctor from Orai in Uttar Pradesh was administered plasma therapy at the state-run KGMU on April 26. He was administered the plasma donated by a doctor from Canada who was the first COVID-19 patient admitted at the hospital and later recovered.Tulika Chandra of Blood Transfusion Department, KGMU said, "When the patient was given plasma therapy, his condition was very bad. His lungs, however, improved. But as he was an old patient with diabetes, he was kept on the ventilator.”Convalescent Plasma Therapy is an experimental procedure for treating COVID-19 patients. In this treatment, plasma, a blood component, from a cured patient is transfused to a critically ill coronavirus patient.The blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 develops antibodies to fight the virus. This therapy uses the antibodies from the blood of a cured patient to treat another critical patient.The Union health ministry, however, had advised against considering the therapy to be the regular treatment for coronavirus, adding it should be used for research and trial purposes till there is robust scientific evidence to support its efficacy.

The same is true for the storage facilities with hazardous chemicals and flammable material, it said.The NDMA guidelines said while restarting a unit, the first week should be considered as the trial or test run period after ensuring all safety protocols.Companies should not try to achieve high production targets. There should be 24-hour sanitisation of the factory premises, it said.The factories need to maintain a sanitisation routine every two-three hours, especially in the common areas that include lunch rooms and common tables that will have to be wiped clean with disinfectants after every single use, it added.For accommodation, the NDMA said sanitisation needs to be performed regularly to ensure workers’ safety and reduce the spread of contamination.To minimise the risk, it is important that employees who work on specific equipment are sensitised and made aware of the need to identify abnormalities like strange sounds or smell, exposed wires, vibrations, leaks, smoke, abnormal wobbling, irregular grinding or other potentially hazardous signs which indicate the need for immediate maintenance or if required shutdown, it said.In order to minimise the risk and to encourage a successful restart of the industrial units, the following guidelines have been issued, the NDMA said.At least 11 people lost their lives and about 1,000 others were exposed to a gas leak at a factory in Andhra Pradesh’s Visakhapatnam on May 7.The incident took place after it restarted operations when the government allowed industrial activities in certain sectors following several weeks of lockdown.The NDMA guidelines said when lockout or tagout procedures are not in place, many energy sources can prove to be hazardous to operators or supervisors who are servicing or maintaining electrical, mechanical or chemical equipment. When heavy machinery and equipment are not maintained periodically, they can become dangerous for operators and engineers.         Combustible liquids, contained gaseous substances, open wires, conveyor belts and automated vehicles make manufacturing facilities a high-risk environment.              Improper enforcement of safety codes and improperly labelled chemicals can further pose serious health hazards. When an unexpected event occurs, managing rapid response becomes challenging.The NDMA said the state governments shall also ensure that the off-site disaster management plan of the respective Major Accidental Hazard (MAH) units are up to date and preparedness to implement them is high.The NDMA said for manufacturing processes, a complete safety audit should be carried out for the entire unit before taking up starting activities.Many process units handle combustibles or toxic substances (or both), the leakage of which could result in disaster, damage, or economic loss.To prevent the occurrence of such incidents, the NDMA said it is necessary to confirm that the plant complies with the required tightness before start-up.The system is first pressurised with operating fluids and then checked for leakage.For air lines, leaks can be found using a soap solution. For water and condensate lines, the leakage can be observed visually.               All vacuum systems must be leak tested. Air inside the system is first evacuated to attain the required vacuum.The NDMA said trial testing be carried out before a full-fledged production is initiated with full human resources.Ensure the arrangement for round-the-clock emergency crews/professional technical teams provided with MAH and cluster of MAH should have an extended coverage of 200 km to reach transport accident spots for help.The NDMA said temperature checks should be done of all employees twice a day.Workers showing symptoms should not report to work, provisions of hand sanitisers and masks should be provided to all employers.        Managerial and administrative staff should work one shift at 33 per cent capacity as per the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) guidelines, but while deciding which particular person is to be included in 33 per cent at any given point of time, overriding priority should be given to personnel dealing with safety.The lockdown was first announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 for 21 days in a bid to combat the coronavirus threat. It was then extended till May 3 and again till May 17. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ndma-issues-guidelines-for-restarting-industrial-activities-to-avoid-vizag-type-tragedy-82932

10-05-2020||New Delhi||Nepal objects to Kailash Mansarovar road||A controversy has arisen in Nepal after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced that India had completed a road that would provide a smooth ride for pilgrims headed to Kailash Mansarovar.The controversyThe Lipulekh Pass is a strip of land in northwestern Nepal, lodged between Nepal, India and ChinaWhile India and China consider it a trijunction with Nepal, Kathmandu lays claim to the southern part of the pass and refuses to recognise it as a trijunctionTwo other sectors — Kalapani and Limpiyadhura — are also part of a similar controversy that has been underplayed by both Nepal and IndiaReacting to the development, Nepal Foreign Ministry has expressed “regret” and maintained that all territories east to the Kali river, including the Lipulekh Pass, where India has constructed the road, “belongs to Nepal”.“This unilateral act runs against the understanding reached between the two Prime Ministers that a solution to boundary issues will be sought through negotiations,” it said in a statement.The problem is that both India and China consider Lipulekh a trijunction, whereas Nepal claims it has sovereignty over the territory. Two other sectors — Kalapani and Limpiyadhura — are also involved in a similar controversy that has been underplayed by both Nepal and India.The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) had completed work on the Ghatiabgarh-Lipulekh road on April 17, so that instead of a three-day trek to the pass, it will now be a two-day drive from Delhi. The inauguration via videoconferencing of the blacktopping on the road was done by Rajnath.A similar controversy had erupted in November when India included Kalapani in its territory on a new political map. After this, the Nepal Government had formed two committees that are yet to conduct field visits and prepare a status report on the dispute. To assuage public sentiments, Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had promised to reclaim the disputed land but no talks have been held with New Delhi on the issue.Protests over 2015 agreementCritics say Nepal was late in reacting to the India-China agreement of 2015 and had protested only after it became a fait accompliNepal had protested against the May 2015 agreement byseparate diplomatic notes to both India and ChinaAfter the Lipulekh controversy emerged, Nepalese Foreign Secretary Shanker Das Bairagi reportedly spoke to Indian envoy Vinay Mohan Kwatra to reiterate Nepal’s concern and its position on the dispute.This is a controversy in which China is also a participant since it had signed an agreement with India to expand border trade via Lipulekh, besides other border points. Beijing had recently played the peacemaker in a conflict that had emerged at the highest levels of the ruling Nepal Communist Party.Critics say Nepal was late in reacting to the India-China agreement of 2015 and had protested only after it became a fait accompli.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-objects-to-kailash-mansarovar-road-82734

It further said the asset “germinated out of proceeds of the crime has been attached to the extent of Rs 16.38 crore”.The provisional attachment order under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) has been issued against AJL and Vora.The federal money laundering probe agency initiated its investigation into the case after FIRs were registered by the Haryana Police and CBI, which alleged that a plot in Sector 6, Panchkula, was allotted to AJL in 1982. However, the same was resumed by the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) Estate Officer on October 31, 1992, as the AJL did not comply with the conditions of allotment letter.The resumption order attained finality after dismissal of the revision petition in 1996. However, the then Haryana CM and HUDA chairman, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, had “misused his official position and dishonestly allotted the said plot afresh in the guise of re-allotment to the AJL at original rates plus interest in violation of necessary conditions in 2005”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ed-attaches-property-of-ajl-in-mumbai-worth-rs-16-crore-82737

TMC national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Derek O’Brien said eight trains had been arranged to bring back migrants during the lockdown.CM’s nephew and TMC youth wing chief Abhishek Banerjee, while accusing Shah of “misleading people with a bundle of lies”, tweeted that the Union Home Minister should substantiate the charges with facts or apologise.Two trains each from Punjab and Tamil Nadu and three from Karnataka were in the pipeline to facilitate the return of over 12,000 people between May 10 and 12, O’Brien said. “One train is scheduled to leave Hyderabad today and it will reach Malda in West Bengal tomorrow with 1,721 passengers,” the TMC leader said.However, the Railways said they did not have any proposal regarding a train leaving Hyderabad for Malda on Saturday.

"The Centre should come out with clear-cut guidelines so that individual states do not take arbitrary decisions," Thorat said.According to the minister, Odisha insists on taking back only those who have tested negative for Covid-19 while Tamil Nadu has come up with a cumbersome procedure. "Initially, Uttar Pradesh too was not willing to take back its people but now people from UP are returning to their homes. However, Bihar which allowed its people to return has reversed its policy because of which people from that state are stuck in Maharashtra," Thorat said. He also hit out at the neighbouring states of Gujarat and Karnataka for "not taking back" their people. The minister said the migrants were stuck in Maharashtra even though the Congress was willing to pay for their tickets.Meanwhile, trains have begun to depart for UP from Mumbai with the first train carrying 1,140 people leaving the city on Friday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-not-taking-back-their-own-people-maharashtra-82767

Prime Minister’s Modi’s ‘chaiwala’ brand went beyond political and caste equations.Sudheer Panwar, a political observer, says, “The political constituency Modi built with great care is feeling angry and hopeless. The economically lower section these migrant labourers belong to is the vote bank he built with great care with his image.”“This class, which transcends caste combinations and equations, has been most committed to the BJP since Prime Minister Modi came to power,” he says. Migrant crisis has given credence to Opposition’s claims of the BJP being a party of rich and privileged, says Arora, adding “there is no coming back from this”.“The party will have to work very hard and come up with new tricks to break the current image of a ruthless, draconian, iron-fisted state that sprays bleach on labourers, forces them to walk thousands of kilometres and lets them starve to death,” he says.

Before today’s guidelines, confirmed cases could only be discharged after testing negative on the 14th day and again after 24 hours.But the ministry said the revised policy was aligned with guidelines on the three tier Covid facilities — hospitals for severe patients; health centres for moderately ill and care centres for the mild and pre-symptomatic persons.Central teams for 10 states, including PbThe Health Ministry on Saturday said central teams would be deployed in 10 high-burden states, including Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Telangana and MP.

Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Pune account for 45 per cent of the national case count.New rules say “mild, very mild and pre-symptomatic cases admitted to a care facility will undergo regular temperature and pulse oximetry monitoring and the patient can be discharged after 10 days of symptom onset and no fever for three days. There will be no need for testing prior to discharge, but at the time of discharge, the patient will be advised seven-day home isolation. If prior to discharge patient’s oxygen saturation dips below 95 per cent, he will be moved to a dedicated Covid health centre”.After discharge, if a mild case again develops fever, cough or breathing difficulty, he would need to contact Covid care centre of dial 1075 and his health follow-up will happen through teleconference on the 14th day.“Cases clinically classified as ‘moderate’ will undergo monitoring of body temperature and oxygen saturation. If the fever resolves in three days and the patient maintains oxygen saturation above 95 per cent for the next four days (without oxygen support), they can be discharged after 10 days of symptom onset.There will be no need for testing prior to discharge,” the new guidelines say, adding moderate patients on oxygenation whose fever does not resolve in three days and demand of oxygen therapy continues, they will be discharged only after resolution of clinical symptoms and ability to maintain oxygen saturation for three consecutive days.ICMR, firm tie up for indigenous vaccineNew Delhi: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and Bharat Biotech International Limited on Saturday announced to jointly develop indigenous vaccine for Covid-19 using virus strain isolated at ICMR’s National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. “Will seek fast-track approvals to expedite vaccine development and animal studies,” ICMR said in a statement.

Thousands of migrants have taken to the streets in Surat, Navsari, Valsad, Rajkot, Ahmedabad and several other places in the state, demanding arrangements for returning home. There have been numerous instances of angry migrants pelting the police with stones and the police resorting to lathicharge and lobbing teargas shells.At least 40 lakh stranded in the stateThere are about 40 lakh migrant labourers stranded in the state who want to return, and considering the slow process of carrying just about 1,200 passengers in each train, the while exercise would takeA government official claimed that 93 Shramik Specials had already left with migrants for Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and other states and more were being planned. According to an estimate, about 40 lakh migrant labourers stranded in the state want to return home, and with each train ferrying about 1,200 passengers, the whole exercise will take months.Despite denial by the ruling BJP, circulars issued by district collectors clearly state that the migrants will have to buy their ticket and have fixed the charges at Rs 650 for any destination in UP and Rs 765 for Bihar. Adding to the woes of the migrants is the refusal by private bus transporters to make any more trips to other states after 80 buses to Odisha and 50 to Madhya Pradesh were impounded and their drivers and conductors detained.Labourers from West Bengal are the worst hit. Not a single train has been planned for them so far.
