14-05-2020||Bhopal/Barwani (MP)||Migrants demand food and buses, pelt stones||Demanding food and transportation, hundreds of migrant workers on Thursday pelted stones near Sendhwa on the Madhya Pradesh-Maharashtra border.Thousands of migrants, on the way to northern states from Maharashtra amid the coronavirus crisis, are pouring in at Sendhwa in Madhya Pradesh’s Barwani district.Eyewitnesses said groups of migrants created ruckus, alleging that government machinery made no arrangement of food and transportation for them.In the afternoon, some of them pelted stones, but nobody was injured in the incident, witnesses said.Shailesh Tripathi, who reached Barwani from Pune, said migrants, which included pregnant women, senior citizens and children, were facing a lot of hardship in the absence of food, water and transportation facilities.A large number of migrants were waiting for food and transport on MP-Maharashtra border for hours, and people from Satna, Rewa, Anuppur and other districts of MP were also among them, he said.Barwani collector Amit Tomar said the migrants were sent to transit points in different districts in 135 buses from the border.Stone-pelting took place as some migrants felt after the buses left that there would not be any more vehicles for those left behind, but officials reassured them and calmed them down, he said.Meanwhile, the state government said that about 15,000 migrant labourers were taken from Sendhwa border (Bijasen Ghat border) to other places in the past three days while there has been a huge influx from Maharashtra.“The maximum pressure of migrants is being faced at Bijasan Ghat on the border of Sendhwa (MP-Maharashtra). 5,000 to 6,000 migrant workers are reaching there every day,” a government statement said.Migrant workers were being transported by buses for free to Dewas transit point after providing them food and conducting medical tests, it said.From Dewas, they are sent to Sagar, Chhatarpur, Guna and Shivpuri by buses.Subsequently, migrant workers of other districts of the state are transported to their home districts and those from Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar are ferried to the border of UP, the state government said.Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan appealed migrants not to panic.“Do not panic in this hour of crisis, the Government of Madhya Pradesh will ensure that every migrant worker reaches home. Arrangements for food, temporary stay, medical check-up and buses have been made. This arrangement will continue until all the migrant workers reach their destinations,” Chouhan said.Additional Chief Secretary ICP Keshari informed that over 2.26 lakh migrant workers were brought back to MP by road from other states while 86,000 migrants were brought by the special trains. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/migrants-demand-food-and-buses-pelt-stones-84802
14-05-2020||New Delhi||Cong accuses BJP of diverting attention of people from 'unprecedented crisis' of migrants||The Congress, on Thursday, accused the BJP of using diversionary tactics to avoid giving answers on the “unprecedented humanitarian crisis” of thirsty and hungry migrants going on foot to their native states, after it accused the opposition party of trying “it’s best to save” fugitive Nirav Modi.Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said former judge Abhay Thipsay had appeared as an expert witness for Nirav Modi in a London court in his personal and professional capacity.He said Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad was making a baseless and irresponsible charge.“As far as the Congress is concerned, the government has made this charge only to divert the attention of people from the unprecedented humanitarian crisis of migrants walking down on the roads thirsty and hungry in their bid to reach their homes amid the lockdown,” he said at a press conference when asked about the BJP’s charge.“The law minister is making a baseless and irresponsible statement and is playing mischief to divert attention as the government’s response to the migrants’ crisis is ineffective,” he said.He also asked Prasad if he had ever sought permission from the BJP for his appearances in court for his clients.Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi also attacked Prasad, saying law ministers should know the right of advocates to appear for clients.“Law ministers know that the right of advocates to appear for clients cannot be trifled with. Thipsay gave evidence in UK court which he has right to do without dictation by the BJP. One of the three accused in Indira Gandhi assassination case was acquitted because lawyers like Jethamalani were not browbeaten into not appearing (for the clients),” he said.Hitting back at Prasad, Singhvi also tweeted, “Hope the Law Minister has intentionally or unintentionally not reopened can of worms regarding senior distinguished BJP lawyers, now departed souls (RIP), whose children held briefs and retainers for high-profile accused in UK. Such reasoning denies legal representation to accused before conviction and after,” he said.The BJP accused the Congress of trying “it’s best to save” the fugitive businessman and cited the statement of a former high court judge, also a member of the opposition party, in the diamond merchant's defence in a UK court.Prasad said Thipsay, a former judge of Bombay and Allahabad high courts, deposed as a defence witness in the case to oppose extradition proceedings against Modi by stating that the charges of cheating and criminal conspiracy against him would not stand up under the Indian law.Prasad noted that Thipsay had joined the Congress in 2018 and had met top party leaders like Rahul Gandhi, Ashok Gehlot and Ashok Chavan.The “judge sahib” was not acting in his individual capacity but was working at the behest of the Congress, he claimed, adding that Thipsay was hardly a big name otherwise in the legal circles.

However, shops engaged in non-essential items in shopping complexes and malls should be allowed to operate on an odd-even basis,” a source said.In the next two to three days, the government will come out with a standard operating procedure to allow economic activities from Monday in the national capital.Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said different economic activities would be allowed in the city from May 18 based on decisions taken by the Centre on the lockdown relaxations.

14-05-2020||Islamabad||Taking steps to ensure review of Kulbhushan Jadhav case, says Pak||Pakistan said on Thursday that it was taking steps as per the guidelines provided by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to ensure the review of the Kulbhushan Jadhav case.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July last year that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.Jadhav, the 49-year-old retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of “espionage and terrorism” in April 2017.Weeks later, India approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.“Pakistan has granted India consular access to Commander Jadhav and is processing measures for effective review and reconsideration as per the guidelines provided by ICJ in its Judgment,” Foreign Office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui said at the weekly briefing when asked to comment on a recent statement by Harish Salve, the Indian counsel in the Jadhav case at the ICJ.Farooqui said on humanitarian grounds, Pakistan even arranged meeting of Jadhav with his mother and wife.“Being a responsible state, Pakistan abides by all its international obligations and will continue doing so,” she said.“We were hoping that through back channel, we may be able to persuade Pakistan to let him go. If they want to say on humanitarian ground or whatever, we want him back. We said let him go. Because it has become a big ego problem in Pakistan. So, we were hoping that they will let him go. They haven’t,” Salve said on May 3.Pakistan claims that its security forces arrested Jadhav from the restive Balochistan province on March 3, 2016 after he reportedly entered from Iran.However, India maintains that Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran where he had business interests after retiring from the Navy.Talking about the recent statement of the Indian army chief that he asked the government to adopt a “whole-of-government approach” in decisively confronting the “strategic uncertainties”, Farooqui said, “irresponsible rhetoric were motivated by an exaggerated view of its own capacities and hegemonic designs.”On India’s reaction to Pakistan’s Supreme Court ruling regarding elections in Gilgit Baltistan, she said a senior Indian diplomat was summoned to the Foreign Office to convey “our strong rejection of India’s baseless and fallacious contentions”.To a question about alleged violation of the Indus Water Treaty by India, she said, “our concerns on this score are well known” and Pakistan “unambiguously raised its concerns with India via the mechanisms provided within the Treaty and will continue to pursue a resolution of these issues through all possible avenues”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/taking-steps-to-ensure-review-of-kulbhushan-jadhav-case-says-pak-84795

14-05-2020||Vibha Sharma||RSS-affiliate BMS threatens agitations against complete burial of labour laws by states||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 14The RSS-affiliated trade union, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), has condemned “complete burial” of labour laws by some states, including BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. The outfit has threatened nation-wide agitations unless there is a rollback.Talking to The Tribune, senior BMS functionaries Saji Naraynan and Virjesh Upadhyay said their objection was not about a particular party or a state. It was about the “gross violation” of the laws by governments, whichever party they belonged to, they said, terming it as “criminal” withdrawal of laws in a civilised society.The ruling BJP’s sister organisation in the ‘Sangh parivaar’ said it was in favour of economy-boosting measures and inviting investments for the same, but not through means and methods such as the “anti-worker” ordinances brought by UP, MP and Gujarat, and increase of working hours by Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Goa and Odisha.Migrant workers are the most neglected lot, they said, demanding cash incentives, attractive wages and good accommodation for them wherever they are.According to BMS president Saji Naraynan, workers’ problems had aggravated during the COVID-triggered lockdown, mainly because of the “gross violation” of laws by most states.Regarding this being perceived as a sign of a rift between the RSS and its political arm — the BJP — Naraynan said whenever the government did good things, the BMS had always appreciated, “but if they do something wrong, it is also our duty to point it.”The BMS president said the main focus of the Labour Secretary should be job losses and non-payment of wages.“These are developing into big livelihood issues in which the government needs to intervene and now. To begin with, it should help by subsidising the wage bills of small scale,” he said.Meanwhile, terming the freezing of labour laws and increase in the working hours as “unheard in history and rare even in most undemocratic countries”, BMS general secretary Virjesh Upadhyay said many other states were readying to follow the trend.“We are pushed to the wall and there is no other way out except agitation. India is facing an unprecedented crisis but this is not acceptable. Whatever democratic means are available, we will use it. The wholesale burial of 40 laws is not a reform, it will lead to lawlessness. We are not against investment but in a civilised society withdrawal of laws is criminal,” said Upadhyay.On expectations from the BJP-ruled Centre, Upadhyay said ultimately, it was the responsibility of the government at the Centre. “The ordinances will come to the Centre for the President’s assent,” he said.Regarding labour reforms, he said they should be done keeping in mind the interests of both workers and the industry.Upadhyay added that the BMS was also open to the proposal for separate labour laws for the MSMEs, an issue that has been pending for years now.“It is an old issue, we are open to it but the government should come up with a detailed road map. Even the states need to tell which particular clause is coming as a roadblock, we are ready to understand. The BMS state units have written to all Chief Ministers but only the CM of Madhya Pradesh had the courtesy to meet the BMS delegation,” Upadhyay said.According to the BMS, migrant workers’ issues had aggravated mainly because there was a gross violation of the Migrant Labour Act by most states.“Migrant workers are the most neglected lot and are treated as second class. Now, the entire country has realised their contribution to the economy. They should be given cash incentives, attractive wages and good accommodation,” said Naraynan.The BMS, in its national office-bearers’ meeting on May 13, condemned the total withdrawal of labour laws in UP, MP and Gujarat as well as the increase in working hours by Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Goa and Odisha.BMS plan of actionMay 16 to May 18: Send letters to district authorities on issues- payment of wages, job losses, relief measures to unregistered workers, migrant workers, self-employed workers, private transport workers, on welfare boards for non-renewal of members, representing stranded migrant labour problems in their respective districts, opposing the increase in working hours. May 20: Nationwide protest day: Demonstrations at taluka centre/district centre/industrial estate by maintaining social distance on freezing labour laws and increasing working hours in various states, migrant workers issues, payment of wages, job losses, increase in working hours and also demand job opportunity for the unorganised sector, contract workers of the organised sector.May 30 and May 31: State/industry/company/sector level conventions on workers’ demands and also demand the withdrawal of labour laws freezing.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-affiliate-bms-threatens-agitations-against-complete-burial-of-labour-laws-by-states-84789
14-05-2020||---||PIL in SC challenges labour law changes by BJP-ruled states||New Delhi, May 14As various BJP-ruled states change labour laws during COVID19 crisis to attract investment, a journalist from Jharkhand on Thursday moved the Supreme Court seeking quashing of their alleged anti-workmen and anti-poor decisions.Exercising their powers under section 5 of the Factories Act, 1948, governments of UP, MP and Gujarat granted certain exemptions to industries, including extending the maximum working hours from 8 to 12 hours a day and from 48 to 72 hours per week. The exemption enabled industries to hire only those willing to work for 12 hours a day instead of 8 hours and that too without liability to pay over-time wages for the extra four hours, petitioner Pankaj Kumar Yadav said, urging the top court to stay the decisions.Terming the move as “illegal for denying equal protection of law to the poor workmen without following the due process established by law”, Yadav contended the changes violated Article 14 (right to equality) and Article 21 (right to life and liberty) of the Constitution.He said the state governments exercised the power conferred under section 5 the Factories Act to the detriment of poor workmen on the premise of facilitating economic activities.The power to exempt would be available to a state government only in case of such “Public Emergency” as explained in the said section itself and not in any other circumstance. “However, various state governments exercised the powers under aforesaid section 5 of the Factories Act, 1948 by equating the current Pandemic “COVID-19” situation as a “Public Emergency”, despite absence of any exception in the aforesaid pre-constitution statutory provision,” Yadav said in his petition.Contending that various statutes constituting “Labour Laws” were benevolent laws aimed to protect the “Oppressed Class”, he alleged that in the present circumstances, the State was depriving the “Oppressed Class” from the welfare measures available to them in order to facilitate the “Oppressor Class”.He said such decisions had been taken at a time when the poor workmen were worst hit by COVID-19 lockdown, losing their livelihood and compelled to live at the mercy of God.Noting that he entire world was passing through the most difficult times, Yadav said, “...a Welfare State cannot be expected to force its least fortunate and most oppressed citizens into further miseries on the pretext of facilitating economic activities/development by taking away their existing rights to their detriment and for the advantage of more fortunate citizens.”He sought to highlight the fact that lakhs of workers lost their livelihood during COVID19 lockdown. “Under such circumstances, the withdrawal of welfare measures from the labourers/workmen as a whole would lead to their further miseries and exploitation at the hands of their employers, who are being exempted from the statutory liabilities to look after the welfare of their employees” Yadav submitted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-in-sc-challenges-labour-law-changes-by-bjp-ruled-states-84787
14-05-2020||---||Centre, Yogi differ on workers’ welfare: FM Sitharaman||New Delhi, May 14In what appears to be a rebuke to some states for suspending labour laws, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, during a press conference, established the Centre’s pro-worker credentials.Several pro-labour reforms were in the pipeline and will be announced after the Labour Code was cleared by Parliament, she said.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted all labour welfare measures that have been jettisoned by several state governments, especially Uttar Pradesh, that have suspended laws relating even to maternity benefit, secure workplace for women staff and minimum wages.Without mentioning the tweaking in labour laws by some states, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman asserted that workers’ welfare was on top of the Government’s agenda.Sitharaman said the Centre was planning to remove the inter-state disparity in minimum wages.“We want to make minimum wages universal. There is a regional disparity in minimum wages. We are trying to get over the problem by having a national floor-wage concept that can be accepted by all the states,” she said.This is in direct contradiction to the Uttar Pradesh government suspending all provisions related to minimum wages.The Finance Minister admitted that most measures enumerated by her were part of the Labour Code pending in the Parliament, yet she chose to list them at a press conference to detail PM Modi’s Rs 20-lakh crore package as an example of the Centre’s commitment to “making it better for the workers”.Other steps include compulsory appointment letters, gratuity to all, annual health check-ups and retraining retrenched workers. These were the measures put in abeyance by the Yogi government.Sitharaman also said all occupations should be open to women, including night working rights with safeguards.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-yogi-differ-on-workers-welfare-fm-sitharaman-84786

The Washington flight had 163 passengers, while others came from Manila.The passengers have been transported to designate locations in the city for mandatory 14-day quarantine. The Telangana government followed the standard operating procedures that included bringing the passengers and aircraft crew from the aircraft in batches of 20-25 persons.The thermal cameras positioned at the aerobridge exit by airport health officials prior to immigration formalities screened each passenger.Their baggage was sanitised in the disinfection tunnel integrated to the baggage belt. The Hyderabad airport has so far handled six evacuation flights from the US, the UK, Kuwait, the UAE and Philippines, repatriating over 1,000 Indian citizens stranded offshore. The seventh flight from Kuala Lumpur is scheduled to land at Hyderabad airport at 8.15 p.m. tonight.The airport has also handled 12 international departures evacuation flights serving close to 1,000 foreign nationals who were repatriated by various special relief flights to the UK, the UAE, the US, Kenya and Germany.COVID-19 was brought to Telangana by the foreign returnees and then the Tablighi Jamaat members returning from Delhi spread more infection. Now, Telangana stares at a third wave of Covid-19 infections with at least 35 migrants testing positive for Covid-19 during the last five days.An alert has been sounded to step up surveillance at the entry points to check the spread of the virus. Officials say movement of a large number of people by different modes of transport following the relaxations in lockdown restrictions poses a challenge as many have already reached their villages.Health Minister Eatala Rajender has cautioned about the threat of a surge with the return of migrants. The asymptomatic are being quarantined at home or in government quarantine facilities while the symptomatic migrants are being isolated for testing.The state also reported 41 new infections, which took the state’s tally to 1,367 cases. Ten of those who tested positive were migrants.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vande-bharat-flight-bring-home-more-returnees-84785

It is an empty package wrapped with speeches since the last three days.”Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari pointed out that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman articulated the second tranche of the bailout or economic package that this government had conceptualised.“It is unfortunate that the entire press conference (of Sitharaman) was a classic display of arrogance, ignorance and insensitivity,” he said addressing reporters via a video link.“We expected that the Finance Minister would come out with what the government is doing to ferry the migrants who are walking on the roads back to their homes safely.

14-05-2020||New Delhi||MEA dials down recent tensions on Sino-India border||The Ministry of External Affairs, like the Defence Ministry earlier, has played down recent scuffles between Indian and Chinese troops in two sectors of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).In fact, due to several confidence-building measures between the two militaries, the India-China border has largely been peaceful, it noted while reacting to recent developments on the LAC.The Ministry of Defence had sought to underline that though there are some portions on the LAC that have claims by both the sides, troops from both sides have acted with restraint.The MEA also took a similar stand while reiterating that India “remains committed to the objective of maintaining peace and tranquillity in the India-China border areas”.The dialling down of aggression took place a couple of days after India flew fighter jets over Ladakh in response to Chinese helicopters hovering near the disputed area.The MEA said occasionally, on account of difference in perception of the alignment of the LAC, situations have arisen on the ground that could have been avoided if “we had a common perception of the LAC”. In this respect it recalled the mechanisms established by both sides to resolve such situations including border personnel meetings, flag meetings, and as well as diplomatic channels.The MEA invoked the resolve expressed by Prime Minister Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping at their two informal summits to maintain peace and tranquillity in all areas of India-China border regions. “This is essential for the overall development of the bilateral relations,” it underlined.It also recalled that the two leaders had also directed their militaries to earnestly implement various CBMs agreed upon between the two sides.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mea-dials-down-recent-tensions-on-sino-india-border-84780
14-05-2020||New Delhi||Army proposal to induct civilians for three years must be deliberated in detail: Experts||Military and strategic affairs experts, on Thursday, reacted cautiously to the Army’s plans to induct civilians for a three-year tenure, saying the proposal must be deliberated upon in great detail and adequate care must be taken before implementing the “fanciful” idea as it may have national security implications.While several former army commanders welcomed the proposed move, a number of others talked about the “inherent risks” involved, noting that it was not a right idea to implement when India was faced with complex security challenges on the borders with China and Pakistan.A number of former military officers wondered why the Army had brought forth the proposal when they should have focused on making the short-service commissioning attractive while aiming to induct talented young professionals into the 1.3 million force.“We cannot ape the West. No other Army in the world has got 7,000 kms of land frontiers to guard. The proposal will have implications on internal as well as external security dimensions of the country,” Lt Gen (retd) Rameshwar Roy said.Lt Gen Roy, who served extensively in Jammu and Kashmir, including as a Corps Commander, claimed that the new proposal had a political dimension, asserting that a “false sense” of nationalism and patriotism could not be generated by recruiting people for three years in the Armed Forces.Lt Gen Roy also said the Indian Army could not afford to have the luxury of training somebody for 10 months and take his services only for three years.“Our army is a grounded Army. You learn from experiences. By the time, anyone will be able to contribute to the army, he will be out under the new concept. The idea looks very fanciful,” he added.In an ambitious move, the Indian Army is considering a proposal to allow civilians, including young working professionals, to join the force for a three-year tenure as officers and in other ranks for a variety of roles in diverse areas such as logistics and in front-line formations.        The former Deputy Chief of Army, Lt Gen (retd) Gurmit Singh, called the proposal “timely” and said it would help in bringing people closer to the military culture.“It will be an excellent opening for those who want to contribute to national security. After the Pulwama strike, this sentiment has grown. The proposal will also help the army deal with the problem of shortage of offices,” he said.Lt Gen (retd) Ashok K Mehta too welcomed the move, saying the reform initiative will further strengthen the Army.A number of former military generals, on condition of anonymity, spoke strongly against the proposal holding that such a move could be detrimental to India’s national security interest.“People serving in the Army for three years may go away with vital security details and leak them to the adversaries,” one of them said.Several former military officials also questioned linking the proposal with resurgence of nationalism and patriotism, saying it was not appropriate to draw parallels.A concept note on the proposal said there has been a “resurgence of nationalism and patriotism” in the country and there was a need to tap the feeling among the youths who did not want to join the Army as a profession but wished to experience military life for a temporary duration.“Does India lack nationalism or are we getting nationalistic and patriotic through a backdoor by serving in the Armed Forces. I am not fond of the idea of honing nationalism and patriotism by putting a man through a temporary three years in service and then throw him to check whether he has become patriotic,” said another former general agreeing not to be quoted.According to the proposal, the people to be recruited under the new scheme will be eligible to be deployed as combatants in key forward locations and there will be no restrictions in their roles.Strategic Affairs expert Dr Laxman Kumar Behera said those inducted under the proposed scheme must not be allowed to operate in core areas such as the front-line bases and adequate care must be taken to ensure that they did not get access to vital security details.When sought his reaction, former Chief of Army Staff Gen (retd) Deepak Kapoor told PTI, “It is just a proposal. One will have to study.”Several other generals also said there had been proposals, including by the Ajay Vikram Singh committee, to make the short service commission attractive.“Under the new proposal, people will be trained for one year and then they will serve for three years. So effectively, it will be a tenure of four years. If that is the case, then why not implement the original five-year tenure under the short-service commissioning,” said another former army commander.Terming the proposal a “game changer”, army sources said it was being examined by top commanders, and its main aim was to bring people closer to the force by giving them an opportunity to experience military life.“If approved, it will be a voluntary engagement and there will be no dilution in selection criteria. Initially, 100 officers and 1,000 men are being considered for recruitment as part of test bedding of the project,” the spokesperson of the India Army, Col Aman Anand, said.

14-05-2020||London||Nirav Modi extradition case in UK adjourned until September||The UK court hearing the extradition case of fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering amounting to an estimated USD 2 billion, on Thursday adjourned the trial to be resumed from September 7.District Judge Samuel Goozee, presiding over the trial at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London, set June 11 as the date for the 49-year-old diamond merchant to be produced via videolink from Wandsworth Prison in south-west London for his 28-day call-over remand hearing, with the case itself set for a case management hearing at the end of August.“I hope Mr Modi by the time we get to September, the current restrictions on movement from prisons have been eased and you can be in court in person to follow the proceedings,” the judge told Modi, at the end of a four-day partial hearing of the case.“The situation is being kept under constant review as we react to the current pandemic,” he said, in reference to the partly remote setting in which the case was heard this week due to the coronavirus lockdown.The first part of the case focused on establishing a prima facie case against Modi but the schedule had to be re-timetabled as the Government of India submitted a further set of documents as “corroboratory evidence” on Wednesday.The judge allowed the additional evidence to be introduced but agreed that Modi’s defence team would require enough time to “digest” them.Therefore, a hearing already planned to deal with a second extradition request, made by the Indian authorities and certified by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel earlier this year on two additional charges of “causing the disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death”, has been effectively extended to conclude the prima facie case arguments.The judge has already indicated that the two requests are “inextricably linked” and therefore he would be handing down an overall judgment at the conclusion of the second hearing, expected to be held between September 7 and 11.On Thursday, Modi’s barrister Clare Montgomery deposed a gems expert, Dr Richard Taylor, as a defence witness who spoke at length about the nitty-gritties of the diamond trade and how the Nirav Modi brand was well-known around the world.“The industry relies on sending out high-value product to companies and to do that they require trust and confidence,” he said, in an attempt to establish Modi’s credibility in the business.“India is the largest and most important centre of diamond cutting… it was a very significant trend that he [Modi] was part of,” he added.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian government, cross-examined him to try and establish that the process of “dismantling” diamonds or pearls from jewellery as part of an “everlasting cycle” with no outward sales was not a commercially sound practice.His witness statement follows that of Thierry Fritsch, a high-end French jewellery expert, and Justice Abhay Thipsay from India during the course of the week.Modi has been following the court proceedings via videolink from a room at Wandsworth Prison, where he has been lodged since his arrest in March last year. Dressed in formals, he can be seen listening carefully and occasionally making notes as he refers to papers on a desk.He has made repeated attempts at bail over the past year, each of which were turned down as he is deemed a flight risk. The jeweller was arrested on March 19, 2019, on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard.The charges against the diamond merchant centre around his firms Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds making fraudulent use of a credit facility offered by the Punjab National Bank (PNB), known as “letters of undertaking” (LoUs).According to the Indian government’s case, a number of PNB staff conspired with Modi to ensure LoUs were issued to these companies without ensuring they were subject to the required credit check, without recording the issuance of the LoUs and without charging the required commission upon the transactions. This resulted in a fraud amounting to nearly USD 2 billion. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nirav-modi-extradition-case-in-uk-adjourned-until-september-84777
14-05-2020||New Delhi||Doubling time of COVID-19 cases slows down to 13.9 days in last 3 days: Vardhan||The doubling time of coronavirus infection cases has slowed down to 13.9 days in the last three days, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Thursday, as the COVID-19 death toll rose to 2,549 and the number of cases to 78,003.The minister, who visited the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) here and dedicated the COBAS 6800 testing machine to the nation, said 14 states and Union Territories have not reported any case of COVID-19 in last 24 hours.These states and UTs are Gujarat, Telangana, Jharkhand, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Goa, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Puducherry.Also, Daman and Diu, Sikkim, Nagaland and Lakshadweep have not reported any case so far.“It is heartening that the last three days’ (COVID-19) doubling time has slowed down to 13.9 days, while the doubling time in the past 14 days was 11.1,” Vardhan was quoted as saying in a Health Ministry statement.About ramping up testing capability, the minister said, “We have now developed a capacity to conduct 1,00,000 tests per day. Today marks an important milestone as we have carried out nearly 20 lakh COVID-19 tests at more than 500 laboratories – 359 government and 145 private—in the country.”            The COBAS 6800, he said, is the first fully automated, high-end machine for real-time COVID-19 PCR testing procured by the government, and is installed at the NCDC.“The COBAS 6800 will provide quality, high-volume testing with a high throughput of test around 1200 samples in 24 hours. It will largely increase the testing capacity with reduction in pendency,” Vardhan said.Highlighting its other features, the Union health minister said COBAS 6800 is robotics-enabled minimising the chance of contamination as well as the risk of infection among healthcare workers since it can be operated remotely with limited human intervention.As the machine requires a minimum BSL2+ containment level for testing, it cannot be placed at just any facility. COBAS 6800 can also detect other pathogens such as viral Hepatitis B and C and HIV, according to an official statement.Vardhan also visited the control room and testing laboratories, and reviewed the current status of COVID-19 testing with NCDC Director Dr S K Sing and other senior officials, it said.“I salute the pathologists, lab technicians, scientists and other staff who are our ‘Corona Warriors’ and working under tremendous risky conditions day and night to save their fellow countrymen,” he said and stressed the people need to shun stigmatising frontline healthcare providers and applaud their contribution.Vardhan also emphasised on the quality and sturdiness of community surveillance and contact tracing in fighting the coronavirus outbreak.“It is the need of the hour that all people who are either at home or facility quarantine, need to maintain a strict vigil, and practise the protocols of social distancing, and personal hygiene. Special care needs to be taken of the elderly, pregnant women and children,” he said.As many as 134 COVID-19 deaths and 3,722 fresh instances of the respiratory infection were reported in 24 hours till Thursday 8 am, according to the Union Health Ministry.With 26,235 people having cured of the disease so far, Vardhan said the recovery rate has further improved to 33.6 per cent from 32.83% on Wednesday on while the fatality rate was 3.2 per cent.He also added that as of Wednesday there were 3 per cent active COVID-19 patients in ICU, 0.39 per cent on ventilators and 2.7 per cent on oxygen support.

14-05-2020||New Delhi||Failed Class 9, 11 students to be given another chance to clear exams: CBSE||Students of Class IX and XI, who failed in their exams this year, will get a one-time opportunity to appear in school-based tests and improve their performance in view of the COVID-19 situation, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has announced.The board had announced last month that all students up to Class VIII will be promoted, irrespective of their performance in the exams.“In view of requests from parents and students, as a one-time measure in an extraordinary situation, the CBSE has decided that all failed students of Class IX and XI will be given an opportunity to appear in a school-based test again. The opportunity will be extended to students irrespective of whether their exams have been completed and results announced or have not been completed. The facility will be extended irrespective of the number of subjects and attempts,” CBSE Exam Controller Sanyam Bhardwaj said.The board has clarified that the one-time opportunity was being extended only in the current year in view of the unprecedented conditions of COVID-19 and the benefit would not be extended in the future.“Schools, by providing remediation to such students, can conduct online, offline or innovative tests and may decide on promotion on the basis of the test. The test can be taken in all subjects in which the students have failed. Before holding the test, the schools will give sufficient time to students to prepare,” Bhardwaj added.The board reiterated that this exemption was to be extended to all students, even if they were given the opportunity prior to the notification.“This is an unprecedented situation. Children are confined at home. Their schools are closed. They are experiencing mental stress and anxiety. Parents are worried about salaries and the health of the family. In this difficult time, children who have not been able to clear school examinations will be even more upset. In such a difficult time, all of us will have to make joint efforts to relieve students from stress and help them mitigate their anxiety,” Bhardwaj said.The CBSE had also announced that the pending board exams for Class X and XII would be conducted in 29 crucial subjects from July 1 to 15.

More than 10 lakh passengers have reached their home state. Trains are being run by the Railways only after concurrence is given both by the state which is sending the passengers and the state which is receiving them,” the Railways said. These 800 trains were terminated in various states, namely Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal.Proper screening of the passengers was being carried out before they boarded the trains, the Railways said, adding that during the journey, the passengers were given free meals and water.From Monday, these Shramik Special trains started carrying around 1,700 passengers each, instead of the earlier 1,200, to ferry as many workers home as possible.While initially, these trains had no stoppages, the Railways announced on Monday that up to three stoppages in the destination states would be allowed. The decision was taken after several state governments made a request in this regard, officials said.While the Railways is yet to announce the cost incurred on these special services, officials indicated that the national transporter was spending around Rs 80 lakh per service.The Centre had earlier stated that the cost of the services was shared on an 85:15 ratio between the Centre and the states.Since the Shramik Special train service started, Gujarat has remained the top originating state, followed by Kerala.Earlier, the Railways drew flak from opposition parties for charging for these services. In its guidelines, the national transporter has said the trains will ply only if they have a 90-per cent occupancy.On Monday, a statement issued by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said the Railways would now run 100 Shramik Specials every day to facilitate faster movement of stranded workers.

14-05-2020||New Delhi||Organised private sector plans layoff, salary cut amid COVID-19 crisis: Report||The organised private sector in India is planning to have major job cuts/layoffs due to the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown that have significantly impacted the economic activities, says a report.According to the latest results of MyHiringClub.com and Sarkari-Naukri.info Layoff Survey 2020, 68 per cent of the employers surveyed have either started the layoff process or are planning to.The online survey covered 1,124 companies across 11 industry sectors in 25 major cities. The survey was conducted between May 1 to May 10, 2020.                             Among the surveyed organisations, 73 per cent said they have plans to decrease the salary of employees, 57 per cent said this layoff is temporary, while 21 per cent said they are doing permanent layoffs for at least 2 years.Interestingly, 32 per cent employers did not have any job cut/layoff plans.“All industries are suffering in the current pandemic situation and the pain is now translating into layoff in every industry at every level. Companies are even cutting salaries of those employees whom they are planning to retain.“This crisis is very much temporary and once companies come out of this, new job creation and hiring will surely start,” said Rajesh Kumar, CEO, MyHiringClub.com & Sarkari-Naukri.info.Kumar further said “industries like aviation, hospitality, travel, FMCG, retail, automobile & manufacturing will suffer more and will take longer duration to recover due to a halt in spending. Job cuts, salary reduction and business downfall are major reasons for spending less in the current situation”.            The survey noted that the percentage of layoff is highest in Retail & FMCG sector at 49 per cent, followed by Hospitality / Aviation / Travel (48 per cent), Automobile / Manufacturing & Engineering (41 per cent), Real Estate (39 per cent), Power Sector (38 per cent).As per the survey, employees with experience between 6-10 years are likely to witness highest number of layoff at 31 per cent, followed by those with experience between 11-15 years (30 per cent).For employees with more than 15 years of experience, the likely layoff percentage stood at 21 per cent, while for junior level employees (experience between 1-5 years), it was 18 per cent.The country is currently under a nationwide lockdown which was imposed in March to combat the coronavirus pandemic.The lockdown, extended twice, is scheduled to end on May 17.

14-05-2020||London||Vijay Mallya loses leave to appeal against extradition in UK Supreme Court||In a major setback, embattled liquor baron Vijay Mallya on Thursday lost his application seeking leave to appeal in the UK Supreme Court, weeks after the London High Court rejected his appeal against an extradition order to India on charges of fraud and money laundering related to unrecovered loans to his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.The 64-year-old businessman had 14 days to file this application to seek permission to move the higher court on the High Court judgment from April 20, which dismissed his appeal against a Westminster Magistrates’ Court extradition order certified by the UK Home Secretary.The latest ruling will now go back for re-certification and the process of extradition should be triggered within 28 days.The UK Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Mallya’s appeal to certify a point of law was rejected on all three counts, of hearing oral submissions, grant a certificate on the questions as drafted, and grant permission to appeal to the Supreme Court.The government of India’s response to the appeal application was submitted earlier this week.The leave to appeal to the Supreme Court is on a point of law of general public importance, which according to experts is a very high threshold that is not often met.“The High Court effectively ruled that even if the approach of the Chief Magistrate was wrong, her decision was not wrong. It is therefore clear that Mallya now faces a significant hurdle in getting it to the Supreme Court,” said Toby Cadman, co-founder of Guernica 37 International Justice Chambers and an extradition specialist.As a further step, in principle, Mallya can also apply to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to prevent his extradition on the basis that he will not receive a fair trial and that he will be detained in conditions that breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which the UK is a signatory.The threshold for an ECHR appeal is also extremely high, with very limited chance of success in Mallya’s case because he would also have to demonstrate that his arguments on those grounds before the UK courts have been previously rejected.Therefore, the dismissal of this appeal marks a major turning point for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) case against the businessman, who has been on bail in the UK since his arrest on an extradition warrant in April 2017.The Supreme Court’s ruling came hours after Mallya asked the Indian government to accept his offer to repay 100 per cent of his loan dues and close the case against him.“Congratulations to the Government for a CVOID-19 relief package. They can print as much currency as they want BUT should a small contributor like me who offers 100% payback of State-owned Bank loans be constantly ignored?” he said in a tweet.Mallya, who is wanted in India over alleged fraud and money laundering charges amounting to estimated Rs 9,000 crore, added, “Please take my money unconditionally and close.”India and the UK have an Extradition Treaty signed in 1992 and in force since November 1993. Two major extraditions have taken place under this Treaty so far – Samirbhai Vinubhai Patel, who was sent back to India in 2016 to face trial in connection with his involvement in the post-Godhra riots of 2002, and more recently alleged bookie Sanjeev Chawla, sent back in February this year to face match-fixing charges.COVID-19 pandemic may impact Mallya extradition timelineThe COVID-19 pandemic might cause a temporary delay, due to the UK’s Article 3 obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, relating to inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.“There is a question now that the UK could be in breach of Article 3 if it were to extradite a person to a country where they could be at risk of being detained in an environment where they are at risk of contracting COVID-19,” said barrister Toby Cadman, co-founder of Guernica 37 International Justice Chambers and an extradition specialist.In principle, Vijay Mallya does have a legal route remaining before his removal, which is to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, seeking an interim order against his extradition.“It is likely that he will apply to the European Court of Human Rights to issue an interim order to prevent imminent removal. The issuance of interim orders barring extradition is quite rare and the threshold is relatively high,” said Cadman.“If unsuccessful, his legal team may also seek to suspend removal due to the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but that is a temporary bar rather than a permanent solution,” he added.If Mallya applies to the ECHR, he will argue that he will not receive a fair trial and that he will be detained in conditions that breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, to which the UK is a signatory. This was a route also used by wanted bookie Sanjeev Chawla just days before his extradition but he failed to secure the interim order and was finally extradited to India in February to face charges of match-fixing, involving former South African cricket captain Hansie Cronje in 2000.Earlier on Thursday, Lord Justice Stephen Irwin and Justice Elisabeth Laing, the two-member bench at the Royal Courts of Justice in London presiding over Mallya's appeal, pronounced their judgment against any further appeals in the UK courts.It marks the final phase of a three-year-long legal battle since Vijay Mallya was arrested on an extradition warrant in April 2017. He remains on conditional bail, believed to be dividing time between a plush apartment near Baker Street in London and his Hertfordshire mansion in the village of Tewin.In her verdict at the end of a year-long extradition trial in December 2018, Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London found “clear evidence of dispersal and misapplication of the loan funds” and accepted a prima facie case of fraud and a conspiracy to launder money against Mallya, which was accepted by the High Court in its ruling last month.“The High Court effectively ruled that even if the approach of the Chief Magistrate was wrong, her decision was not wrong,” said Cadman.The Chief Magistrate had also dismissed any bars to extradition on the grounds of the prison conditions under which the businessman would be held at Barrack 12 of Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai. Her decision to accept the Indian government’s assurances that Vijay Mallya would receive all necessary medical care behind bars had also been accepted by the UK High Court, as it had refused permission to appeal on human rights grounds last year.

14-05-2020||Lucknow||UP CM Yogi Adityanath launches online fair for MSMEs, gives out loans worth over Rs 2K cr||To give a boost to the MSMEs in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, on Thursday, launched an online fair in which he distributed loans worth over Rs 2,000 crore to entrepreneurs.According to an official spokesman, the preparations for the loan fair were already in place through the One District One Product (ODOP) project, but roadblocks cropped up due to the outbreak of COVID-19.In the online loan fair, which was launched at his official residence, he distributed loans worth more than Rs 2,000 crore to as many as 56,754 entrepreneurs, the spokesman said.He said this would provide additional employment to more than two lakh people and added that with this initiative, Uttar Pradesh had become the first state to provide loans to such a large number of entrepreneurs transparently in such a short amount of time during the lockdown.On the occasion, CM Yogi Adityanath also launched ‘Sathi’ portal for the MSMEs.Adityanath said workers and labourers were the strength and capital of the state. “We will utilise their labour and skills to make UP a manufacturing hub of the country and the world. This is the best opportunity for us to eradicate the stigma of migration,” the Chief Minister added.“A record of skills of every labourer is also being prepared so that those coming from other states can contribute in the rebuilding of the state,” he said.Adityanath said on Diwali, Gauri-Ganesh idols from China were sold on a large scale throughout the country and it would be government’s endeavour that this time local units provided an alternative.The entrepreneurs of Gorakhpur, who made terracotta goods, had this skill and could also make sculptures of a superior quality as compared to China, he said, adding that the government would provide all possible help for it.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the MSME sector of Uttar Pradesh was the largest in India.“In this sector, there are many such units whose products are popular across the world. The only need is to give them opportunities. During the coronavirus epidemic, 26 new units of PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) were established in UP. There are many more such examples,” he said.Stressing that there were immense opportunities in the One District One Product (ODOP) project, he said such units would benefit from this economic package.“The products which have already established themselves as a brand in the country will be recognised and strengthened in the world. This will help in giving the maximum employment at the local level through minimum capital. Also, the per capita income of the state will increase,” he said.

However, since the formation of the trust on March 28, 2020, till date no appointment has been made, the petition claimed.The petition has sought a direction to the government and the trust to appoint or nominate at least two members from opposition parties to have a proper check and transparency.“In order to fortify and strengthen the general public’s faith and confidence, it is necessary to issue a direction to the government to declare the funds collected by the PM CARES Fund to date, and how the same have been used for the benefits of citizens affected by COVID-19,” the plea said.

14-05-2020||---||President Kovind to forgo 30 per cent salary, slash 20 per cent expenditure||New Delhi, May 14Leading the national effort to tide over the crisis on account of COVID-19, President Ram Nath Kovind decided to forgo 30 per cent salary for a year and also to take a slew of measures to reduce the annual expenditure by 20 per cent.President Ram Nath Kovind instructed the Rashtrapati Bhavan to set an example by economising the expenditure, making optimal usage of resources and dovetailing the saved money to combat COVID-19 and mitigate people’s economic plight. In the President’s estimation, this would be a small but significant contribution to realise the government’s vision of making India self-reliant and energise the nation to take up the challenge to fight the pandemic and continue the country’s journey for development and prosperity simultaneously, a Rashtrapati Bhavan release said.The Secretariat will undertake the following measures to reduce its expenditure, including no new capital works during the current financial year, and minimum repair and maintenance work required for proper upkeep of assets.The Rashtrapati Bhavan will substantially reduce office consumable using e-technology to cut down the use of paper to avoid wastage and make the office eco-friendly. Efforts will be made to save energy and fuel by rationalising their usage.President Ram Nath Kovind decided to defer the purchase of the Limousine for ceremonial occasions. The existing resources of the Rashtrapati Bhavan and the Government will be shared and used for such occasions.The domestic tours and programmes will be substantially reduced in order to follow the social distancing restrictions and minimise the expenditure that such exercises entail. Instead, the President will largely rely on technology to reach out to people.Consumption during ceremonial occasions such as at-home ceremonies and state banquets will be minimised by taking measures such as a leaner guest list to maintain social distance; less usage of flowers and other items for decoration on such occasions; and, reducing food menu to the extent possible.It is estimated that these measures will save nearly 20 per cent of the budget of the Rashtrapati Bhavan in the current financial year.Meanwhile, it will be ensured that such austerity measures would have no adverse impact on the support given to outsourced/contractual workers. Other activities taken up by the Rashtrapati Bhavan for the welfare of poor people will not be affected either, the release said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/president-kovind-to-forgo-30-per-cent-salary-slash-20-per-cent%C2%A0expenditure-84762

The government will extend Rs 2 lakh crore of concessional credit to benefit 2.5 crore farmers. In addition, NABARD will provide emergency working capital fund of Rs 30,000 crore in addition to its budgeted refinance support of Rs 90,000 annually.For the migrants, even with no ration cards, Sitharaman announced free supply of 10 kg foodgrain and 2 kg pulses for the next two months.The government has estimated the number of migrants at 8 crore and the cost for this exercise at Rs 3,500 crore. However, the onus is on the states for tracing these migrants.She said states have been asked to enrol migrants returning to their villages in MNREGA work for which the government had earlier enhanced the wage floor from Rs 182 to Rs 202 per day. MNREGA has already generated work till May 13 which is 40 to 50 per cent more than in May last year, she noted.However, the other two measures will benefit migrants when the next calamity occurs. The first is to make ration cards nationally portable which Sitharaman hailed as “one classic example” of the Prime Minister’s accent on technology-driven systems. This would benefit 67 crore beneficiaries in 23 states. But Sitharaman was unable to convincingly explain how this system will work if two out of four people on the ration card migrate and the others stay back.Also read Govt’s ‘jumla package’ way short of what PM Modi had promised: CongressWhile this portability will be implemented by March 2021, the other proposal of providing affordable housing to migrants is still a blueprint. Sitharaman said the government was considering three options under the PPP mode of building rental, affordable accommodation.For the middle-income group, the government has extended an income credit-linked subsidy scheme for simple, affordable houses by a year to March 2021. Three lakh families have benefited in the three years of this scheme and Sitharaman expects 2.5 lakh families to take up this offer in a Covid-affected year.Sitharaman said the government has allowed states to use Rs 6,000 crore of afforestation funds for providing work. Street vendors will get a special credit facility of Rs 5,000 crore within a month and Shishu Loans under the Mudra scheme have been given interest subvention on loans worth Rs 1.62 lakh crore for one year. This will benefit about 3 crore people.  However, both Sitharaman and Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur, who translated her observations into Hindi, were intent on establishing the government’s pro-poor and pro-farmer credentials by enumerating the steps taken so far.Sitharaman mentioned migrants several times in her address and pointed out that many of the facilities being extended to them by the states were actually bankrolled or facilitated by the Centre.“The government is not sitting idle. It has kept in mind and prioritised migrant workers. If I have not spoken about something, it is not as if the government has not planned for it. It will be there in the next package,” said Sitharaman.Highlights:||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fm-says-2nd-tranche-of-stimulus-package-to-benefit-migrant-workers-street-vendors-farmers-84760

An intense search operation is in progress. An Army team has also been put on task,” military officials said. The Lugnak La is 16,700-ft high Himalayan pass. In the past one week this is the third accident in North Sikkim, a high plateau abutting China. There has been a crash landing of an Mi-17 helicopter, all six survived, then a Dhruv copter made a ‘hard landing’. Separate from the accidents, India and Chinese troops clashed.Meanwhile, Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment (SASE) has started operational weather and avalanche forecasting for critical sites in Sikkim, which has been experiencing climatic changes and deviation in snow precipitation.A new technology demonstrator project, Snow and Avalanche Hazard Assessment of Sikkim (SAHAS), has been taken up by SASE to provide engineering solutions for avalanche mitigation and control in the strategically sensitive north-eastern state.The SASE is a Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)  laboratory based at Chandigarh and is tasked with mountain meteorology and avalanche forecasting, artificial triggering and structural control in snowbound high altitude areas, mountain hazard mapping snow geo-intelligence and snow climate research.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-soldier-dead-another-missing-after-avalanche-in-north-sikkim-84759

14-05-2020||United Nations||UN economic experts hail India’s ‘impressive’ stimulus package to revive economy hit by coronavirus||Top UN experts have hailed as “impressive” India’s Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package, the largest so far among the developing countries, to revive its economy, which has been severely hit by the coronavirus-triggered lockdown.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced massive new financial incentives on top of the previously announced packages for a combined stimulus of Rs 20 lakh crore (USD 260 billion).While launching the World Economic Situation and Prospect (WESP) report update on Wednesday, Chief of the Global Economic Monitoring Branch Hamid Rashid told reporters in response to a question that the stimulus package announced by the Indian government on Tuesday “is a very welcome development.”           He said the Rs 20 lakh crore package, which is 10 per cent of India’s GDP is the “largest so far in the developing countries” because most developing countries have been rolling out stimulus packages that are between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent of the GDP.“India’s stimulus packages are very large. And also India has the domestic financial market and the large capacity to implement that large stimulus package,” he said, adding that impact of the package would depend on the design of the stimulus.The mega Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package includes previously announced measures to save the lockdown-battered economy, and focuses on tax breaks for small businesses as well as incentives for domestic manufacturing.The combined package works out to roughly 10 per cent of the GDP, making it among the most substantial in the world after the financial packages announced by the US, which is 13 per cent of its GDP, and by Japan, which is over 21 per cent of its GDP.Associate Economic Affairs Officer, Economic Analysis and Policy Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs (EAPD/UN DESA) Julian Slotman told PTI in an interview that the size of India’s stimulus package is “impressive” and “seems to be of a magnitude that will help to reassure markets and to boost domestic consumption.      But at the same time when people are simply not able to spend, you cannot expect the economic growth to suddenly magically re-appear.”Lauding the Indian government for implementing a strict lockdown while the number of COVID-19 cases was relatively low, he said at some point it will be inevitable to gradually ease the restrictions but warned that that could result in infections increasing in the country.“Fortunately in India, the central government acted very decisively in implementing the national lockdown” when the number of virus cases was relatively low and “it seems to have slowed the spread of the disease somewhat,” he said.“The decisive containment measures are absolutely critically necessary and a strong lockdown is critical in India,” he said, adding that the duration of the lockdown has to also be economically feasible.“It is putting tremendous pressure on the Indian economy and of course disproportionately hurting the people that are the most vulnerable and poor.”He said that in India, priority must be given to reduce uncertainty first so that people can eventually go out and spend again.He urged the Indian government to exercise maximum caution in easing the lockdown, saying the country should “not hasten anything unnecessarily. There are ways to gradually lift restrictions,” he said.He added that with a large informal sector in India, the lockdown has disproportionately affected women and migrant workers.Meanwhile, the UN on Wednesday slashed India’s projected GDP growth rate to 1.2 per cent in 2020-21 as the COVID19 pandemic ravages the global economy.In the WESP report update, the UN DESA said that global GDP is forecast to contract sharply by 3.2 per cent as the COVID-19 pandemic paralyses the world, sharply restricting economic activities, increasing uncertainties and unleashing a recession unseen since the Great Depression.“Cumulatively, the world economy is expected to lose nearly USD 8.5 trillion in output in 2020 and 2021, nearly wiping out the cumulative output gains of the previous four years,” the report said.India’s economic growth is forecast to slow to 1.2 per cent in the current fiscal, a further deterioration from the already slowed growth of 4.1 per cent in 2019. India, which grew at 6.8 per cent in fiscal year 2018, is forecast to recover and clock a 5.5 per cent growth rate in 2021.The Economic Survey, released a day before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Union Budget for 2020-21 on February 1, had projected a GDP growth of 6-6.5 per cent, up from 5 per cent estimate for 2019-20.“The national lockdown in India, for example, is expected to depress economic growth to just 1.2 per cent, much lower than the already disappointing growth in 2019,” the report said.Despite the considerably slowed growth rate of 1.2 per cent, India is still the second fastest-growing major economy in the world after China.According to estimates in the report, India and China are the only two economies in the world that are not projected to shrink in 2020 even though their growth rates slow down considerably. While India could clock a 1.2 per cent GDP growth, China is estimated to record a 1.7 per cent growth rate.All other economies in the world, including the US (-4.8 per cent), Japan (-4.2 per cent), European Union (-5.5 per cent) and the United Kingdom (-5.4 per cent) are projected to shrink this year. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/un-economic-experts-hail-indias-impressive-stimulus-package-to-revive-economy-hit-by-coronavirus-84754

Our force posture will not suffer due to the COVID-19 pandemic," he said.It is learnt that the situation in the Eastern Ladakh region remained tense with troops of the two countries maintaining a close watch on each other demonstrating aggressive posturing, even nine days after the violent clash involving 250 soldiers from both sides.The confrontation began on the evening of May 5 and both sides decided to "disengage" the next day.In a separate incident, nearly 150 Indian and Chinese military personnel were engaged in a face-off near Naku La Pass in the Sikkim sector of the Sino-India border on Saturday.

14-05-2020||New Delhi||BJP condemns Congress, accuses it of trying to save Nirav Modi||The BJP on Thursday condemned the Congress and accused it of trying to save absconding businessman Nirav Modi by allowing one of its members, a retired judge, to speak in his favour before a London court.Union Law and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Abhay Thipsay, a judge, who had served the Bombay and Allahabad High courts, and was now a Congress member, had given a “questionable, legally unsound opinion to influence the court and save Nirav Modi at the behest of the Congress party”“We condemn this attempt by the Congress party to save Nirav Modi. This shows the real face of the party and its leadersA retired judge is giving a judicial certificate. Is he some big professional (lawyer) or an arbitrator? It is an attempt to give questionable legal validity to influence the court at a time India is trying to bring Nirav Modi back,” Prasad said, adding that the country will leave no stone unturned to bring him backTipsay recently told the London court that charges levelled by the CBI against Nirav Modi, which include criminal conspiracy, cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, would not hold up under Indian law.“Unless someone is deceived there can be no cheating under Indian law. Deception is an essential ingredient of an offence of cheating. If no one was deceived in issuing LoUs there is no question of a corporate body being deceived.The authority given to officials of the bank to issue LoUs cannot be said to be property and they cannot be said to be entrusted with property and therefore there cannot be a criminal breach of trust,” reports quoted Thipsay as saying.Notably, the Congress had made the Punjab National Bank scam a key theme behind accusations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also alleged proximity between Nirav Modi and Prime Minister Modi.However, according to Prasad, the Congress party has always tried to save “absconders like Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi. It is obvious that the retired judge is not working in isolation but is trying to save Nirav Modi at the behest of the Congress party at a time India is trying to bring him back”Nirav Modi has challenged the Indian government’s extradition request for him.An extradition request from the Indian government was certified by the UK Home Office in February last year before his arrest by Scotland Yard on March 19, 2019. The jeweller remains behind bars at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since then, failing to get bail despite repeated attempts.According to the case against him, a number of PNB staff members conspired with Nirav Modi to ensure Letters of Understanding (LoUs) were issued to companies linked to him without ensuring that they were subject to the required credit checks, without recording the issuance of the LoUs and without charging the required commission upon the transactions. This resulted in a fraud amounting to nearly USD 2 billion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-condemns-congress-accuses-it-of-trying-to-save-nirav-modi-84742

14-05-2020||New Delhi||Plea in HC to release nearly 3,300 Tablighi Jamaat members from quarantine centres||A plea has been filed in the Delhi High Court seeking release of nearly 3,300 members of Tablighi Jamaat who have been sent to various quarantine centres for around 40 days and not released despite reporting negative for COVID-19.The petition, which is likely to come up for hearing on Friday, sought direction to the authorities to comply with the guideline of 14-day quarantine and to constitute a high level committee to enquire as to whether continuous confinement of the members is violative of the provisions of the Constitution.Petitioner Sabiha Quadri, a social worker, alleged that many people have been illegally lodged in quarantine centres and submitted that several persons who are staying in those centres have written letters to the authorities but they have not been considered.The plea, filed through advocate Shahid Ali, claimed that the authorities have failed and neglected in discharging their duties and the continuous detention in the name of quarantine is not justified and violative of guidelines of the central government.  After being exposed to a large gathering on March 31 amid the COVID-19 or coronavirus lockdown many members of Tablighi Jamaat from Markaz Hazrat Nizamuddin were taken out by the authorities and lodged in different quarantine centres in Delhi. Some of them were sent to the centres a few days later after being detained from various mosques.“A total of 3,288 people from Tablighi Jamaat have been put under different quarantine centres and till date none has been released from there, despite the fact that they are not in any manner infected with the disease (coronavirus) and in case of many members, three consecutive reports with negative endorsement have come,” the plea said.It also sought to constitute a committee to investigate the death of two members of the organisation who died in the quarantine centre and to lodge FIR against the officials.On May 6, the Delhi government had said the Tablighi Jamaat members who have completed mandatory quarantine and show no coronavirus symptoms can go home.In April, COVID-19 cases in Delhi spiked after hundreds of many Tablighi Jamaat members, who had attended a large congregation in Nizamuddin, tested positive. The other members were directly taken to quarantine centres to contain the spread of COVID-19.

14-05-2020||London||UK court played video of Nirav Modi's threats to 'dummy directors'||Threats of being implicated for theft and even being killed are among the allegations caught on camera in a video recorded by so-called "dummy directors" associated with companies linked to Nirav Modi, which was submitted by the CBI to the UK court hearing the extradition case against the diamond merchant charged with fraud and money laundering.A group of six Indian men can be heard in the video played at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London during the trial this week, with each of them making allegations of being forced to leave Dubai and come to Cairo, Egypt, where their passports were confiscated and were allegedly made to sign dubious documents against their will by Modi's brother, Nehal Modi."My name is Ashish Kumar Mohanbhai Lad, I am the namesake owner of Sunshine Gems Limited, Hong Kong, and Unity Trading Fze, Dubai," says one of the men on the recording from June 2018."Nirav Modi phoned me and told me that he would implicate me for theft. He used the worst expletives… told me that he would get me killed... he did so much to us," he says in Hindi.The other Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) witnesses include Rushabh Jethwa, who says he is the namesake owner of Empire Gems FZE in Sharjah; Sonu Mehta, the namesake director of Auragem Company Limited, Hong Kong; Shreedhar Mayekar, the namesake owner of Unique Diamond and Jewellery, Azman; and Nileshkumar Balwantrai Mistry, the namesake owner of Hamilton Precious Traders Limited in Dubai.Speaking in a mix of Hindi and Gujarati, they are heard saying that they are making the recording as they fear for their safety and just want to go back to India but are being held against their will."We have signed the document because they will not give back our passports until we sign," says Jethwa.These witnesses relate to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) discovery that dummy directors/owners/managers were appointed in a number of overseas companies in Hong Kong and Dubai, though the companies remained under the direct control of Modi.The charges against the 49-year-old diamond merchant centre around his firms Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds making fraudulent use of a credit facility offered by the Punjab National Bank (PNB), known as "letters of undertaking" (LoUs).According to the government of India's case, a number of PNB staff conspired with Modi to ensure LoUs were issued to these companies without ensuring they were subject to the required credit check, without recording the issuance of the LoUs and without charging the required commission upon the transactions. This resulted in a fraud amounting to nearly USD 2 billion.Modi claims to have come to the UK ahead of a planned initial public offering (IPO) but an Interpol Red Notice was issued against him before he was traced to a plush rented apartment at Centre Point in central London early last year.An extradition request from the Indian government was certified by the UK Home Office in February last year before his arrest by Scotland Yard on March 19, 2019. The jeweller remains behind bars at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since then, failing to get bail despite repeated attempts.A second extradition request, relating to "causing the disappearance of evidence" and intimidating witnesses or "criminal intimidation to cause death", was also certified earlier this year.While the hearing to establish a prima facie case against Modi is ongoing in London this week, the extradition trial will conclude only in September once the second part of the case and the defence arguments against prison conditions at Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai are heard.The UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), presenting the arguments in court on behalf of the Indian authorities, has sought to establish a pattern of dishonest behaviour on the part of Modi when he acquired the LoUs and also in their dispersal across a complex worldwide empire.Modi's defence team have claimed a paucity of evidence to prove dishonesty and also questioned the admissibility of some of the evidence.A ruling in the extradition hearing to establish whether Modi has a case to answer in the Indian courts and that there are no human rights barriers to him being extradited to India is expected only after the second hearing in the case in September.

Doctors and staff, who conducted the post-mortem of a COVID-19 positive body against protocol, have been quarantined.The dead body of 42-year-old Ayodhya resident coming from Maharashtra in a Shramik Special Express was found by the Government Railway Police (GRP) in Lucknow’s Charbagh station on Tuesday night and was shifted to the KGMU mortuary.Violating the standard COVID-19 protocol, the district health officials forced the doctors from the Civil Hospital to conduct the post-mortem of the body and hand it over to his family, without waiting for the deceased’s COVID-19 report.Ignoring their reluctance, the District Magistrate Abhishek Prakash and Chief Medical Officer Narendra Aggarwal summoned two doctors and three staff members from the Civil Hospital to the KGMU to conduct the post-mortem late at night.When his report came on Wednesday afternoon, he was found to be positive causing a huge panic among the health officials.Sources point out that it is difficult to ascertain how many people may have been exposed to the person during the journey and after his death.He may have infected his co-passengers during the journey on the train, who are now home quarantined and difficult to be traced.The Government Railway Police staff that shifted the body to an ambulance and the driver and helper of the ambulance, as well as the staff of the KGMU mortuary, will soon be quarantined.According to the state government spokesperson, until now 268 Shramik Special trains have brought in 3.27 lakh migrants workers to 46 railway stations across the state.At least half a dozen migrants are reported to have died on the train during their arduous journey to their homes.Two men from Jaunpur and Sitapur were found dead inside separate trains at Charbagh station on May 9.The man, who tested positive after his death in the train on causing the closure of the KGMU post-mortem house, had arrived on May 12.On Wednesday, the body of the 75-year-old woman from Gorakhpur was found dead inside a Shramik Special train when it reached Banda in Bundelkhand from Vadodara in Gujarat.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lucknow-medical-varsity-closes-down-for-cleaning-doctors-staff-quarantined-84727
14-05-2020||New Delhi||‘Work from home’ to be new normal for govt offices post lockdown; draft guidelines issued||Asserting that central government employees may have to work with staggered attendance and variable working hours, the Personnel Ministry has come out with a draft framework for ‘work for home’ for the staff post-lockdown.The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) may provide option for work from home to the eligible officers/staff for 15 days in a year as a matter of policy, it said.There are 48.34 lakh central government employees.In a communiqué to all central government departments, the Personnel Ministry said the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated many ministries to operate from home to maintain social distancing.“Many of the ministries/departments in Government of India have successfully managed and rendered exemplary results in combat against the ongoing pandemic outbreak during the lockdown period by leveraging e-office and video conferencing facilities of National Informatics Centre (NIC). This was the first-of-its-kind experience in the Government of India,” it said.It is quite likely that for the near future, the central secretariat will continue to go for staggered attendance and variable working hours to maintain social distancing at workplace, the ministry said.“Therefore, a broad framework for work from home is important to standardize the operating procedure even post lock down situation and to ensure safety and security of information, while accessing government files and information remotely from home,” it said.Accordingly, a new set of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) have been finalised for the employees to ensure smooth and seamless functioning of the government for continuity of the office works besides imparting resilience in the ecosystem even post lock down situations.Employees will be provided with the logistic supports in the form of laptop/ desktop by the respective ministries/departments.“Ministries may use the inventory of laptops on rotational basis for the officers who are working from home and needed such logistic support,” the draft guidelines said.They may also get reimbursement for internet services that they would use while working from home.“Department of Expenditure may consider reimbursement for data uses to the officers working from home and if required may issue separate guidelines in this regards,” the draft guidelines said.It proposed extra protocol for all VIP and Parliament matters that require utmost attention.“Therefore, SMS alerts be sent for all such receipts and files to the next officer in the channel,” it said.The draft guidelines said ministries/departments concerned, who are not yet using the e-office module, would make endeavour for its expeditious implementation in their secretariat, attached and subordinate offices in a “time bound manner”.Presently, about 75 ministries/departments are actively using e-office platform of which 57 have achieved more than 80 per cent of their work. E-office refers to digitization/computerization of office working.However, “classified papers/files” cannot be processed while working from home.“As per instructions of the Ministry of Home Affairs no classified information shall be handled through e-office. Therefore, classified files shall not be processed in e-office during work from home,” it said.The NIC may evaluate the existing security protocol for remote access of classified file/ information in consultation with Home Ministry and propose suitable guidelines and standard operating procedures for handling classified information in e-office, the guidelines said.“Till the time classified files shall be processed on standalone computers only as specified in the Central Secretariat Manual of Office Procedure (CSMOP),” it said.The Personnel Ministry said the officers to whom official laptops are provided shall ensure that they do the official work in official device only.“NIC shall ensure that their devices are well protected against malware and malicious websites. The officers who are working on their personal computers/ lap tops shall ensure installing regular updates, running antivirus scans, blocking malicious sites, etc with the help of NIC to ensure safety of their device against information theft,” the guidelines said.Officers who are working from home shall be available on phone as per requirements and directions of their officers, it said.To facilitate inter-ministerial consultations, exchange of files between the ministries may be made seamlessly in e-office, the guidelines said.“NIC video conferencing facility shall be leveraged to organise important meetings while working from home. Officers and staff shall attend the meetings by activating VC link forwarded to them by NIC in formal meeting set up. VCs shall also be used as far as possible in office environment to maintain social distancing during COVID 19 pandemic,” it said.The NIC has been asked to strengthen the VC to make it more facilitative.“Officials working from home shall adhere to all norms of office environment while attending VC meetings,” the guidelines said.“All central government departments have been asked to send their comments by May 21, failure of which would be presumed that the “ministry/department is in agreement with the proposed draft,” it stated. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/work-from-home-to-be-new-normal-for-govt-offices-post-lockdown-draft-guidelines-issued-84723
14-05-2020||Bengaluru||Anything made in India, including by MNCs, is local for us: BJP||For the BJP, anything manufactured in India, including by multinational companies, are local products and it would not make a distinction among them, the party said on Thursday.Responding to questions on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for national self-reliance, BJP spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member, G V L Narasimha Rao, said there is not going to be any directive to buy local products but felt that a lot of people might themselves see the need to purchase those of good quality made in the country.Noting for example that shampoo is manufactured by many companies, including MNCs, in India, Rao told P T I: “When we say local, it is not just local products made by domestic companies. Anything that is manufactured in India for us is local.”“Anything made locally, we won’t make a distinction, there is not going to be any directive, you buy this or buy that, there is no directive, this will all be individual decisions,” he added.Rao said India has demonstrated even during the COVID-19 crisis how it has been able to organise own needs, while most countries were dependent on other nations.India has helped more than 100 countries supplying medicines, and produced tens of lakhs of N95 masks which were hardly made in the past.“It is not just in times of crisis (that we become self-reliant) it has to become life’s mantra,” he said. “We have the capability and capacity, we should really strive to make everything of great quality. That will also afford us opportunity to export. It is not just local opportunity. This will also help us to go global.”Promoting local products is not a government-driven agenda, he said. What is needed is “mindset change”.“We have to give up this impression that foreign is better.”On the Prime Minister’s call for national self- reliance and stress on the need for us to become ‘vocal about local’, Rao said: “This is not an isolationist policy, we are not going towards protectionism. It is not inward looking.”      “There is no isolationist approach, no protectionism, there is certainly a call for greater quality, greater efficiency, and improving local product lines not only to capture the entire local market but also go global. This is not a protectionist approach as many people seem to think,” he said.“This is certainly strengthening, reforming, revitalising your own product line, your own economy, your own manufacturing sector so that you compete with the best in the world. It’s not giving up better or buying local by force.It’s purely mindset change that Prime Minister talked about,” Rao added.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anything-made-in-india-including-by-mncs-is-local-for-us-bjp-84710

They can print as much currency as they want BUT should a small contributor like me who offers 100% payback of State owned Bank loans be constantly ignored?" he said in a tweet.Mallya, promoter of the defunct Kingfisher Airlines, who is wanted in India on alleged fraud and money laundering charges amounting to estimated Rs 9,000 crore, added," Please take my money unconditionally and close."  Earlier this month, Mallya had filed an appeal in the UK Supreme Court after losing an appeal in the London High Court against an extradition order to India on alleged charges of fraud and money laundering related to unrecovered loans to Kingfisher Airlines.In the past, Mallya had tweeted that he had offered to pay 100 per cent of the amount borrowed by Kingfisher Airlines to the banks but neither banks were willing to take the money nor the Enforcement Directorate was willing to release his attached assets at the behest of the banks.

Pakistan’s veteran Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi eschewed the K word and instead spoke allegorically.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said, “Terrorism continues to be the overwhelming threat to security and stability in the SCO region and would require collective action.”The US-led interaction on Monday saw attempts to blame China for the spread of the disease and hiding its initial spread. At the SCO meet, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov came to China’s defence. “We have to state that even in the conditions of a pandemic, our American colleagues and their allies do not abandon their attempts to escalate confrontation, to use the current situation to impose their point of view, which they call an order-based on rules. As you know, they invent the rules themselves,” Lavrov said while dismissing the accusations against China as “baseless”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sco-for-coordinated-fight-against-covid-84343

14-05-2020||Beijing||Conducting normal patrol on our side of border: China||Amid tensions between Indian and Chinese soldiers at Pangong Tso lake area, China said on Wednesday that India should refrain from taking any action to “complicate” the issue and claimed that the PLA troops were conducting “normal patrol” on the Chinese side of the border.Asked about the tensions along the border and whether the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops’ action was anyway related to the disagreements with the Indian government’s plan to lure business out of China, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said both the countries were in diplomatic contact over the face-off between their troops.“China’s position on the border issue is consistent and clear. Chinese border troops have been upholding peace and tranquillity along the border areas,” Zhao told a media briefing here. “We urge the Indian side to work with China and refrain from making any complicating move so as to create enabling conditions for the development of our bilateral relations and peace and stability at the border areas,” he said.“The two sides stay in diplomatic communication on the relevant border issue,” he said. Since the tensions began at the Pangong Tso lake area in eastern Ladakh on May 5-6, China maintained steady silence over the incident while its official media has not reported it so far.He said the most pressing issue for the world at present is the fight against the deadly coronavirus and added that politicisation of the issue shouldn't be allowed. At least a couple of Chinese military helicopters were spotted flying close to the un-demarcated Sino-India border in the area after the fierce face-off on May 5 following which a fleet of Sukhoi-30 jets of the Indian Air Force too carried out sorties there, sources said in New Delhi.The troops on both sides held on to their respective positions and even reinforcements were brought in an apprehension of further escalation in tension, they said when asked about the face-off. On May 5, scores of Indian and Chinese army personnel clashed with iron rods, sticks, and even resorted to stone-pelting, sources said, adding a number of soldiers on both sides sustained injuries in the incident. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/conducting-normal-patrol-on-our-side-of-border-china-84404

The govt must spend and borrow more and allow states to do so. — P Chidambaram, senior congress leaderAs part of a series of press conferences that will detail the fine print of the PM’s stimulus package, Sitharaman also announced infusion of Rs 90,000 crore in cashless electricity distribution companies and Rs 75,000 crore for non-star performers among non-banking financial companies, housing finance companies and micro-finance institutions.Aim to build local brandsThe measures will help spur growth and build a very self-reliant India. They address ease of doing business and the intention is also to build local brands. — Nirmala Sitharaman, Finance ministerIn all, the first tranche of the package unveiled by the Finance Minister amounts to over Rs 6 lakh crore of which about Rs 5.4 lakh crore will be loans from banks, Rs 50,000 crore in deferred tax and about Rs 21,000 crore from the Central Government. The amount foregone due to Centre’s contribution to six months of PF for small companies was not available.Impactful package under the first tranche of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan. The first phase targets key sectors of MSME, EPF, discoms and taxation among other major areas that are the most impacted. — Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CIISitharaman said several components of the package were directed at the mission of making India self-reliant (atmanirbhar Bharat), a phrase she translated in several Indian languages for the benefit of those who do not understand Hindi. “This is a phrase you will hear quite often,” she said in her opening remarks. Minister of State Anurag Thakur paraphrased Sitharaman’s remarks in Hindi.The Rs 90,000-crore liquidity infusion in discoms would help them pay the power-generating companies, which she said, was an example of “atmanirbhar Bharat”.

14-05-2020||New Delhi||1984 anti-Sikh riots: SC refuses to grant interim bail to Sajjan Kumar||The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to grant interim bail to former Delhi Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, who is serving a life sentence in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.Noting that his medical examination report, prepared by a panel of doctors from AIIMS, said he didn’t need hospitalisation, a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde said the matter will be taken up for hearing in July.The Bench also refused to grant parole to convicts Balwan Khokhar and Mahender Yadav. While Khokhar is serving a life term, Yadav has been given 10-year imprisonment by the Delhi High Court in the case.On behalf of Kumar, senior advocate Vikas Singh said he was produced before the AIIMS board and was examined and then he came back to jail.“After that, he could not be produced in AIIMS due to COVID-19. Tomorrow, if my client dies, his life sentence will automatically get converted to a death sentence,” Singh submitted.“Don’t say that,” responded the CJI, adding, “At the moment, we don’t want to decide on his bail application.”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta opposed Kumar’s plea, saying, “It’s a case genocide and he was leading a mob.”On behalf of the riot victims, senior advocate HS Phoolka opposed the convicts’ pleas for parole, saying they were not entitled to it under the rules.Kumar (73)—who sought interim bail on the grounds of his poor health condition—is in jail since December 31, 2018, when he surrendered after being convicted and awarded life imprisonment by the Delhi High Court in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.He has challenged the Delhi High Court’s verdict of December 17 last year that awarded him life imprisonment for the “remainder of his natural life” in a case relating the killing of five Sikhs in Delhi Cantonment’s Raj Nagar Part-I area of southwest Delhi on November 1-2 in 1984 and burning down of a Gurudwara in Raj Nagar Part-II.In his main petition, he has also sought suspension of sentence and his release on bail.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1984-anti-sikh-riots-sc-refuses-to-grant-interim-bail-to-sajjan-kumar-84275
