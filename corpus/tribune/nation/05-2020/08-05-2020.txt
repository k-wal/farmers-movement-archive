Indus commissioners of both the countries act as representatives of the respective governments for the treaty matters.The treaty provides for both the commissioners to meet at least once every year, alternately in India and Pakistan. It specifies that the waters of three eastern rivers, namely Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, have been allocated exclusively to India.Of the total 168 million acre-feet, India’s share of water from the three allotted rivers is 33 million acre-feet, which constitutes nearly 20 per cent. India uses 93 to 94 per cent of water.The western rivers, namely Indus, Chenab and Jhelum, are allocated to Pakistan with India given some rights such as agriculture, navigation, domestic use and also the unrestricted rights to develop hydroelectric power projects within the specified parameters of design and operations.In March, the annual meeting between the Indus Commissioners was postponed after New Delhi proposed deferment of consultations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown.The Indus Commissioners are supposed to hold a meeting by March 31 every year, according to the Indus Waters Treaty.

08-05-2020||Kolkata||Eight parties appeal to President Kovind to protect workers||Eight opposition political parties, including six having adherence to Left-wing ideologies, on Friday lashed out against the Central government for robbing the workers of their rights in the name of fighting COVID-19 pandemic.In a letter sent to President Ram Nath Kovind, the eight political parties cited the incident of running over of 16 migrant workers by a goods train last night and said it was an instance of the scant regard paid to lives of workers by the ruling dispensation.The letter signed by Sitaram Yechury of CPI(M), D Raja of CPI, Dipankar Bhattacharya of CPI-ML (Liberation), Debabrata Biswas of All India Forward Bloc, Manoj Bhattacharya of Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), Manoj Jha, MP of Rastriya Janata Dal (RJD) and Thol, Thirumavalavan, MP and chief of Tamil nationalist party Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) urged the President to urgently intervene to stop “naked savagery against the working class and the working people”.Accusing the Modi government of doing very little for workers, the parties alleged that fourteen crore workers lost their jobs owing to the lockdown.“Surely, you will agree that India cannot have more deaths due to hunger, starvation, poverty and deprivation than those infected by this deadly virus,” the parties confronted Kovind with the poser.The letter stated that with the exception of Kerala, the treatment meted out to migrant labourers by all the other states was quite deplorable. Besides charging the labourers for their travel back home, many restrictions had been also placed on their movement which were akin to those faced by bonded or indentured labourers, the letter stated.The letter alleged that under the pretext of battling the pandemic, the daily hours of workers had been increased from eight to twelve through executive orders in states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab without amending the Factories Act.Uttar Pradesh suspended all labour laws, except three, for a period of three years.The Madhya Pradesh Government, similarly, announced a Cabinet decision to exempt all establishments from obligations under all labour laws for a period of a thousand days, pointed out the letter by the eight parties.“The fundamental right of the workers to organise themselves into unions is also being gravely threatened,” the letter stated expressing concern.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/eight-parties-appeal-to-president-kovind-to-protect-workers-82214

One-third of them are also thinking of trading down.The lockdown has also boosted digital payments/media consumption, etc with many trying out digital payments for the first time.While online newspaper reading has added 20 per cent, additional new users, there has been a 40 per cent growth in new users shopping for staples online, and a 20 per cent addition to digital wallets.Despite the fear of loss of jobs and the resultant financial burden, many consumers think lifting the restrictions on movements is good to bring the pandemic under control.“More than 50 per cent consumers believe the availability of vaccine and containment of cases are the strongest indicators that the virus is in control, while only around 24 per cent consider this as part of lifting the lockdown,” says the survey.Around 60 per cent of the polled consumers believe that local retail and local transport are likely to return to normalcy first. But a similar number of consumers also believe that it will take at least a few months more for normal barrel back.

But on the US-China tussle, we will come to it subsequently when we have more breathing space to deal with it,” said a source.India is depending on China controlled banks as well as those dominated by the US to provide emergency funding to improve the health infrastructure as well as provide stimulus to the poor and the small and medium enterprises.India has already availed $ 1 billion from the Shanghai-based New Development Bank (NDB) and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has sought a doubling of the amount.Another reason for India’s reluctance to get caught in the US-China crossfire is that it is amalgamating funding from rival sources. In the latest case, the $ 1.5 billion project size to shore up the emergency response and health systems is being financed not just by AIIB but the World Bank as well.This project will cover all states and UTs across India and address the needs of infected people, at risk populations, medical and emergency personnel and service providers, medical and testing facilities, and national and animal health agencies.Besides availing $ 1 billion from the World Bank, India has also obtained a tranche of $ 1.5 billion from the Asian Development Bank.Sources said External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had also sought to keep the focus on eliciting global cooperation to fight the pandemic.In fact, they said all of India’s conversations, from the level of heads of government to senior officials, were focused on cooperating and collaborating in developing vaccines and therapeutic medicines besides keeping the supply chains functioning.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-refrains-from-taking-sides-in-us-china-spat-82210

Pending application(s), if any, stands disposed of,” the Bench said in the order.The term ‘social distancing’ is used to create awareness among citizens to keep them safe from the pandemic COVID-19.

08-05-2020||New Delhi||People with mental illness can’t be denied equal opportunity: HC for judgeship to bipolar person||People suffering from mental illness cannot be denied equal opportunity to have a dignified life, the Delhi High Court said, on Friday, while directing the authorities to declare a person, suffering from bipolar disorder, selected to the Delhi Judicial Service without any further delay.A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Sanjeev Narula set aside the May 21, 2019 notice/result published by the Delhi High Court Registrar General rejecting the candidature of a person for Delhi Judicial Services-2018 under the category of Persons with Disabilities (PwD) on account of his mental disability not being found to be permanent in nature.The bench allowed the man’s petition challenging his rejection and directed the authorities to declare the petitioner as selected to the Delhi Judicial Service without any further delay since he is the only qualified candidate in the ‘mental illness’ category.“Upon his appointment, the petitioner would retain his notional seniority along with his other batchmates and he would be deemed to have joined his post along with his other batchmates, though he would not be entitled to any back wages. It goes without saying that the respondent (high court administration) shall issue necessary orders regarding the petitioner's Induction training for judicial officers,” the bench said, in its 50-page judgement.The bench said from the counter affidavit filed by the high court administration, it appeared the reason for rejection of the man’s candidature was not that his mental illness was not of permanent nature, but because the authorities were of the opinion that the medical condition of Bipolar Affective Disorder (BPAD) makes him incapable of rendering service as a judicial officer.“Once the posts are advertised and seats are reserved for, inter alia, persons with mental illness, it is not open to the respondent to deny the petitioner reservation under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, merely on the basis of an opinion or belief entertained by it that the petitioner would not be able to discharge his duties as a Judicial Officer due to his mental illness. This is a call that the Parliament has taken. The Law provides reservation, inter alia, to persons with the enlisted benchmark disabilities which include ‘autism, intellectual disability, specific learning disability and mental illness’,” it said.The bench said it appeared that a person suffering from such a mental illness could lead a normal life, while being under treatment, though he may face ups and downs from time to time.“It appears that the Parliament granted reservation, inter alia, to the PwD — who suffer from mental illness (which does not include retardation), so that such persons get an opportunity to lead a normal life with encouragement and dignity. Merely because they may need medication and treatment throughout their lives, or may suffer setbacks from time to time, cannot be a reason to deny them equal opportunity to assimilate in society, make their contribution and have a life of dignity,” the bench said.It added that such persons had a fully developed mind like any normal human being and “they may suffer from substantial disorder of thinking, mood, perception or memory that may grossly impair judgment, behaviour and capacity to recognise reality or ability to meet the ordinary demands of life, but with medication and treatment such manifestations can be kept at bay”.The mere apprehension of the authorities that this candidate may not be able to handle the responsibility and stress which a judicial officer faces, cannot be a reason to declare him medically unfit or to say that he is not entitled to claim reservation, the bench said.It further said there was no medical opinion placed on record to come to the conclusion that a person, who is suffering from BPAD and was under remission, would not be able to discharge his responsibilities as a judicial officer.It said the intent and object of the RPwD Act was to protect and preserve the rights of disabled persons and employment was an essential aspect of utmost importance.The law had to be read liberally, keeping in mind that it is a beneficial and social welfare legislation which had to be given effect to in order to protect the rights of the PwD and not to defeat their rights, it said.In November 2018, the high court administration had issued notice inviting online applications from eligible candidates for filling up 147 vacancies for DJS 2018. Out of 147 vacancies, six seats were reserved for PwD.Out of these 6 seats, 2 seats were reserved for persons having autism, intellectual disability, specific learning disability, mental illness and multiple disabilities as mentioned under the RPwD Act including deaf-blindness.The petitioner candidate said he was called for an interview by the Interview Board, comprising judges of the high court and other members and later when final results were published, his candidature was rejected as his disability was not found to be permanent as per the disability certificate submitted by him.The disability certificate issued by the Department of Psychiatry, AIIMS, certified the petitioner of having the disability, that is, mental illness — BPAD to the extent of 45 per cent and stated that his condition was 'currently in remission' and his condition was ‘likely to improve’.

08-05-2020||New Delhi||People must learn to live with the virus, follow prevention guidelines: Health Ministry||“We have to learn to live with the virus,” the government said on Friday, urging people to make COVID-19 prevention guidelines a part of their lives as a behavioural change amid easing of the lockdown restrictions and migrant labourers returning home.Addressing a press conference, the Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry, Lav Agarwal, said there had been a reduction in the doubling time of COVID-19 cases in the country from 12 days, till two days ago, to 10 now because of the spike in cases at some places, even as he asserted that the peak of the disease could be avoided if the prescribed do’s and don’ts were followed.“As we talk of relaxations to the lockdown and of migrant workers returning back to their respective homes, there is a big challenge in front of us that we also have to learn to live with the virus,” he said.“And when we are talking about learning to live with the virus, then it is very important that the guidelines that are there on saving oneself from the virus are adopted in the community as a behavioural change,” Agarwal said.It was a big challenge and the government needed community support for it, he said.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had also recently said people would have to be ready to live with COVID-19 and that time had come to re-open the city, as the government announced certain relaxations.Giving district-wise situation of COVID-19 cases, Agarwal said there were 216 districts in which no COVID-19 case had been reported to date.As many as 42 districts had had no fresh cases in the last 28 days while 29 districts had reported no new cases of COVID-19 in the last 21 days, he said. Also, 36 districts had not registered any fresh cases in the last 14 days and 46 districts had had no fresh cases in the last seven days, he added.When asked about AIIMS (Delhi) director Dr Randeep Guleria’s remarks citing modelling data that the peak of the disease in India might be reached in June or July, Agarwal said, “If we follow the prescribed do’s and don’ts, we may not reach the peak in the number of COVID-19 cases and our curve may remain flat.”If the precautions were not taken and guidelines not followed properly, there could be chances of a spike in cases, he warned, stressing that community support and field action should continue so that the country did not reach the peak.Responding to a question on how many cases India may witness if the peak comes in June- July, the official said different organisations had projected a figure of some thousands to some crores based on their analysis.“They are widely varying that determining field-level action based on that will be slightly difficult. We do an analysis based on the current growth rate of cases and doubling rate, according to analysis, our doubling rate is now 10 days and simultaneously, we do an analysis of districts and cities where cases are rising. On the basis of that we see where more action and additional efforts are required to increase the doubling time of cases,” Agarwal said.Stating that some states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have witnessed a rise in cases during the last few days, Agarwal laid stress on the need to strengthen containment efforts to stop the rise, along with proper adherence to measures such as physical distancing at field level.“As migrant workers return to their respective home states, it is essential that during movement all precautions regarding infection prevention and management are taken and the rules at the quarantine and isolation facilities are followed,” Agarwal said.“We request workers to understand that this is for their own benefit, their people, village and city.

In addition, CII has suggested the creation of a fund with a corpus of Rs 1.4-1.6 lakh crore to subscribe to corporate bonds.The fund can be seeded by the government with a corpus of Rs 10,000-20,000 crore, with further investments from banks and financial institutions.It has also sought Rs 2 lakh crore for bank recapitalisation and Rs 4 lakh crore in support from the subscription of government paper by the RBI.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/time-running-out-for-stimulus-industry-warns-centre-82199

After the incident, it was halted at the next station,” said a spokesperson on South Central Railway.Four migrant workers survived the accident which took place at 5.15 am near Karmad, around 30 km from Aurangabad, police said.

However, according to Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ram Vilas Paswan there is no shortage of food grains and procurement is also on track in the country.Sufficient food grains supply is available to meet the increased demands, said Paswan. As on date, cumulative procurement of wheat in Rabi Marketing Season (RMS) 2020-21 is 226.85 LMT, whereas procurement during the corresponding RMS 2019-20 was 277.83 LMT. Therefore, procurement of wheat in the current season is less by 18.35 per cent than the corresponding period in the previous season, Paswan informed.However, cumulative procurement of paddy as on May 6 in the Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) 2019-20 is 439.02 LMT, whereas procurement during the corresponding KMS 2018-19 was 398.13 LMT, which is 10.27 per cent more, the minister added.Paswan said in view of the prevailing unprecedented situation, it had been decided that procurement of wheat during the ensuing Rabi Marketing Season 2020-21 and procurement of paddy/rice of Rabi crop in the Kharif Marketing Season 2019-20 might be carried out on provisional basis, while keeping the target/estimate of procurement the same as during previous RMS - 2019-20 and KMS 2018-19 (Rabi crop) in case of wheat and paddy/rice, respectively.The procurement of wheat and paddy/rice during RMS normally commences on April 1, but due to COVID-19 most of the states could not commence operations before April 15.States have been advised to ensure the procurement operations. The number of procurement centres could also be increased to the extent possible so as to disperse the procurement operations for ensuring social distancing and maintaining hygiene at these centres, said Paswan.The minister said a massive exercise was underway to supply free food grains and pulses to about 80 crore people across the country under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana.The government is making efforts to ensure that food grains are readily available for distribution in all the states for meeting their requirements under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), he added.As many as 21 states/UTs have completed more than 90 per cent distribution for the month of April under the PMGKAY, covering nearly 41.35 crore beneficiaries.Some sates/UTs, like Andaman Nicobar, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Puducherry and Himachal Pradesh, are distributing food grains for two months in one go, Paswan added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wheat-procurement-18-35-per-cent-less-than-last-year-82196

In fact their undemocratic action damaged the reputation of this prestigious Bar," Arora said, accusing the executive committee of intimidating him at various occasions.Earlier, invoking Rule 22 of the SCBA Rules, Arora had called a meeting to discuss removal of Dave from the primary membership of SCBA, misuse of the bar body for political purposes and withdrawal of a resolution passed in February condemning Justice Arun Mishra's statement praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a judicial conference here.SCBA should not be used for political agenda, Arora had said.Unfazed by the allegations, Dave had asserted that being the elected President of the SCBA, he will continue to serve the bar body till the end of his tenure."It will have no purpose nor can it achieve any objective except to tarnish reputation of this great body, SCBA. I am the President elected lawfully and will continue to serve you till my term is over. This attempt violates every cannon of procedure and law and has no legs to stand," Dave had said in a letter to SCBA members.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/infighting-in-scba-executive-committee-suspends-secy-ashok-arora-82194

Lessons designed by Edn.Dept as per MBOSE Curriculum. Also broadcasted in Airtel ch.399 and local cable. Students may also tune in AIR TURA, SHILLONG, JOWAI.”A senior official said, the move would help students as they could not attend schools in view of the COVID-induced lockdown.Though some private parties had tried to reach out to students during the lockdown period, the reach was limited in view of “not-so-good” internet reach, he said.The education department is hopeful that roping in Doordarshan and the All India Radio will address the problem.

Reasonable prices are the answers. Prices should give some space to the producer countries. It should be profitable for them. It should be viable for them,” Pradhan reasoned.The minister said post-COVID, the government planned to move towards a new gas policy and a new tariff policy.“We are planning for a gas exchange very soon and we will be liberalising our distribution mechanisms. We are very much focused, after relaxing of this lockdown…on the job of implementing the city gas distribution network expansion,” he told Yergin.The minister hopes that this initiative will create a long-term futuristic energy infrastructure in most of the country and enable employment generation. “This is a perfect plan for our gas expansion story,” he said.Pradhan said all the major steel plants and blast furnaces were functioning but there was low demand leading to an increasing stockpile. “But the way we are planning for the future roadmap – a lot of roads, a lot of value-added activities, a lot of infrastructure plans on the roadmap – in all of these areas steel will be required,” Pradhan hoped.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-has-ample-reserves-of-crude-at-its-disposal-dharmendra-pradhan-82189

Immigration and other facilities will be provided at these airports.“There is a fair amount of flexibility and suppleness in this operation,’’ said the source, while adding that feeder flights would carry some of the passengers even closer to their destinations.For instance, passengers from Himachal Pradesh disembarking at Delhi will board a special domestic flight to Chandigarh.The alternate locations will also permit state governments to create ample quarantine facilities.Delhi and Bihar have emulated Kerala by arranging for comfortable hotel stay for the passengers at reasonable rates.  The Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir has also indicated that it has the facilities for all domiciled citizens who wanted to return.The Delhi government is understood to have tied up with hotels at Aerocity for quarantining the passengers while the Bihar government indicated that Bodh Gaya would be an ideal quarantine destination because its huge tourist infrastructure is currently vacant.The sources defended charging passengers for air fare on grounds that the rates were meant to ensure that the operation was self-sustaining.They pointed out that this airlift was taking place at the request of passengers who were mostly students or working abroad, and hence had the capacity to pay.The earlier gratis air lifts from Libya or Kuwait had taken place in an emergency situation in a conflict zone, they reasoned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/next-phase-to-repatriate-indians-from-may-15-to-cover-more-countries-82185

They have been peremptorily asked to tender resignation without any condition.The company's management was evasive when contacted on Friday regarding the retrenchments.Anchal Sharma, a Senior Marketing Expert with the firm, who is among those retrenched, said: "The development has caused me and the other affected employees distress.”Anchal, who hails from a middle-class family, was preparing for her marriage which was to take place after the lockdown was over.A post-graduate in computer science, Anchal had woven her sweet dreams and plans of post-marriage life on the basis of her job.Bikash Kumar, a resident of Faridabad, among those laid off, said he was about seven years into a job with the company. A computer graduate from Jalandhar, he was an Internet Marketing Manger."I have a daughter and wife to support. What will I do now during this period of lockdown?” he wondered.The retrenched employees have made representation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Labour Minister Satosh Kumar Gangwar, among others, seeking their intervention.The central trade unions had written a joint letter to PM Modi and the Union Labour Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar, a few days ago, asking for statutory enforceable measure with a provision to arrest those who violated the government advisory against layoffs during the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gurugram-based-tech-firm-lays-off-nearly-100-employees-82184

The Jalashwa is scheduled to sail out of the Maldives on Friday night and will reach Kochi in Kerala on Sunday. The INS Magar is scheduled to sail out of the Maldives either Saturday evening or Sunday morning.This is the biggest sea-route evacuation carried out by the Navy since its effort in March-April 2015, when a total of 3,074 people, including 1291 foreign nationals, were evacuated from Yemen after Saudi Arabia launched airstrikes against Iranian-allied Houthi rebels.Both ships are amphibious and are hollow from the inside, allowing huge carrying capacity of relief material, rations, machines and hundreds of troops.In the past, the Indian Navy carried out similar Non-Combatant Evacuation Operations (NEO) operations from overseas.In 2006 ‘Operation Sukoon’ — meaning relief — was carried out to evacuate 2,200 Indians, Sri Lankans and Nepalese from Lebanon.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-lockdown-navy-begins-evacuation-of-indian-nationals-from-maldives-82182

But it has been extending the time given to the judge from time to time. It had also extended the tenure of Special Judge Yadav who was to retire in September 2019.“We are cognizant of the fact that Shri Yadav is making all efforts in order that the trial reach a just conclusion,” the Bench noted.Besides Advani, Joshi, Kalyan Singh and Uma Bharti, the accused facing criminal conspiracy charge include former BJP MP Vinay Katiar and Sadhvi Ritambara. Three other high-profile accused died during pendency of the case.Kalyan Singh, during whose tenure as UP Chief Minister the disputed structure was demolished, was initially not tried as the top court held that being a governor of Rajasthan he was immune to prosecution. Charges were framed against him after he ceased to be governor.The court revived the charges 16 years after they were dropped by a Lucknow court on technical grounds.The Mughal-era mosque in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya was demolished by kar sevaks, or supporters of Vishwa Hindu Parishad on December 6, 1992, sparking one of India’s worst communal riots that claimed more than 3,000 lives.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/conclude-babri-trial-against-advani-joshi-others-by-august-31-sc-to-special-cbi-court-82181

The trafficking network is spread across the states of Gujarat, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra,” Malhotra said.In a similar seizure, an NCB team seized 60 kgs of opium from a Haryana registered truck from the Fatehpur district of Uttar Pradesh on April 28.The narcotics was recovered from “under the driver's seat,” the officer said.Initial investigation reveals that the opium was sourced from near Chouparan in Jharkhand and was destined to Haryana, another senior official of the agency said.B Singh, the driver and the owner of the truck, has been arrested.It is uncommon for opium to be sourced from Jharkhand and all efforts were being made to trace the source of the seized drug, the senior official added.In another case, the agency seized as many as 61,368 psychotropic tablets and 840 bottles of codeine-based cough syrup from the Patan district of Gujarat on April 26.A person, J Kumar Patel, was arrested by the agency under the provision of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS).These drugs could not be sold by any medical store without a valid medical prescription from a registered medical practitioner, Malhotra said.Such drugs, he added, usually reached the illegal market by way of diversion from illicit drug manufacturers, wholesalers or retail chemists.

Meanwhile, grants should be put to use as quickly as the colleges receive them and salaries should be disbursed,” it said.There has been a standoff between the Delhi government and the DU adminstration over the issue of formation of governing bodies in colleges partially or fully funded by the former. The government had said that it would not release funds to colleges without governing bodies.Last month, the DUTA had called for a day-long hunger strike to protest against the non-payment of salaries to employees of colleges funded by the Delhi government.

The economically lower section these migrant labourers belong to is the vote-bank he built with great care with the ‘chaiwalla’ image. “This class, which transcends caste combinations and equations, has been most committed to the BJP when he came to power. It was with this ‘chaiwalla’/humble image he was able to influence a large section of voters for the BJP which earlier was known as a ‘brahmin-bania’ middle class party,” said Panwar.While migrant crisis as per analysts has undone PM’s pro-poor image built through his humble moorings and later the controversial demonetisation exercise, and given credence to Opposition’s claims of “BJP being a party of rich and privileged”, Arora believes “there is also no coming back from this”.“The party will have to work very hard and come up with new tricks to break the current image of a ruthless, draconian, iron-fisted state that sprays bleach on labourers, forces them to walk thousands of  kilometres on foot and lets them starve to death.“And the constant modification of orders, going back and forth with decisions, releasing and re-releasing press notes has also exposed the indecisiveness and amateur approach of the government. It will be very difficult to bounce back from these two conflicting images that the migrant crisis has brought forth in the public eye,” he says.Panwar explains why it may be difficult for the BJP to gain confidence of its till now committed vote-bank.“No one can predict the future and the next general elections are four years away. However, PM’s handling of lockdown has divided the society into two parts. There are those who have homes to stay and stand on their balconies to light a diya and those who are dying in the process of going home. The ‘thali’ ‘diya’ are for upper middle class and for economically lower sections there is nothing.”  What happened in Karnataka with Chief Minister BS Yeddiyurappa first cancelling trains and then making a U-turn further added to these perceptions.“People have no faith in what the government is saying as there is also no verification of its claims. What happens in four years no one can predict but at present the BJP’s stock is at the lowest,” says Panwar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/troubles-mount-for-bjp-as-migrant-crisis-shatters-pm-modis-pro-poor-image-82171

The number of migrants ferried is likely to cross the three lakh-mark by tonight,” said a Railway spokesperson.Every special train has 24 coaches, each with a capacity of 72 seats. But the national transporter is allowing only 54 people in a coach to maintain social distancing norms by not allotting the middle berth to any passenger.While the Railways has officially not stated how much it has spent so far on these services, the cost for which the government says has been shared on an 85:15 ratio with states, officials indicated that the national transporter has spent around Rs 80 lakh per service.Since the beginning of the services, Gujarat remained one of the top originating stations, followed by Kerala. Among the receiving states, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh remained the top states. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nearly-3-lakh-migrants-ferried-during-lockdown-railways-82169

Under ordinary circumstances, the Board would not have hesitated to conduct all examinations that could not be held after March 18, 2020 or are postponed for other reasons. But in the present situation, the Board has decided to conduct examinations for only main subjects that will be required for promotion and maybe crucial for admissions in higher educational institutions. For the rest of the subjects, CBSE will not hold examinations and instructions for marking and assessment in all such cases shall be separately issued. The Board will only hold examinations in 29 core subjects,” CBSE said.Earlier the CBSE issued orders to all schools to promote students of classes 1 to 8 to the next class. For classes IX and XI also the CBSE directed all schools to promote students to the next grades on the basis of all the school-based assessments including project work, periodic tests and term exams conducted so far.“For any Class IX or Class XI student who is unable to clear the grade through internal assessment, the school should make remedial arrangements to let the student reappear in class based tests offline or online,” CBSE had earlier directed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pending-cbse-class-10-12-board-exams-from-july-1-to-15-82168

The PIL wanted the top court to declare direct contact sales at liquor shops during the COVID-19 lockdown unconstitutional.Deepak said physical distancing norms were being violated as the number of shops could not match up to the massive demand for liquor.“What do you want us to do in an Article 32 petition?” wondered Justice SK Kaul who was part of the Bench.As authorities allowed resumption of liquor sale on May 5 after 40 days, large serpentine queues were witnessed at liquor shops in various parts of the country, with buyers violating physical distancing norms made mandatory by the government.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-should-consider-online-sale-of-liquor-sc-82152

08-05-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Rahul Gandhi asks PM to devolve power, take states into confidence||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday exhorted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to devolve power and make the states partners in efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, contending that “if we keep this fight in PMO, we will lose”.Gandhi said there will be a “calamity” if the fight against the novel coronavirus is centralised in the prime minister’s office (PMO).Addressing a press conference through video conference, he also asked the government to adopt transparency in its actions to tackle the coronavirus and work together with states and take them into confidence.His remarks came after complaints by Congress-ruled states that they were being pushed into fiscal distress in the absence of the Centre providing them resources to fight the pandemic.Gandhi also called upon the government to immediately put money into the hands of the poor and provide a financial package to the industry to help revive the economy amid the nationwide lockdown to combat the deadly virus.He also called for having a migrant policy in place as also a lockdown exit strategy in consultation with states.“I am deeply disturbed and saddened by news of trains being cancelled and migrants being forced to stay back in some states. They are not bonded labour and should be allowed to travel home as per their own free will. After announcements of buses and trains, why are thousands still forced to walk back to their villages,” he asked.He said the lockdown is not an “on/off switch”, but is a transition which requires cooperation of all—the Centre, states, district magistrates and the people of India.“We need to decentralise power in dealing with the virus. If we keep this fight in PMO, we will lose. The PM must devolve power. If we centralise, there will be a calamity. PM has to trust chief ministers and chief ministers have to trust district magistrates,” he said.Gandhi also asked the government to tell the people what criteria it would use to open the lockdown or continue it post May 17, as the transition out of it is a serious challenge before the country.The Congress MP said the government needs to work on a psychological change and if it has to open lockdown, it has to convert people’s fear about the disease into confidence, as it is not deadly for most of them.Noting that the country is facing an emergency situation, the Congress leader said the idea of injecting immediately a sum of Rs 7,500 directly into the hands of poor is critical.He said as the virus continues to spread across the country, the reality is that the total lockdown has unleashed on India “an economic tsunami of unimaginable proportions”.The Congress leader said it is clear that “we will not be able to get our economy moving again without a massive economic stimulus” from the government and most countries have already announced huge stimulus packages to help restart the economy and ease the pain of their citizens.“However in India, the government has been dragging its feet on announcing an economic package targeting vulnerable groups like farmers, migrant labourers and daily wage earners as well as industry clusters like travel and tourism, automobiles, retail etc. that have been severely damaged.“The longer the government delays announcing this package, the more the pain will grow and the tougher it will become to re-start the economy,” he said.The former Congress president said the economic package is being delayed as the government feels India could be downgraded by international agencies.“We have to protect the job creators and have to build a wall for them to protect jobs and wages of workers. We have to give them financial support,” Gandhi said while calling for a financial package to the MSME sector as well as other industry.“We need to start our domestic economy soon, the more time we lose, the worse impact it will have,” he noted.Gandhi also made several suggestions, including providing Rs 7,500 to the poor that will entail a total expense of only Rs 65,000 crore, doubling of MGNREGA employment guarantee days to 200 from the current 100 a year, food security to the poor and vulnerable by providing them food grains.He also called for wage protection and credit guarantee scheme of Rs one lakh crore each for MSME sector and credit guarantee/ interests subsidy to large industries to ensure there are no layoffs and supply chain continues, besides sops to farmer and agri sector and shopkeepers.The Congress leader hoped the government will give serious consideration to the suggestions by the Congress and incorporate them in the economic stimulus package, which should be announced without any further delay.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 1,886 and the number of cases climbed to 56,342 in the country on Friday, registering an increase of 103 fatalities and 3,390 infections in the last 24 hours, according to the Union Health Ministry.

Lipulekh pass close to the Tri-junction of  India-China-Nepal, is the lowest point in this section of the high Himalayas.The 80 km, which now has a road, entailed more than a three-day trek one-way for pilgrims and also for the security forces posted there. The road completion means it will now be two-day travel distance from Delhi to Lipulekh, a distance of 750 km via Pithoragarh. In all it will reduce some six days from the Kailash-Mansarovar yatra. Beyond, Lipulekh, the 97 km road in Tibet to Mount Tibet already exists.The road on the Indian side, for now, has been completed just 5 km short of Lipulekh. Sources said the Director General Military Operations had placed a temporary ban on last-mile connectivity. Once that is okayed, the BRO expects to complete the last five km by the end of the year.The entire route from Delhi to Kailash Mansarovar, other than 5km, will be on vehicles. A yatri from Delhi can go to Pithoragarh and from there on the night halt at Gunji for first acclimatization and second near Lipulekh Pass for second stage acclimatization, needed due to altitude and rarefied air in tree-less Tibet.The other route for the yatra is via Sikkim is 2780 km. It involves taking a flight to Bagdogra (1115 km from Delhi), thereafter 1665 km of road travel, including 1490 km road travel in China.The 80 km Ghatiabgarh-Lipulekh section is made under the directions of the China Study Group (CSG) and is funded from Indo-China Border Road (ICBR). The road was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) in 2005 at a cost of Rs 80.76 crore. In 2018, CCS approved a revised cost of Rs 439.40 crore.The progress in last two years was possible due to addition of construction equipment — 90 pieces of equipments were deployed on the road.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-connects-to-lac-kailash-yatra-is-a-road-ride-away-from-delhi-82112

08-05-2020||New Delhi||ICMR says no scientific data available to study anti-viral properties of Ganga water||The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) has decided not to go ahead with the Jal Shakti Ministry's proposal to undertake clinical studies for treatment of COVID-19 patients with the Ganga water, saying it needs more scientific data.Dr Y K Gupta, who chairs the committee for Evaluation of Research Proposals at the ICMR, said the evidence and data available at the moment is not strong enough to start the clinical studies by different routes/forms of the Ganga water for treatment of coronavirus.The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), an arm of the Jal Shakti Ministry that deals with the rejuvenation programme for the river, had received a number of proposals, including from people and NGOs working on the Ganga, to undertake clinical studies for treatment of coronavirus patients with the water, officials said.            The proposals were accordingly sent to the ICMR.Gupta, who is also a former dean of AIIMS, said, "At present, the proposal needs much scientific data, proof of concept and a strong background hypothesis. This has been conveyed to them (NMCG)."       NMCG officials said the proposals were discussed with the scientists of the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), which had earlier conducted a study 'Assessment of Water Quality and Sediment to understand the special properties of the Ganga'.According to the NEERI study, the Ganga water has higher number of bacteriophages as against pathogenic bacteria. During consultations that were held between the NMCG and NEERI, the scientists had said there is still no proof that the Ganga water or sediment had anti-viral properties."We forwarded the proposals to the ICMR as received," said a senior official of the NMCG.One of the proposals received by NMCG claimed that the waters of the Ganga have "ninja virus" which scientists call bacteriophages.Another proposal claimed that pure Ganga water boosted immunity which helped fight the virus.The third proposal, a much detailed one, sought more research on the Ganga water's anti-viral properties and its ability to boost immunity in fighting diseases.        NMCG officials said they had not received any official communication on the status of their proposals from the ICMR.

Covid was recognised as a pandemic on March 11.The childbirth analysis is based on data from World Population Prospects 2019 of the UN Population Division.An average full-term pregnancy typically lasts complete 9 months, or 39 to 40 weeks. For the purposes of this estimate, the number of births for a 40-week period in 2020 was calculated. The 40-week period of March 11 to December 16 was used in this estimate based upon the WHO’s March 11 assessment that Covid can be characterised as a pandemic.Trials to test herbs for Covid preventionNew Delhi: India launched two clinical trials on Thursday to study whether a range of medicinal herbs under Ayurveda could offer preventive and management potential against Covid. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan launched the studies saying while China used its traditional medicines on Covid patients, India continued to be hesitant to experiment with its time-tested Ayurvedic traditions “documented as superior to others since years”. The Interdisciplinary Ayush Research and Development Task Force has designed the clinical research protocols for this study. The trial involves studying four different interventions - Ashwagandha, Yashtimadhu, Guduchi-Pippali and a poly herbal formulation.

08-05-2020||New Delhi||PIL in Supreme court against charging workers stranded abroad||A PIL has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Centre to use the Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) to rescue poor workers stranded abroad due to the Covid lockdown.Launched in 2009, the fund is meant to help Indian nationals living abroad in times of distress. The petitioner NGO, Pravasi Legal Cell, said fixing a fare for repatriation during these challenging times would further burden the migrant labourers who lost their jobs and were in a vulnerable condition in foreign land. “The government must also consider the situation of migrant workers who have already lost their jobs and are living in a miserable condition in the Gulf countries, and make use of the funds like the ICWF already available for bearing the cost of such needy Indian expatriates,” the NGO submitted.Noting that majority of migrants were working in Gulf countries and were mostly “low skilled”, the petitioner said most of them had been shifted to quarantine camps that were notoriously crowded. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pil-in-supreme-court-against-charging-workers-stranded-abroad-81988

08-05-2020||---||Experts rule out parallels between Bhopal, Vizag tragedy||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 7Experts today ruled out parallels between Bhopal gas leak and Visakhapatnam tragedy saying there was no evidence to suggest long-term health impact of styrene, the compound that leaked today.“Chances of long-term impact of styrene are less because this compound gets flushed out of the body after metabolising. This is an acute exposure rather than a chronic exposure. We will have to follow up and see, but as of now data doesn’t suggest a significant long-term impact,” Randeep Guleria, Director, AIIMS, New Delhi, said when asked if styrene could leave long-term impacts as seen after methyl isocynate gas leak in Bhopal.Guleria, who is leading the medical response to Andhra Pradesh gas leak, said styrene was an alkaline benzene compound which could impact the human body at two levels depending on the degree of exposure — respiratory distress and damage to the central nervous system mainly the brain. He said benzene illness by and large was not universally fatal.“In most people there is good recovery. The compound mostly irritates the respiratory airways. Those with very close exposure can have severe effects. In such cases styrene can lead to coma, pulmonary edema and sometimes irregular heart beat. The gas does not stay for a very long time. Avoiding exposure is the best. Eyes can be washed to avoid irritation and skin can be cleaned with absorbents like towels to remove styrene deposition,” Guleria said.He said there was no definitive medicine to reverse the effect of styrene.“So far as treatment goes, there is no specific antidote for styrene compound and treatment is mainly supportive. People need to be removed from the contaminated areas, which has been done. Clothes need to be removed as they could be contaminated. Exposed eyes should be washed so also the skin. All affected people have to be monitored for breathing difficulty and drowsiness as styrene can affect both lungs and brain,” Guleria added.Medically, he said, the main treatment was to watch out for breathing difficulty in airway management.Some affected individuals could need a ventilator while many would just require oxygen therapy. “We have to monitor the oxygen, respiratory rate and CNS depression of patients. In case of acute lung injury, steroids have also been given as per data,” he said.Styrene can cause harm to humans by inhalation and ingestion and impacts the skin and eyes. Medical symptoms include irritation in the throat and airways, which can lead to breathing difficulties, wheezing sound in the chest. Absorption of styrene can cause central nervous system depression by impacting the brain leading to headache, nausea, fatigue and unsteady gait as was seen today with many people falling unconscious.Scenes bring back Bhopal memoriesVisakhapatnam: Unconscious children being carried by parents in their arms, people laying on roads, health workers scrambling to attend to those affected by the styrene vapour leak and residents fleeing were some of the scenes that played out on Thursday, bringing back grim memories of the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy. Women and children were seen lying on roads struggling to breath, reminiscent of the infamous Bhopal gas tragedy when a leak from the Union Carbide plant left around 3,500 dead and many maimed.

The cascading effect of the increase in the Dearness Allowance (DA), pension liability etc. are not included in this sum.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has approved the proposal of Engineer-in-Chief of the MES for optimisation of more than 9,300 posts in the basic and industrial workforce. “The proposal of abolition 9,304 posts in the MES out of the total 13,157 vacancies of the basic and industrial staff has been approved,” the MoD said.“It is in line with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts, headed by Lt General DB Shekatkar, which had recommended measures to enhance combat capability and rebalance defence expenditure of the armed forces”, a spokesperson of the MoD said.One of the recommendations made by the committee was to restructure the civilian workforce in a manner that the work of the MES could be partly done by departmentally employed staff and other works could be outsourced.In 1881, the British carved out the Military Works branch out of the PWD and transferred it to the Military Department. The Military Works Services headed by a Director General came into being in 1889. The MES was organised into its present structure after 1947.Sources said the normal maintenance of military infrastructure would be carried out by private agencies.The Shekatkar panel listed 99 points for structural changes in the Army — cutting flab and reducing revenue (maintenance) expenditure. The MoD, in 2017, accepted 65 of 99 suggestions. Off these 65, some are pending for implementation.Panel recommendationsFormer Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had set up the Lt General DB Shekatkar committee. It suggested how to enhance combat potential of the forces and rebalancing expenses. It listed steps to trim, redeploy and integrate manpower. It suggested expenses “could be cut by Rs25,000 crore over five years”. These many posts cost a sum of Rs300 crore to the exchequer per annum just by way of salaries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mod-abolishes-9-300-posts-in-military-engineering-service-81699
