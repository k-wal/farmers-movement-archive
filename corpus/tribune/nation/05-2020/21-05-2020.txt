In view of the above, the RPF has started concerted nationwide efforts to identify and act against these touts,” it said.A drive was launched on May 20 and 14 touts, including eight IRCTC agents, were arrested. Tickets worth Rs 6,36,727 were recovered from them. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/railways-protection-force-arrests-14-touts-recovers-tickets-worth-over-rs-6-lakh-88030
21-05-2020||New Delhi||Centre cites lockdown violations, asks states to ensure strict implementation||The Centre on Thursday asked states to ensure strict implementation of lockdown and night curfew protocols, saying it has noticed violation of the restrictions at several places.In a communication to all states and union territories, Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla asked them to strictly ensure prohibition of all non-essential activities between 7pm and 7am, saying the night curfew imposed to contain the coronavirus spread is an “important element of the Home Ministry guidelines”.He said the night curfew has been imposed to ensure that people observe social distance.“Accordingly, local authorities should be asked to issue orders in the entirety of their jurisdiction, under proper provisions of law, for imposition of night curfew. Strict compliance of these orders should be ensured by the local authorities,” he said.Bhalla said the Home Ministry has noticed reports of violation of its guidelines at several places.“I would like to emphasise that the MHA guidelines should be strictly implemented, and all authorities in states and UTs should take necessary steps to ensure the same,” he said.These stipulations, such as wearing face covers, ensuring social distancing at work, transport and in public places, maintaining hygiene and sanitation etc., are important for containing the spread of COVID-19. “It is the duty of all district and local authorities to enforce the national directives,” he said.“I would request all the chief secretaries of states and administrators of union territories to remain vigilant in the fight against COVID-19 and ensure that all measures that have either been mandated by MHA or laid down by the States and UTs, are scrupulously adhered to at all levels,” Bhalla said.After the lockdown was extended till May 31, the Home Ministry issued fresh guidelines relaxing some curbs that were imposed during the first three phases, except in the containment zones.Bhalla said a proper delineation of containment zones and effective implementation of containment measures is key to preventing the further spread of COVID- 19. In this respect, the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare need to be followed and containment zones properly demarcated.“States and UTs can now delineate various zones, and decide on the activities to be prohibited, or allowed with restrictions, in accordance with the MHA guidelines. Further, once the guidelines have been issued by the states and UTs, they should be strictly implemented, and action taken if any deviations are noticed,” the home secretary said in the letter.The lockdown was first announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 for 21 days. It was then extended till May 3 and again till May 17. The lockdown has now been extended till May 31.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 3,435 and the number of cases climbed to 1,12,359 in the country till Thursday 8 am, according to the Union Health Ministry. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-cites-lockdown-violations-asks-states-to-ensure-strict-implementation-88025

21-05-2020||New Delhi||BJP indulging in vendetta politics: Cong after FIR against Sonia Gandhi||The Congress on Thursday accused the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of indulging in vendetta politics after a case was registered in Karnataka against Sonia Gandhi for raising questions over the PM-CARES fund.The party also hit out at the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, alleging it was playing dirty politics by registering a case against the party's state unit chief Ajay Kumar Lallu and arresting him twice on Wednesday.The party also urged Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to review his decision."It is extremely unfortunate that at a time like this, when the world is facing a disaster like coronavirus and in India crores of people have lost their livelihood and are forced to walk home…instead of helping them all that you (BJP) want to do is vendetta politics,” Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said at a press conference held through video-conferencing."You are not just misusing government machinery, you are also inciting vendetta politics. We strongly condemn this," said Supriya.A case has been registered against Congress president Sonia Gandhi at Sagara town in Karnataka's Shivamogga district on a complaint that @INCIndia, the official Twitter handle of the Congress, tried to create distrust among the masses with its tweet by spreading "baseless charges".The complainant alleged that on May 11 at 6 pm, the INC India Twitter account posted messages against Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging "misuse" of PM-CARES Fund set up to enable people contribute to help the government fight the coronavirus and "similar distressing situations".       Supriya said it was not just about the FIR against Sonia Gandhi, "this gives us an insight into how the BJP and Mr Modi operates"."Even at a time like this, what is important for them is vendetta politics. This is a democracy and in a democracy opposition leaders have a basic right to ask questions," she said.Supriya said this was a not a question on the state of affairs, but on the PM-CARES Fund, where thousands of crores had been deposited and even with so much funds available migrants were still forced to walk and people were still suffering."Why can this money not be released...every Indian wants to ask this question," she said.About the arrest of Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu, Supriya said, "This is political vendetta. We request that you leave aside this politics, reconsider the allegations against Ajay Lallu ji and end this politics of vengeance."        The Uttar Pradesh Congress chief was arrested twice on Wednesday – first in Agra for sitting on a dharna to protest against the UP Government not granting permission to allow buses arranged for migrants by the Congress enter the state.He was granted bail by an Agra court and released, before being rearrested by a team of Lucknow police in a second case filed here in connection with the Congress' standoff with the state government."This is a murder of democracy. We strongly condemn the detention of Ajay Lallu ji. The Chief Minister should reconsider this. It seems that the BJP government is indifferent to the suffering of the people," said Supriya.She said "dirty politics" was being played even at the time of coronavirus pandemic. "Not only did the Adityanath government rejected our offer of help with the buses, but even sent UP Congress president Ajay Lallu to custody." The Congress leader alleged that all charges against Lallu were ridiculous. "In the FIR, he has been accused of causing loss to the people, which is ridiculous because he was helping people," she said."Everyone in Uttar Pradesh understands this dirty politics of the BJP government. Ajay Lallu ji has struggled a lot and worked hard. He is being targeted for helping the labourers," she alleged.

However, the issue acquired a sharp political edge as Australia suggested that the resolution would pin China down.The MEA spokesperson Anurag Shrivastav said India engaged in negotiations and agreed to co-sponsor the resolution because it accounted for Indian interests in management of global health issues and affordability of vaccines. “It is important to underscore that the resolution was unanimous. Our position was well reflected in the resolution,” Shrivastav told newspersons over video-conferencing.In the end, the seven-page resolution that was being projected as a tool to corner China contained a request for an independent probe into the origin of the virus and its transmission to human beings. This was also stated in resolutions on previous viruses. In addition the resolution advised countries to take specific measures in health and general social life to minimise the spread of Covid.It also laid stress of pooling of IPRs as well as public and private expertise to find a Covid vaccine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-resolution-met-indian-interests-for-cheap-covid-vaccine-mea-88019

We, therefore, decided to do it indigenously,” he said.The secretary informed how the testing equipment will help the nation during the crisis.“With the acquisition of this equipment and with a concrete plan to add some more equipment as per need, we will be able to address not only the quantitative but also the qualitative requirements involved in the testing of body coveralls worn by the frontline health workers and other COVID-19 warriors.”The Textiles Committee is a statutory body established in 1963 through an Act of Parliament and is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Textiles, Government of India.

The government, however, stressed that the mortality rate in India has remained less than half of the global average of 6.65 per cent.The nationwide death toll due to the deadly virus infection has neared 3,500 with a mortality rate of about 3 per cent, while more than 47,000 have recovered so far. At least 15 other countries have recorded more deaths than India so far.However, India’s tally of active cases at over 65,000 is now the fifth largest in the world after the US, Russia, Brazil and France.While India is the 11th worst-hit in terms of the number of overall cases detected so far, some of the 10 most affected countries now have fewer active cases than India and those include Spain, Italy, Germany, Turkey and Iran.In its morning 8 am update, the Union Health Ministry said the death toll due to COVID-19 has risen to 3,435 and the number of confirmed cases to 1,12,359 in the country, registering an increase of 132 deaths and 5,609 cases in the last 24 hours. It put the number of active cases at 63,624 and recoveries at over 45,000.However, a PTI tally of figures announced by different states and union territories, as of 9.30 PM, showed a higher number of confirmed cases at 1,16,295 and the death toll at 3,494. It showed an increase of 5,705 cases and 139 fatalities since Wednesday evening, while recoveries also rose during this period by more than 2,700 to 47,487.More than half of this cumulative number of confirmed cases have been reported since May 8 -- the day when the morning update by the Union Health Ministry had put the number of confirmed cases at 56,342.India reported its first COVID-19 case on January 30, while the 100-mark was reached 45 days later on March 15. However, the 1,000-mark was reached much faster on March 29 and the 10,000-mark was breached on April 13. The 50,000-mark was breached on May 6, while it took less than two weeks for the next 50,000 cases with the one-lakh mark being reached on May 18.Globally, more than 50 lakh people have tested positive for the deadly virus infection since its emergence in China last December, while nearly 3.3 lakh have lost their lives. More than 19 lakh people have recovered so far.The government officials have said that the time taken in India for the case count to move from 100 to one lakh has been much better at 64 days, which was better than many other badly-hit countries and actually double the time taken in the US and Spain.In a statement, the Union Health Ministry said timely case identification and proper clinical management have helped India keep its mortality rate lower.It also said that more than 3,000 people have been cured in the last 24 hours itself and the overall recovery rate is improving continuously and has crossed 40 per cent now.The Ministry said all patients are under active medical supervision, while around 2.94 per cent of all active cases in ICU.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said there has been a 1000-fold increase in the number of COVID-19 tests done per day in the last two months. More than 25 lakh tests have been done so far.A noted public health expert and epidemiologist, however, cautioned that India may witness COVID-19 cases peaking in mid-July if the current lockdown is lifted this month-end, but also hoped that there could be a “lower surge” in the wake of strong containment measures taken in the past two months.“If the lockdown is lifted on May 30, then we will have peak around mid-July because if you take three incubations period, which is one-and-half months, that will be enough for you to know how the disease spreads when nothing is controlled,” Giridhara R Babu, Professor and Head of Life Course Epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India, told PTI.Several states and UTs continued to report new cases, with the national capital itself recording the highest single-day spike of 571 fresh cases to take its total to 11,659. This was the third consecutive day when 500 or more fresh cases have been reported in a day in Delhi. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-covid-19-tally-crosses-1-16-lakh-govt-says-mortality-rate-less-than-half-of-global-average-88009

One of the two degrees, however, has to be through regular mode and the other has to be through online distance learning,” UGC Secretary Rajnish Jain said.He said “an official notification will be issued soon in this regard.”The UGC, last year, had set up a panel headed by its vice-chairman, Bhushan Patwardhan, to examine the issue of pursuing two-degree programmes simultaneously from the same university or different universities either through distance mode, online mode or part-time mode.However, this is not the first time the commission was examining the issue. The UGC had set up a committee in 2012 as well and consultations were held on the same but ultimately the idea was junked.The 2012 committee headed by then Vice Chancellor of the Hyderabad University, Furqan Qamar, had recommended that a student enrolled in a degree programme under regular mode may be allowed to pursue a maximum of one additional degree programme simultaneously under open or distance mode from the same or a different university.“However, two-degree programmes under regular mode may not be allowed simultaneously as it may create logistic, administrative and academic problems. A student pursuing a degree programme under regular mode may be allowed to pursue a maximum of one certificate, diploma, advanced diploma, PG diploma programme simultaneously either in regular or open and distance mode in the same university or from other institutions,” the panel report had then said.According to UGC officials, “the commission had then sought comments of the statutory councils on the committee's report and the responses received did not endorse the idea of allowing students to pursue multiple degree programmes simultaneously. Hence the plan did not take off.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/soon-students-can-pursue-two-degree-courses-simultaneously-through-different-modes-ugc-88003

21-05-2020||Vibha Sharma||India opening up coal sector but 70 pc plants do not meet emission standards, says CSE||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 21While Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has announced major structural reforms for the coal sector, including commercial mining in coal on a revenue-sharing basis, to boost India’s COVID-hit economy, leading environmental NGO Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) claims 70 per cent of coal-fired power stations may not meet environmental norms by the 2022 deadline.Coal-fired power plants are some of the most polluting industries and the sector must meet the environmental norms to ensure ‘the right to breathe in clean air’, says the Centre for Science and Environment.Seeking urgent action, CSE director-general Sunita Narain said the Environment Ministry must issue directions and impose hefty fines on plants which clearly would not meet the 2022 deadline, along with high penalties/closure notices for non-compliant Delhi-NCR airshed plants, at least for peak winter pollution months.“The Environment Ministry should immediately decide regarding the older plants which cannot meet the already lax emission standards. Either they must be retired/refurbished to use alternative fuels or move towards using the plants for biomass gasification or ultra-modern municipal waste processing units. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her 2020 Budget speech, had discussed the need to close these plants,” she added.Notably, India is opening up coal mining to privatisation to revive the economy.However, coal-fired power plants have to meet stringent new emission norms by 2022, set in December 2015, by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC).“The industry tried to first obstruct and prevaricate on the 2015 standards. The deadline for meeting them was moved from 2017 to 2022. But the sector continues to remain in its state of sloth. With barely two years to go before the deadline hits them, almost 70 per cent of the plants will not meet the emission standards,” says the CSE report ‘Coal-based Power Norms: Where do we stand’ released on Thursday.The 2015 standards are in line with global regulations. According to rough estimates, their implementation can cut down emissions of PM by 35 per cent, SO2 by 80 per cent, and NOx by 42 per cent. They can also bring down freshwater use by the industry.The sector, however, has been far from forthcoming in accepting the norms, says the study based on the assessment of the progress in the implementation of environmental norms.Furthermore, there is a little information in the public domain about compliance with PM or NOx standards and certainly, there is no direction to the thermal power plants that they must meet the crucial water standards, which would make this water-guzzling sector more responsible on its usage.With 56 per cent of generation capacity being based on it, coal is the mainstay of India’s power sector. Besides being accountable for emissions of pollutants like SO2 etc, the sector is also extremely water-intensive and is responsible for 70 per cent of total freshwater withdrawal by all industries in the country, according to the CSE.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-opening-up-coal-sector-but-70-pc-plants-do-not-meet-emission-standards-says-cse-87965
21-05-2020||New Delhi||Pension costs rising; Indian Ocean has threats: Defence Secretary||Defence Secretary Dr Ajay Kumar on Thursday said ways are being found to reduce the wage and pension bill at the Ministry of Defence.Separately, while addressing a wider strategic issue, he said the Indian Ocean Region was becoming “a threat” like the South China Sea (SCS).The latter was the obvious unstated reference to China’s recent activities in the Indian Ocean, including building artificial islands near Maldives, and the ongoing tussle in the contested hydro-carbon rich waters of the SCS.He delivered a talk on ‘COVID-19, Resource Crunch and Defence Modernisation’ and later answered questions at a ‘web-seminar’ conducted by the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (MP-IDSA), here.On the Indian Ocean, he was answering questions on ‘blue economy’ euphuism for marine, fishing, minerals and energy, when he said security needs in Indian Ocean will have to be addressed, adding that the means of doing it are best left to experts.On pensions he said expenses rose from some Rs 32,000 crore in few years back to Rs 1,33,000 crore.“We need money for committed expenses… We have to look at ways to reduce pension and wage bill to free money for capital and modernisation,” he said.Possible extension of service (for jawans) which will reduce pension bill and long-term pension liabilities, Dr Kumar said. On budgetary requirements, he said the COVID-19 was a passing phase and said the share of capital procurement—new weapons and equipment — has decreased from 40 per cent of the budget in 2010-11 and is down to 33 per cent.The Finance Commission has been tasked to see how additional resources can be mobilised for defence sector.Reduction of civilian manpower has started, 9,000 posts have been abolished in the Military Engineering Services (MES), he said.“We are examining other civilian areas for reduction,” Dr Kumar said answering a question.“We have not taken any decision to reduce manpower of armed forces, so there is no question of political will,” he said clarifying on being asked if there could be a political fallout of this.The non-salary expenses under the revenue head have grown incrementally and dependence is on import while the transfer of technology items produced in India are costing more than the imported ones, he said.The Lt Gen DB Shekatkar committee suggested reforms and several areas have been identified, he added.“We are looking at outsourcing those activities which can reduce revenue cost without impacting operations,” Dr Kumar said.Military farms are being closed down while outsourcing has been approved for base workshops. In NCC we are intending to send back some 3,000 serving personnel to active duty and employ ex-servicemen, he said.Dr Kumar said, "Our software industry is doing $1.5 to $2 billion dollars of work for foreign manufacturers, this segment of technology needs to be tapped. Land monetisation models exist and that is being looked into to develop housing." On being asked about lateral induction of retiring servicemen into other cadres, the Defence Secretary assured, that the issue was being looked at, how recruitment rules of other cadres will need to be changed for ‘group B and A’ employees.He talked about exports saying the figure jumped from Rs 1500 crore a few years ago to Rs 11,000 crore and 80 per cent of growth came from the private sector.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pension-costs-rising-indian-ocean-has-threats-defence-secretary-87963

He loved Hindustan and its people. He could not see their pain. We have learnt from him to help the weak.”                 Lalan said that Priyanka Gandhi has called upon about 50,000 Congress workers of the state to raise their voices for the labourers through ‘Facebook live’ on Thursday against the “oppression”, as that would be the “proper tribute for Rajiv Gandhi”.

We are developing a protocol to identify the stations where counters can be opened. We have to ensure that there are no large crowds gathering at counters to book tickets, so we are studying the situation and devising a protocol towards it,” Goyal said.“We will also soon announce the resumption of more trains,” he further said during a conversation with his party colleague and BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra.He said the railways which started the Shramik Special trains from May 1 has run 2,050 such trains since then, ferrying around 30 lakh migrants, students and other stranded people.Goyal also praised Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani for their cooperation with the railways in running the Shramik Special trains and criticised West Bengal and Jharkhand for their non-cooperation.He said till date the railways has been able to run only 27 trains in West Bengal and till May 8-May 9, only two trains could reach there. Jharkhand has allowed only 96 trains while Rajasthan has so far received 35 trains, he said.“Even if we asked for permission to run the train, the home minister wrote a letter, even after that a list of 8 trains was received (by West Bengal),” the railway minister said.“I expect all states to allow their people to come to their homes and help us reach them by running trains.”Crediting Prime Minister Narendra Modi for conceptualising the railways’ isolation coaches for coronavirus patients, Goyal said the prime minister had called him to suggest if these coaches can be converted.Railways so far has converted around 5,000 coaches into COVID-care centres which will be deployed at 225 stations.Goyal said the railways has also started bookings for the 100 pairs of special trains with both air conditioned and non-air conditioned services which will begin operations from June 1.He also said within 2.5 hours of opening bookings for the 100 pairs of special trains on Thursday, four lakh passengers had booked tickets.

A large chunk of this, ie, Rs 800-900 crore is owed to the print industry alone," the INS said in an affidavit filed in the top court.The INS said such amounts had been outstanding for several months and there was little prospect of realising the money anytime soon.The affidavit has been filed in response to a PIL by National Alliance of Journalists, Delhi Union of Journalists and Brihanmumbai Union of Journalists seeking directions to media houses not to sack journalists and non-journalists during COVID19 crisis.The Supreme Court had on April 27 asked the Centre, INS and NBA to respond to the PIL which alleged that media houses were using COVID19 lockdown for layoffs and salary cuts.In its affidavit, NBA, too, highlighted the unprecedented financial constraints faced by the TV news industry due to Covid19 pandemic.No measures had been announced by the government so far for news broadcasters even as their businesses were on the brink of collapse, NBA said seeking dismissal of the petition."Other unions are also saying this. The question is if business does not start, how long will they sustain? The issue needs hearing," a Bench of Justice NV Ramana, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice BR Gavai had said last month while hearing the petition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-and-states-owe-rs-1-500-1-800-crore-to-media-houses-ins-tells-sc-87938

21-05-2020||Lucknow||UP sees clashes as migrant returnees denied entry into villages||Clashes are now being reported from several districts as migrants return to their villages.The clashes are mainly due to refusal of villagers in allowing the returnees to stay in their homes vein after completing the quarantine period.In some cases, clashes have been reported from within the families over property issues.Around two dozen cases of clashes have been reported in Prayagraj range alone in the past five days.The highest number of 15 incidents of clashes were reported in the neighbouring Pratapgarh district where one person died and left more than a dozen injured in separate cases.Additional SP (Pratapgarh) Surendra Dwivedi said that there were over a dozen incidents where migrants had clashed either within their family or with other people of the same villages over different issues.He said that majority of the migrants were drivers by profession who had been driving their own taxis or autos for the past one decade."Once they returned to their native village during lockdown, they developed conflicts within their own family over domestic as well as property issues. The verbal disputes took a violent turn and left family members injured. The migrants are also involved in scuffles with people of the same village after they are called 'corona carriers'," he said.In another incident reported from Teunga village in Pratapgarh district, a 32-year old migrant was allegedly killed by a group of nine villagers after they had clashed over petty dispute.Though police claimed to have solved the case with the arrest of five persons but the incident sparked off tension in the village.Inspector General (Prayagraj) K.P. Singh said: "We have issued instructions to all police chiefs in the Prayagraj range to take corrective measures and each police station of the range has been asked to maintain the data and details of the migrants returning  to their native places during the lockdown".He also asked police officials to maintain dispute register at all police stations of the range and act promptly so that a dispute does not turn into a fatal incident. Cops have also been asked to intensify patrolling in identified villages where more  migrants had returned as compared to other areas.

The entire system is likely to go out of hands of common advocates,” BCI alleged, attributing the view to some advocates and bar associations.In a meeting held here on Wednesday, BCI decided to consult state bar councils and bar associations on the resumption of in-person proceedings.The Supreme Court, high courts and district courts have been functioning in a restricted manner via video-conferencing since the beginning of COVID-19 lockdown on March 24 as most of the court premises remained out of bounds for judges, lawyers and litigants alike. The hearings have often been hit by technical glitches making it difficult for all the stakeholders.“On one hand cases of Covid-19 are increasing day by day and on the other, the problems of litigants and advocates are mounting.Litigants are unable to get justice through the process of virtual courts...due to unsatisfactory Wi-Fi and other technical problems which are a common phenomenon. We cannot expect an effective hearing in this process. The public and Advocates are in the dark as to what is really going on in the various courts of the country,” BCI said.It said the reports received from state bar councils and associations will be submitted to Chief Justice of India SA Bobde within a week.Taking note of the difficulties faced by advocates practising in SC, BCI decided to approach the CJI and Justice DY Chandrachud, who heads the E-committee of the top court. A maximum of 5 links should be provided to the advocates of each side who apply for the links in a case, it depended.Without consulting the Bar and without taking the Bar into confidence, if any decision is taken, the same was not going to succeed, BCI said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/litigants-unable-to-get-justice-through-virtual-courts-bci-87925

21-05-2020||New Delhi||New hope for COVID-19 vaccine, clinical trials show promising early results on humans in US||As scientists across the world work frantically to find a vaccine against COVID-19, which continues its rapid global spread, all eyes are on US-based company Moderna's encouraging early results on a small group of healthy volunteers.Cautioning that a vaccine is still months, maybe even a year away, experts said the US-based biotechnology firm‘s results have propelled it to a pole position in the race of 118.Eight candidate vaccines for COVID-19 are in the clinical evaluation, while 110 are in the preclinical stage, according to the WHO's latest draft landscape. Preclinical development is a stage of research during which important feasibility, iterative testing and drug safety data are collected, while clinical trials are research studies performed on people.Early data from its vaccine candidate “mRNA-1273” showed it produced protective antibodies in a group of eight healthy volunteers, Moderna said.The other closely watched COVID-19 vaccine is the one being developed by scientists at Oxford University. It appears protective in a small study of six monkeys, promising findings that led to the start of human trials late last month. “Because Moderna's is the only vaccine having demonstrated any kind of immunologic response in the COVID-19 field, we would consider this to be the leading candidate,” said Michael Breen, associate director, Infectious Disease, at GlobalData, a UK-based data analytics and consulting company.“Of the vaccines in human trials, only two have demonstrated any kind of effectiveness,” Breen told PTI, noting that the Moderna study proves that the platform can lead to the production of antibodies against a given virus.Moderna on Monday announced positive interim clinical data of mRNA-1273, from the Phase 1 study led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).The data comes from eight people who took part in a 45-subject safety trial that kicked off in March.The study showed the vaccine was safe and all study participants produced antibodies against the virus, according to the company.“Globally, one vaccine candidate that is promising is Moderna's mRNA based vaccine that showed promising results in the early trials,” Upasana Ray, assistant professor at CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology in Kolkata, told PTI.RNA is the genetic material of the viruses. While conventional vaccines are developed with an inactivated virus or using proteins made by virus,  messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines work by introducing a synthetic sequence of the viruses' genetic material that encodes the disease-specific protein to trigger the body's immune system, the experts explained.Discussing the Oxford University vaccine, she said the work “deserves applause but needs additional supportive information and experiments”.The preliminary findings of the Oxford study appeared on the preprint server bioRxiv.A preprint is a full draft research paper that is shared publicly before it has been peer reviewed or published in a journal.British drug maker AstraZeneca teamed up with researchers at the Oxford Vaccine Group and the Jenner Institute in developing the vaccine.Breen described their “ChAdOx1 nCoV-19” candidate vaccine as a “standout”. “While this vaccine has yet to demonstrate efficacy in humans, it was shown to be able to prevent infection and disease from COVID-19 in a primate model,” he said.While this needs to be replicated in humans, it is one of only two vaccines to have demonstrated any effectiveness in reducing infection due to COVID-19, making it a “highly interesting candidate”.Though the Moderna and the Oxford vaccines are in a leading position, there are several other vaccines, including those being developed in India,  in the running.In India, eight organisations are in the fray with a vaccine candidate, half of which are companies and the other half non-industry, said Brooke Wilson, associate director, Healthcare, GlobalData.“These organisations are running or planning to initiate 12 clinical trials, one is ongoing, recruiting and the other 11 are planned,” Wilson told PTI.He explained that six of these trials are specifically for a COVID-19 vaccine while the other six trials use a vaccine developed for other indications, such as tuberculosis, adding that the majority of the trials are in Phase I, followed by Phase 3 and Phase 2.Explaining the various phases in the development of a vaccine,  E. Sreekumar, chief scientific officer at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) in Kerala, said Phase 1 trials are small-scale, usually involving few participants, to assess whether the vaccine is safe for humans. Phase 2 trials often involve several hundred subjects, and mainly evaluate the efficacy.      "The final phase involves thousands of people to further assess the efficacy of the vaccine over a defined period of time, and can last several months, Sreekumar said.Breen also mentioned China-based Sinovac Biotech's PiCoVacc vaccine which he said has demonstrated efficacy in non-human primates, similar to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.However, he said Sinovac Biotech does not have the global marketing capabilities of AstraZeneca, which could impact worldwide availability of their vaccine.In another animal trial, researchers from Fudan University in China last week announced that a single dose of a  SARS-CoV-2 simulating particle vaccine induces potent neutralising activities in mice.“These results support further development of ShaCoVacc as a candidate vaccine for COVID-19,” the researchers wrote in a paper that appeared in preprint platform BioRxiv.A vaccine is designed to protect people before they're exposed to a virus -- in this case, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 -- according to the WHO.It basically trains the immune system to recognise and attack the virus when it encounters it, the world health body noted.“Vaccine development involves many steps starting from designing the candidate, mice immunisation studies and neutralising antibody repertoire testing, other animal immunisation trials like in ferrets, human safety checks, human trials of various levels before it is approved for general use,” said Ray       This entire process, she noted, takes at least 12-18 months.“However, the extent of worldwide effort been taken in this area is commendable and promising showing hope of a possible efficient vaccine in near future,'' Ray added.Umashankar Singh, assistant professor, biological engineering, IIT-Gandhinagar told PTI that the number of different approaches employed for COVID-19 are impressive.“My personal understanding is that all of these strategies will yield results that may suit different profiles of recipients and might end up providing immunity, not exclusively though, against different strains of this virus that will emerge, if not there already,” he said.The number of COVID-19 cases globally has crossed  five million  with 3,28,000 fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-hope-for-covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trials-show-promising-early-results-on-humans-in-us-87923
21-05-2020||Washington||Pakistan’s counter-terrorism steps important but not irreversible: US||The Trump administration is pressing Islamabad to take “credible steps” to dismantle the terror groups operating from its soil, a top US diplomat has said, describing Islamabad’s recent counter-terrorism measures like the prosecution and conviction of JuD chief Hafiz Saeed as important but not irreversible.Speaking at an Atlantic Council-organised virtual discussion, Alice Wells, the outgoing Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, also said the US encourages practical steps that India and Pakistan can take to reduce bilateral tensions.She said the recent counter-terrorism steps being undertaken by Pakistan are important but not irreversible.“I don’t turn these steps irreversible, but they’re important steps. Whether it’s the prosecution and conviction of (JuD chief) Hafiz Saeed, the seizure of assets, certainly what we’ve seen on the documentation, better documentation of the economy and we need to keep that focus and work with our international partners,” Wells said at the session held by the Washington DC-based think tank on Wednesday.Participating in the discussion with Richard Verma, the former US Ambassador to India, Wells also said that the Trump administration continues to encourage practical steps for India and Pakistan to reduce tensions.“We certainly support practical steps that India and Pakistan can take to reduce tensions such as restoring the 2003 line of control ceasefire, while continuing of course to press Pakistan to take credible steps to dismantle terrorist groups,” she said.The Indian government led by late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee entered into a border ceasefire agreement with Pakistan along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir on November 26, 2003.The Indo-Pak hyphenation is now found only in history books, she said.Noting that the US considers Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country of 200 million population, as an important partner, she said that the Trump administration is not blind to the cross-cutting issue of terrorism.“The administration has a very strong stance on terrorism. It’s principled approach towards combating non-state actors and the presence of non-state actors has also been a boon in our broader global engagement and certainly in our engagement with India,” she said.The US has continuously asked Pakistan to end its support and safe haven provided to all terrorist groups operating on its soil, whose only goal is to sow chaos, violence, and terror in the region, to terrorist safe havens inside the country.Wells said that what really made it a warning shot across the bow was the international community’s reaction to the Pulwama terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM).Pakistan was under intense global pressure to rein in terrorist outfits operating from its soil after the Pulwama attack in February, 2019.At least 40 CRPF personnel were killed and many injured in one of the deadliest terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir when a JeM suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into their bus in Pulwama district.“There was an escalatory period. It was quite concerning to everyone. But India did not come under criticism for its response. And it didn’t come under criticism by principal allies or partners or friends of Pakistan because there was a deep concern over the fact that a non-state actor was being allowed to, or was able to operate in a fashion that was destabilising to global security,” she said.“So I do think that we are in a different period and we really welcomed these important steps that are being taken by Pakistan. I welcomed the important statements that Prime Minister Khan has issued...Words are not actions, but those are important words,” Wells said.Earlier, she told reporters during a conference call that the suspension of security assistance by President Donald Trump in 2018 marked a fundamental change in the country’s  approach towards Pakistan. “The South Asia strategy made it clear that Pakistan needed to take decisive action against these groups, particularly those who support the conflict in Afghanistan and threaten regional stability,” Wells said. Since then, the United States has seen constructive steps by Pakistan to encourage the Taliban to advance the Afghan peace process, Wells said.“Pakistan has also taken initial steps towards curtailing other terrorist groups that threatened the region such as arresting and prosecuting (terrorists) and beginning to dismantle terrorist financing structures. As Pakistan’s commitment to peace in the region has grown, we’re seeing initial growth in our relationships, particularly in trade,” she added.—PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistans-counter-terrorism-steps-important-but-not-irreversible-us-87919

21-05-2020||Washington||Possibility of US sanctions on India remains on table, says top diplomat||The possibility of US sanctions on India for buying the multi-billion dollar S-400 missile system from Russia remains on the table, a top American diplomat has said, asserting that New Delhi will have to make a strategic commitment to technologies and platforms.In October 2018, India signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, notwithstanding warning from America that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).Last year, India made the first tranche of payment of around USD 800 million to Russia for the missile systems. The S-400 is known as Russia's most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system."CAATSA very much remains a policy priority, certainly for Congress, where you've seen the very strong demand for implementation and concern over the ability of Russia to gain monies from these military sales that will be used to further undermine the sovereignty of neighbouring countries," Alice Wells, the outgoing Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, told a Washington DC-based think-tank on Wednesday.The US had imposed sanctions on Russia under the stringent CAATSA. The law also provides for punitive action against countries purchasing defence hardware from Russia."CAATSA has not moved off the table. Instead of approaching it from a Russian prism though, I think the more important conversation to have is at this level of sophistication and as India is moving to adopt the highest level of technological systems, it really becomes a question of which system do they want to operate within," Wells responded to a question posed by former US Ambassador to India Richard Verma."How do they want their systems to communicate with one another? It's not a mix-and-match arrangement. At certain point, India will have to make sort of a strategic commitment to technologies and platforms and we think we have the best technologies and platforms," Wells said while participating in an Atlantic Council-organised virtual discussion.At the same time, the top US diplomat for South Asia who will retire on May 22 after a 31-year-long career, referred to the growing defence relationship between the two countries."We have also made strides in our defence trade, with the bilateral tally now crossing the 20 billion mark after the President's visit. I think this administration deserves to take credit for making a concerted policy change to offer India our most advanced defence technologies such as armed Unmanned Aerial Vehicle," she said."It's quite remarkable to think that the same missile defence system protecting Washington DC will soon be protecting new Delhi," Wells said.India's growing capabilities as a first responder have also been on display in the Indian Ocean where it has been delivering COVID relief, often using US-origin platforms to dozens of countries."Looking ahead, I'm confident that defence trade and interoperability will continue to grow even though COVID-19-related budgetary challenges may slow the pace," she noted."One area where I think we can exert even more attention is preparing for 21st century threats, especially as the military implications of artificial intelligence, autonomous devices and quantum computing become more pronounced. I'm proud that our maturing relationship has allowed us to develop a new degree of resiliency and self-confidence and that does allow us to navigate differences on issues like trade sanctions and visas," she said.Wells said the US sees India as a global power and understands the country's global interests which it seeks to protect diplomatically, politically, economically, and militarily.The US and India share a vision for an Indo-Pacific order that respects sovereignty and rule of law."India seeks to become, you know, in the words of (External Affairs) Minister Jaishankar a leading power, but one that plays by the rules. We in turn recognise that India is successful, (its) rise contributes to an environment in Asia that serves US interests," she said."So, this strategic meeting of the minds on the Indo-Pacific vision has greatly enhanced how we're able to work together, around the world. It was seen in what was rebranded as the comprehensive global strategic partnership announced earlier this year during President Trump's historic visit to India," Wells said.Jaishankar told US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in June last year that India would go by its national interest while dealing with other countries, including with sanctions-hit Russia from whom New Delhi is procuring S-400 missile defence systems.The personal rapport between President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is clear and it has clearly helped the relationship, she said."Another example is the QUAD, which is well on its way to becoming one of the premier forums of the Indio-Pacific. In just the past year, we held the inaugural QUAD ministerial meeting. We saw QUAD ambassadors meeting regularly in countries across the Pacific and we convened experts meetings on counter-terrorism, cyber issues, and maritime security," she said.The QUAD is also playing a role in their COVID-19 coordination, Wells said.QUAD is an informal strategic dialogue between the US, Japan, Australia and India that is maintained by talks between member countries.

21-05-2020||Kolkata||Cable operators forced to block news channel critical of Mamata||Opposition parties cutting across their political differences have condemned the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government for its alleged action against a TV news channel.The Mamata administration has allegedly put pressure on cable operators to stop airing the Calcutta News (CN) channel because CN had criticised Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.CLP leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, while criticising the state government for coming down heavily on CN, said Mamata Banerjee could not accept criticism. “Criticism is unbearable to her and so cable operators have been asked to stop beaming the CN channel”, Chowdhury said.“Last evening, under sustained administrative pressure, cable networks in & around Kolkata pulled the plug on @calcutta_news, a tv network that was mildly critical of @MamataOfficial govt. I understand there is pressure to do the same to Sadhna News”, Pro-BJP Rajya Sabha member Swapan Dasgupta tweeted.“This sustained attack on news & opinions that are not to TMC’s liking is a feature of this state government that sustains itself on crude propaganda & sycophancy. I will do my utmost to help publications & TV networks maintain their independence in West Bengal”, Dasgupta added in another tweet which was also marked to I&B minister Prakash Javdekar.The state unit of BJP questioned the “dead silence” of Editors Guild of India and said “Most media is afraid to put stories critical of CM. Calcutta News which upheld the voices of dissent is being bullied by the CM and taken off the air!”Fuad Halim of the CPI(M) also criticised Mamata Banerjee for forcing the cable operators to withdraw the channel from air.In the past, Mamata Banerjee had initiated action against people who dared to criticise her on social media. In last October also police arrested a 29-year-old man for allegedly posting “derogatory remarks” against Banerjee on his Facebook page.While the CN channel has been blocked by cable operators, it is still available on DTH networks. The channel beamed a story today on how Mamata has been snapping at CN reporters during news conferences. The channel refused to bow under pressure and promised to remain loyal only to truth.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cable-operators-forced-to-block-news-channel-critical-of-mamata-87897

It has also asked India to open talks with the Taliban considering that it will soon be a part of the governing structure in Kabul.Alice G Wells, US State Department’s top official for Central and South Asia, said there would come a stage when New Delhi would have to do business with the Afghan group. “That government’s (a joint Taliban-Ghani-Abdullah government) relationship with India should be close,” she said.“The border dispute is a reminder that Chinese aggression is not always just rhetorical. So whether it is in South China Sea or whether it is along the border with India, we continue to see provocations and disturbing behaviour by China that raises questions how it seeks to use its growing power,’’ said Wells in a webinar with journalists of the region.This aggressive Chinese behaviour has led to a rallying of like-minded nations in the ASEAN or of US-led diplomatic groupings such as the trilateral with Japan and India or the quadrilateral that includes Australia, said Wells.Accusing China of being extremely self-centered, Wells said this has led to conversations around the world about reinforcing the post-World War II principles of free and open trade that will help lift all boats “including the Chinese boat”.Wells also had harsh words to say about China with respect to Nepal and Pakistan. Calling upon Nepal to accept a $ 500 million US loan to improve roads and electricity transmission, she said this would show that Nepal would not take ‘dictation from China’. Wells said the Covid pandemic had made it incumbent upon China to write-off ‘predatory and unfair’ loans to Pakistan for the China Pakistan Economic Corridor.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/open-talks-with-taliban-us-to-india-87740

Asked if a meeting took place along the LAC, an Army spokesperson said in New Delhi, “No comment is being made on the issue at present.”Sources said the main issue at the north bank of Pangong Tso that China was objecting to was a road constructed by India between one of the eight mountain spurs that end at the lake. Each of the spur is identified as “finger” in military parlance and each ridgeline is separated by 2-5 km.On the intervening night of May 5/6, troops from both the sides clashed, resulting in injuries to many soldiers.India assumes the LAC to be at “finger 4” while China is learnt to be trying to push Indian troops back to “finger 2”, a distance of more than 10 km. Towards the east of “finger 4” is Srijap where pitched battles were fought during the India-China war in October-November 1962.Sino ploy||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-meetings-fail-to-ease-stand-off-87744
