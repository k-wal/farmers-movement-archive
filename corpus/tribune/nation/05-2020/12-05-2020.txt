12-05-2020||Ahmedabad||HC declares Gujarat minister Chudasama’s election as void||The Gujarat High Court on Tuesday declared state minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama’s election in 2017 as void on the grounds of malpractices and manipulation.The returning officer was “hand in gloves” with the BJP leader and postal ballots were rejected illegally, it said.Congress candidate Ashwin Rathod had challenged his BJP rival’s victory from Dholka constituency by a margin of mere 327 votes in the 2017 Gujarat Assembly polls.Justice Paresh Upadhyay also rejected Chudasama’s request for a stay so that he could file an appeal.The high court held that Returning Officer Dhaval Jani “illegally rejected” 429 postal ballots during the counting of votes, while the victory margin was only 327.The procedure adopted for counting of votes was “against the orders of the Election Commission of India (EC)” and illegal, Justice Upadhyay said.Further, Chudasama indulged in “corrupt practice” under section 123 (7) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and was “hand-in-gloves with the then returning officer Dhaval Jani”, the judge said.All three facts materially affected the outcome of the election, it said, declaring it as void.At the same time, the court also rejected petitioner Rathod’s prayer that he be declared as elected from the constituency.Rejecting Chudasama’s request for a stay to the order, the court said an election “cannot be  permitted to hold the field any further” where 429 postal ballots were excluded from counting “behind everybody’s back, including the Observer nominated by the Election Commission,” and election record “systematically manipulated” to conceal this fact.The RO defied relevant orders and instructions of the EC, including mandatory instructions regarding the procedure of counting of votes, announcement of result and preparation of Final Result Sheet ‘Form 20’ to conceal this, the court said.Chudasama is currently the minister for education, law and justice, legislative and parliamentary affairs and some other departments in the Vijay Rupani government.Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel said the decision will be challenged in the Supreme Court.“The order of the Gujarat High Court is shocking for all of us. The order to cancel election of Bhupendrasinhji is sad news. Naturally, Bhupendrasinhji is getting legal advice regarding the order and steps are being taken to appeal against it in the Supreme Court.“We are confident of getting justice and stay on this order,” he said.State Congress president Amit Chavda said Chudasama won by misuse of power and manipulation of government officials, but the court’s order showed that such interference in the election process will not be tolerated.“This is a victory of truth and defeat of the manner in which the BJP misuses power and government officers for its gains. Congress candidate had opposed this election saying votes were rejected because they were in his favour.“But the BJP candidate was somehow declared victorious illegally. After more than two years, the high court finally rejected Bhupendrasinhji’s election, and this clearly showed that the BJP government has always misused power and government officials for its own gains,” Chavda said.

12-05-2020||Gorakhpur||Gorakhpur doctor Kafeel Khan’s detention under NSA extended by 3 months||The authorities, on Tuesday, extended the detention of Dr Kafeel Khan, booked over alleged hate speech under the National Security Act, by another three months.The Gorakhpur doctor has already spent three months in detention at Mathura Jail under the stringent NSA after allegedly making an inflammatory speech on the Aligarh Muslim University campus during the protests there over the Citizenship Amendment Act.“The NSA on Dr Kafeel has been extended up to six months as there is apprehension that his release may lead to law and order problems,” a senior official in Aligarh confirmed.The six months include the three months already spent in detention. The NSA allows preventive detention for up to a year.Kafeel Khan's brother Adil Ahmed Khan questioned the extension.“I am surprised by the NSA extension grounds that Kafeel’s release may lead to unrest,” he said.“With all train and air services discontinued and the university closed, how is it possible that Dr Kafeel goes to the AMU campus and disturbs the peace?”“Does the extension make any sense in the situation of a lockdown,” he asked.Adil Khan also expressed concern over his brother's health, citing reports of coronavirus infection in Agra Jail and the fear of the infection spreading in the “overcrowded” Mathura prison.Kafeel Khan was arrested at Mumbai airport on January 29 in connection with a case registered at Aligarh's Civil Lines police station under section 153-A of the Indian Penal Code.The section relates to promoting enmity between groups over religion and other differences.On February 10, Khan was granted bail by the Allahabad High Court but not immediately released by Mathura Jail authorities. His family then moved court in Aligarh, claiming contempt of the HC order.The court issued a fresh release order on February 13. But before it could be executed, the authorities invoked the NSA against him.The doctor had earlier faced arrest following the deaths of over 60 children in a week at a government hospital in UP's Gorakhpur in 2017.About two years later, a state government probe cleared Khan of all major charges, prompting him to seek an apology from the Yogi Adityanath government.

Whereas, 86,191 samples were tested on Monday," he said.The Centre, states and UTs are taking cohesive efforts to combat the coronavirus and "this provides us the assurance that the country is well-prepared to face any eventuality due to COVID-19", Vardhan added.During the meeting, the Union Health Minister also stressed on ramping up surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI)/Influenza Like Illness (ILI), which would help in identifying any possible hidden infections at an early stage and in its timely containment.He praised the work done for SARI/ILI surveillance and contact-tracing in Uttarakhand.Ladakh stated that it had started mobile medical vans in far-flung areas for non-COVID services. RK Mathur, the LG of Ladakh, said his administration was keeping doctors and police personnel in reserve to deploy on rotational basis.Vardhan pointed out that as the usage of tobacco was fairly high in Ladakh, spitting in public places needed to be banned as per the guidelines issued earlier.Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur said Ayurvedic immunity boosters had been provided to front-line health workers, police personnel and paramilitary forces.Sirmaur district is providing training to barbers and salon operators to prepare them for post-lockdown, said Thakur.The states and UTs were advised to keep adequate stock of essential medicines and timely release of salaries and incentives to boost the morale of front-line health workers.The meeting was also attended by Jammu and Kashmir LG Girish Chandra Murmu and Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat.

The US is accusing China of not being accountable for the spread of the disease all over the world and for hiding the spread of epidemic during the initial days.The leaders also discussed collaboration toward preventing future global health crises, reaffirming the importance of the rules-based international order.The US has been on a publicity binge with its local missions actively pushing steps being taken by Washington’s all over the world. Each missive unfailingly mentions in publicity about its various cooperation initiatives – with Asia Pacific, trans-Atlantic, etc., – that the US is the world’s largest aid giver.China, too, has been upfront in publicising the dispatch of masks, personal protection equipment and medicines to countries around the world. At the same time, it has been extremely proactive in countering insinuations about opaqueness from the US Government as well as in pushing back at suggestions that call for the inclusion of Taiwan in the World Health Assembly general conference.India has refrained from entering the US-China spat till it is able to counter the Covid epidemic, suggest sources.However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already spoken of the need for reforms in the World Health Organisation.  Meanwhile, with US leaders showing the way, the customary face-to-face diplomacy that began with its Special Envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad visiting Qatar, India and Pakistan is set to continue. Pompeo will travel to Israel on Wednesday to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pompeo-dials-jaishankar-others-to-counter-china-83863

12-05-2020||---||IT workers being gradually recalled to work in Telangana||Naveen S GarewalTribune News ServiceHyderabad, May 12While big IT giants like TCS have asked workers to work from home, there are many IT companies that are slowly asking the employees to come back, keeping the COVID-19 protocol in place.From gradual five per cent strength in the first phases the workforce increased to 10-20 per cent currently.Telangana has been one of the first states to extend the lockdown till May 29 and Chief Minister K Chandershekhar Rao (KCR) has minced no words in opposing the Union government’s move to start trains.“We need to implement the lockdown very strictly and make sure no one violates this,” the chief minister told officials during a meeting earlier this week.Despite a strict warning to individuals, the state has offered to extend some relaxations to private companies which undertake to maintain proper norms to prevent the spread of coronavirus. “Many companies are not keen to get employees to office even when the facility of allowing 33 per cent workforce operating from office is given from today onward. Working from home has become the new norm for others. At the end of May some will take a call on whether it is absolutely fine to come to office. Jayesh Ranjan, principal secretary, Information Technology (IT), has said.According to him, “About 50 per cent companies will continue to work from home. In the remaining 50 per cent also, 33 per cent workforce operating from office looks unlikely at this stage. We conducted a survey of about 90 companies few days ago. The findings showed that many of the companies would go up to 10-15 per cent or to a maximum 20 per cent.”He observed that only a handful of companies are ready to go for 33 per cent employees to work from office.Companies and employees are working out transportation plans, evaluating company-organised vehicles and personal vehicles for commute, following social distancing norms. Telangana has issued guidelines to be followed strictly that include staggered timings for login and log out, authorisation letters, restricted movement during curfew hours, following physical distancing norms in office and in vehicles, and no operation of cafeteria and other crowd gathering spots.Strictly following guidelines, about 10 lakh-plus workforces will be gradually getting back to the work, according to government estimates.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/it-workers-being-gradually-recalled-to-work-in-telangana-83857

12-05-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra government to temporarily release 17,000 prisoners||The Maharashtra government had decided to release 17,000 prisoners, on temporary parole, of the total 35,000 inmates lodged across jails in the state to contain the spread of COVID-19, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said on Tuesday.Of these, 5,000 undertrial inmates have already been released.The government’s decision came close on the heels of 185 inmates at the Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai contracting the viral disease, Deshmukh said.Earlier, a high-powered committee appointed by the Maharashtra government decided to temporarily release around 50 per cent of the total prisoners to decongest jails across the state in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.In a video message on Twitter, Deshmukh said, 185 inmates at the Arthur Road Jail contracted COVID-19. They are being treated at present.The state government has now decided to release on temporary parole 17,000 of the 35,000 inmates in jails across Maharashtra to prevent the spread of the disease in other jails.He said that 5,000 undertrial inmates have already been released.Deshmukh said 3,000 and 9,000 inmates, imprisoned for up to seven years and above, respectively, would also be released.He, however, clarified that those convicted in serious cases like that of rape, big financial and bank scams and under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), the Terrorist and the Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), among others, would not be released.The minister reiterated that the government had already “locked down” eight prisons where no entry or exit was being allowed till the COVID-induced curbs were in force.Meanwhile, the government-appointed committee took the decision to temporarily release prisoners to decongest jails across the state in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.The panel, while taking the decision on Monday, said prisoners convicted or booked on serious charges under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and stringent law provisions such as the MCOCA, the UAPA and the PMLA would not be released on temporary bail or parole.The committee, comprising Bombay High Court judge Justice AA Sayed, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Sanjay Chahande and Maharashtra Director General Prisons S N Pandey, was set up after the Supreme Court in March called for decongestion of prisons across the country due to the COVID-19 outbreak.The panel rejected a representation filed by advocate S B Talekar, claiming that the decision to not release prisoners charged or convicted under the Special Acts was discriminatory and arbitrary.It noted that the Supreme Court had left it to the absolute discretion of the committee to determine which class/category of prisoners could be released on temporary bail or parole, depending not only upon the severity of the offence but also the nature of the offence.The committee said prisoners who are not entitled to temporary bail or parole would have to seek regular bail from the courts concerned.

Liquor stores have been allowed to supply Indian Made Foreign Liquor, beer and wine to those holding permits, according to the order issued on Tuesday.According to the excise department’s new rules, delivery personnel have to wear masks and use hand sanitizers at frequent intervals. Liquor stores have also been asked to implement an e-token system under which consumers can be allotted a time slot to collect alcohol from the stores.”It is mandatory for delivery boys to possess medical certificates and identity cards,” an official from the excise department said.Meanwhile, liquor store owners in Mumbai have sought a clarification from the BMC as to whether they would be allowed to open their shops."It is not clear if we are allowed to open our shops or whether we are allowed only home delivery of liquor with our shops closed,” an email sent by the Association of Liquor Vendors to the excise department said.Owners of restaurants and bars in Mumbai too have sought permission to sell their stock as bottles beer held by them are nearing their date of expiry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-maharashtra-permits-home-delivery-of-liquor-83851
12-05-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: Delhi HC expresses concern over home delivery of alcohol||The Delhi High Court has expressed concern over the suggestion relating to home delivery of alcohol through food delivery platforms saying it would be “fraught with security and safety issues”.“The possibility of alcohol being snatched during transit cannot be ruled out. The possibility of home delivery of alcohol, distribution whereof till now is largely in the hands of state, would also increase the possibilities of adulteration of alcohol, also resulting in loss of life.“It appears that transit of alcohol from home to home would have to be in the same manner and style as transit of cash between banks and between banks and ATMs,” a Bench comprising Justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal observed.          The remarks were made by the Bench, which on Monday, also asked the Centre and the Delhi Government, to take a decision “at the earliest” with regard to sale of alcohol and ensuring there is no crowding outside liquor vends during COVID-19 pandemic.It asked them to consider suggestions, like online sale of alcohol, discussed during the hearing of several petitions against the crowding outside liquor vends.The Bench also expressed its displeasure over the conduct of people when the liquor shops were opened during the lockdown and said delivering it to homes through platforms like Zomato “would be fraught with security and safety issues”.Some of the other suggestions that were made during the hearing were opening of all the liquor vends in the national capital, and providing information about available liquor brands at a store to a customer at the time of applying for e-token.Delhi Government standing counsel Ramesh Singh and Central government standing counsel Amit Mahajan told the court they were looking into online sale of liquor and how to implement it, as presently it is not permitted under the Excise law and rules.The Bench said any delay on the part of the Centre and Delhi Government in coming with a solution “can exacerbate the problem of crowding outside liquor shops” and would increase probability of spreading COVID-19 as each day more and more people will come in close contact with each other.“Moreover, it is not as if the problem is of a permanent nature, solution whereof can be devised at leisure. The problem is perhaps of a few days more in as much as once the patrons of alcohol are satisfied that there would be no further closure, the crowding outside liquor shops is likely to disappear,” the high court opined.The Bench asked the Centre and Delhi Government to take a decision at the earliest “so that more damage than has already been done is not caused and so that the decision taken, serves the need of the hour”.During the hearing, Singh told the court that instructions have been issued by Delhi Government to the liquor vends to ensure social distancing by having separate queues for those approaching to purchase liquor along with the e-tokens and those approaching without e-tokens.The Bench, however, was of the opinion that the instructions were issued “without regard to the location and position of the liquor vends”.           “It appears to us that considering the location and position of most of the liquor vends in the city, it is not possible to maintain social distancing as has been prescribed and the instructions stated to have been issued will not serve any purpose and will remain on paper only.“Most of the liquor vends open on and have delivery counter facing the road and do not permit entry of any person therein except the staff deployed for selling.

12-05-2020||Shubhadeep Choudhury                                                                              ||Fighting COVID-19: Peeved with doctors, Didi pens song for cops||Tribune News ServiceKolkata, May 12On International Nurses Day, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has greeted nurses for “selflessly attending to COVID-19 patients” with utter disregard to their personal safety.Incidentally, the accolades for the nurses posted on her Facebook page turns out to be one of the rare instances of the Chief Minister lauding a group of professionals from the medical fraternity for their service at a critical juncture.While governments across the world have been fawning over health workers engaged in fighting the dreaded COVID-19, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has been extremely stingy in this respect.When she decided to shower praise on a group of workers for their service at the time of the pandemic, she chose the police force.Mamata Banerjee has penned verses to say “thank you” to the state police. The verse has been set to tune modelled on a popular song (Jab koi baat bigad jaye…) from Mahesh Bhatt film ‘Jurm’ (1990).Sung by West Bengal’s Information and Cultural Affairs Minister Indranil Sen, an accomplished singer, the song accompanied by footage of various assistance activities by the police during the lockdown, has been posted on the Kolkata Police’s twitter handle.Apparently, various issues raised by doctors from time-to-time in the wake of the pandemic has not gone down well with the Chief Minister resulting in her reluctance to acknowledge the work being done by the doctors, paramedics and other health workers.On Tuesday also, the West Bengal Doctors Forum (WBDF) wrote to Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha drawing his attention to the supply problems of PPE kits and other logistic support to frontline doctors, including resident physicians.The letter, which found its way to the media, also requested Sinha to publish in the daily bulletin the number of healthcare workers infected by COVID-19 and the number of HCWs in quarantine.The WBDF missive followed a press release issued on Monday by junior doctors (Interns) at RG Kar Medical College to “express grievance and concern over the gross mismanagement during COVID-19 pandemic by the administrative authorities”.On Sunday, the Association of Health Service Doctors of West Bengal wrote a stinging letter to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee warning her that the COVID-19 situation in the state might go out of control if appropriate measures were not initiated immediately.The association wrote that COVID hospitals in Kolkata and Howrah were already overflowing with patients. “The critical care unit for serious COVID patients had not been developed in most of the COVID hospitals”, the Association pointed out in the letter.West Bengal has also faced sharp criticism from the Centre for down-playing the figure regarding the number of people who lost their lives owing to the virus infection.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fighting-covid-19-peeved-with-doctors-didi-pens-song-for-cops-83845

"They (owners and drivers of the vehicles) have earned nothing for the last two months. So they are leaving with the families in their own vehicles," said Quadros.The veteran union leader warned that Mumbai would face a severe shortage of taxis and auto-rickshaws once the lockdown was lifted as the migrants may not return to the city in a hurry.The city has more than two lakh licensed auto-rickshaws and taxis. There are also a large number of auto-rickshaws plying on fake license plates in some parts of the city.The number of people thronging the Mumbai-Agra highway has increased as migrants leaving along the route from towns like Nashik, Dhule and Jalgaon are joining the exodus."The number of people on the roads have increased after the Maharashtra government deployed State Transport buses to drop those on the roads till the state borders," sad a Home Department official.Sources here said after hesitating for a few days, the Madhya Pradesh government had now deployed buses to ferry people coming from Maharashtra till the borders of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.Police sources said, the number of people on the roads had increased after messages of buses being organised by Maharashtra and MP governments went viral on social media.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-cabs-choke-highway-to-up-83841

The illegal users of this drug in India had a tendency to import these products from various parts of world, the officials said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-issues-alert-against-possible-drug-trafficking-associated-with-covid-19-shipments-83840

But now he has developed some medical complications, he submitted.Yadav is lodged in a Dehradun jail after being awarded life imprisonment by a CBI Special Court in Dehradun in 2015 in Mahendra Singh Bhati murder case.Bhati—an MLA from Dadri, Ghaziabad—was shot dead at Dadri railway crossing in December 1992.Yadav’s appeal against the conviction and life sentence awarded by CBI Special Court was pending in the Uttarkhand High Court.Besides Yadav, others convicted in the cases were Pal Singh, Karan Yadav and Praneet Bhati.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-cbi-on-dp-yadavs-bail-plea-83839
12-05-2020||London||Case against Nirav Modi very short on proof, his legal team tells UK court||Nirav Modi’s legal team, on Tuesday, told a UK court hearing the fugitive diamond merchant’s five-day extradition trial that the case of fraud and money laundering against him was not backed up with the underlying evidence that proves his dishonesty.Nirav Modi’s legal team made the remarks a day after Crown Prosecution Service barrister Helen Malcolm, appearing on behalf of the Indian authorities, told the court that Modi acquired “eye-watering amounts of money” fraudulently from the Punjab National Bank (PNB).The 49-year-old jeweller is wanted in India on the charges of defrauding PNB by deceitfully obtaining letters of undertaking (LoUs), or bank guarantees, and then laundering the proceeds of the funds through a complex set of worldwide transactions using dummy companies.The five-day extradition trial had opened at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London, on Monday, when the CPS argued on behalf of the Indian authorities to lay out the estimated USD 2-billion fraud and money laundering case against Modi.CPS barrister Malcolm told the court that between 2011 and 2018, Modi had stolen “eye-watering” sums of money under the pretext of importing pearls into India.“The difficulty is that none of this is proved. There is a lot of detail but the government of India’s case is very long on assertion but very short on proof,” said Nirav Modi’s barrister Clare Montgomery, as the defence began its counter-arguments in the case on Tuesday.Modi has been following the court proceedings via video link from a room at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London, where he has been lodged since his arrest in March last year. Dressed in formals, he has been listening intently and can be seen occasionally making notes as he refers to a large folder on a desk.The court has heard repeated references as precedence from liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya’s extradition case, which now awaits a Supreme Court level appeal approval.Modi is expected to be lodged in the same Barrack 12 at Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai where Mallya is to be held following extradition in relation to his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines’ unpaid loans to Indian banks.While the CPS referred to the video and other assurances related to the prison cell already provided as sufficient proof of prison conditions in India meet international human rights requirements, Nirav Modi’s lawyer indicated that they would be presenting a witness to prove that it lacked any provisions in relation to Modi's fragile “mental health condition”.District Judge Samuel Goozee is presiding over the hearing, which is expected to conclude on Friday and is being conducted partly in a remote format to abide by the social distancing norms in place due to the coronavirus pandemic. While some of the legal counsels are physically present in court, the others are accessing the proceedings via video link or through a conference call.On Monday, Malcolm appeared via video link to lay out the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) case against Nirav Modi co-conspiring with bankers at PNB to misuse at least 150 bank guarantees in 2017.She also laid out details of how the diamond merchant and his brother then went on to intimidate witnesses, even threatening them with death, to try and cover up the fraud.Modi has made repeated attempts at bail but remains behind bars as he is deemed a flight risk. The jeweller was arrested on March 19, 2019, on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard on charges of fraud and money laundering brought by the Indian government and certified by the UK Home Office.

12-05-2020||New Delhi||Nearly 50 pc parents with kids below 5 yrs not able to access immunisation during lockdown: CRY||Nearly 50 per cent of parents of children below five years of age have not been able to access immunisation services during the nationwide lockdown imposed in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, says child rights NGO Child Rights and You (CRY).The online perception study conducted by CRY in 22 states and Union Territories of the country also talked about the multiple effects of the pandemic on children.The survey was conducted during the first and the second phase of the lockdown. It is based on responses of about 1,100 parents and primary caregivers from across the country.According to the study, access to immunisation suffered a huge setback across all regions of the country and a whopping 63 per cent of the surveyed households in northern states reported lack of access to immunisation services.Only around half (51 per cent) of parents, who had children below five years of age, were able to access immunisation services during the lockdown, the survey said.“One in every four (27 per cent) of the respondents reported non-accessibility of regular healthcare services for children during the lockdown, with most cases reported from North India (31 per cent), followed by the South (21 per cent). In other regions, lack of access to regular healthcare facilities was experienced by less than 20 per cent of parents,” it said.Even though children had not been the face of this pandemic as they had largely been spared of the direct health effects of COVID-19 so far, findings of the study indicated that they had been among its biggest victims with multiple side-effects on their physical and psycho-social well-being. If access to basic healthcare for children was at bay, their access to education was affected equally during the lockdown days, the survey said.Three in every four (77 per cent) of the respondents had reported that the lockdown had affected education and learning. This was again the highest again in North India (87 per cent) and the least in West India (56 per cent), it said.While 60 per cent of the parents/primary caregivers pointed out that among the regular activities for children affected were their extra-curricular opportunities; 60 per cent believed that children’s friendships and social lives were affected; and almost an equal section (59 per cent) perceived that their outdoor games and recreational opportunities were majorly compromised, the survey found.More importantly, according to 37 per cent of the respondents, children’s psychological well-being and happiness had definitely been affected during this phase. This was most reported from the eastern states (51 per cent), the survey said.A majority (88 per cent) of the respondents reported an increase in their children’s exposure to online activities (screen time), amongst which 45 per cent reported the increase to a great extent.  Region-wise, in South, North, and West, around 40 per cent of the respondents reported that the screen time for children have increased considerably, it said.Only 43 per cent of the parents reported about being able to watch their children's online activity continuously. This was the highest in the West (68 per cent), followed by East (50 per cent). More than half of the respondents (52 per cent) reported about the provision of supervised access to the Internet for their children.  One in every five respondents (22 per cent) reported about taking no measures to protect their children when online. This was most reported from North (25 per cent), the survey said.The findings of the study were made public through a webinar which included a session where eminent experts shared their insightful views and valuable opinions. Explaining the objective behind the study, Puja Marwaha, CEO, CRY said, “In a country where 40 per cent of the total population are children, and the budget allocated for them is just a little over 3 per cent of the entire budget outlay, it is but obvious that they do not feature as the topmost topic of discussion while the country battles a pandemic.”“However, this most vulnerable section of the society has been one of the worst affected by the side effects of COVID-19. To be able to address this, and to be better prepared to support the marginalised children of the country during and after the lockdown, we conducted the online survey in 23 states and Union Territories to understand how the ‘lockdown days' have affected their physical and mental health, nutrition, education, protection and online security issues,” she added.

12-05-2020||New Delhi||India needs basic income scheme to make lockdown work: French economist||India needs to come out with a basic income scheme to make the lockdown work, noted French economist Thomas Piketty said on Tuesday.He also said India had the potential to become the global democratic leader of the 21st century if it managed to address the issue of inequality.The government has imposed lockdown from March 25 to curb the spread of COVID-19 and since then extended the restrictions twice.“I think the government would be well advised to introduce a basic income scheme, and more generally to develop a safety net in India. I do not see how a lockdown can work without a system of income maintenance,” Piketty said.Interestingly, the idea of universal basic income was mooted in the Economic Survey 2016-17 by the then chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian, and there was a discussion last year during the electoral campaign to introduce a basic income in India.Piketty also pitched for more equitable and progressive taxation including a wealth tax and inheritance tax in India.“India has the potential to become the global democratic leader of the 21st century, assuming the country manages to come to terms with its legacy of inequality,” the eminent economist emphasised.“The attention that was put to the reservation system was not matched by sufficient attention to other issues, including land reform and the redistribution of property, and the funding of adequate education, infrastructure and health investment through a more equitable and progressive tax system (including a wealth tax and inheritance tax),” Thomas Piketty said.Piketty, who recently wrote a book ‘Capital and Ideology’, noted that a pandemic like COVID-19 could have contradictory effects on inequality.“On the one hand, it can raise the legitimacy of public investment in health, infrastructure and education. But on the other hand, it can also raise the fear of strangers and reinforce the pre-existing trends toward sectarian conflicts,” he said.Before the pandemic, Piketty said the trend toward sectarian conflict reflected the lack of political ambition to change the economic system and to put in place a system that was truly based on economic justice.“This will be even more true after the pandemic: we need to think again about how to reconcile prosperity and equality,” he said, adding that in his book, he explored the possibility of a system based upon educational justice and participatory socialism, involving private property for all and the permanent circulation of wealth and power.Asked how the COVID-19 pandemic will impact India’s rising inequality, Piketty said the experience of the Spanish flu of 1918-20 was frightening.“According to some studies, mortality rates were as large as five per cent in India or Indonesia, as compared to 0.5 to one per cent in Western Europe and the United States (which was already very high). It seems unlikely that things can get so bad today, but this means that we have to be very careful,” Piketty, who is currently a professor at Paris School of Economics, said.The French economist, who has worked extensively on issues such as inequality and poverty, said by looking at a broader range of historical trajectories, he had also come to stress the key role of ideological and political change in the evolution of inequality.“The main determinants of inequality are not economic and technological: they are ideological and political,” he argued.Piketty’s previous book ‘Capital in the Twenty-First Century’ became the best-selling work in the history of the Harvard University Press and made him a household name.

12-05-2020||New Delhi||Immediate spike likely in inter-city mobility after train, bus services resume operations: Study||An immediate spike in the inter-city travel is expected within two weeks of resumption of train and bus services as many people, who are stuck in different cities, will look for an opportunity to return to their bases, according to a survey by IntrCity RailYatri.However, the inter-city mobility industry in India, which was in an expansion mode, has been slowed down by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the survey by the multi-modal intercity mobility platform, covering more than 20,000 users across metros, tier-1 and tier-2 cities.Interestingly, as many as 38.41 per cent of travellers indicated that they would consider travelling this year if the pandemic had been effectively controlled.Leisure travel would take the biggest hit with a sharp drop of 71 per cent in planned holidays and festive travel. Only 29 per cent of the respondents plan to travel this year for social or festive occasions.“An immediate spike is expected in inter-city mobility in the immediate zero to two weeks period once trains and inter-city buses start to operate. People are looking for an opportunity to return to their base,” the survey said.A high (30 per cent) number of travellers are stuck in the wrong city as the lockdown took many Indians by surprise, it added.According to the survey, social distancing will drive near-total shift from offline to online bookings.“Despite strong and persistent efforts by online brands, offline bookings have historically dominated in India. This finally looks set to change and is a big opportunity for online brands,” it said, adding the biggest impact would be on bus bookings, specifically on ‘last-minute’ sales by agents and touts at popular boarding-points.When it comes to the preferred mode of travel, tourists are unlikely to change their choice in the post-COVID-19 era.“Upon asking which mode of transport best addresses ‘social distancing'’ – most travellers prefer to stick to their original preference of bus or train. However, this ‘bias’ is significantly more pronounced in bus and train travellers, as compared to flight travellers,” it said.Flight travellers were the most pessimistic in comparison to those by train and bus. Domestic flyers constituted the most nervous cohort, followed by train and bus, it added.“Over 50 per cent of travellers who prefer travelling by sleeper bus or train are far more confident about travelling within the next three months. Therefore, train and bus travellers displayed a far greater sense of optimism as regards to resuming their inter-city travel,” the survey added.Despite India experiencing one of the most severe lockdowns in the world, the overall travel sentiment was biased towards optimism of things becoming normal again, it added.However, the inter-city mobility industry in India will require to put in place innovations, diversification and safety measures to meet with challenges.“How soon we will recover from the crisis will depend upon the extent of ‘safe-zone travel’ and ‘safe destinations’ and the ability to transform and innovate within the industry and adjust to travellers ‘new’ expectations,” it said.

12-05-2020||Lucknow||Plasma donation by singer Kanika Kapoor not happening now||A fortnight after Bollywood singer Kanika Kapoor offered to donate plasma for the treatment of other COVID-19 patients, the idea has fizzled out.A doctor at King George’s Medical University (KGMU) here said they cannot use the plasma because of her family’s medical history.The singer faces a police case after allegedly hiding her COVID-19 status.Plasma therapy, still at the trial stage for treating those infected with coronavirus, involves transfusion of plasma extracted from the blood of a recovered COVID-19 patient to someone suffering from it.On April 27, Kapoor had expressed a desire to donate plasma for treating other patients, doctors said.A blood test cleared her for the procedure. Later, she mentioned her family’s medical history and asked doctors if she was a fit case for plasma donation, they said.Doctors said she did not refuse to donate plasma but now they are also reluctant to accept it because of her family’s medical history.“Information about family history cannot be shared with the media as it is against medical ethics,” Dr Tulika Chandra, Head of Department of Transfusion Medicine at KGMU, told PTI.“Kanika Kapoor’s plasma cannot be taken for the treatment of a COVID-19 patient, but taking her plasma for research can be considered,” she said.“If in future her plasma is needed for research, it could be considered,” she added.Despite repeated attempts, Kapoor could not be contacted for comment.Five recovered patients have donated plasma at KGMU so far, a doctor said.The singer tested positive for coronavirus on March 20 and faced a controversy over whether she should have gone into self-quarantine following her return from a trip abroad.She was booked for negligence and committing acts likely to spread the infection after she attended at least three gatherings in Lucknow, according to police.One of the parties was also attended by former Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and her son Dushyant Singh. They later went into self-quarantine.The singer had denied the charge that she put anybody at possible risk.In a statement on April 26, Kapoor said she was aware of “several versions” about her diagnosis, but “negativity thrown at a person does not change the reality”.She said some of these stories were fuelled by her silence till then and the truth will eventually prevail.

12-05-2020||Lucknow||Lockdown: Two migrants die in road accidents in UP||After having travelled 1,300 km in an auto rickshaw from Maharashtra, a woman and her 6-year old daughter were killed in an accident when a truck hit them on Tuesday just 230 km short of their destination in Jaunpur in eastern Uttar Pradesh.Sanju Yadav and her daughter Nandini were part of a group that was travelling from Thane in an auto rickshaw for the last three days when they met with the accident in Fatehpur district.Despite the state government asking migrants not to walk or cycle down, they flock the highway and make the treacherous journey home, too despondent to wait any longer.Spurred by lack of resources at a time of an unprecedented lockdown called to slow the spread of coronavirus, many migrants brave not just the virus but the length of the journey---all in an attempt to get back home.Take the example of 25-year-old Shiv Kumar Das.A migrant, Das was killed when a car knocked him down when he cycling down from Bulandshahr in western Uttar Pradesh to Bihar.The car’s brakes reportedly failed, killing the cyclist. The driver of the car was also injured in the accident.Earlier on Monday, two migrants travelling in a truck to reach their village in Maharajganj in Uttar Pradesh were killed when the truck met with an accident.On May 9, 24-year old Sagheer Ansari, who worked as a tailor in Delhi was mowed down on the divider of the highway in Lucknow as he was eating a sparse meal of flattened rice. He along with his group mates, including his cousin had cycled down 500 km and had another 474 km to cover to reach home in Motihari in Bihar, where his wife and three children were waiting for him.After post mortem, his body was sent to village in an ambulance late on Saturday.On May 7, a couple started on cycle from a slum in Lucknow to their native village in Chhattisgarh---a distance of 700 km.When they had barely made it out of town, they became victims of a hit-and-run accident. Both died on the spot, leaving a 4-year-old son and one-and-a half-year old daughter.Experts believe that the number of migrants who die while making their journey could be higher---some of sheer exhaustion of the journey and some in road accidents.Experts also believe many of such cases go unreported, making it difficult to document just how many such incidents have really happened.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-two-migrants-die-in-road-accidents-in-up-83822
12-05-2020||New Delhi||Kejriwal seeks people’s suggestion on lockdown strategy beyond May 17||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Tuesday sought suggestions from people on how to ease the curbs after May 17, but made it clear that lockdown cannot be lifted completely given that the city was recording a high number of coronavirus cases daily.The chief minister said that his government will send a proposal on lockdown relaxations for Delhi to the Centre on Thursday after discussing the suggestions with experts and doctors.People can send their suggestions by calling toll-free number 1031 or through WhatsApp number 8800007722, or by sending an e-mail to delhicm.suggestions@gmail.com by 5 pm Wednesday.“On one hand, we will have to save ourselves from coronavirus. But on other, we will also have to maintain the health of economy,” Kejriwal told an online media briefing.“I seek suggestions from the people of Delhi. Obviously, lockdown cannot be lifted completely from the city given the spike in cases of COVID-19,” he said.Delhi recorded 13 fresh deaths due to COVID-19, the highest single-day spike in coronavirus fatalities for the city, authorities said on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the total number of cases rose by 406 to reach 7,639.“I want to ask whether there should be relaxations in lockdown (post May 17). How much relaxations should be given and in which areas?” the chief minister sought to know from Delhiites.He also asked whether buses, metro, taxis and auto-rickshaw should now be allowed to operate in Delhi and if schools, markets and industrial areas should be opened after May 17, when the lockdown 3.0 ends.He said it was clear that social-distancing norms will have to be strictly followed post-May 17, and wearing masks for everyone in the city will be compulsory.“I know that many people have been facing difficulties due to lockdown. People should send their suggestions by 5 pm on Wednesday,” the CM said.Barring COVID containment zones, economic activities should be allowed to resume in the national capital, Kejriwal had told Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a meeting with chief ministers.During the media briefing on Tuesday, he said the Central government has asked all states to submit by May 15 their proposal on lockdown relaxations.The Delhi government has already demanded from the Centre that all 11 districts of the city not be treated as “red zones” so that more economic activities are allowed, the sources said.They said the city government wants that “red zones” in Delhi to be identified as per municipal wards instead of districts, they said.Recently, the Union Health Ministry classified the entire national capital, which has 11 districts, as red zone. The city has 272 wards. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kejriwal-seeks-peoples-suggestion-on-lockdown-strategy-beyond-may-17-83817
12-05-2020||New Delhi||India, China locked in tense military stand-off in eastern Ladakh||Fully-armed troops of Indian and Chinese armies are at present locked in a tense stand-off in Eastern Ladakh, indicating that the clash on the night intervening May 5 and 6 between the two sides is still simmering.Troops of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China are holding ground at a position on the north-bank of Pangong Tso Lake. Some 80-100 troops form what is the “front” for the stand-off of each country.  This is just a few hundred metres away from the spot where troops of both sides clashed in the small hours of May 6, and even pelted each other with stones resulting in injuries to several people on either side.   Some 1,200 troops are in a back-up location of China. India has reinforced its position militarily, sources said, asking for the exact numbers to be avoided.The Indian troops are at a location India perceives as its own territory along the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC). The Chinese dispute Indian claims at this particular location and their troops are stationed just across. The Chinese do not have a post at this location. They normally come for patrol and return.Sources said the matter had been ‘bubbling’ since February when the PLA stopped an Indian patrol at a location called “Finger 2” on the north bank of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial melt lake which straddles India and China, at an altitude of 13,000 feet.“Finger 2’ is not disputed, and is held by India. A fully-paved Indian road exists in the place. The movement of the Chinese in this area was a red-herring for the Northern Command.India retaliated and stopped Chinese patrol at locations much ahead, or eastwards, of “Finger 2’. Since the perception of LAC varies the patrolling parties of either country stop the other one and ask to return. There is a laid-down protocol on such interactions and both parties are expected to return.During the stand-off, the Indian Air Force was asked to fly in a pair of Sukhoi30 MKI after helicopters of China were seen flying on their side. As per existing arrangements, fighter jets maintain a certain distance from the LAC.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-locked-in-tense-military-stand-off-in-eastern-ladakh-83815

12-05-2020||New Delhi||US’ CDC commits $3.6 million to India’s COVID-19 fight||The US’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has committed $3.6 million to assist India’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the aid will support prevention, preparedness and response activities.The funds would also be used to support the development of Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) centres of excellence that can improve the ability of hospital networks to detect COVID-19 and strengthen local health systems through enhanced surveillance and monitoring systems, a US Embassy statement said.The CDC is the national public health institute of the United States. It is a federal agency under the US’ Department of Health and Human Services.“This initial tranche of funding will seek to further strengthen and support the Indian government’s efforts to increase laboratory capacity for SARS-COV-2 testing, including molecular diagnostics and serology,” the embassy said.The CDC will work with local partners to assist in the development of a strong public health workforce to support India's capacity to respond not only to the COVID-19 pandemic but to future threats as well.The scope of support will include planning for health emergency operations centres to further strengthen public health emergency management capacities.The CDC India programme will provide technical assistance for the Indian government’s ongoing crisis emergency and risk communication efforts.Since early January, the CDC’s India office had been collaborating with sub-national and national government institutes to support the COVID-19 response in the country, the statement said.Collaboration efforts are focused on lab strengthening, infection prevention and control, health workforce development, emergency management, risk communication and community engagement.The CDC has conducted trainings across India for healthcare administrators, physicians, nurses, and hospital staff on preparedness and response, infection prevention and control, laboratory operations, and field epidemiology to equip frontline response workers with the necessary skills to collect, analyse and interpret data, and contribute to evidence-based decisions.The goal of the CDC’s global health response to COVID-19 was to limit human-to-human transmission and minimise the impact of COVID-19 through partnerships with key country and non-governmental partners to mitigate vulnerabilities and gaps in preparedness, the US Embassy said.The CDC has a long-standing relationship and technical collaboration with the Indian government's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to control HIV, TB, and malaria, eradicate polio, and prepare responses to influenza and other pandemic diseases.“Over the past two decades, this partnership has received support at the highest levels of the two governments and has deepened mutual cooperation through the exchange of scientific knowledge, expertise, and technology, and the development of institutional and human capacities for addressing these health goals,” the US Embassy said.These previous investments to improve health security had laid the foundation for rapidly and effectively preparing for emerging threats, including the current coronavirus outbreak, it said.For decades, the United States has been the world’s largest provider of bilateral assistance in public health, the statement said.In India, US government agencies, including the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention, and other Department of Health and Human Services agencies, had provided more than $1.4 billion in health assistance and nearly $2.8 billion in total assistance over the last 20 years, it said.

On restarting manufacturing activities at Gurugram facility, he said "it will start, but not yet".On April 22, the Haryana government had granted permission to the auto major to restart its Manesar manufacturing facility, but the company had said it will resume operations only when it can maintain continuous production and sell vehicles, "which is not possible at this point of time".The Gurugram district administration had allowed the auto major to run the facility on a single shift basis, while fixing the total number of employees at the plant at 4,696.MSI's Manesar plant is outside the limits of Gurugram Municipal Corporation, while its Gurugram plant falls within the city limits.The two plants in Haryana have an installed capacity to roll out 15.5 lakh units per annum.When asked how the lockdown would impact industry sales this fiscal, Bhargava said that in current circumstances it was too early to forecast.He, however, pointed that cars in the country were among most highly taxed in the world."I have always held that cars are too heavily taxed in India by both the central government as well by the as state governments... The result is that carmakers in India pay much higher taxes than in most other developed parts of world," he noted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maruti-resumes-operations-at-manesar-plant-83788

It is mandatory for passengers to download Aarogya Setu app in their mobile phones, before commencing their journey," the tweet said.Sources said it was made mandatory after a Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) missive, following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with chief ministers.Passengers, who do not have the app installed on their mobile phones, might be asked to do so after their arrival at the station, they added.However, there is no clarity yet on if and how the app will be enforced, officials said, as the Supreme Court, in a directive, has said making it mandatory is illegal.The Aarogya Setu app has been installed on 9.8 crore smartphones so far and is used by the government for contact-tracing and disseminating medical advisories to users in order to contain the spread of COVID-19.The MHA has also said installing the mobile app will be a must for those living in the COVID-19 containment zones.

Honourable Prime Minister you know this, you have been a Chief Minister of a state yourself. All states must get their due respect,” Banerjee told the PM on Monday evening during a video conference the PM had with all the CMs to discuss the coronavirus-induced lockdown.The points raised by Banerjee in the meeting were made available to the media by the Trinamool Congress through a press release. Evidently, the West Bengal CM, who received a number of missives from the Central Government in recent days accusing her of not trying hard enough to contain the pandemic, fired several salvos at PM Modi.Why were the Central Government’s letters written to her with “rampant accusations” leaked to the media, the CM asked the PM. Mentioning the Union Home Minister by name, Banerjee asked why Amit Shah should leak to the press the letter written to her about the Shramik special trains?“After it was out in the news, people were asking me. What am I supposed to do? Why don’t you speak to us directly? I request this must not happen to other states,” she told the PM.The Chief Minister asked the PM to “trust” the states and not call meetings after important decisions were taken by him already. “Then what is the point of the meeting?” she remarked.“We all know this virus has come from outside India. Yet, when we are not pointing fingers at any other country, why are we pointing fingers at our own states and our own people,” the press release quoted Banerjee as having said this to the Prime Minister during the video conference.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bengal-cm-mamata-banerjee-tells-pm-modi-to-show-respect-to-states-83781

The latter has not just been highlighted by prominent members of the community in the Arab World but also by the party’s ideological fountainhead, the RSS.It is believed that only after RSS Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat said that an entire community should not be vilified for the mistakes of a few, apparently referring to the Tablighi Jamaat incident, in his address to the cadres on April 26 that regular attacks by BJP spokespersons in television debates against the community toned down.Also the focus shifted to the big humanitarian crisis unfolding across the country in the form of heart-wrenching visuals of migrants walking on roads and railway tracks to return homes, some also losing their lives in accidents in the process. The RSS has not said anything openly on the issue so far but affiliate BMS has been quite vocal about attempts to change the labour laws by BJP-run Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.Observers say the saffron party and the government may try to “divert” attention by holding individual state governments responsible for their residents, but the decision of the lockdown, much like the controversial demonetisation, will always belong to and will be identified with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The migrant crisis has dented Prime Minister Modi’s carefully crafted image of someone coming from a humble background, which the BJP successfully used to woo economically weaker sections and win many political battles in the past seven years. Observers add that it also left the society "sharply divided" into two sections — the middle/affluent and the economically weaker.“The economically weaker section, especially in the Hindi heartland, has been most committed to the BJP ever since Modi, someone whom they believed to be their own, came to power. No one can predict the future and the next general elections are four years away but currently the stock of his government is down on two accounts, handling of the migrants issue and the systematic targeting of Muslims during the lockdown,” says political analyst Sudheer Panwar.Though several fact-checking platforms and researchers have compiled fake videos against Muslims and attacks prompted by online abuse, apparently a report by a think tank of the Home Ministry headed by Amit Shah has also red-flagged targeting of minorities over the Covid pandemic.Recently, a study, ‘Temporal Patterns in COVID-19 misinformation in India’, at the University of Michigan also pointed towards “a rise in the number of debunked misinformation, especially following the third week of March” when the discourse dominated by “discussions of a possible lockdown and about infections” gradually “changed to Muslims and religion more significantly”.“From our data we found that news sources ranging from less widely consumed, regional digital news to heavily engaged national news have been complicit in spreading misinformation,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-on-backfoot-on-migrants-issue-and-fake-news-targeting-minorities-83777

They were coming from Hyderabad.In the letter, Bhalla also referred to the meeting chaired by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba on Sunday. “In the meeting, the situation of migrant workers walking on roads and railway tracks was noted with great concern,” he said in the letter. If migrants are found in such a condition, they should be appropriately counseled, taken to nearby shelters and provided with food, water, etc., till they are facilitated to board Shramik Special trains or buses to their native places, Bhalla said, while urging that the states should allow receiving of all Shramik Special trains “without any hindrance”.Over 100 trains to run daily for migrantsOfficials of the MHA, during a videoconference with nodal officers of the states and UTs on Monday, said migrant labour should be reassured that sufficient number of trains would be run for travel of all those wishing to go home.

However, the Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson here suggested that a path already being used by pilgrims was blacktopped to benefit a wider cross-section of society, including traders and locals.Pressure had mounted on the Nepal Government after its MPs called for action over the inauguration of the road. Nepal Communist Party co-chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, locked in a power tussle with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, urged Nepal to go beyond diplomatic means in settling the border dispute.Nepal played down the summoning, describing it as a “meeting”, and chose to record its divergence with the Indian stand not by a “protest note” or “demarche” but through a diplomatic note. In its initial reaction on Saturday too, Nepal was conciliatory by suggesting talks between Foreign Secretaries Harsh Vardhan Shringla and Shankar Das Bairagi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-summons-indian-envoy-over-border-row-83652
