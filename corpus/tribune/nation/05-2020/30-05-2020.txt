30-05-2020||New Delhi||Talks at military, diplomatic levels on to resolve standoff: Rajnath||As Indian and Chinese troops remain engaged in a tense border standoff, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday asserted that the government would not allow India's pride to be hurt under any circumstances even as he said bilateral talks were on at military and diplomatic levels to resolve the row.Singh also said he conveyed to US Defence Secretary Mark T Esper during a telephonic conversation on Friday that India and China had an existing mechanisms to resolve "problems" through talks at diplomatic and military levels.In the midst of the flare-ups between Indian and Chinese armies, US President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was "ready, willing and able to mediate" between the two countries. He reiterated the offer on Thursday as well.The Ministry of External Affairs indirectly rejected the offer two days ago, but Singh became the first Central minister to speak on India's position on the issue with clarity."I spoke to the US Defence Secretary yesterday. I told him that we have developed a mechanism already under which any problem between India and China are resolved through military and diplomatic dialogue," said Singh.He was replying to a question on whether India ruled out any third-party mediation in resolving the border row with China.The Defence Minister said efforts were on to resolve the border row in eastern Ladakh."I want to assure the country that we will not allow India's pride to be hurt under any circumstances. India has been following a clear policy of maintaining good relationship with neighbouring countries and it is not a new approach. We have been following it for long. At times, situation arises with China. It has happened before," he said.Singh noted that China had also said that it wanted to resolve the border issue through diplomatic dialogue."It has been India's effort to ensure that the tension does not escalate. It should be resolved through talks at military and diplomatic levels. Negotiations are ongoing between the two countries at the military and diplomatic levels," he said.Troops of India and China were engaged in the standoff for over three weeks in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie in eastern Ladakh.The trigger for the face-off was China's stiff opposition to India laying a key road in the Finger area around the Pangong Tso Lake besides construction of another road connecting the Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie road in Galwan Valley.Military sources said China was also laying a road in the Finger area which was not acceptable to India.The sources said military reinforcements, including troops, vehicles and artillery guns were sent to eastern Ladakh by the Indian Army to shore up its presence in the areas where Chinese soldiers were resorting to aggressive posturing.       The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on the evening of May 5 which spilled over to the next day before the two sides agreed to "disengage".However, the standoff continued.The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.The troops of India and China were engaged in a 73-day stand-off in Doklam tri-junction in 2017 which even triggered fears of a war between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long LAC. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it.Both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.

Many of them have tested positive for the virus and need to be relieved,” a home department source said.So far, the Centre has dispatched ten companies drawn from the Central Industrial Security Forces, the Central Reserve Police Forces and the Rapid Action Force.According to officials, five companies of the CAPF have been deployed in Mumbai alone while the rest have been stationed in Nagpur, Nashik, Aurangabad and Amravati.“There is a requirement for at least another five companies of CAPF personnel in Mumbai alone, but it is not clear whether we will get them,” the official said.The Mumbai police personnel above the age of 55, and those with medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, have been asked to stay at home.According to the state police department, as many as 2,325 personnel have so far contracted the virus, with more than 100 of them testing positive every day for the past few days.A total of 26 police personnel has, so far, succumbed to the virus.

30-05-2020||New Delhi||57 pc worried of high-priced COVID-19 treatment in India’s pvt hospitals: Survey||Around 57 per cent of respondents expressed concern about exorbitant charges for COVID-19 treatment at private hospitals, while 46 per cent fear of contracting a secondary infection in a government facility, a survey said.The survey conducted by LocalCircles, a community social media platform, received around 40,000 responses on five questions related to public perception of government and private hospitals for COVID-19 treatment.It also said 61 per cent of respondents want the government to fix a price cap or standardise coronavirus treatment related room charges in private hospitals.According to the survey, 46 per cent of people expressed concern over catching secondary infection due to crowd and poor adherence to infection prevention control standards in hospitals, while 32 per cent highlighted the lack of adequate medical infrastructure, as their topmost concern regarding COVID-19 treatment available in the country. It said 16 per cent of people pointed at long waiting time and inefficiencies as major issues.On being asked where would they prefer to go for treatment if they contracted the disease, 32 per cent of respondents said they would prefer a private hospital.While, 22 per cent said they would want to go to a government hospital, 32 per cent of respondents did not want to go to a hospital, the survey said, adding 14 per cent were unsure about it.When the country started reporting a surge in COVID-19 cases, government hospitals were initially designated to treat such cases. The treatment for the same was made available in private hospitals later.According to the survey, in Red Zones, especially the high virus load districts, many people expressed concern over limited capacity in private hospitals and long waiting time for admission in government facilities for COVID-19 treatment. “That explains why 32 per cent citizens say they would rather stay home and take treatment at home and not go to the hospitals unless it is an emergency situation,” Akshay Gupta, General Manager, LocalCircles said.On the COVID-19 treatment available in private hospitals, 57 per cent of the respondents said exorbitant charges in such facilities was their topmost concern.Additionally, unnecessary tests, lack of knowledge of COVID-19 treatment protocols and difficulty in getting admission were other major concerns expressed by 26 per cent of respondents. “Even today, many private hospitals, especially in smaller towns, do not break up the charges of rooms, consumables and services, and it is offered as a single package. “According to the respondents (of the survey), given that COVID-19 is already having a major economic impact on people’s lives, most cannot sustain the high cost of treatment. Therefore, need of the hour is for the central and state governments to cap the treatment charges or at least standardise them based on hospital categories or ratings,” Gupta said.He added that the findings of the survey would be submitted to the Union health ministry so that action can be taken against the concerns raised by people. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/57-pc-worried-of-high-priced-covid-19-treatment-in-indias-pvt-hospitals-survey-92066

A thriving economy under the UPA has been completely destroyed by the NDA,” Gehlot said.“Under Modi ji, the democratic, liberal ethos of India as an inclusive society has been completely undermined. The NDA is tampering with the autonomy of institutions, the PSUs are being sold and communal harmony is being disrupted with a divisive agenda. Instead of taking the nation forward, the NDA government is taking it backwards,” Gehlot further accused. “Modi 2.0 would be remembered as the time when lakhs of people lost everything and faced unbearable hardships during the lockdown. The government has remained a mute spectator to the sufferings of the people. The nation saw the most insensitive government least bothered about the lives or livelihood of crores of Indians,” he elaborated.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-anniversary-the-worst-for-common-people-rajasthan-cm-92064

30-05-2020||New Delhi||CRPF forms committee to plan better distancing in barracks, toilets used by jawans||The Central Reserve Police Force has constituted a committee of its senior officers to find better ways of ensuring social distancing in barracks and toilets used by jawans to check the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in its camps, officials said on Saturday.They said the recent spread of the infection to about 140 personnel living in the 31st battalion of the country’s largest paramilitary in Delhi’s Mayur Vihar and a few other such instances had led to the decision of finding innovative ways to combat the new challenge of keeping the force “combat-ready amid the enhanced level of physical distance between troops.”Almost all personnel living in the 31st battalion have recovered now and as per the latest data, only about 170 personnel, out of over 400, are under treatment for COVID-19 in the CRPF.Officials said the committee was headed by an Additional Director-General posted in the CRPF headquarters and all zonal commanders had been asked to send in their ideas and inputs on better management of barracks and common toilets space after talking to the actual users — jawans and junior-rank officials — and sanitary experts.“The committee has been created on the directions of CRPF Director General A P Maheshwari and he has sought a time-bound report so that better ways can be found to ensure social distancing and personal hygiene in barracks and toilets used by jawans,” a senior officer said.He said the committee would also find ways to better sanitise these two areas in the camp so that jawans, who have to live in shared spaces, do not contract COVID-19 infection.These measures would go a long way in ensuring the overall health of our troops and their personal hygiene even when coronavirus goes away from our lives, another officer said.The second officer said living, sleeping and performing daily ablutions in small and shared spaces was a concern in certain camps, including temporary ones, where there was no land space to expand.“New locations where a battalion or company camp is made have better space when it comes to barracks and toilets for jawans and sub-officers. The coronavirus pandemic has magnified this issue and hence solutions are being looked into,” he said.As part of measures to combat the disease, the CRPF has also decided that all those personnel who have an exposure to COVID-19 patients or surroundings, those who are joining back after leave or those who are returning to camp after lockdown will now be put in 17 days quarantine.Officials said the measure had been declared by the CRPF chief in order to cut the coronavirus infection chain in the camps and units of the force where troops and their families ranging from a varied strength of 1,000 to 3,000 people reside.When the issue of infection to so many troops living in the 31st battalion came to light it was found that the medical wing of the force had issued “dichotomous” order of quarantining a returning medical staff for five days rather than the stipulated 14-day time period and that possibly led to the spike in the number and the camp virtually becoming a hotspot, they said.Officials suspect that as jawans lived in closed spaces like barracks, mess and toilets, the infection quickly spread from one person to the other in this camp and few others from where COVID-19 cases were reported. Hence, it had been directed by the DG that the quarantine period would now be 17 days in the CRPF, they said.The 3.25-lakh-personnel-strong force, the mainstay for anti-Naxal operations and counter-terrorist combat in the Kashmir valley, had also ordered that officials above 50 years of age would not be deployed for “hotspot or active duty”, they said.“Also, men and women troops suffering from medical conditions like hypertension, diabetes among others will not be sent to hard duties as the health ministry guidelines for COVID-19 state such people fall in the high-risk category when it comes to contracting coronavirus infection,” a senior official said.The DG, during a recent address to troops, has also asked the personnel to increase intake of immunity-boosting food items, shun junk food, be stress-free and adopt a healthy and positive-thinking lifestyle.He said it had been decided that the troops who could not join duty due to restrictions of travel during the nationwide lockdown would be “considered on duty” and their personal leaves would be intact.

30-05-2020||New Delhi||Skymet announces arrival of monsoon over Kerala, IMD differs||The southwest monsoon has arrived in Kerala before its onset schedule, private agency Skymet Weather announced on Saturday, but India’s official forecaster IMD said conditions are not yet ripe for the declaration.Skymet Weather CEO Jatin Singh said all conditions such as rainfall, Outwave Longwave Radiation (OLR) value and wind speed have been met to declare the arrival of the southwest monsoon over Kerala.“#JUSTIN Southwest #Monsoon2020 finally arrived on the mainland of India, #Monsoon arrived on Kerala before the actual onset date. All the onset conditions including rainfall, OLR value, wind speed, are met. Finally, the 4-month long festival begins for Indian. #HappyMonsoon (sic),” the private forecaster tweeted.The onset of monsoon over Kerala marks the commencement of four-month rainy season in the country. The country receives 75 per cent of the rainfall from June to September.        Skymet had predicted that monsoon will hit Kerala on May 28 with an error margin of plus or minus 2 days. Whereas, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had said the monsoon will make an onset over Kerala on June 5, four days after its normal onset date.However, earlier this week, it said a cyclonic circulation in the Bay of Bengal will help in advancement of the monsoon and it could reach Kerala on June 1, its normal onset date.         IMD director general Mrutunjay Mohapatra said conditions are still not right to declare onset of monsoon over Kerala.According to the IMD, there are three major conditions to declare the onset of monsoon.The first is if, after May 10, 60 per cent of the 14 weather stations---Minicoy, Amini, Thiruvananthapuram, Punalur, Kollam, Allapuzha, Kottayam, Kochi, Thrissur, Kozhikode, Thalassery, Kannur, Kudulu and Mangalore---report rainfall of 2.5 millimetres or more for two consecutive days, the onset over Kerala will be declared on the second day.The second is the depth of westerlies should be maintained up to 600 hectopascals (hPa) and the third is the Outwave Longwave Radiation should be below 200 watt per square metre (wm-2).

30-05-2020||New Delhi||28 pc of COVID-19 cases in India till April 30 are asymptomatic: Study||At least 28 per cent of the 40,184 people, who had tested positive for COVID-19 between January 22 and April 30 in India, were asymptomatic, a study found, raising concerns about COVID-19 being spread by those who show mild or no symptoms.A large proportion of both those tested and those positive were asymptomatic contacts, according to the study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) scientists, along with other collaborators.Healthcare workers constituted about 5.2 per cent of the total infections, said the study published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research (IJMR).According to the study, of the 28.1 per cent asymptomatic patients, 25.3 per cent were direct and high-risk contacts of the cases, while 2.8 per cent were healthcare workers in contact with confirmed the case without adequate protection.“However, the proportion of the asymptomatic infected people could be much more than the 28.1 per cent and this is a cause of concern for us”" Manoj Murhekar, director of the ICMR’s National Institute of Epidemiology, and one of the authors of the study, said.The findings stated that the proportion of the confirmed cases was the highest among the asymptomatic contacts, two to three-fold higher than among those with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), those with an international travel history or healthcare workers, Murhekar said.Between January 22 and April 30, a total of 10,21,518 people were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).The testing increased from about 250 individuals per day in the beginning of March to 50,000 by the end of April. Overall, 40,184 (3.9 per cent) tested positive for COVID-19.In this study, an analysis of the laboratory surveillance data was done to describe the testing performance and descriptive epidemiology of COVID-19 cases by time, place and person.The attack rate (per million) by age was highest among those aged 50-69 years (63.3) and was lowest among those under 10 years (6.1).The attack rate was higher among men as 41.6 of them tested positive, while 24.3 of the women contracted the infection.COVID-19 cases were reported from 523 of the 736 (71.1 per cent) districts in the country.States with the highest proportion of districts reporting positive cases included Delhi, Maharashtra, Kerala, Punjab, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat.States/UTs with the highest test positivity are Maharashtra (10.6 per cent), Delhi (7.8 per cent), Gujarat (6.3 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (6.1 per cent) and West Bengal (5.8 per cent).Among the 12,810 cases with reported symptoms at the time of specimen collection, cough and fever were the most commonly-reported symptoms, while around one-third of cases reported sore throat and breathlessness.Gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were reported by less than five per cent of cases, the study stated.With the implementation of the ICMR’s laboratory-based surveillance for COVID-19, testing was available and accessible, and thus contributed to improved case detection throughout the country, the study underlined.The network of COVID-19 testing laboratories and testing capacity continues to expand.“While the cumulative number of cases continues to increase, the growth rate of reported cases has slowed,” it said.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/28-pc-of-covid-19-cases-in-india-till-april-30-are-asymptomatic-study-92049

30-05-2020||Washington||A wealthy, powerful, democratic India would help frustrate China’s ‘hegemonic ambitions’: US Senator||A wealthy, powerful and democratic India would help frustrate China’s “hegemonic ambitions”, a senior US Senator has said, amidst a war of words between Washington and Beijing on a range of issues.The US and China are engaged in a major confrontation over issues like the origins of the novel coronavirus pandemic, Beijing’s security crackdown in Hong Kong and the communist giant’s aggressive military moves in the disputed South China Sea.  John Cornyn—a Republican Senator from Texas—on Thursday tweeted that “A wealthy, powerful and democratic India would help frustrate China’s hegemonic ambitions.”      Cornyn also shared an op-ed written by Walter Russell Mead in The Wall Street Journal in which the US academic argued that helping India lift its long-term growth rate should be one of America’s top foreign policy goals.“America won its most important Cold War victories by helping democracies become rich in ways that advanced its own security and prosperity. It’s high time to revive that approach, and India is the place to start,” he wrote.Mead, the James Clarke Chace Professor of Foreign Affairs and the Humanities at Bard College, said India is a natural US ally in the new Cold War with China.He noted that without a strong push by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling BJP party, India’s growth could stabilise at a rate that would keep Indian incomes rising but leave the country falling ever further behind China.“That wouldn’t be good for the US and Asia, or good enough for the hundreds of millions of poor Indians whose elevation from poverty would be hastened by faster growth. But Indian society is complex and difficult to govern. Reforms that challenge powerful constituencies aren’t easily imposed,” Mead said.“Helping democratic India lift its long-term growth rate enough to narrow the gap with China should be one of America’s top foreign-policy goals,” he added.Mead opined that achieving it will require working with Indian officials and experts to find regulatory changes and forms of American assistance that could smooth the path of reform. It will mean working to avoid the kind of environmental devastation that followed China’s industrialisation.“Those who rightly urge a ‘whole of government’ approach to countering China should think hard about what such an approach to India’s development would look like and which allies to enlist in the effort to make a more peaceful, prosperous and securely democratic world,” he said.

30-05-2020||Vibha Sharma||Abrogation of Art 370, paving way for Ram temple, CAA among bold steps by Modi govt 2.0: Nadda||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 30BJP president JP Nadda on Saturday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was able to bridge the gap of 60 years in a mere six years with decisive and bold decisions, bringing a “cultural change in the political arena” of the country.Addressing mediapersons on the occasion of the completion of first year in office by Narendra Modi government 2.0, Nadda said when PM Modi took over in 2014, the country was at a "standstill". "In his first term, he gave a momentum to governance. In the second term, the government was already in its pace, a momentum due to which several bold decisions could be taken," he said.Enumerating the “holistic” social and economic steps taken in past one year, the BJP president said decisions like abrogation of Article 370 and 35A were a result of the Prime Minister’s ‘icha shakti’ (will power), the ‘sutradhaar’ of which became Home Minister Amit Shah.“The people of Jammu and Kashmir have been mainstreamed. More than 100 laws passed by the Centre were not earlier implemented in J&K. Ladakh is now a separate UT. The Centre’s money is going right to the panchayat level and those who were earlier deprived, like women and Dalits, are now enjoying all rights."It was also the wish of the country that Article 370 should be removed. With his bold and decisive actions, the Prime Minister has shown what is right is right and can be implemented without any compromise. He has brought a cultural change in the political arena," he said.Speaking of the efforts taken by the government to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, Nadda stressed on the PM’s pitch on ‘atmanirbhar bharat’ (self-reliant India).“The government has been responsive and receptive and the government has the capacity to take decisions. As compared to other countries, India fought the corona battle with PM leading from the front and taking timely and bold decisions at a time when many big countries became helpless.“Timely lockdown has led to a situation where the country is in a stable situation,” he saidEnumerating various steps, Nadda said holistic economic package will make every section ‘atma nirbhar’ and help them stand on their feet.The BJP president also slammed Congress and Rahul Gandhi for “politicisation of corona”. “The Congress has not behaved responsibly,” he said, adding that all Gandhi had done so far was “confuse” the country during the crisis.To a question related to the state of India’s economy, the BJP president assured India’s approach will remain “progressive and not regressive. We are not trying to go back to any licence/ ‘quota raj’. We are only trying to encourage our entrepreneurs”.Hailing the PM, Nadda said even amid unimaginable challenges, he led from the front and managed the situation very well. “I give my best wishes so that he is able to carry on the work and serve the nation with the same strength as he has done in the past.“In the past six years, India has become self-reliant and this has been because of PM Modi. He has been able to bridge the gap of past 60 years in a six-year time with reforms and bold decisions for social and economic justice and keeping in mind the country’s ‘ekta’ and ‘akhandta’ (unity and integrity).Nadda said in just one year of the second term, the government passed important legislations like CAA, triple talaq, UAPA and increasing the ambit of NIA, FDI in civil aviation, reduction in corporate tax, banks' merger, reduction in NPA, easy loans, amendments in companies Act, which were all indicative of intentions of the government.Nadda also mentioned the building of grand Ram temple in Ayodhya. “It was our dream of many decades that a grand Ram temple is built. Yes, it was Supreme Court which gave the decision even though the Congress tried its best to put up obstacles”.The BJP today launched a special edition of its inhouse magazine 'Kamal Sandesh'.To mark the first year of the government, the party will deliver the PM's message in a letter to 10 crore people, hold 250 virtual press conferences, 2,000 meetings with at least 1,000 party workers and 500 meetings by morcha heads so that “work done by the Modi government in one year reaches up to the grassroots”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/abrogation-of-art-370-paving-way-for-ram-temple-caa-among-bold-steps-by-modi-govt-2-0-nadda-92033
30-05-2020||Tribune Web DeskChandigarh||Boycott Chinese goods, delete TikTok, says Sonam Wangchuk, man behind '3 Idiots'; Milind Soman follows||Educator and innovator Sonam Wangchuk created a buzz online after he asked people to boycott Chinese goods. From smartphones or apps such as TikTok, the innovator is asking people to part ways amid the growing tensions between India and China in Ladakh. Wangchuk, who inspired Phunsukh Wangdu’s character essayed by Aamir Khan in the film '3 Idiots', recently released a YouTube video titled ‘China Ko Jawaab Sena Degi Bullet Se', 'Naagrik Dengey Wallet Se‘, explaining how people can help the country in this situation.The clip starts with Wangchuck sitting in Ladakh with the backdrop of the Himalayas and the river Sindhu. He also talks about the tensions at the border of India and China. He adds that Indian jets were flying over him a few hours ago.In the video, he majorly speaks about the responsibilities of the Indian citizens and how they can help India during the tension between the two countries. He said: "Jab tanav hota hai seema par tab hum-aap jaise nagrik soojate hai raat ko yeh soch kar ki sainik iska jawaab denge. (Whenever there is tension at the borders, we sleep peacefully at night thinking that there are soldiers who are at the border.)"He said: "Is baar Bharat ki bullet power se zyada wallet power kaam aaegi. (This time instead of the bullet power, wallet power will play a more important role.)" He adds: "Isliye agar humare desh ke 130 crore log aur baki ke 3 crore log jo bahar hai, sab milkar agar boycott made in China abhiyaan shuru karte hai to ho sakta hai ki sari duniya bhi yehi kare. Aur China ki arthvyavastha dugmagae aur uski janta roosh main aae. (If the entire Indian population along with the Indian leaving abroad, boycott everything made in China, it will have an impact on the entire world and other countries will do the same. This will have a negative impact on the Chinese economy and the people will get angry.)"Wangchuk says, it is not just about the phones and the computers, it is also applicable to the softwares and apps such as TikTok that need to be boycotted. As a result, India will become self-reliant and things that are made in India will flourish.In the video, Wangchuk also explained the reason behind the brewing tension between India and China. He said that it is not just India, but China has been having problems with Vietnam, Taiwan and even Hong Kong. Paying heed to Wangchuk's advice, Milind Soman took to Twitter to announce that he is no longer a TikTok user. Sharing a short clip of Wangchuk's orginal video, Soman tweeted: "Am no longer on tiktok. #BoycottChineseProducts". Am no longer on tiktok. #BoycottChineseProducts pic.twitter.com/QEqCGza9j7||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/boycott-chinese-goods-delete%C2%A0tiktok-says-sonam-wangchuk-man-behind-3-idiots-milind-soman-follows-92025
30-05-2020||Aditi Tandon||Nurse who continued in Covid-19 care post retirement dies of virus||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 30Joan Mary Prescilla, the nursing superintendent at Chennai’s Rajiv Gandhi Hospital, spent months planning her post retirement life, but had no idea that fate had other plans.Due for superannuation on March 27 this year, Priscilla postponed her retirement plans when duty called that she stay back to serve the hospital that was fast filling up with COVID-19 patients.On May 27, exactly after two months of serving the sick, Priscilla died of COVID-19 having contracted the virus a few days back.“Joan was a dedicated nurse all her life and was always committed to serving the sick. The moment her hospital authorities asked her to stay for COVID duties post retirement she readily agreed and threw herself headlong in the service of the ill. As a frontline health worker, she was in touch with the ICU patients and those on oxygen support and ventilators. Despite protective gear and precautions, she ended up contracting the virus. Her demise is unfortunate but it’s the best tribute to a woman whose sole mission in life was service,” says Victoria Solomon, Joan’s cousin, herself a nursing superintendent at another hospital in Tamil Nadu, which is among the 10 states with 80 per cent of India’s over 1.65 lakh COVID cases.Victoria also says their whole family has had a tradition of nursing care with at least 10 people in the extended kinship currently in COVID care across hospitals.Joan’s friends are, meanwhile, in shock and say she was healthy until a few days back when the virus infected her and took her away in no time. “Everyone says they will remember her for her smiling face and kind demeanour.”Tributes are now pouring in for the frontline warrior who staked her life to stand in the care of the sick when she could have easily moved on to lead a comfortable post-retirement life.Joan has quickly earned herself the sobriquet of the Florence Nightingale of Tamil Nadu.Later in the day, the Tamil Nadu government announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for Joan Mary but her family was not impressed.Speaking to The Tribune, Joan’s brother Ebanezer Arul Selvan said, “COVID warriors are entitled to a compensation of Rs 50 lakh and the state government has only announced Rs 5 lakh. Despite the fact that my sister was admitted to isolation ward like other COVID patients, the hospital authorities say she died of co-morbid conditions and not COVID. This is a lie because in my sister’s first case sheet COVID positive was clearly written but the hospital later said she died of other underlying conditions which is just an attempt to deny Joan and her kin the compensation that’s due to COVID warriors. Even after Joan died, doctors were keeping 3 metre distance from her body. Why should they keep social distance from my sister’s body if she was not COVID positive?” said an inconsolable brother.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nurse-who-continued-in-covid-19-care-post-retirement-dies-of-virus-92023

And we are the ones we were waiting for,” she said.Gawani underscored that women, peace and security are the most important aspects of a society.“Gender becomes relevant especially in the places driven by conflict. Women and children, being more vulnerable, are worst hit in such situations,” she said.Describing South Sudan as a “beautiful” country, she said working towards peace as a military observer in South Sudan has been a life changing experience for her and thanked her colleagues in the Indian Army.Created in 2016, the United Nations Military Gender Advocate of the Year Award recognises the dedication and effort of an individual military peacekeeper in promoting the principles of UN Security Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security in a peace operation context, as nominated by Heads and Force Commanders of peace operations.Commander Carla Monteiro de Castro Araujo, a Brazilian Naval officer working in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA), was also honoured with the award.For the first time, two peacekeepers were jointly awarded for their contribution to this important cause. This is the first year the prestigious award has gone to a peacekeeper from India.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres applauded Gawani and Araujo for their “inspiring work” in promoting gender equality, saying their contributions underscore the importance of increasing the number of women in UN peacekeeping.Guterres underscored the essential role played by women peacekeepers for the success of UN peace operations. He lauded Gawani and Araujo, saying their “inspiring work has made a remarkable difference in promoting gender equality and empowering local women and your own colleagues. Your contributions are proof that women peacekeepers are vital to peace and security everywhere.”      The UN Chief noted that during her deployment with the UN Mission in South Sudan as a Military Observer, Gawani mentored more than 230 Military Observers on conflict-related sexual violence and ensured the presence of women military observers in each of the Mission’s team sites. She also trained the South Sudanese government forces and helped them launch their action plan on conflict-related sexual violence.India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti, in his message on Peacekeepers Day, said that Gawani “epitomises, in many ways, the rich values of Indian peacekeepers.” PTI YASRS05300942NNNN||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/female-peacekeepers-help-bring-sense-of-security-among-conflict-survivors-suman-gawani-92014
30-05-2020||Kolkata||‘West Bengal shifting to Sweden model to contain coronavirus’||With West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announcing the easing of lockdown restrictions in the state, a renowned doctor said that following ramping up of COVID-19 tests, the government seems to be gradually shifting towards the Sweden or Taiwan model to contain the pandemic.Dr Diptendra Sarkar of the state-run SSKM Hospital said that with the countrywide lockdown having been in force for nearly 70 days and the government, both at the Centre and the state, having shored up resources during the period to deal with the disease, it was time for a gradual easing of restrictions.“I feel that they are shifting the model, they were till now going by the hammer and the tongs model which is a lockdown,” he said.Referring to the 72-day lockdown in Wuhan, he said that a lockdown of 60 to 70 days brings down the number of cases of infection.“The Sweden model or that in Taiwan or South Korea, where instead of lockdown they stressed on testing and segregating high-risk population, they have got equal success,” Sarkar said.He opined that the government had enforced a strict lockdown in the beginning owing to lack of testing facilities, but now with a countrywide testing capacity of around one lakh per day, the government is shifting towards the Sweden or South Korea or Taiwan model from the lockdown model.He said that according to a study by the Imperial College of London, if 60 per cent of the population wear ordinary masks, then it can prevent 90 per cent spread of infections.“As an epidemic progresses, a virus in order to survive reduces fatality among its host and gradually loses its vigour,” Sarkar said.While agreeing that the lockdown has to be lifted at some point of time, the Association of Health Service Doctors secretary Dr Manas Gumta expressed his reservations on the manner in which it was being eased in the state.He said that it is not about one-upmanship with the central government over bringing of thousands of people by trains from other states, including the most affected Maharashtra and Gujarat, but there has to be a scientific basis on the way the lockdown is lifted.“Lockdown is simply for buying time by which the health infrastructure can be readied to deal with the pandemic effectively as also for non-COVID patients,” he said, adding that it has to be lifted but in a phased manner.“The way the lockdown is being practically lifted without any preparation, it may lead to a catastrophe,” he said.Gumta said the government needs revenue and people also require livelihood and as such lockdown has to be lifted gradually.“But what is the purpose of opening up religious places, at this juncture, where people may congregate in large numbers,” he questioned.He said that with work from home becoming common in various sectors, there was no need to open up all sectors with full workforce.Gumta also opined that the government should introduce shift systems in offices so as to ease the crowding of many people at a time, in workplaces as well as in public transport.

30-05-2020||New Delhi||Inspired by movie Kabir Singh, man dates women by posing as doctor, held||Inspired by Shahid Kapoor-starrer Bollywood movie Kabir Singh, a 31-year-old man allegedly posed as an orthopaedic surgeon on dating websites and extorted money from gullible women, police said.The police have arrested the accused Anand Kumar and his co-conspirator Priyam Yadav.The matter came to light after police received a complaint from a doctor who was conned by Kumar.Kumar created a fake profile on Tinder app and identified himself as Dr Rohit Gujral to the doctor after which both of them started talking to each other.Kumar also promised that he would marry her and made her transfer Rs 30,000 into his bank account. He also blackmailed her by threatening to expose her private pictures and videos, police said.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber Cell) Anyesh Roy said Kumar used to run an event management firm and was in touch with a lot of men and women who aspired to become models and actors."He used the pictures of one of these men to create fake profile on various dating apps like Tinder, Bumble and matrimonial sites like Jeevan Saathi, by the name of Dr. Rohit Gujral, claiming to be an orthopaedic surgeon," he said.In the movie Kabir Singh, Shahid Kapoor portrays the character of an orthopaedic surgeon.During interrogation, Kumar told the police that the whole idea of identifying himself as a doctor came after he watched the movie Kabir Singh.He then created a profile in such a way that it attracts women, Kumar said during interrogation, police said.Once he connected with the women, he would exchange numbers and start talking to them. On the pretext of his mother's treatment, he would avoid video calls with the them and within a few days, would convince them about his seriousness to marry them. He would also ask the women to send their private pictures and videos, police said.Kumar also cooked up a false story to blackmail the women.To extort money, he would tell the women that he has a friend named 'Anand' who was upset with him as he had slept with his sister.He told the women that Anand was blackmailing him because he had private photos of him with his sister," the DCP said.Kumar would asked the women to meet Anand, a proposal which would be often rejected by them. To extract money from them, Kumar would then start blackmailing the women by threatening them of making their private photos and videos public. He would lie about his mother's health so that the women give him more money, the DCP said."Kumar had been doing this for four months and conned many women. A few of them thought that he was in a 'difficult situation' but would marry them eventually. One woman even applied for a loan of Rs 5 lakhs for Kumar," he added.Police said Kumar was traced through his ID and arrested from Lajpat Nagar. They found that Kumar has an associate named Priyam Yadav, who had given his bank details to Kumar to receive the money from the women.

30-05-2020||Lucknow||Lucknow: Monkeys attack lab worker, run away with coronavirus samples||A troop of monkeys in Lucknow attacked a medical official and snatched away blood samples of patients who had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, authorities said on Friday.The attack occurred this week when a laboratory technician was walking in the campus of a state-run medical college in Meerut, 460 km ( 285 miles) north of Lucknow, capital of Uttar Pradesh state."Monkeys grabbed and fled with the blood samples of four COVID-19 patients who are undergoing treatment ... we had to take their blood samples again," said Dr S. K. Garg, a top official at the college.Authorities said they were not clear if the monkeys had spilled the blood samples, but people living near the leafy campus feared further spread of the virus if the monkeys carried the samples into residential areas.Garg said it was not clear if the monkeys could contract the coronavirus if they came into contact with infected blood."No evidence has been found that monkeys can contract the infection," Garg told Reuters.The virus is believed to have jumped from animals into people in a wildlife market in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.India has had 165,799 cases of the coronavirus and 4,706 deaths.Monkeys have been increasingly straying into human settlements in India and causing disturbances, even attacking people.

It was first extended till May 3 and then again till May 17. The lockdown was further extended till May 31.The Home Minister’s telephonic conversations with the chief ministers came just three days before the end of the fourth phase of the lockdown.During his talks with the chief ministers, Shah sought to know the areas of concern of the states and the sectors they want to open up further from June 1, the official said.Interestingly, till now, it was Modi who had interacted with all chief ministers through video-conference before extension of each phase of the coronavirus-induced lockdown and sought their views.This was for the first time that the Home Minister spoke to the chief ministers individually before the end of another phase of the lockdown.Shah was present in all the conferences of chief ministers along with the Prime Minister.It is understood that majority of the chief ministers wanted the lockdown to continue in some form but also favoured opening up of the economic activities and gradual return of the normal life, another official said.The Central Government is expected to announce its decision on the lockdown within the next two days.The number of COVID-19 cases in India has climbed to 1,65,799 on Friday, making it the world’s ninth worst-hit country by the coronavirus pandemic.The Health Ministry said the death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 4,706 in the country.While extending the fourth phase of the lockdown till May 31, the central government had announced continuation of prohibition on opening of schools, colleges and malls but allowed opening of shops and markets.It said hotels, restaurants, cinema halls, malls, swimming pools, gyms will remain shut even as all social, political, religious functions, and places of worship will remain closed till May 31.The government, however, allowed limited operations of train and domestic flights.

Mamata today said she would urge the Central Government that it too should think about lifting the ban on places of worship. The Chief Minister also announced that all offices in the state — private as well as government – would open from June 8.Mamata did not make any announcement regarding malls, restaurants or the Metro and the local train service. She, however, said that city buses would be allowed to ply with maximum passengers as far as the sitting capacity of the vehicle would allow. All passengers must wear masks. Once the seats are full, buses will not take any more passenger.The Chief Minister said that number of COVID-19 positive patients was going up in the state because of   influx of people from “hotspots” such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh.Mamata alleged that the “Shramik Special” trains coming to the state were overcrowded. She said the Railway Ministry must make available more trains for the service so that the labourers returning home need not travel in crowded coaches. Travelling in crowded coaches enhanced one’s chance of contracting corona from an infected person, she noted. Five to six lakh migrant labourers – approximately 75,000 of them by trains and the rest by bus, lorry and other means – have already entered West Bengal, Mamata said. She said she did not try to stop those returning to the state since they were original inhabitants of West Bengal only.The Chief Minister said local schools have been turned into quarantine centres where people returning from outside are being put up initially. Anyone who does not show any symptom is released after seven days. If one shows any symptom, the person is tested and referred for further treatment if required.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-to-open-all-places-of-worship-from-june-1-mamata-banerjee-91616

In fact, they underlined that no conversation has taken place between the two leaders since April 4 when they spoke on export of hydroxychloroquine.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has been stressing on bilateralism to resolve the dispute even as the US, first by senior diplomat Alice Wells and later Trump, sought to triangulate it.For the first time, the Chinese Foreign Office also spoke against the US offer for mediation. “We are capable of properly resolving the issues between us through dialogue and consultation. We do not need the intervention of the third party,” its spokesperson said at a media briefing here. “We have existing border-related mechanisms and communication channels between China and India,” he added.The clarification from both India and China was prompt after Trump said in response to question that he had spoken to PM Modi and went on to say that the Indian PM was not in a “good mood” over the “big conflict” between India and China.A day earlier, the MEA had said India was directly in touch with China through established mechanisms and diplomatic contacts to resolve the border stand-off.Trump has offered at least half a dozen times to mediate between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue, which was always turned down by New Delhi.India, US can strike ‘smaller’ trade deal soonWashington: India and the US could strike a ‘smaller’ trade deal in the coming weeks, India’s ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu has said while acknowledging that the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic has been a ‘bit of a setback’ in moving ahead as the governments are focused on tackling the health crisis.

Yadav said, “It appears that the demand for these trains is declining from the originating state. 137 trains were flagged on Thursday and 172 on Wednesday. The demand for trains has been going down in the last two days,” Yadav said.Till last week 250 trains were being run daily. The Railways has been drawing flak over the last few days due to inordinate delay of Shramik Special trains owing to route congestion and inadequate supply of food and water. Reports of deaths of some passengers travelling on these trains over the past few days have triggered concerns over the lack of basic necessities amid the intense heat wave.“Of 3,840 trains, 71 were diverted to deal with network congestion only between May 20 and 24.Only four trains took more than three days to reach destination states in the north-eastern part of the country. These were long distance trains and incidents like landslide in Assam delayed the journey,” Yadav said.He said passengers with serious health issues, senior citizens, pregnant women and children below 10 years of age should board Shramik Special trains only for essential travel.Body found in train toiletLucknow: A 38-year-old returning worker’s body was found inside a toilet of a Shramik Special train that he had boarded four days ago.

30-05-2020||---||Don’t let lockdown woes turn into disasters: Modi in 'letter to citizens'||New Delhi, May 29Acknowledging the tremendous suffering endured by migrant workers and disadvantaged sections during the Covid-19 lockdown period, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said the country has to ensure that inconveniences being faced do not turn into disasters.“In a crisis of this magnitude, it can certainly not be claimed that no one suffered any inconvenience or discomfort. Our labourers, migrant workers, artisans and craftsmen in small-scale industries, hawkers and such fellow countrymen have undergone tremendous suffering, PM Modi said in a letter to citizens on the completion of one year in office of the second term.Recounting a series of measures undertaken to usher in a change, he said just as the country was moving at a fast pace, Covid engulfed the country. Praising citizens for the confidence and resilience with which they faced the global pandemic and transforming the way the world now looked at India, he cautioned that everyone had to take care and follow guidelines to ensure that “inconveniences that we are facing do not turn into disasters”.“We have displayed patience so far and we should continue to do so. This is one of the important reasons for India being safer and in a better state than many other countries. This is a long battle but we have started traversing the path of victory, and victory is our collective resolve,” he said.He reiterated that becoming self-reliant — Atmanirbhar Bharat — was the need of the hour in the post-Covid era.Recalling that in 2014 people voted for a substantive transformation, he said in the last five years, the nation saw how the administrative apparatus broke free from the swamp of corruption as well as misgovernance. From 2014 to 2019, India’s stature rose significantly. The nation achieved financial inclusion, total sanitation coverage, and made progress towards ensuring “housing for all”.“In 2019, people voted not merely for continuity but also with a dream of taking India to new heights,” the PM said, noting that today people feel involved in the development trajectory of the nation.“Powered by the mantra of ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas’, India is marching forward in all spheres”, he said choosing to describe himself as “Pradhan Sevak”.In the last one year, some of the decisions were widely discussed and remained etched in public discourse. Article 370 furthered the spirit of national unity. The Ram Mandir judgment brought an amicable end to a debate persisting for centuries.

The output in eight core sectors is estimated to have contracted 38.1 per cent in April, suggesting much bleaker days ahead.Telling commentWe had forecast that the GDP for Q4 would slip below 4%. It has turned out to be worse. The govt should remember that this data was pre-lockdown. — P Chidambaram, CongressThe growth during the full 2019-20 financial year was slow too.The GDP grew by 4.2 per cent as compared to 6.1 per cent in 2018-19 — the slowest in 11 years. The slide in the GDP growth during the January-March quarter, a partially Covid-impacted period, was due to a crash in most core sector indicators, except coal, according to the National Statistical Office. The drop was especially precipitated by a fall in cement production (- 4.9 per cent), steel (-3.9 per cent) and crude oil (- 5.7 per cent). The NSO said India would attain a per capita income of “Rs 94,954 during 2019-20 as against Rs 92,085 in 2018-19.” — TNSGST Council meetThe Finance Ministry is not in favour of increasing GST rates on non-essential items at next month’s meeting of GST Council, despite depressed collections.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gdp-growth-slides-to-3-1-pc-core-sectors-output-shrinks-91811
