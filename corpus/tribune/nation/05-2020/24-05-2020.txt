And those who tested negative were sent to their respective homes,” Jagatsinghpur District Collector Sangram Mohapatra said.“They were directed to remain under self-isolation for 28 days.”The move was aimed at vacating some of the temporary quarantine centres, which have now doubled up as cyclone shelters, too, he said.“Altogether 815 people quarantined in 39 health camps were provided with the opportunity to return home and maintain self-isolation,” Mohapatra said.“They have submitted a written undertaking that they would not violate the isolation norms.”All health camps were thoroughly sanitised before converting them into cyclone shelters, he said.Nearly 45 lakh people in Odisha have been adversely affected by the extremely severe cyclonic storm Amphan, which fiercely went past the state coast and made landfall in West Bengal's Sunderbans last Wednesday.At least two lakh people were evacuated from the vulnerable areas of the state ahead of the landfall. Several people have also been rendered homeless by the storm.In Kendrapara, around 250 migrant workers were sent home after their COVID-19 tests confirmed that they have not contacted the infection.“Eight health camps that had been housing quarantined people over the past two months are now serving as cyclone shelters. Over 250 have been asked to maintain self-isolation at home,” Kendrapara District Collector Samarth Verma said.Those sent home were provided with their COVID-19 test reports amid apprehensions that locals might stop them from entering the villages.“We have received no report of resistance shown to any of the migrants sent home,” Verma said.Similar measures were undertaken in parts of Balasore and Bhadrak districts, officials said.A Gujarat-returned labourer, who was allowed to go home, said he cannot wait to meet his loved ones.“I had undertaken a long and painful journey to return to Odisha. I so wanted to go home and rest,” said the migrant worker in Balasore who did not wish to be named.“Now that I have been granted permission, having tested negative for the disease, I can’t wait to meet my family. That said, I will strictly adhere to the social distancing norms,” he added.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/quarantined-migrants-to-make-space-for-cyclone-affected-people-in-odisha-89418
24-05-2020||New Delhi||India felt ‘big jolt’ with the sudden spike in cases due to Markaz incident: Health Minister||India felt a “big jolt” with the sudden spike in cases following the Nizamuddin Markaz incident, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Sunday, asserting that the incident was a lesson for all communities that when a collective decision is taken by the country it must be followed with discipline.At the same time, he said there was no point talking about it now as strict contact tracing of the Tablighi Jamaat congregation participants was done and those who contracted COVID-19 had been treated.In an interaction with BJP spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao, Vardhan said the state governments, the IT department, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and Home Minister Amit Shah played an important role following the Tablighi Jamaat incident.Asked by Rao if the incident was a take-off point, Vardhan said: “We feel bad raising the issue, but there is no doubt that around the second week of March when COVID-19 was spreading rapidly across the globe and even after one and a half months had passed following the first case in India, the number of cases were very few, in a few states, when this unfortunate and irresponsible incident happened.”“In Delhi, the law was such that more than 10 to 15 people could not have gathered. At that time, people from about one or one and a half dozen other countries were there,” he said, adding that social distancing was not followed.People coming from outside were bringing the disease with them and at such a time over 1,000 people were staying together without the knowledge of the administration.When that information was received by authorities, these people were removed while many had left on their own, the BJP leader said.The country got a big jolt at that time when the cases increased suddenly and it resulted in the government deciding to take the drastic step of lockdown and other measures,” he said.“It was an unfortunate incident and is a lesson for all sections and communities in the country that when a country takes a collective decision everyone should follow it with discipline as it is in everyone’s larger interest,” Vardhan said.A large congregation organised in March by the Tablighi Jamaat in the Nizamuddin area of the national capital had emerged as a major hotspot. Some of the participants, who were later tested positive for COVID-19, had travelled to their home states and other areas.Vardhan hailed the lockdown imposition as a bold decision which acted as a “potent social vaccine” against the virus and said it was taken at the right time.Many developed countries of the world put a lot of thought into making this decision and decided to impose a lockdown when the situation went out of control, he said.Vardhan also visited the Dedicated COVID-19 Health Centre (DCHC) at Chaudhary Brahm Prakash Ayurved Charak Sansthan (CBPACS), Najafgarh, where he said the testing capacity had also been ramped up and around 1,50,000 tests could be conducted every day.“On Saturday itself, we conducted 1,10,397 tests. Till Saturday, we have conducted 29,44,874 tests,” the Minister said. India now has 422 government laboratories and 177 private laboratory chains, he said.Informing about the healthcare infrastructure set up across the country to deal with the pandemic, he said: “These have been divided into three categories — the Dedicated COVID Hospitals (DCHs), the Dedicated COVID Health Centres (DCHCs) and the COVID Care Centres (CCCs) — with an adequate number of isolation beds, ICU beds and other facilities.”“A total of 968 Dedicated COVID Hospitals have been identified across the country with 2,50,397 beds (1,62,237 Isolation beds + 20,468 ICU beds); 2,065 Dedicated COVID Health Centres with 1,76,946 beds (1,20,596 isolation beds + 10,691 ICU beds); and, 7,063 COVID Care Centres with 6,46,438 beds,” he said.Talking about the protective equipment, he said the country was now making a sufficient number of N95 masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) through the ramped up domestic manufacturing sector, and the requirements of the states were being sufficiently met.He informed that the states, UTs as well as central institutions had been provided with around 109.08 lakh N-95 masks and around 72.8 lakh PPE.Talking about the status of containment of COVID-19 in the country, Vardhan said: “Prior to the lockdown, on March 25, 2020, the doubling rate was 3.2 when measured over a period of 3 days, 3.0 when measured over a period of 7 days and 4.1 when measured over a period of 14 days.”“Today it stands at 13.0 over a 3-day window, 13.1 over a 7-day window and 12.7 when measured over a 14-day window. Similarly, the fatality rate stands at 2.9 per cent, while the recovery rate has improved to 41.2 per cent. Clearly the situation has improved due to lockdown,” he asserted.This also reflected on the quality of healthcare being provided to the COVID-19 patients, he said.Vardhan reviewed the arrangements at the centre for treatment of COVID-19 patients. While in the COVID-19 Health centre, the minister also interacted with a team of doctors and enquired about the wellbeing of COVID-19 patients.“Ayurveda is a traditional medicinal knowledge source from India and there is huge potential in it. Its inherent strength in holistic healing and wellbeing is being put to good use in the treatment of the COVID-19 patients at this DCHC,” Vardhan said.This knowledge and experience would surely prove beneficial to people all over the world, especially in the battle against COVID-19, he said.In his interaction with Rao, Vardhan said: “India has immensely benefited from the leadership of Prime Minister Modi in the fight against COVID as he swung into action pre-emptively and proactively. His decisions like lockdown and other advisories have worked as a potent social vaccine against the virus.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-felt-big-jolt-with-the-sudden-spike-in-cases-due-to-markaz-incident-health-minister-89416
24-05-2020||Lucknow||No hugs, join hearts: People get ready for sombre celebration of Eid amid Covid||With all major pre-Eid shopping hubs staying shut here, the people on Sunday appeared to be readying themselves for a subdued and sombre celebration of the festival, striving to “connect hearts” instead of embracing each other.The people here are set to celebrate Eid on Monday amid prominent Muslim clerics’ appeals to observe it at home and avoid embracing each other and shaking hands to rule out the chances of contracting coronavirus infection.All major Eid-Ul-Fitr eve shopping destinations here in the city, including those at Aminabad, Nazirabad, Fatehganj, La Touche Road and Kaisarbagh wore deserted looks with shops staying shut on Lucknow district administration orders.Whether it be dry fruit stores and hand-made papad shops at Aminabad Road or clothes showrooms at Nazirabad, they all had their shutters down.There were no different stories at markets at Fatehganj, La Touche Road and Kaisarbagh. They all stayed closed due to their proximity to COVID cantonment zones.Despite the missing tell-tale signs of a boisterous festivity, people did not appear to be complaining and seem headed to celebrate the Eid in a new light and spirit.Speaking to PTI, Lucknow’s prominent Muslim cleric Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahali, while asking people to celebrate Eid while staying at home, appealed to them to spend half of their celebration budget with the poor and needy.“Celebrate Eid at your homes. Only four-five persons, staying in mosques, will offer prayers there. Greet people through the social media. Do not shake hands or embrace or hug anyone. Apart from this, 50 per cent of Eid budget should be given to the poor,” he said.Shia cleric Maulana Yasoob Abbas too echoed Maulana Mahali’s sentiments.“Ibaadat (prayers) can be done at home too. We are telling everyone to celebrate Eid at homes. This will be in the greater interest of our family and the country,” he said.“Gale milne ki jagah is baar hamen dil milane par jor dena chahiya . (We should strive to connect hearts this time instead of hugging each other),” he said.These noble sentiments of Muslim spiritual gurus also appeared to have touched chords of common citizens.“The best Ramzan ever: Limited delicacies, no iftaar parties and no Eid shopping. Wow...isn’t this the right way to rejoice this holy month every year? We all should feel blessed that for the first time, we got the opportunity to actually celebrate Ramzan and not indulge in distractions to show off on Eid,” said Uzma Talha, a Lucknow-based freelance writer in a post.“We should not feel that this pandemic has dampened the spirit of Eid,” she said, adding “we must thank this month of Ramzan” for imparting us a “spiritual experience in a difficult phase” making us all “to strive to become more humane, compassionate, kinder & selfless”.Gudhiya, a domestic worker at Lucknow’s Thakuganj, said she would be celebrating Eid from home.“I have asked all my relatives to do the same and pray for each other while staying at home and exchange greeting on phone,” she added.Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel extended her Eid greetings to the people of the state.“Greetings to all the people of the state especially the Muslim brothers and sisters on Eid-ul-Fitr,” she said.“Eid gives us the message of love, unity and brotherhood. Sharing happiness increases them. Extending help to the poor and needy will also usher happiness in their lives. In view of COVID-19 pandemic, exercise caution, and offer Namaaz from homes,” she said.

24-05-2020||New Delhi||India-China Foreign Offices downplay LAC disagreements||The Foreign Offices of India and China have so far sought to underplay recent disagreements between their border troops at several places along the Line of Actual Control.A 90-minute press conference by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sunday covered a number of topics but did not touch the LAC question which has been dominating the Indian social media and TV channels.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) here issued two statements on the incidents in one week – on May 14 and 21 – which is unusual. While expressing resolve to stand the ground and blaming Chinese troops for obstructing usual Indian patrols, the statements expressed hope in the existing mechanisms for sorting out troops disagreements.Wang at his press conference had two options if he wanted to flag the LAC flashpoints. He could have made a suo motu statement, as he did on Hong Kong for instance or, the Chinese Foreign Office could have sounded out a resident Indian newsperson to query Wang about the tensions on the border.“That Wang chose neither option suggests that either the incidents are not grave enough in Beijing’s security calculus or it is occupied with other pressing matters,” said a China watcher.The MEA too has declined to be drawn in over reports that have given varying accounts of the incursions.In its first statement on May 14, a few days after Indian and Chinese troops had allegedly scuffled, the MEA explained the ground conditions under which the disagreements emerged and said both sides are attempting to maintain tranquillity on the border.Its May 21 statement resolved to safeguard India’s sovereignty but also said both sides were engaged on the issue. The situation on the LAC has turned brittle less than six months after National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Wang agreed to work together to develop more confidence building measures (CBMs) for the boundary and to approach the boundary question from the strategic perspective of India-China relations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-foreign-offices-downplay-lac-disagreements-89411
24-05-2020||Ajay Banerjee||China’s military posturing questions validity of treaties||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi May 24As India and China are locked in a tense military posture at three separate points along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh, the efficacy of the border agreements and protocols is under question.China is honouring none of agreements inked since 1993, probably trying to carve a ‘new normal’, attempting to alter the existing arrangements.The series of protocols ensured that the two sides knew which were disputed sections of the LAC and decided upon conduct of troops in disputed areas.  The 3,488-km LAC running all along the Himalayan ridgeline in un-demarcated and has several points which are disputed. The perception of where the LAC runs varies by several km at certain places and troops of either side patrol in these disputed sections.Non-disputed areas were a strict no-go and in the present case what China is doing at Galwan in Eastern Ladakh is a situation that has not arisen since November 1962 – when the India-China war ended. At Galwan, China is sitting some 3-4 km inside Indian claim line of the LAC and its perception is not disputed by either side.At the north bank of Pangong Tso – a 135 km glacial melt lake, troops have clashed, two flag meetings yielded nothing. China wants to keep India at least 8-10 km short of the present patrolling line.Since 1993— the timeline, incidentally, coincides with the economic rise of the India and China – the two countries have had a few key agreements aimed at ensuring peace along the LAC. There have been a series of agreements which dictate the conduct of soldiers and also how a high-powered committee with members of both sides will sort out matters.In January 2012, the two countries inked an agreement and established a ‘Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs’. It is tasked too “address issues and situations that may arise in the border areas that affect the maintenance of peace and tranquillity”.So far, China has been ‘threatening’ India through the news outlets owned by the Communist Party of China.Incidents at Galwan and Pangong Tso fly in the face of the 2005-inked “protocol on modalities for implementation of confidence building measures in the military field along the LAC in the India-China border areas”. The mandate of the agreement is: “Neither side shall use force or threaten to use force against the other.” It also calls upon both sides to stop their activities (like patrols) in the disputed area and not advance any further. On coming face-to-face troops unfurl a banner at each other asking to back off the present positions of patrolling.There are some 400-500 such banner drills done annually and in this case the system has not worked.The Border Defence Cooperation Agreement (BDCA) inked in 2013 says both sides have to inform about military exercise and over-flying aircraft. The two sides agreed that they shall not follow or tail patrols of the other side in areas where there is no common understanding of the LAC. At present, China is flying helicopters very close to LAC, India responded by flying out a team of Sukhoi30 MKI jets and patrols parties have jostled, fought and thrown fisticuffs at each other.The two countries have five meetings points along the boundary where military commanders meet. These at DBO and Spanngur gap in eastern Ladakh. Meetings have yielded nothing, so far.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinas-military-posturing-questions-validity-of-treaties-89409
24-05-2020||New Delhi||If states want UP migrant workers back, they have to seek our permission: Yogi Adityanath||Any state which wanted migrant workers of Uttar Pradesh back has to seek permission from the state government and need to ensure their socio-legal-monetary rights, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Sunday.Upset that migrant labourers were “not properly taken care of” by various states in the wake of the COVID-triggered lockdown, Adityanath said: “These workers are our biggest resource and will give them employment in Uttar Pradesh as state government is going to set up a commission for their employment.”“They are our people... and if some states want them back, they have to seek permission from the state government,” Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said in an interaction with the RSS- affiliated publications, ‘Panchjanya’ and ‘Organiser’.As per the feedback received from migrant workers, who reached Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said safeguarding their rights should get utmost attention and importance.“All migrant workers are being registered and their skills mapped.

24-05-2020||Naveen S Garewal||Punjab police food distribution video helps unite Telangana man with family||Tribune News ServiceHyderabad, May 24What started as a social cause to involve others in helping the needy during the time of lockdown and fight against coronavirus has turned out to be the best thing that could happen to a Telangana family.A TikTok video shot in Punjab’s Ludhiana by the police during a relief operation has united a hearing- and speech-impaired Telangana man with his family after two years.Roddam Venkateshwarlu, a resident of Bhadradri Kothagudem district, who had gone missing in 2018, was spotted by his family in one of the videos that was circulating online.In one of the videos showing food distribution among the needy during the lockdown in Punjab, the children of Venkateshwarlu saw their father who they had lost two years ago.“We had lost all hope till we suddenly saw this video and spotted our father unmistakably,” says R. Peddiraju, one of the sons said.“My other siblings — two other brothers and two sisters could not believe their eyes when they saw our missing father in a TikTok video of Punjab’s Ludhiana Police.”The children saw two men hand over a food packet to Venkateshwarlu, who was seen walking with the help of a walker.In the video, a Punjab Police Head Constable as part of the social service helped the needy during the cronavirus pandemic, especially the beggars and people living on the streets. The children saw that their father was trying to communicate in a sign language and pointed out that he could not hear or speak. They became sure that this was their father.Peddiraju approached his state’s police, who got in touch with their Punjab counterparts and after confirming that the man featured in the video is Venkateshwarlu issued the former a movement pass to travel down to Ludhiana in a car on Saturday. “I was so happy to meet my father after such a long time. It was painful to see him begging on the roads, but thank God we finally found him,” Peddiraju told local media.The old man had gone missing in April 2018 after he left home to look for a job as a daily wager. They don’t know how he reached Ludhiana, but they think that in an inebriated state he may have boarded a train and landed in Punjab. A police complaint was filed but in vain.Peddiraju said his father had developed an injury in the leg which will be shown to the doctors in Hyderabad, once the lockdown is lifted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/punjab-police-food-distribution-video-helps-unite-telangana-man-with-family-89394
24-05-2020||Kolkata||Water supply restored, Haldia units normalise operations in cyclone-hit Bengal||Four days after cyclone ‘Amphan’ ravaged West Bengal, operations of several industrial units in Haldia normalised on Sunday as water supply to many facilities was restored, an official said.Besides power, the supply of water, a key input for running units, was disrupted due to the cyclone, he said.Some large plants having captive power facilities managed to run their units at a lower capacity with a scarcity of water, the official said.“Electricity for supplying water to industrial units has been restored. Despite massive damage to power structures and poles, we have completed maximum restoration job,” Haldia Development Authority CEO Hari Shankar said.He said water was supplied from a treatment plant at Geonkhali that produces 27 million gallons daily, and 85 per cent of which is consumed by the industries in Haldia.Located about 150 km from here, Haldia, the port town in East Midnapore district, witnessed the destruction of the cyclonic storm as electric poles and communication lines had been blown away by gusting winds.The Indian Oil Corporation, which was running its refinery in the town at 40-50 per cent capacity in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, had to scale down its operation further due to water shortage, sources said.Large plants of many other companies in Haldia also trimmed output due to lack of water, they said.IVL Dhunseri Petrochem chairman C K Dhanuka said that the company's PET resin plant in Haldia was operational with availability of captive power and water from its reservoirs but the production was less.

The video is tampered,” he added.A case under sections 452, 324, 504, 506, 34 of IPC has been registered on Marathe’s complaint but no arrests have been made, a Kranti Chowk police station official said.

24-05-2020||New Delhi||There will be no delay in supply of Rafale jets to India: France||There will be no delay in delivery of 36 Rafale jets to India as the timeline finalised for the supply of the fighter jets will be strictly respected, French Ambassador Emmanuel Lenain has said.India had signed an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 for the procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of around Rs 58,000 crore.“The contractual delivery schedule of the Rafale jets has been perfectly respected till now, and, in fact, a new aircraft was handed over to the Indian Air Force in end-April in France, in keeping with the contract,” Lenain told PTI.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh received the first Rafale jet at an airbase in France on October 8.“We are helping the Indian Air Force in arranging for the ferry flight of their first four Rafales from France to India as soon as possible. So there’s no reason today to speculate that the schedule will not be maintained,” the envoy said.France is reeling under swelling cases of coronavirus and has emerged as one of the worst-hit in Europe. Over 1,45,000 people were infected by the virus while the death toll stood at 28,330.There were apprehensions that the delivery of Rafale jets could be delayed due to the pandemic.However, Lenain asserted that the original timeline for delivery of the jets will be adhered to.The aircraft is capable of carrying a range of potent weapons. European missile maker MBDA’s Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missile and Scalp cruise missile will be the mainstay of the weapons package of the Rafale jets.Meteor is the next generation of BVR air-to-air missile (BVRAAM) designed to revolutionise air-to-air combat. The weapon has been developed by MBDA to combat common threats facing the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and Sweden.Besides the missile systems, the Rafale jets will come with various India-specific modifications, including Israeli helmet-mounted displays, radar warning receivers, low band jammers, 10-hour flight data recording, infra-red search and tracking systems.The IAF has already completed preparations, including readying required infrastructure and training of pilots, to welcome the fighter aircraft.The first squadron of the aircraft will be stationed at Ambala air force station, considered one of the most strategically located bases of the IAF. The Indo-Pak border is around 220 km from there.The second squadron of Rafale will be stationed at Hasimara base in West Bengal.The IAF spent around Rs 400 crore to develop required infrastructure like shelters, hangars and maintenance facilities at the two bases.Out of 36 Rafale jets, 30 will be fighter jets and six will be trainers. The trainer jets will be twin-seater with almost all the features of the fighter jets.The Congress raised questions about the deal, including on rates of the aircraft, and alleged corruption, but the government has rejected the charges. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/there-will-be-no-delay-in-supply-of-rafale-jets-to-india-france-89384

The couple also signed on a bond paper and handed over the baby to the woman on Saturday night,” the police official said.The woman was nabbed on Sunday while she was taking the baby to a hospital, the official said adding the baby’s parents and the woman buyer were detained and efforts were on to nab three other absconding accused, who had signed as witnesses on the bond paper.

24-05-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19 impact: Concern over possible resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases among children||The hampering of routine immunisation of children against “old enemies” like diphtheria, measles, tetanus and polio during the two-month coronavirus lockdown has triggered serious concerns about a possible resurgence of such vaccine-preventable diseases among them, according to experts.A report brought out by the World Health Organisation said that world over at least 80 million children under the age of one year are at risk of diseases like diphtheria, measles and polio as COVID-19 outbreak disrupted routine vaccination efforts.An estimated 20-22 lakh children across the country under the age of one are targeted for vaccination under national programmes every month that translates into approximately 260 lakh children per year, according to official sources.In the first two phases of the lockdown that spanned 40 days, people could not reach immunisation camps due to unavailability of transport facilities while several states themselves had temporarily suspended vaccination sessions as they were busy in preparations to deal with the pandemic.According to sources, when the lockdown was announced, states like UP and Bihar, which constitute almost 30 per cent of the national birth cohort (under one year),  had stopped vaccination programmes, including sessions held in villages, while states like Odisha, Rajasthan, Kerala, and Delhi also had paused such drives for a few days.“Several states had stopped the routine healthcare activities, including immunisation, and the disruption may have led to over 15 lakh children missing out on vaccination completely or partially. States have resumed their services, but have a huge backlog to cover,” Chhaya Pachauli, member of the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA), a national platform that co-ordinates activities on healthcare across the country, said.“With its routine immunisation programmes, India has made significant strides in terms of protecting its children from infectious diseases like polio, measles, tetanus and diphtheria over the years and a delay in vaccination may lead to disastrous results,” she said.However, no official figure was available on how many children missed vaccination during the lockdown period.According to government sources, many children may have missed immunisation in the initial days of the lockdown but all the states have subsequently resumed the immunisation programmes following talks with the Union Health Ministry that asked them not to halt vaccination especially in green zones and outside the buffer zones.“While many other countries stopped immunisation totally due to lockdown and non-supply of vaccines to the session sites, India was able to tide over the situation because of the continuous push from the Centre and the supply chain was also steadily maintained,” an official source said.“After the Union health ministry issued guidelines on carrying out immunisation during COVID-19 outbreak, the states are geared up not only to resume the drive but also to cover the huge backlog,” the source said.According to Dr Yogesh Jain, public health physician at NGO Jan Swasthya Sahayog, the number of children who may have missed vaccination could be way over 15 lakh.“And the bigger point here is that this missing of vaccine dose is not only a process indicator of how our health systems have failed in the setting of COVID-19, but it actually means a major impact on the outcomes on childhood survival,” Jain said.“Because the vaccines we presently give look at old enemies like diptheria, tetanus, measles and polio and bring back home the greatest fear we had regarding impact of COVID-19 on the health systems. Yes, we will lose some people due to COVID-19 but the much larger impact would be the non-COVID causes of death of which the vaccine-preventable will be one major group,” Jain said.A recent online study conducted by Child Rights and You about ‘understanding the effects of COVID- 19 on children’ found that 49 per cent of parents or primary caregivers of children aged 0-5 years stated that they could not get access to basic child healthcare such as immunisation during the lockdown.The impact of non-immunisation will be aggravated with the compromised immune system, especially in the vulnerable populations, and push many children towards life-threatening diseases and infections, the CRY said in a statement.“Global fraternity of science and research is trying to develop the vaccine for COVID-19 and in the meantime, the entire world is struggling with the spread and impact of the virus, including India. The irony is we are not even able to provide the already available vaccination to life-threatening diseases in the lockdown situation,” it said.India needs to be ready to fight back with equipped and adequate frontline health workers, availability of vaccination supply chain, supplementary nutrition packages, improved food and nutrition system, PPE gears for frontline staff and quality improvement of community-based health services like Primary Health Centers, it said.Anindit Roy-Chowdhury, Director for Programme, Policy and Impact, at child rights NGO Save the Children said access to essential health services in India has become a tremendous concern along with the availability of nutritious food for children.Quoting WHO’s figures that 80 million children have missed their regular immunisation cycle world over, Chowdhury said though the exact numbers are hard to estimate in India, the fact remains that a large proportion of children in the country will be missing their immunisation cycles.“This is even more true for the most marginalised, the urban and the rural poor. Also, migrant labourer families who have now moved back to their villages have unfortunately not been able to prioritise their children’s immunisation... because food and shelter have become the greatest concern,” Chowdhury said.The union health ministry on May 21 issued guidelines stating birth dose vaccinations at health facilities would continue irrespective of the categorisation of zones amid the COVID-19 pandemic.In other cases, providing vaccination doses will only be allowed outside the containment and buffer zones, and in green zones.An area enlisted as a “containment or buffer zone” should stop health facility-based sessions and outreach sessions, but someone who walks into a health facility to get their child vaccinated should not be turned away.

24-05-2020||New Delhi||Domestic flights to resume on Monday amid confusion as several states set own rules||Indian skies will open up for domestic passenger flights from Monday after a gap of two months but there was confusion following imposition of own set of conditions and rules by several states which are at odds with each other.Many states like West Bengal and Tamil Nadu were opposed to opening up of their airports in view of rising cases of the coronavirus infection, making it difficult for the airlines as well as the civil aviation authorities to resume services.Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal are home to some of the busiest airports in terms of passenger traffic.Earlier Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said on Twitter that it is “extremely ill-advised” to reopen airports in red zones.In the evening, cabinet minister Nawab Malik said the Maharashtra government has decided to permit 25 flights to land and take off from Mumbai airport from Monday.West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said she will urge the Centre to postpone resumption of domestic flight services at Kolkata and Bagdogra airports by a few days.On Sunday afternoon, AirAsia India said on Twitter that all passengers must read the health protocols of the destination states and it would “not be responsible for repatriating or bearing any quarantine or related costs of any guests”.In the midst of uncertainty and confusion, representatives of airline and several states held multiple meetings with top officials of the Civil Aviation Ministry on Sunday covering a range of contentious issues like quarantine rules for flyers and standard operating procedures for leading airports, officials said.The focus of the deliberations was to have uniform quarantine rules following announcement of separate conditions by various state governments. However, it is not immediately clear whether uniform quarantine rules as envisaged could be finalised in the meetings.The government last week announced resumption of the domestic flight services from May under specific rules and guidelines like cap on ticket pricing, wearing of face masks by passengers, no food served on board planes and making available details of medical conditions by travellers through Aarogya Setu app or by filling up of a self-declaration form.The government’s decision came as the aviation sector was reeling under severe stress triggered by the coronavirus lockdown that began on March 25.However, many states expressed serious reservations to the Centre’s decision to start the flight services. Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Bihar, Punjab, Assam and Andhra Pradesh have announced their respective quarantine measures for passengers arriving at their airports.Some states decided to put passengers on mandatory institutional quarantine while several others talked about putting them under home quarantine.Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Saturday questioned the need for quarantine if a passenger is shown green status in Aarogya Setu app. The green status signifies that a passenger is safe.However, as the states remained adamant on the matter, the central government is trying to create coherence in quarantine rules for flyers, officials said.They said bookings have been opened for around 1,050 domestic flights that will operate on Monday.Several executives from a number of airlines said since Mumbai airport and Kolkata airport handle a significant share of domestic flights, the operators are expecting the Centre to clarify the “prevailing confusion” relating to quarantine.“Clarity is required on matters regarding quarantine and flights to Mumbai and Kolkata as it is affecting our bookings. Passengers are reluctant to book in such an environment,” said an executive of a low cost carrier.The Jammu and Kashmir government said on Saturday that all incoming passengers will have to undergo 14 days of “administrative quarantine”.Similarly, the Kerala government said on Friday that all flyers will be put into 14 days’ home quarantine and that it has made an exception to those coming for business purpose or for a short duration.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had said all incoming passengers will be put in home quarantine for 14 days while the Bihar government said that travellers will be put on “paid quarantine” for 14 days.Passengers coming to Andhra Pradesh would be put under home quarantine, said the state government, adding that once their test results for COVID-19 come negative, they will be relieved from quarantine.The Assam government on Friday said it will be putting flyers on a 14-day quarantine. The passengers might be distributed equally in home quarantine and government quarantine, it clarified.Karnataka government’s health ministry made it clear that anyone coming from states where there is “high prevalence” of COVID-19 will be kept in institutional quarantine for seven days and if tested COVID-negative, the passenger will have to spend the next seven days in home quarantine.Karnataka has classified Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh as “high prevalence” states.The passengers coming through remaining states in the country to Karnataka will have to undergo 14 days of home quarantine.However, the Karnataka health department clarified that special cases where businessmen are coming for urgent work will not require to undergo any quarantine if they bring test results that are not more than two days old and show them COVID-negative.Puri’s announcement on Wednesday that airlines will resume domestic passenger flights from Monday came as a big breather for the aviation sector.Saujanya Shrivastava, Chief Operating Officer - Flights, MakeMyTrip and Goibibo, said: “With domestic flights taking off after 61 days of lockdown, there is an understandable apprehension amongst flyers. That said, we expect the situation to smoothen out as flyers gradually get attuned to the new safety protocols.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/domestic-flights-to-resume-on-monday-amid-confusion-as-several-states-set-own-rules-89379
24-05-2020||Lucknow||Mayawati a ‘Twitter behanji’ and ‘undeclared spokesperson of BJP’: Congress||The Congress, on Sunday, described BSP chief Mayawati as a “Twitter behanji” and “undeclared spokesperson of the BJP”, “angry with the grand old party’s “proactive” efforts to mitigate migrant workers’ miseries amid the COVID-19 lockdown.Congress leader PL Punia hit back at Mayawati a day after the BSP described Rahul Gandhi’s meeting with migrant workers a “drama”, in a language allegedly similar to that of the BJP.“The language and the tweets, which the ‘Twitter behanji’ is using clearly indicates that she makes the press note for the BJP and sends it,” Punia told reporters.“She feels angry over the proactive efforts of the Congress and its general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (in mitigating the poor’s plight amid the lockdown),” he added.Punia also accused the BSP of having a “tacit understanding” with the BJP while the Congress’ SC cell chairman Brijlal Khabri said: “Mayawati is the undeclared spokesperson of the BJP.”“There seems to be a tacit understanding between the BSP and BJP, as the both have termed Rahul Gandhi’s meeting with poor labourers as drama,” said Punia.Punia also accused Mayawati of being silent amid the alleged rise in incidents of attacks on the Dalits during the Yogi Adityanath government’s tenure in Uttar Pradesh.“The list of attacks on Dalits is long, and it is taking place under the patronage of the government. We have been raising questions and fighting on this. But why is the self-proclaimed leader of Dalits silent?” he asked.

24-05-2020||New Delhi||Feeling ‘cheated’ by parties & govts, many returning migrants question why they cast votes||Nineteen-year-old Roshan Shrivastav was looking forward to finally being able to vote since he turned 18 a year ago, till enduring pain and suffering as a migrant during the lockdown shook his faith in the system.A native of Siwan district in Bihar, Roshan arrived in Delhi soon after Holi this year to find a job and support his family. He is now desperate to return home, an endeavour that has turned out to be his biggest struggle in the city.On Friday evening, Roshan along with his nephew Shivam Shrivastav (19) and friend Prince Gupta (21) were turned back by the police when they attempted to cross the Delhi-UP border, near Ghazipur, in the hope of somehow reaching their homes in Bihar.The trio, who lived in a rented single-room flat in Baljeet Nagar, west Delhi, said their landlord was “kind” to them and did not ask for rent.“But politicians play games with us around election times with fake, hollow promises, sympathise with the poor and then forget us,” an anguished Roshan said.“The way villagers and poor migrants are literally dying in the streets, some on railway tracks, some in road accidents, as if their life does not matter to anyone, it has shaken me,” he said.Feeling that people like him have been “abandoned by the government” in this time of crisis and having “lost faith in the system”, Roshan said he has decided to either not cast his vote at all or choose the NOTA option in the future elections.“I have just become eligible to vote but I have vowed to not vote for any party or politician. Be it the coming Bihar polls, next general elections, or any other elections in future. We feel cheated,” he said.While agreeing with Roshan, Shivam said he would not exercise his franchise at all in any election.Echoing similar feelings of hurt and discontentment, Prince said: “This COVID-19 crisis has exposed the government. I have decided to either not vote or choose NOTA from here on.”Roshan said when they would reach their homes, they would tell people in their hometown to “not waste their votes on scheming politicians and unscrupulous political parties”.It took Adesh Singh and his wife Manju, along with their three small children, three days to reach their hometown Shahjahanpur in UP after they left their accommodation in south Delhi.“We work hard to earn our living. We don’t beg or steal. We may be poor, but we are also citizens of this country with equal rights granted to us. But perhaps, we are the lesser equals because we are not rich,” said a teary-eyed Manju, her mouth covered with a dupatta, as the couple haggled with taxi drivers at the Delhi-UP border to take them home without charging an exorbitant fare.“This government was talking about bringing people from foreign countries under the CAA, but it is clear they can’t handle their own population and are still trying to get more people into our country from abroad,” she said.“Why should we vote for any of these parties? All of them are of the same ilk. We don’t need sympathy, we need dignity,” rued Adesh, who worked in a factory in Delhi.“The purpose of a lockdown is understood, but poor people who have been left stranded with no jobs or money, should they just die of starvation?” he asked.After an arduous journey, the family finally reached home on Saturday morning.Bareilly native Mahendra Singh, stranded in Delhi since the lockdown began, said he had made several attempts to leave the city but in vain.“We hoped that the government of Delhi or UP or the central government, any of them would help us. But they all disappointed us. Now we don’t have faith in any of them. ‘Ab bas apne pair par vishwas hai’(We just believe in our two feet now),” Singh said, willing to walk all the way to his home, almost 300 km away.Lakhs of migrant workers stranded in Delhi and other big cities, far from their homes, have been attempting to reach their native places since the lockdown was imposed about two months ago. A large number of them have been walking on foot for scores of kilometres after they could find no mode of conveyance.A migrant woman recently delivered a baby on the road while walking from Nashik, Maharashtra to Satna in MP, over 1,000 km apart. She rested for two hours after delivery and then walked another 150 km with her family, prompting the National Human Rights Commission to send notices to the Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh governments.Roshan and Shivam said they both wrote and sang songs in Hindi and their native tongue Bhojpuri.“We have written a few lines on lockdown crisis too — ‘Hum mazdooran ke ghar bhejwa da sarkar, nahin to ketna log hiyan par ho jai bimar’ (please send us home or else many would fall sick here). Maybe we will complete this song after we reach home, but first we need to complete our journey,” Shivam said.

24-05-2020||New Delhi||Heatwave: IMD issues 'red alert' for Punjab, Haryana and other parts of north India||With temperatures surpassing the 45 degrees Celsius-mark across several parts in north India, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday issued a "red" warning for Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Rajasthan for the next two days.The IMD has also issued an orange warning for a heatwave for east Uttar Pradesh, said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of IMD's Regional Meteorological Centre.He cautioned that temperatures could soar up to 47 degrees Celsius in some parts over the next 2-3 days.This is also for the first time this summer season that a red warning has been issued for a heatwave, Srivastava said.This season, the temperatures did not rise the way it usually does in the north and central India because of significant rainfall activity during April that continued till mid-May.On Saturday, Pilani in Rajasthan recorded 46.7 degrees Celsius."Heatwave conditions over some parts with a severe heatwave over isolated pockets are very likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha and Telangana during the next five days," the IMD said in its daily bulletin.It added that heatwave conditions in isolated pockets over Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Gujarat, central Maharashtra and Vidarbha, coastal Andhra Pradesh, Yanam, Rayalseema and north interior Karnataka are also likely during the next 3-4 days.A heatwave is declared when the maximum temperature is at least 40 degrees Celsius and the departure from normal temperature is 4.5 degrees Celsius to 6.4 degrees Celsius.For the plains, a heatwave is declared when the actual maximum temperature is 45 degrees Celsius and severe heatwave when it is 47 degrees Celsius or above.The IMD issues colour-coded warnings depending on the intensity of any weather system in ascending order – green, yellow, orange and red.Srivastava said the red warning has been issued to caution people not to step out from 1 pm to 5 pm when the intensity of the heat is the most.Naresh Kumar, a scientist with the National Weather Forecasting Centre of the IMD, said due to dry north-westerly winds and a trough between Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu, conditions are favourable for heatwave to severe heatwave.Kumar said relief is only expected after May 28 as a western disturbance is likely to bring some rainfall.A western disturbance is a cyclonic storm that originates in the Mediterranean and travels across Central Asia. When it comes in contact with the Himalayas, it brings rains to the hills and plains.

24-05-2020||Cuttack (Odisha)||Sex on false promise of marriage not rape: Orissa High Court||In a significant observation, a judge of the Orissa High Court has observed that indulgence in sexual intercourse on false promise of marriage does not amount to rape.Justice S K Panigrahi also raised questions about whether rape laws should be used to regulate intimate relationships, especially in cases where women enter into a relationship by choice.Justice Panigrahi made the observations on Thursday while allowing the bail application of a rape accused, setting aside a lower court order.The case related to the arrest of a student from Koraput district of Odisha under rape charges on a complaint by a 19-year-old tribal woman in November last year.According to the case records, the young man and the woman of the same village were in a physical relationship for about four years and she got pregnant twice during that period.The woman later lodged a police complaint alleging that the man had established physical relation with her taking advantage of her innocence and promising that he will marry her.The woman had claimed that she was coerced by the accused into terminating her pregnancies by consuming abortion pills.Police registered a case and arrested the man, who was in jail for the last six months.The high court on Thursday allowed his bail application on the condition that he will cooperate with the prosecution and shall not threaten the alleged victim.In his 12-page order, Justice Panigrahi discussed the rape laws in detail and observed that “a consensual relationship without even any assurance obviously will not attract the offence under Section 376 of the IPC (rape)”.Noting that there was a need to delve into the issue, Justice Panigrahi said questions are often raised as to how such cases are addressed by the statute and judicial pronouncements.He, however, also observed that the rape laws often fail to address the plight of socially-disadvantaged and poor victims, who get lured into sex by men on false promise of marriage.

24-05-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown may not end on May 31:  Uddhav Thackeray||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said it was wrong to impose the lockdown suddenly and now it cannot be lifted all at once.Amid the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra, Thackeray also said there was a need to be extra cautious during the upcoming monsoon. The coronavirus-induced lockdown cannot be lifted even by May 31, he said"It was wrong to impose the lockdown suddenly. It will be equally wrong to lift it in one go. It will be a double whammy for our own people," he said in a televised message.Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown from March 24 midnight to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection. It was later extended, and currently, the fourth phase of lockdown, with some relaxations, is on and will continue till May 31.Thackeray, whose party Shiv Sena parted ways with long-term ally BJP last year, said though the Union government has been of little help, he would not indulge in any political mudslinging."The Maharashtra government has not yet received its due GST amount. The Centres share of train ticket cost (for facilitating transportation of migrant labourers to their native places) is yet to be received. There is still a shortage of some medicines. Earlier, we did face a shortage of PPE kits and other equipment, he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-may-not-end-on-may-31-uddhav-thackeray-89355

Lingade killed Shinde first, kept his body in a bathroom, and then went to where the sadhu resided, killed him,” the SP said.He kept the body of the sadhu in the car and tried to escape but the vehicle dashed into the gate of the ashram, which woke up residents nearby, the SP said.“As the residents came out, in the melee, the accused fled on a two-wheeler. The body of the sadhu was found in the car. Lingade has a murder case against his name, which was registered at Dharmabad police station some 10 years ago,” the SP said.He said evidence of substance abuse by the accused has also been found near the ZP school here.After the arrest of Lingade, Magar said robbery was the motive as the former had fled with Rs 70,000 and a laptop.Tweeting about the double murder, senior BJP leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said, “Incident of brutal murder of a sadhu and other sevekari in Nanded district is shocking and painful. My heartfelt tributes.”“It is my request to the state government that all the accused must be immediately arrested and to ensure that they are severely punished,” he added in the tweet. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sadhu-man-killed-in-nanded-accused-held-near-telangana-border-89350

The handbook also details guidelines for students as well as parents, listing the do's and dont's and activities to understand the sensitivity of the issue."Students must learn to set limits to their online friendships as well as online communication with real-life friends. There has to be a limit to what they share or exchange in terms of written words, photographs or videos. They must remember that, once online, they may not be able to control who will actually see it, prevent a breach of trust and misuse and potential risk and harm to their person and reputation," a senior board official said."Teenagers need to understand gender relations. Boys must learn to interact with girls on equal terms and respect them and their desires as those of human beings, not simply as objects of respect or desires," the official said."Consent must be an important part of relationships. Pictures, videos and other material shared in confidence cannot be published on social media without the permission of the person just because the other person does not want to continue in a relationship. Youngsters must learn to cope with rejection as it is a part of life but not the end of the world," the official added.The board has advised parents to empower children to decide for themselves how others collect and use their information by requiring their consent."As of now, there is no minimum age of digital consent in India. If there are people offline who you would be uncomfortable talking to about your physical or sexual experiences, chances are, you would be uncomfortable doing this with strangers online too. Cyber Groomers create fake accounts to befriend people, for the purpose of harming them whether physically, sexually or emotionally," the official said."Students must be cautious when their chat partner gives them many compliments regarding their appearance within a short span of their acquaintance. Do not talk to people who ask you to share your sexually explicit photographs or videos. Never accept a friend request from someone you have never met in person. If you share your sexually explicit photos or videos with someone, the person can share those photos with others or post them on social media. They can also blackmail you," the official added.The handbook warns against falling into the trap of revenge pornography."Teenagers in the age-group of 14 to 18 years are the worst victims of revenge porn as well as the perpetrators themselves, which is a matter of concern. Some teenage students who have been in a relationship and end it find their explicit photographs circulated on social media platforms. When such images go viral, students are often harassed and bullied by their peers – branded with insult and in the end, isolated," the handbook states."A teenager may be targeted by her jealous classmates, her ex-boyfriend or even an unknown friend on social media who may be victimising her because she stopped communicating with him when she realised the dangers of online relationships," says the handbook.Earlier this month, a massive outrage erupted online after it emerged that an Instagram group named ''bois locker room'' was being used by some persons to share objectionable pictures of minor girls and discuss illegal acts including rape.People posted purported screenshots of crude conversations among members of the group – believed to be students of some top schools in Delhi and some allegedly as young as 13. It is alleged that they shared photos of teenage girls and made explicit comments about their looks.However, during its investigation into the 'Bois Locker Room' case, the Delhi police have stumbled upon a conversation on Snapchat where a girl, posing as a male, suggested a "sexual assault plan" to a boy just to test his "values and character".

Agitated residents blocked roads in several areas in south Kolkata on Saturday, demanding restoration of electricity and water supply which are not available since Wednesday afternoon.In places like Mudiali in south Kolkata, locals stepped in with saws to clear roads blocked by uprooted trees.Mobile and internet services were restored in some areas of the city even as many places in South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas and East Midnapore remained cut off.On Friday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee described the situation as “more than a national calamity” and put the estimated loss at more than Rs 1 lakh crore. She had stated that more than six crore people have been affected by the cyclone.Prime Minister Narendra Modi along with Banerjee had conducted an aerial survey of the affected areas in South and North 24 Parganas districts on Friday.

24-05-2020||New Delhi||Migrant woes 'greatest manmade tragedy' in India since Partition: Ramchandra Guha||The unfolding miseries of millions of poor people in the world's largest coronavirus lockdown are the ”greatest manmade tragedy” in India since Partition, says historian and economist Ramchandra Guha.Cautioning that there will be social and psychological consequences for the rest of the country too, he said the migrant tragedy could have been averted or at least minimised if Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given them a week's notice to return home before the lockdown kicked in."It is probably not as bad as Partition, for at that time there was also horrific communal violence. But it is nonetheless the greatest manmade tragedy in India since Partition," Guha told PTI in an interview.In a televised address on the evening of March 24, Prime Minister Modi announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown from midnight that day. The lockdown measures included banning train services, road transport and air travels to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.The lockdown was extended thrice but certain relaxations have been allowed since late April."I have no idea about how the prime minister took the decisions he did. Did he consult with knowledgeable officials, or take inputs from his cabinet ministers? Or did he act unilaterally?” asked the author of books such as “Redeeming the Republic” and “India After Gandhi”.Even now, he added, the situation can be "slightly" salvaged if the prime minister chooses to adopt a more consultative approach, and takes advice from the best minds in the country, including those in the Opposition."But I rather fear that he won't. His cabinet ministers are busy shifting the responsibility to the states for cleaning up a crisis the Centre has created," the noted historian added.Days after the lockdown came into force, lakhs of migrants, including daily wage workers, walked, cycled or hitchhiked to their home states hundreds, sometimes thousands, of kilometres away. Two months on, the exodus from cities and towns across India continues.The images of their struggle for survival shook the nation and made global headlines, raising questions about the government's handling of the situation.Arguing that the tragedy could have been averted if Modi had given the migrant workers at least a week's notice to return home, Guha said, "That he or his advisers did not think of the consequences of a lockdown at four hours notice is mystifying. They bear direct responsibility for the humanitarian tragedy that has since unfolded."Guha said the tragedy has three dimensions -- public health, economy and society."Had the migrants been allowed to go home in mid-March, when few had COVID, they would have been safely re-integrated with their communities. Now, with so many of them infected, they are carriers of the disease," he said.Discussing the impact of the migrant crisis on the economy, he said it would have a cascading effect.“The economy was already in a shambles before the pandemic, and now it is in a state of near collapse. The unemployment rate is in the region of 25 per cent."The social and psychological dimensions are also important; now, migrants who have after so much trouble and suffering finally returned home will be unwilling to return to factories and cities in search of work," the economist said.To a question on overall challenges such as a crumbling economy, allegations of threat to its founding principles and the pandemic facing the country, he said he is today more pessimistic about India than he has been ever been."This is the greatest crisis India has faced since Partition. Then, we had towering politicians like Nehru, Patel, and Ambedkar; and great, selfless social workers like Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay and Mridula Sarabhai," he said."These leaders set aside their personal and political differences to work together to unite India and rebuild its society and economy. Now, when we face a crisis of comparable magnitude, those in power at the Centre can think only of building their individual brand or promoting the interests of their own party," Guha observed."Unless that changes, and changes soon, our future seems terribly bleak," he said.The Indian economy, Asia's third-largest, has been hit hard by the nearly two-month lockdown of 1.3 billion people. Lakhs of people have lost their livelihoods while numerous sectors, including tourism, service industry, retail trade, real estate and manufacturing, are staring at a grim future due to huge losses.On May 12, Modi announced a Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package to revive the economy. It is not clear yet how far it will impact to bring back the economy on its tracks.According to an assessment by the Reserve Bank of India, the economy is expected to contract for the first time in nearly 40 years, due to demand compression and supply disruptions.

24-05-2020||New Delhi||Health infrastructure must be ramped up to ensure preparedness for next 2 months: Govt||Health infrastructure should be ramped up to ensure preparedness for the next two months in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has conveyed to eleven municipal areas in the country that have accounted for 70 per cent of India’s coronavirus case load.Eleven municipal areas from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Rajasthan account for 70 per cent of the active caseload, the Union health ministry said in a statement.The government has asked the eleven municipal areas to step up monitoring in old cities, urban slums and other high density pockets like camps and clusters for migrant workers for management of COVID-19 cases.Union Health Secretary Preeti Sudan, who held a high-level meeting on Saturday through video conferencing with principal health secretaries and municipal commissioners along with other officials from the 11 municipal areas, urged them to focus on prevention through active screening of high risk and vulnerable population along with effective and sturdy clinical management of the admitted cases to reduce fatality rate.COVID-19 cases in India saw the biggest spike for the third consecutive day on Sunday with 6,767 new infections reported in the last 24 hours, taking the nationwide tally to 1,31,868, while the death toll due to the disease rose to 3,867 after 147 more fatalities, the Union Health Ministry said on Sunday.The active cases of the coronavirus disease rose to 73,560. While 54,440 people have recovered, one patient has migrated to another country, according to the ministry’s bulletin.“Thus, around 41.28 per cent patients have recovered so far,” a Health Ministry official said.During the meeting on Saturday, a presentation was made to highlight the trend in case trajectory with respect to total confirmed cases, case fatality rate, doubling time, tests per million and confirmation percentage, the ministry said.“It was told that a major challenge lies in those corporations having shorter doubling time, higher mortality rate and a higher confirmation rate than the national average,” the ministry said in its statement.The officials were briefed about the factors to be considered while mapping the containment and buffer zones and the activities mandated in containment zones like perimeter control, active search for cases through house to house surveillance, contact tracing, clinical management of the active cases.They were also asked to undertake surveillance activities in the buffer zone like monitoring of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza like illness (ILI) cases and promoting social distancing and hand hygiene among others.It was pointed out that testing needs to be stepped up in some municipal areas to ensure early detection of cases, timely clinical management and a reduction in fatality rate.“They also need to be mindful of ramping up the health infrastructure to ensure preparedness for the next two months with special focus on isolation beds with oxygen, ventilators and ICU beds,” the health ministry statement said.Other issues that need focused attention include active coordination with government and private labs to address delays in sample collection, partnership with private hospitals to augment the health/bed capacity, waste disposal and disinfection of COVID positive areas, management of camps for migrant labourers, creating awareness regarding issues such as stigmatization of patients and medical professionals in local languages, actively involving community leaders, youth groups, NGOs and SHGs in accompanying surveillance teams for awareness and confidence building measures, it said.“Maintaining high vigilance and monitoring in areas of old cities, urban slums and other high density pockets along with the camps/clusters for migrant workers are important steps in COVID-19 management in the urban areas,” Sudan said at the meeting.The officials were also urged to focus on prevention through active screening of high risk and vulnerable population and groups, and effective and sturdy clinical management of the admitted cases to reduce fatality rate.While many have operationalised 24x7 state control rooms, others could also follow the lead and start such units which shall not only provide assistance to the people regarding various facilities and services for COVID-19 management, but also have a panel of domain experts and doctors to provide round the clock support and mentoring for clinical issues, the statement said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/health-infrastructure-must-be-ramped-up-to-ensure-preparedness-for-next-2-months-govt-89336

24-05-2020||Hyderabad||Lockdown relaxation is the time to be extra cautious, say doctors||With the increased movement of people on roads and other public places following the relaxation of lockdown norms by the Central and state governments, one must be extra cautious to avoid being contracted by the deadly coronavirus, say doctors.According to them, people need to be especially careful by taking all preventive measures while using public places."This is the time when one must stay extra cautious to ensure they do not contract the deadly coronavirus from carriers," said Dr Arabind Panda, senior consultant urologist, KIMS Hospitals.He believes that there is an added responsibility on the people who operate stores and public places to ensure the surroundings are disinfected on a continuous basis.Office spaces, including conference rooms, should be cleaned every evening after office hours or early in the morning before the rooms are occupied. If the contact surface is visibly dirty, it should be cleaned with soap and water prior to disinfection."Covid-19 virus is transmitted in most instances through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cases and also through contaminated surfaces/objects. Though the virus survives on environmental surfaces for a varied period, it gets inactivated by chemical disinfectants. All indoor areas to a shop or office such as entrance lobbies, corridors and staircases, escalators, elevators, security guard booths, office rooms, meeting rooms, cafeteria should be mopped with a disinfectant like sodium hypochlorite or 7% phenol twice daily," he said.Disinfectants with 70 per cent alcohol can be used to wipe down surfaces like metal where the use of sodium hypochlorite is not suitable. Benzalkonium Chloride or any other disinfectants found to be effective against coronavirus may be used as per manufacturer's instructions.The doctor said masks are effective if worn according to instructions and properly fitted. It is important not to touch the masks or the face. Disposable masks should be discarded if they become physically damaged or soaked. Reusable cloth masks should be washed daily with detergents and water and then dried thoroughly before being reused.Dr. Saji Dsouza, Chairman & Managing Director, KSAC group of Hospitals, said with life slowly starting to fall back to the rhythm with lockdown relaxation, a 'new normal' set of guidelines for everyone to follow has taken birth."Wash your hands for 20 seconds when and where possible. Face and its parts should be covered with appropriate masks and should not be touched frequently. Sanitise your hands before and after every contact. 'Namaste' is the best way to greet anyone, maintain physical distancing of at least one meter from the next fellow being," he said.Dr Saji is of the view that people should avoid any form of the crowd. "Any purchases of fruits/ vegetables bought should be thoroughly washed with baking powder mixed in hot water or hot saline before consumption. Drink your own beverages from home to keep you hydrated."Eat dishes made of amla, ginger, garlic, black pepper, turmeric etc." Dr Nishanth Sinha, Consultant Pulmonologist, Continental Hospitals, too, feels that as lockdown is eased and people have started coming out, extra care must be taken at the workplace and while using public transport."Wear facemask all the time. Maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet. Don't go shopping as a source of entertainment, do the shopping swiftly, and efficiently. Avoid using your fingertips to push a door or a button. Use your knuckles, knees, feet etc. Carry extra napkins, masks and disinfecting wipe if possible. Avoid giving a lift to any unknown person in your car or bike."At workplaces, people should wear masks all the time, maintain social distancing and wash hands many times with soap and water.

24-05-2020||Lucknow||Mobile phones banned in UP's Covid-19 hospitals||The Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh has banned Corona patients from keeping mobile phones inside isolation wards of COVID-19 hospitals in the state.Patients admitted in dedicated L-2 and L-3 COVID-19 hospitals will no longer be allowed to take mobile phones along with them in the isolation wards in order to check the spread of the infection.According to an order issued by the state government late on Saturday night, two mobile phones will now be available with the ward in-charge of the COVID-19 care centres so that patients and talk to their family members and administration if required.Further, the orders specify that the mobile numbers should be communicated to the family members of the patients also.Director General Medical Education, K.K. Gupta, who issued the order, has informed all concerned officials and directors of dedicated COVID-19 hospitals.अगर मोबाइल से संक्रमण फैलता है तो आइसोलेशन वार्ड के साथ पूरे देश में इसे बैन कर देना चाहिए. यही तो अकेले में मानसिक सहारा बनता है. वस्तुतः अस्पतालों की दुर्व्यवस्था व दुर्दशा का सच जनता तक न पहुँचे, इसीलिए ये पाबंदी है. ज़रूरत मोबाइल की पाबंदी की नहीं बल्कि सैनेटाइज़ करने की है."To facilitate the communication between COVID-19 patients admitted in clinics, with their family members, or anyone else, ensure that two dedicated mobile phones while adhering to infection prevention norms, are kept with ward in-charge of COVID-19 care centre," the order said.According to the latest data available on the website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Uttar Pradesh now has 5,735 cases of corona positive patients and the numbers have been growing steadily since the past ten days.Questioning the Uttar Pradesh government’s decision to prohibit coronavirus patients from using mobile phones inside isolation wards of COVID-19 hospitals, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday said the ban was put in place to hide the “poor condition” of hospitals in the state.             In a tweet in hindi, the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said: “If infection spreads through mobile phones, then they should be banned across the country. Mobile phones provide mental support and help cope with loneliness.”       “In fact, the ban has been put in place, so that the truth about the poor condition of hospitals does reach the common public.

Mere thermal scanning of passengers inadequate w/o swabs. Impossible to have autos/cabs/buses ply in current circumstances. Adding positive passenger will add COVID stress to the red zone," Deshmukh tweeted on Sunday."Getting passengers to come from a green zone to a red one putting them to risk of exposure doesn't make sense.Keeping a busy airport up & running with all COVID-safety measures will need huge staff presence and compound risk in the red zone," the minister added.Of the 47,190 cases in Maharashtra, 28,817 are from Mumbai. The financial capital also accounts for 949 COVID-19 deaths.The worst-hit Mumbai Metropolitan Region, which includes Mumbai and surrounding satellite towns, has reported 36,173 cases and 1,069 deaths.

Environmentalists, however, have put the number at 10,000.The trees, which absorb carbon emissions, had played a significant role in improving the air quality in the city during the lockdown.“More than a third of the roadside trees in the city seem to have been wiped out. We foresee a serious rise in PM 2.5 levels from the first week of September, when an estimated eight lakh vehicles will hit the roads post-lockdown,” environmentalist Somendra Nath Ghosh said.An official of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board said that trees will have to be planted on a large scale during the coming monsoon season.“We will launch a plantation drive once things settle down. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has also called for plantation of trees to restore the green cover,” Member of KMC’s Board of Administrators and former mayor-in-council (Parks), Debashis Kumar said.But first, the uprooted trees have to be removed on an urgent basis and the job is being done on a war footing, he said.“Ten trees will need to be planted to compensate for the loss of one fully-grown tree. This is the standard practice,” he said.Around 200 trees were uprooted in the Rabindra Sarobar area itself, Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) Executive Engineer Sudhin Nandy said.KMDA, custodian of the Rabindra Sarobar Lake, will replant at least 100 of the fallen trees, he said.The extremely severe cyclone has also damaged the world’s largest banyan tree in Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden in Howrah’s Shibpur, Botanical Survey of India scientist Shiv Kumar said.Many other trees in the botanical garden have been uprooted, an official of the establishment said.“We are yet to assess the total damages. We will see which trees can be replanted and where planting saplings of the same species will be required,” he added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kolkata-stares-at-rise-in-pollution-levels-due-to-green-cover-loss-say-environmentalists-89294

24-05-2020||Gurnaaz Kaur||Uma Gurbaksh Singh took Punjabi theatre to new heights||At the tender age of 13, she took up the baton to take Punjabi theatre to greater heights and succeeded. Uma Gurbaksh Singh, fondly called the first lady of Punjabi theatre, passed away at the age of 93. Needless to say, the loss is humongous and memories galore.From being the first female actor in the Punjabi play “Raj Kumari Latika” in 1939, when women were not expected to act or be part of theatre in any capacity, to doing a role of a lover alongside her elder brother Navtej Singh, her entry was etched in time.But that was just the beginning, quite a progressive one at that. Soon, she headed protest plays as part of the nationalist movement. Uma Gurbaksh was among the seven female artistes, who was imprisoned for staging the play “Hulle Hulare” against the British rule in India.Her love for theatre and the way she promoted it is reckoned by one and all. “She lived a beautiful life and her contribution to Punjabi theatre is unmatched. She patiently promoted the art and would come to watch plays, attend seminars and be a part of script readings until recently,” shares Kewal Dhaliwal, president, Punjab Sangeet Natak Akademi.In Preet Nagar, she was instrumental in bringing about an auditorium, which Dhaliwal says, is on a par with any international conference hall.“For the past 20 years, every third Wednesday a show is presented at the auditorium. She took great care of the artistes; from their stay to their meals, she made sure everything was looked after.” Uma was an inspiration for many more girls. Following in her footsteps and with her support, several of her women friends joined theatre. That’s when they became a group of seven. According to playwright and theatre director Sahib Singh, “Even in jail, she protested. It reflects how daring she was as a person,” Singh said.Even after being so educated and forward, Uma chose to stay close to her roots and not move to a city. She was a fine classical singer, a sitarist and wrote stories for kids.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uma-gurbaksh-singh-took-punjabi-theatre-to-new-heights-89108

24-05-2020||Ajay Banerjee||India, China see tension mounting in Ladakh||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 23Armed forces of India and China have literally “dug in” their boots at separate locations along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Eastern Ladakh. The Chinese have a huge build up that includes upcoming military-style bunkers, new upcoming permanent structures, military trucks, road-building equipment and even a warehouse.Some of the structures, military camps, road-building equipment and trucks are within the territory of India and in areas that are not disputed, like those at the confluence of the Galwan and Shyok rivers in what is defined as the sub-sector north (SSN).“Matters could escalate. This is by far the most tense situation since 1962,” said an official. An Australia-based security analyst tweeted what he claimed were satellite images of Chinese “incursion” in Galwan.At Galwan, India and China never disputed the alignment of the LAC. India’s new road, the 255-km Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Baig Oldie (DSDBO) road has seemingly caused this flare up. The road is within the Indian territory and provides all weather access to the DBO, Depsang plains and the Karakoram pass. Opposite of the road or eastwards of it is the Aksai Chin plateau, illegally occupied by China.In the valley along the Galwan river, the China infrastructure is poor. The other flashpoint is the north bank of Pangong Tso, a 135-km glacial melt lake at an altitude of more than 14,000 feet. China is objecting to a road made by India between one of the eight mountain spurs that end at the lake. Each of the spur is identified as “finger” in the military parlance and each ridgeline is separated by 2-5 km. On the night intervening May 5 and 6, troops of either side had clashed, resulting in injuries to many.India assumes the LAC to be at Finger 4. China is trying to push Indian troops back to Finger 2, a distance of more than 10 km.Structures in Indian territory||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-see-tension-mounting-in-ladakh-89083

She said clear instructions had been given at a meeting with CEOs and MDs of public sector banks and financial institutions that the banks should not be scared to extend loans as 100 per cent guarantee was being given by the government.In case of default, the individual bank or official would not be hauled up, she said in a conversation with BJP leader Nalin Kohli uploaded on the party’s social media platforms.“If a decision goes wrong, and if there is a loss, the government has given 100 per cent guarantee now. It is not at all going to be on the individual official and on the bank and, therefore, without fear they should take this automatic route ...,” she said.It is being said that genuine bonafide decisions in the banking sector are being impacted because of worry of undue harassment by the CBI, CVC and CAG. “The Finance Ministry has taken several steps to allay those fears, including withdrawing some notifications which were causing fears among bankers,” she said.On criticism about leaving out critical sectors, including hospitality, auto and civil aviation, in the economic package, Sitharaman said the government had not taken a sectoral approach but a holistic one.She expressed the hope that from June 1, liquidity would start flowing from banks without any new collateral. During the meeting with bankers, the Finance Minister said it was emphasised that the loans should be sanctioned in a simple manner and, if possible, digitally. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/extend-loan-without-fear-finance-minister-tells-banks-89084

The straw in the wind also suggests that expectation in the Opposition camp of the BSP joining an anti-BJP formulation featuring Congress in it was discovery of the proverbial mare’s nest.This is an ominous signal as the BSP is a potent force in the country’s largest state of UP, and has support base in various parts of the country to reckon with.

We can also run trains within states and around 10-12 lakh can travel on them,” Yadav said. The Railways has run 2,600 Shramik Special trains in the past 23 days, carrying around 36 lakh migrants. About 31 per cent of the passengers were from Bihar and 48 per cent from Uttar Pradesh. “Social distancing norms and protocols for Covid-19 are being followed. We have operated 260 Shramik Special trains every day on an average for the last four days, carrying 3 lakh passengers daily,” Yadav stated.On operating 200 pairs of special passenger trains from June 1, Yadav said some 17 lakh passengers had booked tickets so far. To a question on fares for the special trains to be operated from June 1, he said the Railways was charging pre-lockdown normal fares only. He reiterated that 85 per cent of the expenses of Shramik Special trains were being borne by the Centre and the states were only paying 15 per cent in the form of fares.“Isolation coaches meant for Covid-infected people are yet to be deployed as 50 per cent of them will be used to run Shramik Special trains. An order issued earlier this week stated that 60 per cent of around 5,200 coaches, which have been converted so far, will be used in migrant special trains,” Yadav added.
