It shall be the responsibility of the head of the respective organisation to ensure 100 per cent coverage of the app among the employees”.Sunday’s guidelines also said district authorities “may advise” individuals to install the app on compatible mobile phones and regularly update their health status as this will facilitate timely provisions of medical attention to those individuals who are at risk.The last guidelines had said that the local authority “shall ensure 100 per cent coverage of Aarogya Setu app among the residents of containment zones”, a point no more mentioned in the latest one.Early this month, a French hacker and cyber security expert who goes by the name Elliot Alderson had claimed that “a security issue has been found” in the app and that “privacy of 90 million Indians is at stake”.The government had categorically rejected this claim saying no data or security breach has been identified in the app and “no personal information of any user has been proven to be at risk by this ethical hacker”.“We are continuously testing and upgrading our systems. Team Aarogya Setu assures everyone that no data or security breach has been identified,” the government had said through the app’s Twitter handle.

17-05-2020||---||WHO meet to consider India-backed proposal for probe into Covid response||New Delhi, May 17The crucial General Assembly of the World Health Organisation (WHO) will meet for two days from Monday to consider an India-backed resolution seeking an impartial and independent evaluation of the institution’s role in the current pandemic.The list of countries backing the resolution makes it clear that the intent is not to target WHO DG Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Among the countries that have co-sponsored the resolution are ones that would not lend weight to an anti-China resolution.Bangladesh, Belarus, Indonesia, Mozambique, Moldova, Russia, Turkey and Zambia are some of the co-sponsors whose interest in WHO are more wide-ranging.However, there will be considerable heat as all heads of delegation will address the Assembly. It will also consider a proposal relating to electing a new DG.The probe sought by over 60 countries is one among large number of proposals mentioned in the exhaustive seven-page resolution. The resolution has at times applauded the WHO’s efforts and appreciated its role in controlling the pandemic in developing countries, especially Africa whose 53 countries have tended to back Ghebreyesus, an Ethiopian.The resolution has also sought details of actions of WHO and its timelines for the Covid. Indicating that the countries behind the proposal were not entirely satisfied with WHO, they have sought a report on improving global pandemic prevention, preparedness and response capacity.The resolution has become the talking point ahead of the General Assembly meeting after a concerted campaign to include Taiwan as an observer does not seem to have received traction.The WHO was thrust into global power politics after US President Donald Trump accused Ghebreyesus of being complicit with China when it delayed reporting the pandemic. Ghebreyesus became DG in a divided polity, as for the first time, multiple candidates stood for the post in 2017.The US candidate lost to the current incumbent because of the backing from China and the developing countries.Ghebreyesus has tried to restore a balance between representation of developing and developed countries in the WHO. Its Geneva-based headquarters, which employs one-third of its total staff, had only 25.1 per cent from developing countries. The percentage has risen to 26.5 per cent after one year of a four-year campaign.Staff from developed countries has a high ratio in regional offices such as South East Asia offices (30 per cent). But reciprocation was absent in the Europe offices till the WHO DG started the program. Since then the percentage has risen from 19.1 per cent to 24.6 per cent.The main functions of the World Health Assembly are to determine the policies of WHO, appoint the Director-General, supervise financial policies and approve the proposed programme budget.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-meet-to-consider-india-backed-proposal-for-probe-into-covid-response-86069

But that does not mean that governments can suspend/abrogate/abuse laws so as to curtail the constitutionally guaranteed rights to the people,” the IAL said in a resolution.“The Indian Association of Lawyers registers its strong protest against these undemocratic actions, which in fact will hurt the economy in the longer run due to conflicts,” it said.It also expressed displeasure over the Supreme Court’s handling of PILs during the COVID-19 crisis.“It is distressing to note the manner in which the Supreme Court of India has failed to act promptly, decisively and effectively in many Public Interest Litigation cases,” it said. The IAL appealed to the government to take urgent steps for initiating large scale welfare measures to save the poor from hunger, depravation and malnutrition.  “Huge public investment is required forthwith to save the people on the one hand and to bring the economy back on the rails. Indecision and delay in this regard has caused huge suffering to the people and damage to the economy.

While the doubling time in the past 14 days was 11.5, it has improved to 13.6 in the last three days.”Also as of Saturday, 3.1 per cent of the active COVID-19 patients are in the ICU, 0.45 per cent are on ventilators and 2.7 per cent on oxygen support, the minister said.The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) announced on Sunday that the ongoing countrywide lockdown has been extended till May 31.

I truly believe that under PM Narendra Modi’s leadership, we will win this war against the pandemic.”        Elaborating on the health infrastructure preparedness, Vardhan said 916 dedicated COVID-19 hospitals with 1,80,473 beds -- 1,61,169 isolation and 19,304 ICU—and 2,044 dedicated health centres with 1,28,304 beds (1,17,775 isolation beds and 10,529 ICU beds) along with 9,536 quarantine centres and 6,309 care centres with 5,64,632 beds are now available in the country.The Union health minister said that while India sees a gets accustomed to a “new normal”, following simple hygiene measures like washing hands with soap frequently or using alcohol-based sanitizers, not spitting in public, sanitizing one’s workplace, using face covers in public places are a must.“Physical distancing is the most potent social vaccine available to us and hence it is advisable to ensure ‘Do Gaz ki Doori’ (two-years distance) while interacting with others and to limit social gatherings by opting virtual gatherings,” he said while people advising to travel only when it is absolutely necessary and not to visit crowded places to limit the exposure to the virus.Due precautions, safe handling of food can help prevent the spread of COVID-19, the minister said.The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has advised some simple steps like washing raw fruits and vegetables in potable water, having “fully cooked” meat, avoiding sharing of utensils and cleaning of surfaces such as tables with anti-bacterial bleach wipes that can be followed to ensure food safety.Vardhan expressed his gratitude to the services being rendered by frontline health workers such as doctors, nurses, ANMs, anganwadi workers as well as the pathologists, lab technicians, scientists and others since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the statement said.They have been working under tremendously high-risk conditions in their line of duty, to save their fellow countrymen, Vardhan said and emphasized that the nation needs to shun stigmatising them and applaud their contribution.“By shunning the stigma attached with COVID-19, we encourage people to report symptoms on time which will help in early detection and management of the cases thus improving the recovery rate in the country,” the health minister said.He also emphasised on the importance of downloading the Aarogya Setu app which helps in self-assessment and provides surveillance of COVID-19 positive cases.Additionally, Vardhan warned against falling prey to misinformation, rumours and myths or unfounded claims regarding the coronavirus infection.Highlighting that the daily testing capacity has increased to 1,00,000 tests through 373 government and 152 private laboratories, he said, “Cumulatively, 22,79,324 COVID-19 tests have been done so far of which 90,094 samples were tested on Saturday.”He also said the Centre has provided 90.22 lakh N-95 masks and 53.98 lakh Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) to the states, UTs and central institutions. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-doubling-time-in-india-improved-to-13-6-days-in-last-3-days-vardhan-86058

Centre shares key parameter with statesPunjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had on Saturday said the states should be allowed a simple containment/non-containment zone categorisation instead of the green/orange/red zone classification of the Central government.In a ‘Facebook Live’ interaction, Amarinder had pointed out that at present, the district as a whole is a single zone or at the most, there are two units i.e. municipal corporation area and non- municipal corporation area. As per the current system, Covid cases in one part of the district can result in classification of the entire district as red zone, thus putting severe restrictions on industry, shops, etc, he had noted, underlining the need to scrap this system and go for a containment-focused strategy.As per today’s guidelines issued by the Centre, “In the containment zones, only essential activities shall be allowed. There shall be strict perimeter control to ensure that there is no movement of people in or out of these zones, except for medical emergencies and for maintaining supply of essential goods and services.Guidelines of MoHFW shall be taken into consideration for the above purpose. In the containment zones, there shall be intensive contact tracing, house-to-house surveillance, and other clinical interventions, as required,” the fresh order said.The movement of individuals shall remain strictly prohibited between 7 pm to 7 am, except for essential activities.

Earlier this month, there were reports of a face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh and Sikkim.A senior officer at Headquarters Western Command, Chandimandir, under whose jurisdiction the area falls, however, declined to comment on the matter, saying that only the central government would respond to reports of any such cross border incident.He added that all activities along the border are monitored by different agencies regularly and any untoward or unusual incident is reported and shared amongst them as per established protocols. The peacetime management of the border is with the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Forces that maintains posts on the zero line.There have been reported instances of Chinese helicopters violating Indian airspace in Himachal Pradesh earlier. Apart from Lahaul-Spiti, Kinnaur is the other district in the state that shares borders with China. The Western Command’s formation, 26 Infantry Brigade that is responsible for this area, is headquartered in Pooh, which is about 11 km from the border as the crow flies.A limited cross-border trade amongst locals on both sides is also conducted through the Sipki La pass along the Sutlej river during summers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-chinese-helicopters-violated-indian-airspace-says-hp-police-officer-86045

Inter-state movement of vehicles and buses has also been allowed with mutual consent of the concerned States/UTs. Intra-state movement of vehicles and buses can be decided by the States and UTs.” In the guidelines the MHA asked district authorities to advise individuals to install the “Aarogya Setu” application on compatible mobile phones and regularly update their health status on the app.  “This will facilitate timely provision of medical attention to those individuals who are at risk,” it said.Further the MHA has categorically mentioned the guidelines that all other activities will be permitted “except those which are specifically prohibited”, but in containment zones, “only essential activities shall be allowed”, as mentioned earlier.It, however, said, “States/UTs, based on their assessment of the situation, may prohibit certain other activities in the various zones, or impose such restrictions as deemed necessary.”Activities continue to be prohibited throughout the countryChanges from the previous lockdown in terms activities allowedAdministrative changes in terms of authority||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-extends-nationwide-lockdown-till-may-31-new-guidelines-issued-86042

Finally, after negotiations with the district administration they agreed. Food packets were distributed before they were sent home in 55 buses arranged by the district administration.“It is an ongoing process. People are continuously coming and buses are being arranged as they arrive,” said the Mathura police PRO.Since Saturday evening thousands of migrants returning from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh were stopped at the Raksa Jauhariya border in Jhansi on the Madhya Pradesh-UP border causing a 10-km long jam.While the district administration had assured the migrants to make arrangements for buses the process of arranging was slow, complained the migrants.They were not ready to get off their private vehicles to wait to board the buses being arranged by the district administration to take them home.There was even a clash with the police where police lathi-charged them. Finally, after completing the paper work many were allowed to proceed in their vehicles while others agreed to board the government buses.Additional chief secretary Avanish Awasthi said CM Yogi has issued clear instructions to negotiate with the migrants and at no cost allow them to enter the state on foot, cycle, trucks or other modes of unsafe transport.He said even trains were being arranged at different points in the state like Agra, Mathura, Ghaziabad, Jhansi, Prayagraj to take the migrants home safely.Meanwhile, Cabinet minister Siddharth Nath Singh scoffed at Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s offer to pay for 1,000 buses to bring back migrants to UP.“Migrants are coming from states like Maharashtra, Punjab, and Rajasthan. She should send these buses to these Congress-ruled states and ask her CMs to arrange for buses to bring back workers to UP. She should understand the basic concept of logistics that migrants are not originating out of UP,” said Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/trouble-at-borders-as-migrants-protest-at-being-stopped-from-entering-up-86038

A prepaid tag, fixed on vehicles’ windscreen, allows automated deduction of toll charges, and lets any vehicle pass through a toll plaza with zero human contact.

It has much-needed facilities,” Raut had tweeted.However, responding to Raut’s message, Aaditya Thackeray pointed out that heavy rains would render the grounds unusable during the monsoon.“Sanjay ji, we can’t take the grounds of the stadiums or playgrounds because they have a mud base and they won’t be usable during monsoons. An open space with a solid/ concrete base is usable and it’s being done already,” Thackeray said in response to Raut’s message.Later in the day, Mumbai’s Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said the BMC would not take over any stadium or any open space because of the heavy rains experienced by the city during the monsoons.The official said the civic body was looking at converting the many multi-storeyed parking lots across the city into facilities for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.According to sources in the civic body, at least 50,000 beds can be put up in the sprawling parking lots belonging to the Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport. Smaller parking lots in several municipal wards have also been identified for setting up facilities with ICU beds and even dialysis facilities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-backtracks-on-quarantine-facilities-at-wankhede-stadium-86035

17-05-2020||New Delhi||SC comes up with new guidelines for hearing matters from May 18 to June 19||The Supreme Court will hear all cases via video and audio links between May 18 and June 19, and has scaled up its ‘1881’ helpline to assist advocates and litigants in e-filing and virtual hearing, according to a standard operating procedure (SoP) released on Sunday amid the COVID-triggered lockdown.The fresh SoP assumed significance as the Supreme Court, which has been hearing only urgent cases through video-conferencing during the lockdown, decided on May 15 to postpone its summer vacation by five weeks and declared that it would remain functional from May 18 to June 19.Issuing the fresh SoP, the Supreme Court said for the first time in the Registry, ‘1881’ helpline number would remain functional from 10 am to 5 pm under the supervision of senior officers to provide instant solutions to query of advocate and litigants about e-filing and other issues relating to judicial functions.“In order to contain the spread of COVID-19, considering the prevailing situation, and taking into account the suggestions received from various quarters and the guidelines issued by the Government of India and the Government of NCT of Delhi from time to time, the Chief Justice of India has been pleased to direct the constitution of the bench(es) to hear matters in the coming weeks since the Virtual Courts will be functioning from May 18, 2020, to June 19, 2020 (both days inclusive), that is, during the earlier notified summer vacations through video conferencing/ teleconferencing mode only,” the Supreme Court said.The communication further said: “The proceedings by video-conference should not be recorded/stored or broadcast, in any manner whatsoever, as recording/copying/storing and/or broadcasting, by any means, of the hearings and proceedings before the Supreme Court are expressly prohibited.”The fresh matters lying in the pool which could not be listed due to the pandemic had been scheduled to be listed before the virtual court for hearing during the period, it said.“Once the pool of fresh matters is exhausted, matters belonging to Short Categories, which are ready for listing, will be listed before the court for the hearing. In addition to the fresh matters and short category matters, such other matters shall also be listed for hearing, as may be directed,” it said.It further said that the timing of sitting of the virtual courts will be notified in the respective cause lists which will be published well in advance.“The Advocate-on-Record or the parties in person should specify as to whether he/she would link to the Bench through their own computer or would prefer to avail the facility for video-conferencing in the Supreme Court premises,” the SoP said.It, however, noted desktop, laptop, tablet computers provide stable connectivity for a video-conference, whereas signal drop/incoming call on mobile devices could delink such devices from an ongoing video-conference disrupting such video-conferencing.“It may be further noted that smooth functioning of the video-conference is squarely dependent upon and subject to the connectivity (signal-strength/bandwidth) available at the end of the remote user(s), and hence it is expected that any party joining a video-conference hearing shall ensure robust connectivity and bandwidth are available at their end – in this regard, parties may use a broadband connection of minimum 2 Mbps/dedicated 4G data connection, and may also ensure that no other device or application is connected to or using the bandwidth when the hearing by video-conferencing is progressing on their Vidyo-enabled computer.”“The parties are first required to file the petition/miscellaneous application, preferably through the e-filing mode available on the top court's website and upon completion of all the formalities, and its due registration they are permitted to send separately the signed and verified mentioning-application containing a synopsis of urgency not exceeding one page,” said the Supreme Court in its fresh SoP.It directed the parties to remember to keep their microphone on “mute” at all times, except when the Bench requires them to make submissions as there is the possibility of the microphone catching audio feed from the speakers and creating “echo/noise- disturbance” would become very high and may disturb the video-conference.“During hearing through video-conferencing, the parties may kindly keep in mind that they are participating in court proceedings, and hence it is expected that they would not resort to any indecorous conduct or dress or comment,” said the circular.It also said that the Registry may call any party upon publication of the cause-list, to test the device or its connectivity, and every such party is required to cooperate with the staff/official and abide by the instructions given, so that the hearing by video-conference may be smoothly conducted.The new circular has superseded the previous SoPs on e-filing and mentioning which were issued on March 23, 26 and April 17.The Supreme Court, since March 25, has been holding courts through video conferencing due to the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19 and had suspended the entry of advocates and other staff into the high-security zone on the basis of their proximity cards, till further orders.During the lockdown, the benches usually assemble at the residences of the judges and the lawyers are allowed to join the video-conferencing from their homes or offices.

17-05-2020||New Delhi||To arrest COVID spread, jails intensify medical screening of inmates; suspend ‘mulaqat’ with family||Releasing prisoners on bail and parole to decongest jails, compulsory wearing of masks, frequent medical screening and suspension of ‘mulaqat’ with family—these are some of the steps being taken by the Delhi prison authorities to check the spread of the novel coronavirus.Authorities are extra cautious now after coronavirus infections were reported from the Rohini Jail. There are three jails in Delhi—Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli.After a 28-year-old inmate of Rohini Jail tested positive for the coronavirus, 15 others who shared a barrack with him and one head warden contracted the infection.The jail authorities said they are conducting medical screening of each inmate more frequently and at a faster pace. All the inmates have been strictly advised not to hide about their health conditions in case they are unwell and should report to doctor immediately, the authorities said.The jail staff and doctors have been educating the inmates about the novel coronavirus and the precautionary measures to be taken to contain its spread, said an official.“Every inmate has been provided with two masks each and they are reused after washing. These masks have been stitched by jail inmates,” he added.While coming out of barracks, it is compulsory for inmates to wear masks. The jail authorities also encourage inmates to wear masks while inside the barracks too as a preventive measure, said the DG (Prisons) of Tihar, Sandeep Goel.The inmates cannot be confined to their barracks all the time. They do come out when needed, and in such times, it is ensured they have limited interaction with members of other barracks, Goel said.The inmates usually come out of their respective barracks either to avail phone facility, canteen facility or to visit the jail office or dispensary which is within the jail premises, he said.All these areas are encircled so that inmates wait in queue within the marked circle to avail the facility as and when their turn comes, he said.Only eight to 10 inmates are at a time allowed to come outside their barracks to avail phone facility.Earlier, they used to interact with inmates of other barracks but now, they are very cautious and have limited interaction and maintain social distancing even while speaking to inmates belonging to their own barrack, officials said.Usually, a barrack houses 20-25 inmates.A major step that was taken towards maintaining social distance was to decongest the jails.The jail authorities said when they started the process of decongestion back in March, the population in jails were 175 per cent of the capacity—the three jails were housing 17,500 inmates against the capacity of 10,000.But a lot of effort was taken and many inmates were either released on emergency parole or on interim bail.So far, 3,500 inmates have been released and more will be freed in the coming days to avoid over-crowding.Another significant effort that was taken was to stop court production of inmates and ‘mulaqat’ (meeting) with family members to ensure they are not exposed, they added.Phone facility in the jail was made free of cost for the inmates and it is ensured, they get to speak to their family at least once in a week.In case someone falls sick, doctor after checking his health condition decides if the person needs to be kept in medical isolation which is made in each barrack or if he has to be kept in a jail dispensary from where his conditions are monitored regularly, they said.

Some of them succumbed to injuries on the way to the hospital,” District Magistrate Abhishek Singh said, adding all deceased were men.The mini-truck, which was going from Delhi to Madhya Pradesh, had stopped at the eatery as some workers wanted to have tea. It was carrying around 22 people, including five women and seven children, officials said.The trailer truck with 43 migrants was coming from Rajasthan, they said.Both the vehicles were ferrying people who found themselves without jobs, money or food during the lockdown and were desperate to get back home.Local villagers assisted the police and the administration in the rescue operation as JCB machines were used to pull out the people from under the lime sacks.

17-05-2020||New Delhi||65k register for leaving Delhi; transport arranged for 50k||About 65,000 migrants and others, from different states stranded in Delhi, have registered with the state government for being sent back to their home states, but the Delhi government has so far made arrangements for ferrying around 50,000 people.It was on April 29 that the Union government allowed for the movement of the migrants and people stranded at different places to their home states amid the coronavirus nationwide lockdown.The first train from Delhi carrying 1,050 migrants hailing from Madhya Pradesh left Delhi on May 7. Since then, people have been sent to their home states in buses or trains.Speaking to IANS, an official involved in the operations of the migrant movement said the requests are still coming."We have been receiving requests from more and more people everyday. So far, about 65,000 people have registered at the Delhi government portal for being sent back to their home states amid the lockdown due to coronavirus," the official told IANS.The registration at the website—https://epass.jantasamvad.org/train/passenger/ -- was only for those who have been stranded in Delhi due to the lockdown.According to the official, till Saturday 35,000 passengers have been sent by the Delhi Government through the Shramik Special trains."Apart from trains, the migrants were also sent by buses and more such trains and buses are being arranged. Although trains are better for longer distance and for carrying more people at a time. Till date, arrangements have been made for about 50,000 people. Among these some will leave on Sunday and Monday also," the official said.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that arrangements will be done for the migrants, irrespective of the fact that they want to stay or leave."We have the responsibility of each and every migrant labourer living in Delhi. If they want to stay in Delhi, we will take full care of them and if they want to return to their village, then we are arranging trains for them. Under no circumstances we will leave them without help," Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi.Deputy Chief Minister Manisha Sisodia in a series of tweets also said that for taking the trains, people need to do the registrations first."Till Saturday evening, 35,000 passengers have been sent by the Shramik Special train by the Delhi Government. Even on Sunday, eight trains are carrying around 12,000 passengers," Sisodia said, adding most of the people going are ready to return on lockdown removal.He also said that most people heading home were those who came to Delhi in search of some work about two to six months ago. However, with lockdown, they are left without any hopes.The Delhi government has ordered the officials concerned to ensure that the migrant workers do not walk on the roads or the railway tracks and should be taken to the nearest shelter facilities, if found doing so. About 18,000 people were housed in over 340 shelters across the city. IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/65k-register-for-leaving-delhi-transport-arranged-for-50k-86026

I accept and shall abide by the same" and requires the passenger to click on 'I agree' to move forward and book tickets.The rule comes days after around 50 passengers who arrived in Bengaluru from Delhi on May 14 refused to be quarantined at an institutional facility and created a ruckus at the station.Despite much persuasion, the railways had to attach an extra bogie and send back around 15 passengers who refused to be quarantined. The passengers paid for their tickets.According to IRCTC officials, before finally proceeding to book a ticket, a pop-up will now appear on the computer or mobile screen asking passengers to confirm if they had read the health advisory of the destination state and agree to abide by it.The message is being displayed in Hindi as well as English.If the passenger selects disagree, then s/he won't be able to book the ticket and will be returned to the reservation page.The new rule is part of a growing list of "mandatory" protocols that the railways has issued due to travel restrictions during the coronavirus crisis.Earlier, railways made it mandatory for passengers to download the government's contact-tracing app Aarogya Setu and also made it compulsory for passengers to list their destination address before they could book tickets on the IRCTC portal. It has also made wearing masks and social distancing mandatory during travel.The special Rajdhanis are travelling between 15 major cities and the national capital.

It is said that Ma Narmada ka kankar kankar is Shankar (Lord Shiva) and Narmade Har-Jeevan Bhar,” Patel told PTI on Sunday.“As the Supreme Court, High Court and National Green Tribunal (NGT) have banned the excavation of sand with the help of machines in all rivers, those indulging in it are trying to kill the river.“Therefore, I have directed collectors of 11 districts under Narmadapuram and Jabalpur divisions to register attempt to murder FIRs against those indulging in illegal sand mining with machines,” he said.“They should be treated like any person accused of attempt to murder as Narmadaji is a living entity for us,” Patel, who is the minister in charge of the Narmadapuram and Jabalpur divisions, said.He said he would shortly be writing to collectors of other districts as well through which the river passes to register attempt to murder cases against illegal sand miners.Patel said he had ordered for the installation of CCTVs along the routes leading to the river and asked police to take action if trucks are found overloaded.Collectors have been asked to send daily reports in the action taken against sand miners, he said, adding that such moves would go along way in curb illegal sand mining and protecting and conserving the river. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/narmada-sand-mining-file-attempt-to-murder-cases-says-patel-86022

I don’t want to be involved in any discussion if I have done less or more. I don’t see anything can be adequate. No matter how much you do, it will not be enough (in the current situation),” she said in Hindi.The Finance Minister also said that many solutions can be offered and the Central government has taken on board all the suggestions that have come.“We worked on something which we think will have an impact.” Saying that nothing will be enough in the situation, she said that is why she believes that these issues should not be politicised.“We should have this sympathy in our hearts that how we all can work together to get over this situation. We should plan to deal with the situation with dignity and not indulge in fights,” she said without taking names.The Finance Minister also said that the Prime Minister first urged all to stay where they are and asked the states to arrange their food and accommodation.“All who could help in this provided help. Later, a time came when the Centre and the states decided that the migrants should be allowed to move and so trains were being arranged. If migrants are ready to go, they are given food in trains. It feels sad to see that the migrants are walking on roads to their homes.”Sitharaman also said that if the Congress is feeling so much sad about the picture, “why the state government ruled by Congress or their allies is not demanding more trains for the migrants to ensure all reach home.” Instead of doing that, she added, “They are wasting time in talking to the migrants who are headed home. Better would have been if they carried their children and suitcases instead of just talking,” referring to Rahul Gandhi’s meeting to the migrants.The Finance Minister said she is very sad to say, but she is “now using their words and call them “dramabaz”. What happened on Saturday was not dramabazi? They wasted the time of the migrants in just talking,” she added.Saying that it is time to join hands, Sitharaman added that she is “requesting the Congress to work together in this situation. It feels sad to see the picture of the migrants.” “Let us speak responsibly, let us deal with our migrants responsibly,” Sitharaman urged Congress President Sonia Gandhi.The remarks came a day after Rahul Gandhi on Saturday evening went to meet migrant workers camped out near a flyover in Delhi’s southeast.‘Frivolous, Cong hits back at FMAfter Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman alleged that the Congress is playing politics on the issue of migrants, the party hit back saying its “frivolous” and Congress does not need to “learn” from the Finance Minister.Sitharaman during her press conference on Sunday morning said that the Congress is playing politics over the migrants issue and Sonia Gandhi should have asked her chief ministers to help the migrants and Rahul Gandhi should have walked with them when he met migrants and arranged for their transportation.Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said, “We expect certain degree of seriousness and gravitas when the Finance Minister is addressing a press conference.” “The statement of the Nirmala Sitharaman is frivolous and the Congress president did not need to learn from the finance minister,” added Sharma.He said Congress has stood by the migrants in solidarity as they are citizens of the country and with no food, shelter and money where will the migrants go? The government should apologize to them as their fundamental rights have been violated, Sharma said.On the issue of Rahul Gandhi meeting migrants in Delhi, Anand Sharma said, “Rahul has right to show his sensitivity. I can understand her frustration, first she damaged the economy, and now....” Finance minister Sitharaman had said that Rahul Gandhi should have picked the belongings of the migrants and walked with them.Sharma hit back and said, “Did the Government of India take and look to their pains who are walking hundreds of kilometres. One way preaching is going on. The government is taking decisions arbitrarily without consulting the opposition on the issue of national security of defence and space.” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday termed the meeting of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi with the migrants in Delhi a “dramabaazi” (doing drama) and said the Congress should “be more responsible” and work together with the Centre in the current situation. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sitharaman-calls-rahuls-meeting-with-migrants-a-dramabaazi%C2%A0frivolous-congress-hits-back-86020
17-05-2020||New Delhi||Govt package only worth Rs 3.22 lakh cr and 1.6% of GDP, not Rs 20 lakh crore: Cong||The Congress on Sunday accused the government of misleading people in the name of an economic package and said the measures announced by the Centre amounted to only 1.6 per cent of India’s GDP, i.e. worth Rs 3.22 lakh crore instead of Rs 20 lakh crore as claimed by the Prime Minister.Congress’ senior spokesperson Anand Sharma said Prime Minister Narendra Modi must “walk the talk” and announce the measures required by giving money in the hands of the poor and small and medium enterprises to help reboot the economy.He noted that there was a difference between providing stimulus to the economy and merely giving loans and credit to people.         Sharma, a former union minister, challenged the finance minister for a debate on the package while raising questions about the announcements made by the prime minister.“The government’s economic package is only of Rs 3.22 lakh crore and is only 1.6 per cent of India’s GDP and is not worth Rs 20 lakh crore as announced by the prime minister,” Sharma said while addressing a press conference through video conferencing.“I am questioning the Finance Minister, disputing the announcement of Prime Minister and challenging the government to disprove me on the numbers given by me and am ready for a debate with the finance minister,” he said.The Congress leader further said the Finance Minister should answer questions and not ask questions instead. He also demanded that the government provide answers to the country on the plight of migrants forced to walk on roads due to lack of planning on the part of the central government.Sharma hit back at  Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for her attack on the opposition party and termed it as “frivolous”, saying the country expects some seriousness and gravitas from the finance minister.He also asked the government to apologise to the poor citizens of the country who have been abandoned and their fundamental rights and legal rights violated.Allocation of additional funds exposes BJP claim about MGNREGA: CongressWith the Centre sanctioning additional funds for job creation under the MGNREGA, the UP Congress, on Sunday, said the BJP had been exposed about its claim regarding the scheme, once dubbed as a ‘living monument’ of poverty by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.If the scheme was an ‘epitome of corruption’, then why was it being implemented now and additional funds allocated, UP Congress spokesperson Ashok Kumar asked referring to a Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement about the scheme in the Parliament in 2015.“Who was telling lies, and who was misleading the country? It is the schemes envisaged by the Congress on which the country is functioning today,” Kumar said, claiming that the Congress had always been contributing to nation-building.The BJP had been “effectively exposed”, he said.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Sunday, allocated additional Rs 40,000 crore under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme as part of the 20-lakh crore economic stimulus in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.In March 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken potshots at the Congress in the Lok Sabha while referring to corruption in the scheme and coal block allocations.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said: “Do you think I will put an end to the scheme. My political wisdom does not allow me to do it. This is a living monument of your failure to tackle poverty in 60 years. With song, dance and drum beat, I will continue with the scheme,” he had said.The Congress leader also took a dig at the UP government, saying the scheme once flayed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi was now needed for job creation in the state.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, on May 12, had asked for the creation of 50 lakh jobs per day under the MGNREGA recently, more than double the current numbers.The mandate of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act is to provide at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every rural household, whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had said that in view of the COVID-19 outbreak, stranded workers were returning to the state, hence, jobs in large numbers were needed.Countering the Congress attack, UP BJP media co-convenor Navin Srivastava said: “Schemes are made by the governments, and after periodic reviews, the schemes either continue or are scrapped off. The BJP government has strengthened the MGNREGA. We have also increased wages for the workers.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-package-only-worth-rs-3-22-lakh-cr-and-1-6-of-gdp-not-rs-20-lakh-crore-cong-86019
17-05-2020||Chandigarh||Jobless in Ludhiana, migrants set off for home over 1,000 km away||Kicked out of his job in Punjab's Ludhiana, Vijay Kumar headed home to Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh, often keeping to village roads to avoid police and wading through the Ghaggar river with his wife and 11-year-old daughter.After repeated efforts, he could not book any of the special Shramik trains.Kumar says he decided to return home, over 1,000 km away from Ludhiana, when his employer told him to vacate the room where he was staying.Kumar says he worked in a garment factory and was not paid for over a month.Since the Punjab Police was not allowing migrant labourers to cross the state border, Kumar says he travelled through villages.He had to wade through a stretch of the Ghaggar river near the Punjab-Haryana border to reach Ambala on Saturday morning.Like Kumar, other migrant workers have been forced to make similar journeys to reach their homes in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar after rendered jobless due to the lockdown imposed to check the coronavirus spread.Another group of migrant workers and their families crossed the same river to enter Ambala district, hoping to find a way home.A youth who was part of the group said he worked in an industrial unit in Ludhiana.“There has been no work for us since the lockdown. I have exhausted all my savings and the house owner too had been putting pressure for rent for the past over a week. How long could we continue like this. So, we decided to go home,” he said.Ambala Deputy Commissioner Ambala Ashok Sharma said the administration has sent several migrant labourers from Ambala to their destinations in Bihar and UP through buses and trains.Labourers entering Haryana are kept in relief shelters till arrangements are made for their journey ahead, officials said.A week ago, the Haryana administration had stepped in, accommodating them in relief shelters.Officials said migrant workers are being sent to their villages only after they register with the district administration and their home states have given approval to receive them.Many migrants who entered Haryana had said that not all of them were able to register online. They sought help from the government, saying arrangements should be made for their journey back home.There have been similar reports recently of migrants, including women and children, of crossing the Yamuna river from the Haryana side to enter Uttar Pradesh.Yamunanagar Deputy Commissioner Mukul Kumar said this has not come to his notice.However, on Saturday he led a team of police and civil administration officials to check if any migrant was using the river route.“Since morning, we have been on the round. Our enforcement teams are also on job, but we did not come across any migrant crossing the Yamuna river,” he said on Saturday.In Faridabad district of Haryana, which abuts the national capital, migrant workers, were seen waiting on footpaths late in the night, with many hoping truck drivers will take them to some distance.Some claimed they had reached the highway from Delhi and Ghaziabad.A woman with a child on her lap said she was going to Jhansi with her family.Some said after the imposition of the lockdown, they were left with no work and though the government made food arrangements for them, they still wanted to go home.

So far, 26,691 tests have been conducted and there are 244 active cases while 36 have recovered in the country. One person has died.Foreign Affairs Minister Pradeep Gyawali in a tweet thanked the Indian government for the medical supplies.“Sincere thanks to the Government of India for providing medical logistics and testing kits for 30,000 tests which were handed over to the Ministry of Health and Population today as a part of ongoing cooperation to fight the pandemic,” Gyawali wrote on Twitter.India on Sunday gifted the medical supplies to Nepal to help it fight the coronavirus pandemic.India’s Ambassador Vinay Mohan Kwatra handed over the Pathodetect COVID-19 Qualitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test kits manufactured in India to Nepal’s Minister for Health and Population Bhanubhakta Dhakal.The consignment, as a gift from the people of India to the people of Nepal, will enable Nepal’s health professionals to conduct PCR tests on about 30,000 people, according to a statement by the Indian embassy.On April 22, India gifted Nepal 23 tonnes of medicines.“Gifting of medicines and test kits manifests the continuing cooperation of our leaders and people of the two countries to prepare, act and fight together the common challenge of COVID-19 pandemic,” according to the statement.These initiatives stem from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conference of  South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Leaders on March 15 2020, when the coronavirus outbreak just started, it said.“India stands in solidarity with the Government, Health Professionals and people of Nepal in this hour of challenge,” it added.The Nepal foreign minister’s tweet thanking India for the medical assistance came days after he summoned the Indian Ambassador on Monday and handed over a diplomatic note to him to protest against the construction of the key road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand.The 80-Km new road inaugurated by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on last Friday is expected to help pilgrims visiting Kailash-Mansarovar in Tibet in China as it is around 90 kms from the Lipulekh pass.On Friday, President Bidhya Bhandari, addressing Parliament, reiterated that Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipulekh belong to Nepal and appropriate diplomatic measures will be adopted to resolve the existing issues.   India has said that the recently-inaugurated road section in Pithoragarh district in Uttarakhand lies completely within its territory.“The road follows the pre-existing route used by the pilgrims of the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra,” spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Anurag Srivastava said in New Delhi last week. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nepal-thanks-india-for-providing-medical-supplies-to-fight-covid-19-86013

17-05-2020||New Delhi||Lockdown: Over 60 per cent of sex workers in Delhi return to their home states||Over 60 per cent of Delhi’s sex workers have returned to their home states due to loss of means of livelihood in view of the ongoing lockdown, a forum working with the sex workers said.The fear of contracting the deadly pathogen has kept customers away, leaving a debilitating impact on sex workers in the city.Kusum, who is president of the All India Network of Sex Workers (AINSW) - a group of sex workers that assists others with legal rights, health issues and social security across the country, said over 60 per cent of the sex workers in Delhi have already left for their home states.“The 60 per cent population accounts for around 3,000 sex workers. According to government figures, a total of registered 5,000 sex workers reside in Delhi,” Kusum said.She said they were forced to leave the city after enduring weeks of struggle for basic facilities like food and medicines.Shalini, one such worker, moved back to her village in Uttar Pradesh after living for eight years in Delhi.“I ran away from my abusive home in UP at the age of 18. I wanted to be an actress but got into prostitution to survive in this city,” 26-year-old Shalini told PTI.“After getting into this business (sex trade), at least I was not struggling for food, I was not on streets. But ever since the coronavirus outbreak and the lockdown, I have zero customers and money is drying up,” she said.Another sex worker Rajni (name changed) said she and her four-year-old son have not eaten properly in the last two months.“When my son fainted out of weakness two weeks back I decided to move back. I have some relatives in UP who do not know what I do here. I will stay with them for some days before figuring out what to do next,” she added.Sharmila (name changed) who grew up as an orphan on the streets of Kanpur became a sex worker in Delhi five years ago to make ends meet.“But now there is no food, no medicines and no customers. It is impossible to survive any longer in Delhi with the savings that I have. The social distancing is going to hit our business more than anything so there is no point staying here,” Sharmila, who is planning to move back to Kanpur, said.Rajni, Sharmila and Shalini are residents of the Garstin Bastion Road, or more famously G B Road, and now renamed Swami Shradhanand Marg. There are around 100 brothels on the one-kilometre stretch housing approximately 1,500 sex workers.Activists fear that many of these women who were on medication for different diseases, including HIV-AIDS, will not be able to get proper treatment in their home towns.“We feel all the work which we did in the past years for HIV and other diseases would be of no use. Many of them who escaped abusive homes can again become victims of domestic violence. There are many concerns but mostly we are worried about their health,” Kusum said.She further said that similar migration of sex workers is taking place in other cities too.Amit Kumar, the national coordinator for the AINSW, said the GB Road has completely shut down and most of its residents have returned to their home towns.     “We were doing our best to provide dry ration, medicines, masks and sanitiser. We also gave them basic information on HIV treatment,” he said.Kumar said many of the sex workers went to their homes during Holi but they did not return after that.“Due to the coronavirus outbreak, a number of sex workers did not see a point in returning to the city after Holi and stayed back with their families,” he said.India is currently under the biggest lockdown with around 1.3 billion people asked to stay home in view of the coronavirus pandemic. The nationwide lockdown was initially imposed from March 25 to April 14, but was later extended till May 17 to contain the spread of the deadly disease.The virus has so far claimed 2,872 lives and infected over 90,000 people in the country. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-over-60-per-cent-of-sex-workers-in-delhi-return-to-their-home-states-86005

Police told me that I was being detained but no reason was given for doing so,” he said.Kumar said police kept asking him if he had gone to the Ghazipur border on Saturday.“The Congress is providing help to the starving migrant workers that’s why I went to the Ghazipur border yesterday. People will not spare these governments that are detaining us for helping migrant workers,” the Congress leader said.However, a senior police official said Kumar was only questioned and asked to remain at home.“We were patrolling in the area when we came to know through some migrants that Anil Kumar had assured them some help in migrating to their native place.

17-05-2020||Vijay Mohan||New training programme for top ITBP officers on promotion||Tribune News serviceChandigarh, May 17With additional posts being approved in the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) following a cadre review, officers will have to undergo a mandatory pre-promotion course before being elevated to newly created posts at the apex level.According to ITBP sources, cadre officers of the rank of Inspector General (equivalent to major general in the army), who would be promoted as Additional Director General (ADG) will be required to undergo a training programme before assuming their new responsibilities.“The Training Directorate at ITBP headquarters has been tasked to formulate the new course as promotion rules for ADG make it compulsory to attend such a course,” a senior officer said. “The contents of the course would include aspects pertaining to geo-strategic environment, operations, administration, human resources and material management as well as aspects pertaining to the government’s rules of business, inter-department coordination and policy formulation,” he added.In October 2019, the union cabinet had approved the ITBP’s cadre review, creating two new posts of ADG for ITBP officers. At present, the single post of ADG at ITBP headquarters is held by an officer on deputation from the Indian Police Service (IPS).In addition, the cadre review, which is now in the process of being implemented, created 10 new posts of Inspector General (IG), 10 posts of Deputy Inspector General (equivalent to Brigadier) and 13 posts of Commandant (equivalent to Colonel), in addition to some more posts at lower levels.While the Director General of all Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) under the Ministry of Home Affairs is an IPS officer, other higher level posts are tenable by a mix of IPS and cadre officers. Till now, cadre officers could only reach up to the level of IG.In ITBP, 50 per cent of the posts at the level of IG are filled by IPS officers on deputation, whereas at the rank of DIG, 80 per cent posts are held by cadre officers and the remaining 20 per cent by IPS officers. This ratio of IPS officers to cadre officers varies in other CAPFs. There are also instances of an IPS officer coming on deputation to CAPFs at the level of Commandant.IPS officers being deputed to CAPFs has been a bone of contention, with cadre officers pointing out that this had led to promotional avenues being restricted, thereby resulting in stagnation. Parliament’s Standing Committee on Home Affairs has also raised this issue and recommended that the deputation of IPS officers be reduced.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-training-programme-for-top-itbp-officers-on-promotion-85998

17-05-2020||Vibha Sharma||BMS criticising government a sign of growing rift between BJP and RSS?||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 17In its most scathing and direct attack against the Narendra Modi government, RSS affiliate Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh on Saturday told it to find “novel ways” to revive the economy instead of depending on “failed ideas”.Condemning the announcements made by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her fourth Covid relief tranche, the ruling BJP’s sister organisation in the Sangh parivaar also accused the Modi government of “taking advantage of the crisis period” to push corporatisation and privatisation agenda, warning  "serious consequences to the security" of the country due to decisions related to Space.The RSS-affiliated trade union is also on the warpath over “complete burial" of labour laws by some states, including those ruled by the BJP.Calling as "criminal" withdrawal of laws in a civilised society, the trade union is demanding cash incentives, attractive wages and good accommodation for them wherever they are.The RSS, which has been actively involved in providing food and help to poor during the lockdown, may not have said anything directly on the huge migrant crisis and tragic deaths being reported almost on a daily basis from across the country but top functionaries have been voicing concern to "those who matter", say sources.These may have been BMS statements and assertions but can a Sangh affiliate say anything so scathing about another member without the backing of the parent organisation, the RSS, observers wonder.BMS leaders say they have praised the government when it does good work but the observers see the statements issued by the Sangh-affiliated trade union as the voice from the RSS, the ruling BJP's ideological fountainhead.On BMS' objections being perceived as a sign of a rift between the RSS and its political arm, the BJP, BMS president Saji Narayanan says whenever the government takes good decisions the BMS always appreciates, like it did in the case of the first three Covid tranches announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. “But if the government does something wrong, it is also our duty to point it,” he adds.According to the observers, with the number of migrants' deaths rising, the issue is becoming increasingly difficult for the BJP. In fact, the migrant issue is believed to have been discussed in the very first meeting BJP president JP Nadda had with the top ministers two days back, say sources.According to the observers, the migrants crisis and the overdrive of ‘fake’ news and ‘selective’ targeting of Muslims during the lockdown are two issues the ruling party needs to be extra careful about while devising political strategies.It is believed that only after Sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat said that an entire community should not be vilified for the mistakes of a few, apparently referring to the Tablighi Jamaat incident in his address to the cadres on April 26, that regular attacks by BJP spokespersons on television debates against the community toned down.The humanitarian crisis unfolding across the country in the form of heart wrenching visuals of migrants walking on roads and railway tracks to return homes, some also dying in the process, is an issue that can no longer be ignored.As much as the government may try to say otherwise, the decision of the lockdown, much like the controversial demonetisation, will always belong to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, observers say.The migrant crisis has dented Prime Minister Modi’s carefully crafted image of someone coming from humble background which the BJP sucessfully used to woo economically weaker sections and win many political battles in past seven years. Their plight also left the society "sharply divided the society" in two parts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bms-criticising-government-a-sign-of-growing-rift-between-bjp-and-rss-85987
17-05-2020||Port Blair||Rigorous policing helped make Andaman & Nicobar Islands coronavirus-free: DGP||Aggressive policing ensured that lockdown norms were strictly followed in Andamans that has become COVID-free after all 33 coronavirus patients recovered, a top police officer said.Of the 572 islands in Andaman and Nicobar, 37 are inhabited.Novel coronavirus had knocked on the door of the archipelago when nine persons, who returned from Delhi's Tablighi Jamaat event, were found to have contracted the disease in late March."It was after we questioned the returnees, the details of the Tablighi Jamaat mid-March meet came to light, and accordingly we informed Delhi about it," Director General of Police Dependra Pathak said.Two of the nine, who tested positive, were taken to hospital from the airport, and rest were placed under institutional quarantine, Pathak, who had earlier served in the Delhi Police, told PTI."We managed well the first wave of infection with the arrival of Jamaatis, but unfortunately two others who had gone to Chennai tested positive for the virus on return. They, in turn, infected several others, raising the count in the Union Territory to 33," he told PTI.The spurt in cases forced us to opt for a rigorous containment exercise, Pathak said.Police began strictly enforcing the lockdown norms laid down by the Centre.It resulted in the registration of 200 cases, arrest of 190 violators by May 15, and realisation of a sum of Rs 30 lakh by way of penalty, the DGP said."Shutdown norms were meticulously implemented in all inhabited islands. Strict vigil was maintained to prevent any infiltration bid from Indonesia, Thailand and Myanmar," he said, adding that the 33 patients were sent home from hospitals a week ago, following their recovery.Andamans had shut its doors to tourists from March 16, and inter-island movements were subsequently stopped from March 21, he said.With the situation having improved and the Centre relaxing lockdown curbs, the Union Territory is giving a "one-time and one-way" opportunity to the stranded natives to return to their homes in different islands, the DGP stated.The administration is also making arrangements to send ships to Chennai and Kolkata in a day or two to ferry back residents stuck in other states amid the lockdown, he noted.The Union Territory would take necessary measures to ensure that the islands remain coronavirus-free, Pathak added.

17-05-2020||New Delhi||Wife pregnant, but disability keeps penniless railway worker from reaching home||Rakesh Ram fractured his left leg a year and half ago in an accident at his village in Bihar's Chhapra district. The doctors implanted a 12-inch rod in his leg for proper alignment during healing."The rod will be taken out after two years. I cannot walk long distances. It pains a lot," the 24-year-old says as he pops in a pain-killer and goes about his work – cleaning trains at the New Delhi Railway Station's maintenance yard.Back at his home in Sheetalpur village, his wife is due to give birth in a few days. Last month, he had sent Rs 6,000 to her from the Rs 12,000 he earned working for a private contractor.He hasn't got any salary for April so far. "We usually get our salary by the 12th day of the month. This time, there is nothing so far...maybe because there is lesser work due to the lockdown," Ram says.A part of his last month's salary also went to his two brothers who are stuck on the Delhi-Haryana border due to the travel restrictions.The brothers worked in a footwear manufacturing unit in Bahadurgarh, but the coronavirus lockdown rendered them jobless.They set out for home when the government started 'Shramik Special' trains, but were caught on the border by police, Ram says.He says he filled a form a few days ago to board a special train being run to take migrant workers home. "But nothing has happened. Now the thanewala says take Rajdhani (Express) to go home"."They have started Rajdhani, but I don't have Rs 3,500 for a ticket. Many of us who want to go home cannot afford the cost of travel in a Rajdhani train," Ram rues."I cannot even borrow money from my friends working here. They too are in a similar situation," he says.What Ram cannot understand is why the people who work for the railways itself cannot be sent home on Rajdhani."Itna to madad milna hi chahiye. (They help us with this at least)," he says, adjusting his loosened yellow mask.He is worried what will happen if his wife goes into labour without him or any of his brothers present at home."My parents are old and my wife needs care. Mummy wants at least one of us (three brothers) to be there," he says.Ram says he would have set out on foot, like countless others are walking hundreds of kilometres, but he cannot walk long distances due to the rod in his leg."If I walk too much, the leg swells up. A group of coworkers from Bihar left for their villages a few days ago. They asked me to join them. I denied,” he says."I would have slowed them down too."With no money left on him, Ram doesn't have a place to sleep. For the last few days, he has been living in a container along with seven others in the yard."Our contractor lets us use the 20X8 feet container. We use the toilets inside the trains and bathe with the help of water pipelines provided along the length of the platform to fill the tanks in coaches,” he says.The steel container has two small windows and an emergency light.Ram's coworker, Md. Amjad Ali from Bihar's Begusarai, is still holding onto hope that things will return to normal and he will have enough money to go home soon."There's not a single paisa in my pocket right now," Ali says, as he eats the remaining morsels of khichdi in his plate."I have been doing this work for two months. We got our salaries last month. I am awaiting the wages for April, then I will go home," he says, and asks if some help can be sent to the "workers stuck in the yard"."We get just one meal during the day. We have been sleeping empty stomachs," he says, before running towards a man who called out his name.

17-05-2020||Jerusalem||COVID-19: Stranded Indians in Israel excited to return home on May 25||Out of work and almost broke amid a ranging COVID-19 pandemic, many Indians working as caregivers in Israel have heaved a sigh of relief at the eagerly-awaited announcement that a special Air India flight will operate on May 25 to bring back Indian nationals stranded in the country.The Indian government launched the 'Vande Bharat Mission' on May 7 to bring back Indians who were stranded in various countries due to coronavirus-related restrictions.Under the phase one of the mission, the government evacuated a total of 6,527 Indians from the Gulf region and other countries like the US, the UK, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Malaysia and the Maldives."Air India has planned a flight on Delhi-Tel Aviv - Delhi sector on May 25 to repatriate Indian nationals stranded in Israel and are willing to meet the conditions set by the government such as an undertaking that they will go for mandatory quarantine. We will also offer Israelis who are currently in India and looking to come back to Israel to take the Delhi-Tel Aviv flight," Air India's country manager, Pankaj Tiwari, told PTI.The Indian embassy in Tel Aviv, in an announcement on May 15, said that it was looking into the possibility of facilitating the return of interested Indian nationals from Israel, who could not travel earlier due to COVID-19-related international travel restrictions."The passenger will have to bear the expenditure of travel and mandatory quarantine for self and family members (if accompanying) at destination", the announcement said."Around 140 people have so far contacted them for repatriation, out of which around 90 have provided their details and willingness to pay for ticket and quarantine," the embassy officials told PTI.With an overwhelming majority of possible passengers looking to go to Kerala, the Ministry of External Affairs is said to be looking at the possibility of arranging a connecting flight to Kochi from Delhi.Annama Siby, who is from Kerala's Idukki district and came to Israel in 2013 as a caregiver but has been recently cleaning houses in Tel Aviv for a living, said that most of the people looking to go back are those without a job."I am without a job for almost four months now. I have no money and no work. I have to pay rent for my room and Israel is such an expensive place. The Israeli government has given us the permission to work but even those who would earlier give us some work are scared because of the coronavirus and we have to sit idle", Siby said."I want to go back to be with my husband and two sons, 8 and 13. I have requested the embassy to register me for the flight. I will borrow money from friends now and settle with them once I am back in India", she said.Her husband, who is a school teacher in Idukki, has been taking care of the children. She had been visiting them once every two years earlier, but now does not plan to return.Alex D'Souza, a 65-year-old man from Mangalore in Karnataka has been working near Beit Shemesh as a caregiver for 13 years. His employer died on March 17 this year and he has been without work and pay since then."I have registered for the flight but do not know how much I have to pay. I hope it is not something ridiculous like I heard of the people evacuated from Abu Dhabi had to pay", he said.Anusree Sasi, who is from Ernakulam in Kerala, was planning to go back after completing work as per her contract on March 27 to get married and settle down. The COVID-19 lockdown has her stranded here due to lack of international flights and with no income during the past month and a half."I have worked in Ashkelon for two and a half years as a caregiver and didn't expect this to happen. I want to go back, get married and have no plans to come back," she said.Some several Indian students and researchers have applied to go back for various reasons.Akhila Viswan, a postdoctoral fellow at Bar-Ilan University had declined to take an extension and informed her Chemistry department about her plans to leave for India after finishing her one-year term. Her family has been waiting for her to come back and to get married."I did not extend my visa which got over in April as I am certain about going back. It has been a good learning experience here in Israel otherwise", she said.Two of her friends have also registered to be repatriated with one securing a teaching position in India and the other looking to join his wife who is in an advanced stage of pregnancy.Ministry of External Affairs will be approving the list of the passengers following which the Air India would be reaching out to them for bookings. The passengers would then receive a link for payments as has been the practice during evacuation of Indians from other destinations.India has been under lockdown since March 25 to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has claimed 2,872 lives and infected 90,927 people as of Sunday. All scheduled commercial passenger flights have been suspended during the lockdown period.The deadly coronavirus which originated from China's Wuhan city in December last year has claimed 311,821 lives and infected over 4.6 million people, according to Johns Hopkins University data.

17-05-2020||---||FM announces Rs 40,000 crore more for MGNREGA to help migrants||New Delhi, May 17Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her fifth and last press conference to detail the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Rs 20-lakh crore COVID stimulus package, on Sunday, announced a hike in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment (MGNREGA) by Rs 40,000 crore to help migrants returning to their homes, entry for the private sector in all strategic sectors and an incentive-based hike in the borrowing ceiling for the states.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also announced initiatives towards the health and education sectors, including “One Classroom One Channel” online teaching, a special capsule for the ‘divyang’ and allowing 100 top universities to launch online courses from May 30.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Union Government intended decriminalising a dozen categories of offences under the Companies Act, the ease of doing business index and has extended relief to the MSMEs and corporates from insolvency proceedings.Faced with criticism of not doing enough for the migrants, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the Rs. 40,000-crore hike in the MGNREGA would be in addition to this year’s Rs 61,000-crore package to generate an additional 300-crore man days of employment in villages.In another major declaration of the intent to open up strategic sectors, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman described the contours of a Public Enterprise Policy that would restrict the PSUs to no more than four in each such sector and permit the private sector in all of them.At her fourth press conference on Saturday, she had mentioned the opening up of atomic energy and space sectors.“We shall define the areas where their presence will be impact-fully felt. There will be notified sectors where at least one PSE will be present while the private sector will be allowed to play a role,” she explained.For states, the Centre had devolved Rs 46,038 crore in April and given revenue deficit grant of Rs 12,390 crore on time. The states also used Rs 11,092 crore from the State Disaster Relief Fund. Now, the Union Government has allowed states to borrow up to five per cent of their respective GDPs from the existing three per cent subject on four conditions.“Each hike is linked to a clearly specified measurable feasible reform — One Nation One Ration Card, local urban body revenue collection changes, reforms in power distribution and ease doing business. The states will be allowed to borrow more if they achieve all the four milestones,” said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.In health, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman promised an all-round upgrade and said this was an ongoing process with the Union Health Ministry having released Rs 4,113 crore for direct funding of anti-COVID activities.The Minister dwelt on major changes in three matters related to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code — debts incurred due to COVID shall not be considered as default, there will be no fresh insolvency proceedings for one year from the present six months and a special insolvency framework will deal with medium and scale-scale enterprises (MSMEs). The Union Government will issue an Ordinance to raise their insolvency limit from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1 crore.It has also been decided to issue an Ordinance to decriminalise technical and procedural defaults under the Companies Act instead of waiting for the Parliament to pass a pending Bill.Seven compoundable offences will be dropped and five to be dealt with by an alternative framework. Under the head of ease of doing business, companies can list securities in foreign jurisdictions and a company listing non-convertible debentures will not be regarded as a listed company.Highlights: The minimum threshold to initiate insolvency proceedings raised from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1 crore: FMTrying to decriminalise most of the sections in the Companies Act: FMThe next 0.5 per cent will be released for completing a tranch. After at least 3 tranches are completed, the last 0.5 per cent will be released.Spending on agri infrastructure and other measures for agriculture and allied sectors in the third tranche totalled to Rs 1.5 lakh crore. The fourth and fifth tranches that dealt mostly with structural reforms totalled to Rs 48,100 crore, she said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fm-announces-rs-40-000-crore-more-for-mgnrega-to-help-migrants-85977

Indian start-ups are not so much equipped to take up space challenges. Even atomic energy is being converted to PPP mode which is a major step towards privatisation. Corporatisation and PPP are the routes for privatisation, and privatisation the route for foreignisation,” the BMS said.BMS chief Saji Narayanan said they would call a meeting of the office-bearers and federations to decide the future course, terming the announcements by the Finance Minister as a “sad day for the nation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/why-depend-on-failed-ideas-asks-rss-affiliate-85918
