31-05-2020||New Delhi||As lockdown 4.0 ends, states come with varied guidelines to ease more curbs||State governments on Sunday came out with varied ‘Unlock 1' guidelines, including on allowing inter-state travel, even as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana extended the lockdown till June 30 with several relaxations, a day after the Centre eased the 68-day shutdown curbs significantly with an economic focus.As the Centre's three-phase unlock plan that will restrict curbs to containment zones kicks in from Monday after the end of the fourth phase of the national lockdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi cautioned people against showing any laxity in the fight against COVID-19 and asked them to be "extra alert and careful", while acknowledging that the poor and labourers have been hit the hardest by the crisis. “Becoming careless or lackadaisical cannot be an option”.Also read: Punjab issues guidelines for lockdown 5.0, from June 1 to June 30As Delhi, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha recorded the biggest spurt in cases in a single day so far, Modi in his monthly 'Mann Ki Baat' broadcast warned people against letting their guard down while noting that a big part of the economy has opened and train and flight services have begun operating partially with more relaxations on the anvil.With the Centre seeking to underline the reduced footprint of the unprecedented lockdown in force since March 25, its strategy revolved around localised lockdowns leaving it to states to decide where, how and to what extent to lift the shutdown as the number of COVID-19 cases varied from state to state. The phased reopening of areas outside the containment zones will be effective till June 30.The Home Ministry on Saturday said 'Unlock-1' will come in force from June 8 under which the lockdown norms will be relaxed to a great extent, including opening of shopping malls, restaurants and religious places, while strict restrictions will remain in place till June 30 in the country's worst-hit areas. A total of 30 municipality areas in the country are considered to be the worst-hit.The Maharashtra government while announcing the extension of the lockdown in the entire state till June 30, preferred to call the new phase of reopening as "Mission Begin Again". It allowed many relaxations and phase-wise resumption of activities.All markets, market areas and shops, except malls, will be allowed to open in Maharashtra from June 5 on the odd-even basis in non-containment zones. However, religious places, shopping malls, hotels and restaurants will continue to remain closed.In a major relief, the state government allowed outdoor physical activities like morning walks and cycling.Maharashtra is the worst affected state, reporting 65,168 cases and 2,197 deaths so far.The Tamil Nadu government while announcing the extension of the lockdown till June 30 said curbs will remain for inter-state bus transport and Metro and suburban train services. With 22,333 cases, the state is in the second position in the national tally.Mizoram also extended the lockdown till June 30 while it will be in force till June 8 in Jammu and Kashmir.States like Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka also lifted restrictions on the inter-state and intra-state movement of people and goods.The UP government allowed inter-state travel but left it to the district administrations of Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddh Nagar to take a call on the movement of people from adjoining Delhi.The Noida-Delhi border will remain sealed for movement of people to and from the national capital, the Gautam Buddh Nagar administration said in its latest guidelines in the evening.A  Delhi government official said it is in favour of allowing inter-state movement of people from Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon and other NCR cities as phase-wise relaxations are set to start from next month.The official said the Delhi government has not opposed the movement of people from these towns and it is the authorities in Uttar Pradesh and Haryana which have restricted the entry from the national capital, citing spike in COVID-19 cases. With 19,844 cases, Delhi is in the third position in the national COVIDE-19 tally.In Maharashtra, the guidelines said inter-state and inter-district movement of persons like stranded migrant workers shall continue to be regulated.The MHA had said there shall be no restriction on inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods and no additional permission is required for such travel."However, if a state or UT, based on reasons of public health and its assessment of the situation, proposes to regulate movement of persons, it will give wide publicity in advance regarding the restrictions to be placed on such movement, and the related procedures to be followed," it said.The Rajasthan government allowed government and private sector organsiations to function with full strength of their employees and said there would be no restriction on inter-state and intra-state movement of persons and goods.The Gujarat government has decided to allow shops and businesses located outside the COVID-19 containment zones to operate without any restrictions.In Uttarakhand, Tourism Minister Satpal Maharaj, his wife Amrita Rawat and 21 others, including members of his family and staff, tested positive for coronavirus.An official said Satpal Maharaj had also attended a meeting of the state cabinet on Friday.Two Delhi Police Assistant Sub-Inspectors have died due to COVID-19 since Saturday evening, taking the overall coronavirus casualty figure in the force to three, officials said.In Madhya Pradesh, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the lockdown in the state to contain coronavirus will be extended till June 15.The West Bengal government extended the lockdown by two more weeks till June 15, but also announced some conditional relaxations June 1 onwards, including for allowing TV and cinema production activities. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-lockdown-4-0-ends-states-come-with-varied-guidelines-to-ease-more-curbs-92515

The complainant alleged that the TDP chief had flouted lockdown rules during his visit from Hyderabad to his residence in Undavalli near Amaravati.Naidu who arrived in Andhra Pradesh last Monday had drawn attention from several quarters for turning his travel into a party event at several places where he had his party men welcome him without following any COVID-19 preventive measures.At all the places where Naidu stopped, TDP men were seen crowding around the vehicle without wearing masks and grossly ignoring physical distancing.The TDP chief had sought permission from Andhra Pradesh Police and reached Undavalli along with his son Nara Lokesh at 1 pm on Monday by road.The TDP chief stopped at a few points on National Highway No 9 and brazenly broke the lockdown rules to interact with the TDP cadre.The Andhra Pradesh High Court already has a petition pending before it on the issue of TDP chief violating the lockdown rules.The TDP has termed this as political vendetta by the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) leaders after being shocked at the response received by the former chief minister during his visit to Vijaywada.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ap-police-books-former-cm-chandrababu-naidu-for-violating-lockdown-norms-92502

31-05-2020||Mumbai||Won’t operate non-essential flights if ‘distasteful’ treatment is not stopped: AI’s pilot union||Alleging “harassment” of cockpit crew by health officials at Delhi airport, the national carrier Air India’s Airbus fleet pilots’ body, Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), on Sunday, warned that its members would not operate any flight other than the essential services if such “distasteful” treatment meted out to them is not stopped.In a letter to Air India executive director (Operations) RS Sandhu, the ICPA, which represents over 700 members, has also sought clarity on the protocol that is to be followed in case a pilot operating the ‘Vande Bharat Mission’ or domestic flights is tested positive for COVID-19.Air India has been operating special evacuation flights to transport stranded Indian nationals from abroad in the wake of the pandemic.“As you are aware, the crew of Delhi-Moscow flight on May 30 had a traumatic day after one of the pilots tested laboratory COVID-19 positive. The rest of the crew were made to wait the entire day without any food or refreshments. The health officials at the Delhi airport failed to comply with the government orders and the protocol to be followed for both the pre and post-flight COVID-19 testing for crew operating Vande Bharat Mission flights was thrown out of the window. Hence, the crew were shuffled to multiple places aimlessly. The crew were harassed by the health officials at the airport,” the ICPA stated in the letter.On Saturday, an Air India flight that was on its way to Moscow to bring back Indian nationals from there was forced to come back mid-away after the airline officials on the ground realised that the pilot of the flight was “mistakenly” given a “negative” report for the virus while he was actually tested “positive”.Stating in the letter that the pilots were being “forced” to be taken to a government medical facility for a period of seven days and that it was only after the institutional quarantine facilities refused to accept the crew, they were allowed to go home to follow home-isolation for 14 days, the ICPA said.The ICPA added: “Not to mention, the post-flight COVID-19 testing was violated. On return, the COVID-19 testing was not carried out and they were also not accommodated in a hotel as per the protocol. This can be construed as a lack of coordination between Air India, the Ministry of Home Affairs, aviation regulator DGCA and the health officials at the airport.”According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the DGCA’s March 23 circulars, “If a laboratory positive case of COVID-19 is found in a flight, the entire crew has to be de-rostered for a minimum of 14 days. The crew needs to follow home-isolation during the time in their own country,” the ICPA said.Though as per the MHA order of May 5, the standard operating procedure for movement of Indian nationals stranded outside the country requires RT-PCR test for passengers, “it has been brought to our notice this is not being followed,” the ICPA alleged.“We are operating flights under the ‘Vande Bharat Mission’ as ‘national duty’ and the treatment meted out to the operating crew is distasteful. We do not appreciate the treatment perpetrated to our crew and if history repeats itself, we will not be in a position to operate any flights other than the essential services,” the ICPA warned in the letter.

31-05-2020||New Delhi||Bhima Koregaon: Ex-information commissioners urge Maha CM to release Varavara Rao||Two former information commissioners have written to Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to release 80-year-old Telugu poet P Varavara Rao, who is in judicial custody in Bhima Koregaon case, on humanitarian grounds.In their letter, former commissioners Shailesh Gandhi and Sridhar Acharyulu claimed that there is “a lack of evidence” against Rao.“Pune police and State Investigation Team having investigated the case for 16 weeks could not collect even an iota of evidence to prove the wild charge that this 80-year-old man from Hyderabad has conspired/attempted to murder Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” they said.The case was taken over by the National Investigation Agency after change in government in Maharashtra.The case is related to speeches delivered at the Elgar Parishad conclave, held at Shaniwarwada in Pune on December 31, 2017, and the next day’s violence near the Koregaon Bhima war memorial in the district.Pune Police claimed that the conclave was backed by Maoists and the speeches made there triggered the violence.During the probe, the police arrested Left-leaning activists Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Mahesh Raut, Shoma Sen, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj and Varavara Rao for alleged Maoist links.Citing the constitutional position, the former information commissioners in their letter said, “The subject of ‘Law and order’ is in the state list as per the distribution of powers under the Indian Constitution, which cannot be taken away by the Centre without any such request from the state or by the court”.“It is a well-established principal of criminal justice that the accused shall be presumed innocent until the charge is proved beyond reasonable doubt. Because of lack of evidence, Varavara Rao has every right to be acquitted as not guilty. Only awaited legal formality is the final judgment of acquittal by court,” they said.The former information commissioners highlighted Rao’s frail health, Supreme Court order on undertrials during COVID-19 scenario, lack of information to his family to appeal for his release.“The magistrate who is hearing the case is seeking a medical report about Varavara Rao, since several adjournments. When the court was hearing the bail petition on 29th, the medical team was attending unconscious Varavara Rao. But the medical report was not submitted to the court,” the letter said.The ex-commissioners appealed to the chief minister to take either of the steps to acquit him, release him on bail, shift him to Hyderabad Hospital, permit the family to meet him in the hospital, facilitate a videoconferencing with family, disclose his medical condition or share certified copies of entire file notings related to handing over of his case to NIA.

PM Modi announced lockdown to prevent its spread. I made some changes in the machine and gave it to Satana Nagar Parishad to sprinkle disinfectants during the pandemic,” he said.With the help of the machine, roads, housing societies, doors and compound walls can be cleaned to curb the spread of the infection, he said.“I am very happy that PM Modi has taken note of my work. Irrespective of my age, I will do more such work for the farmers and the nation,” Jadhav, who had won the President’s medal for one such innovation in 2017, said.“The machine has two aluminium blades fixed on each side. These blades rotate, absorb air from opposite directions and spray the disinfectants using force. A 15-HP tractor can be used to operate the machine which can clean even 15-feet high walls. This machine has 600-litre capacity tank,” he added.Operating the machine needs minimal human intervention and thereby helps in curbing the spread of the infection, he said.“We developed the machine in 25 days. It is currently being used by Satana Nagar Parishad (municipal council) to sanitise 30 km area in the town,” he said.According to Jadhav, he has applied for its patent and also sent its design to National Innovation Foundation (NIF).

We throw many objects into the seawater as part of our rituals," said the lawmaker from the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party led by Prime Minister Imran Khan.Shafiq, a local Muslim youth, said Hindus who come to the temple throw many things including valuables into the seawater under the bridge as part of their rituals and this means the local boys can earn their livelihood by collecting them from the Arabian Sea.Shafiq, 20, and 17-year old Ali along with some others dive into the sea from time to time to retrieve the objects thrown by the worshippers and visitors to the temple.According to Shafiq, the boys have found gold jewellery, silver ornaments, coins and other valuable objects from the seawater."We have now trained ourselves and become expert divers, swimmers and can keep underwater and hold our breath for a long time as we search for the objects,” he said.Asked whether the visitors to the temple or its caretakers object to them retrieving and taking away objects given as part of religious rituals, Ali said sometimes they are shouted at and told to go away."When the heat is on we disappear for a few days but return to our spot under the bridge. We remain here till the temple is open for worship. Throughout the day we are in the seawater searching for the thrown objects,” he said.Asked what they did with the objects retrieved from the sea, he said they sold them."We have found many things in the sea in the last few years. The Hindus who come here are very devoted in their worship and to their rituals,” Shafiq said.But Ali complained that these days there was no rush at the temple due to the coronavirus pandemic and it has made their livelihood more difficult."Nowadays there is less rush because of the coronavirus problem. We also follow social distancing for the devotees. We don't allow more than four or five people into the temple at same time,” explained Vivek, one of the caretakers at the ancient temple.Eight years ago, the Sindh High Court stopped the Karachi Port Trust authorities from demolishing the temple when a big recreation spot and food court, now known as Grand Port, was being built close to the temple.Pakistan is home to several temples revered by Hindus. The Katas Raj temple in the northeastern Chakwal district and Sadhu Bela temple in southern Sukkur district are the two most-visited sites by Hindus, who form the biggest minority community in Muslim-majority Pakistan.According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.Majority of Pakistan's Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with their Muslim fellows.

31-05-2020||Kathmandu||Amid border row with India, Nepal govt tables Bill in Parliament to amend Constitution for new map||The Nepal government on Sunday tabled a Constitution amendment Bill in Parliament aimed at altering the country’s map amid a border dispute with India.Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Shivamaya Tumbahangphe, on behalf of the government of Nepal, tabled the Bill, a day after the main Opposition Nepali Congress also backed the legislation.It will be the second amendment to the Constitution.Nepal recently released the revised political and administrative map of the country, laying claim over the strategically key areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura.India reacted angrily to the move saying such “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims will not be acceptable and asked the neighbouring country to refrain from such “unjustified cartographic assertion”.The Bill seeks to amend the political map of Nepal included in Schedule 3 of the Constitution. The new map will be used in all official documents, including the coat of arms, after the amendment Bill is endorsed through Parliament. Parliament will now deliberate on the proposal before endorsing the Bill.After its endorsement by both the Houses of Parliament, the President will order issuance of the Bill. The central committee of the main Opposition party Nepali Congress on Saturday decided to back the Bill.Last week, the proposed Bill was removed from the business schedule of Parliament at the last minute at the request of Minister K P Sharma Oli.The discussion on the Constitution amendment Bill was delayed as the Nepali Congress asked for more time to discuss the matter in its high-level body.Similarly, the Samajbadi Janata Party Nepal and the Rastriya Janata Party Nepal demanded that their long-standing calls for Constitution amendment also be incorporated.It requires a two-thirds majority to endorse the Constitution amendment Bill.During an all-party meeting on Tuesday, Prime Minister Oli urged the top leaders of all political parties represented in parliament to unanimously endorse it.The ties between India and Nepal came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory.India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.Nepalese Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali earlier this month summoned Indian Ambassador Vinay Mohan Kwatra and handed over a diplomatic note to protest against India inaugurating the key road.However, Gyawali last week said that he was confident that the Kalapani issue between the two neighbours will be resolved through talks.India on Thursday indicated its readiness to engage with Nepal to resolve the festering border row based on mutual sensitivity and respect.India is monitoring the current situation in Nepal, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said referring to Kathmandu deferring a plan to bring in a constitutional amendment to validate a new map that depicted Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territory.             “India is open to engaging with all its neighbours on the basis of mutual sensitivity and mutual respect, in an environment of trust and confidence. This is a continuous process and requires constructive and positive efforts,” Srivastava said.The Lipulekh pass is a far western point near Kalapani, a disputed border area between Nepal and India. Both India and Nepal claim Kalapani as an integral part of their territory—India as part of Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district and Nepal as part of Dharchula district.

31-05-2020||New Delhi||AI makes it mandatory for crew to check pre-flight COVID-19 test results are negative||Air India has made it mandatory for its pilots and cabin crew members to check and confirm that their pre-flight COVID-19 test results are negative before they operate an aircraft, according to an official communication issued hours after the Delhi-Moscow flight incident involving a pilot on Saturday.An Air India flight from Delhi to Moscow with no passenger on-board was asked to return midway on Saturday after its ground staff realised that one of the pilots of the plane had tested positive for coronavirus but was assigned the duty following an oversight by a team checking pre-flight medical reports of the crew."The COVID-19 test is being conducted by the airline at a substantial cost, with considerable effort. As it is a recent procedure and there is a shortage of staff in office, there is a possibility of oversight in this matter," said Captain R S Sandhu, Executive Director (Operations), Air India in a circular, which has been accessed by PTI."The test is primarily designed to mitigate the risk of transmission among the crew. Every effort will be made by the personnel dealing with the testing and rostering of crew to ensure that the reports are checked before the crew is being rostered for a flight," he stated in the circular.However, it is imperative that the individual crew member also checks and reconfirms his or her test result, Sandhu said."In case of any oversight in this matter, not only are there avoidable adverse operational issues, tarnishing the image of the airline, but also irresponsible exposure of a fellow crew member to this disease," Sandhu mentioned."Therefore, it is mandatory for every individual crew member to check and confirm a 'negative' report result, before undertaking a flight. Any laxity in this matter will be dealt with severity," he added.About Saturday's incident, two senior bureaucrats had said there was a "lapse" on the part of officials responsible to scrutinise the coronavirus test reports of the crew members and that aviation regulator DGCA has already begun an investigation into the case based on a preliminary report by the airline.The Airbus A320 plane departed around 7.15 am on Saturday for Moscow to bring back a group of stranded Indians under the Vande Bharat evacuation mission and it was back in Delhi by 12.30 pm following orders from the authorities, the officials said.They said the airline officials tasked to examine medical reports of the crew did not look at the pilot's test results properly before assigning him the duty.According to a standard operating procedure, pilots and other crew members of any flight are required to undergo mandatory testing for coronavirus and are assigned duties if the laboratory results are negative.The plane with registration number VT-EXR was in the airspace of Uzbekistan when it was told to return. All crew members including the Delhi-based pilot with coronavirus infection have been quarantined after they arrived in Delhi, the officials said."In this case, the airline officials did not look at the pilot's test results properly and deemed him fit to fly, assuming that he is COVID-19 negative, even when the test results stated otherwise," said an official in the DGCA.In a statement, Air India had said on Saturday that it recalled the aircraft immediately when it was noticed that one of the cockpit crew had tested positive in the pre-flight COVID-19 test."Immediately after landing all cockpit and cabin crew have been tested and all laid down medical precautions are being taken to ensure their health and safety. Another aircraft has taken off today to operate the Vande Bharat flight from Moscow to Delhi," Air India said.

31-05-2020||New Delhi||Fourth phase of lockdown accounts for nearly half of total COVID cases in India||The fourth phase of the coronavirus-triggered lockdown, which began on May 18, saw 85,974 COVID-19 cases till 8 am on Sunday, which is nearly half of the total cases reported in the country so far.Lockdown 4.0, which will end on May 31 midnight, has accounted for 47.2 per cent of the total coronavirus infection cases, number crunching from the Union Health Ministry data reveals.The lockdown, which was first clamped on March 25 and spanned for 21 days, had registered 10,877 cases, while the second phase of the curbs that began on April 15 and stretched for 19 days till May 3, saw 31,094 cases.The third phase of the lockdown that was in effect for 14 days ending on May 17, recorded 53,636 cases till 8 am of May 18.The country had registered 512 coronavirus infection cases till March 24.India is the ninth worst-hit nation by the COVID-19 pandemic as of now.              The first case of COVID-19 in India was reported on January 30 from Kerala after a medical student of Wuhan university, who had returned to India, tested  positive for the virus.India registered its highest single-day spike of COVID-19 cases on Sunday, with 8,380 new infections reported in the last 24 hours, taking the country’s tally to 1,82,143, while the death toll rose to 5,164, according to the Union Health Ministry.The number of active COVID-19 cases stood to 89,995, while 86,983 people have recovered and one patient has migrated, it said.“Thus, around 47.75 per cent patients have recovered so far,” a senior Health Ministry official said. With the fourth phase of lockdown ending on Sunday, the Home Ministry on Saturday said ‘Unlock-1’ will be initiated in the country from June 8 under which the nationwide lockdown will be relaxed to a great extent, including opening of shopping malls, restaurants and religious places, even as strict restrictions will remain in place till June 30 in the country’s worst-hit areas.While announcing the extension of the lockdown in containment zones across the country, the Home Ministry said temples, mosques, churches and other religious places and shopping malls will be allowed to open in a phased manner from June 8, while a decision on opening of schools and colleges will be taken in July in consultation with states.

31-05-2020||New Delhi||Made in lockdown: Couples recast big fat Indian wedding, get back to simplicity||Their plans of tying the knot hopelessly tangled in a pandemic that shows no signs of abating, many a wedding has been postponed but some couples are choosing to get married in simple, intimate ceremonies that are just about them.Recasting the idea of the big fat Indian wedding—with guest lists running into many hundreds, sometimes up to 2,000, and lakhs of rupees spent on multiple functions and elaborate clothes—couples are going back to the basics on arguably the most important day of their lives.Retaining the essence of romance and maybe the gravitas that should go with a long-term commitment, they are saying “I do” on rooftops, homes, temples, churches, and sometimes even state borders, with only immediate family in attendance. Sans ‘band, baaja, baraat' and other extra frills, but with masks, sanitisers and social distancing norms in place.“We didn't have a grand procession, decorations, firecrackers, feasts and relatives, but this was indeed the most memorable experience of my life,” said a bride in Odisha's Jagatsinghpur district who did not want to be named."We had earlier arranged for a grand function. But the lockdown threw a spanner in the works. So we decided to donate a part of the money saved for the wedding to help the state combat the pandemic," said Jyoti Ranjan Swain, the groom, a resident of Erasama block in the district.Apart from the parents, an inspector of the Erasama police station and the block development officer (BDO) attended the wedding."This was no social gathering. The couple distributed sweets after the ceremony. It was a simple affair," said the BDO Kartik Chandra Behera.There have been many unlikely wedding venues over the years, but a checkpost on the Assam-West Bengal border is likely to be top amongst them.That's where Om Prakash Sha from Jalpaiguri in West Bengal reportedly wed Kajol from Dhubri in Assam last week.Given the restrictions on movement from one state to the other and mandatory quarantine, the families approached the administrations of both districts for permission.  After much discussion, officials decided the wedding would take place on the Dhubri-Jalpaiguri ‘boundary'.The bride's father Mahesh Sha said his family accepted the advice of the administration and the priest to go ahead with the wedding despite the odds because it was an auspicious day. Taufiq Hussain and Abeda Begum also decided to go ahead with their wedding despite the lockdown. They got married at home in Goalpara, Assam, last month with only eight family members present."This is the way marriages should always be conducted… among close relatives and people who matter rather than the usual fanfare and large sums of money being spent,” said Hussain.His words found resonance many hundred miles away in the Tamil Nadu capital Chennai where K Shakthivel got married last month on the terrace of his home."It resulted in a saving of at least 75 per cent of the originally planned expenditure of a few lakhs," Shaktivel, an AC mechanic, said.Only 10 family members were present since the hall he had booked was shut in view of the lockdown. But Shaktivel was content.And that's how it was for Rebin Vincent Gralan and Cila Lona, too, in neighbouring Kerala. They got married on April 15 at the St. Joseph's parish shrine in Pavaratty with only 10 family members in attendance.  "The date for the wedding was fixed earlier itself… we both convinced everyone to hold the marriage on the same date itself and it was conducted as a low-key function," Gralan told PTI.There is no point in waiting for the pandemic to end, agreed Alex Paul, a businessman in Ernakulam who is all set to get married on June 15.       "We got engaged almost a year ago and had elaborate plans for a major wedding. But then came coronavirus and the lockdown. Now the wedding date has been decided as it is almost sure that this pandemic scare is not going to end anytime soon,” he said.His grand wedding was downsized to a small affair at a temple in Karnataka's Mandya district but 30-year-old Ravi Gowda is not complaining. He got married on April 20 as he had planned, and that's all that matters.     "I had invited about 2,000-2,500 people for my wedding at a marriage hall in Bangalore's Rajarajeshwari Nagar on April 20… We got married on the same date at our village temple in Mandya," he said.He said he spent about Rs 10 lakh for the arrangements in Bangalore, but hasn't got the money back yet.Not everyone wants to get married without family and friends though. Shraddha Patel in Chhattisgarh's Durg district, for instance, was supposed to get married on May 17 but has postponed the plans."I don't want a lavish wedding with hundreds of guests, but at least I want my close friends and relatives to be present there on the occasion. We are trying to figure out when to hold the wedding," the 24-year-old teacher told PTI.There are also those who got married with parents looking on – virtually.       Research analyst Chaitanya and IT professional Thanuj were going to get married on April 30 in Kannur in Kerala but could not because of the lockdown. They waited and finally tied the knot on May 24 in Bangalore at the bride's uncle's home with 12 relatives present.“The lockdown was getting extended and the virus cases were surging. There was no point in waiting as the uncertainty was continuing,” the bride's father A K Sudhakaran told PTI.       Most of his daughter's jewellery was in a bank locker at Kannur so a few gold ornaments were bought for the big day. Both sets of parents and other close relatives saw the event on Zoom.A businessman in Patna also went ahead and got the eldest of his three daughters married at a temple rather than wait for the lockdown to end.“Everything was finalised. Even the engagement and ‘tilak' functions were done before the lockdown, so I decided to get my daughter married at a temple,” the father told PTI on the condition of anonymity.Sneha Anil Mahajan, a mother in Nagpur whose daughter got married on May 8 said the family decided not to postpone the wedding because the date was an auspicious one.“Only about 45 to 50 guests attended. We had a guest list of over 1,000 people but it was not possible to invite them in such health crisis,” she said.“All the guests were given sanitisers and masks and we strictly followed social distancing norms. Each ritual was explained in detail which normally would not have been possible. A marriage to remember for a lifetime. We have no regrets,” said the mother, looking forward to a grand reception once the pandemic is behind everybody. And sometimes, the young just overcome every obstacle on the way.  Like 19-year-old Goldie, who earlier this month walked 80 km from Kanpur to Kannauj in Uttar Pradesh to wed her fiance alone, unafraid and determined that the continuing lockdown would not interfere with their plans.When lockdown throws a hurdle on the way to matrimony, just jump it – that's what young couple seems to be saying as the coronavirus continues its spread.

To ensure that students who are not present in the district where their school is located, the candidates have been allowed to appear for the remaining examinations from an exam centre located in a CISCE affiliated school in the location they are in,” said Gerry Arathoon, chief executive and secretary, CISCE.Students who are unable to appear for the remaining exams due to COVID-19 will be permitted to take the exams at the time of conduct if compartmental exams, he added.The students have been asked to make request for change in the exam centre by June 7 with their respective schools.The Council has also asked schools to ensure social distancing is followed and directed candidates to carry hand sanitisers and wear face masks.Unlike the CBSE, which will conduct the pending exams in only 29 subjects crucial for promotion and admission to higher educational institutions, the CISCE will hold all pending exams.The pending Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) exams are scheduled from July 1 to 15.Universities and schools across the country have been closed since March 16 when the Centre announced a countrywide classroom shutdown as part of a slew of measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.Later, the government announced a nationwide lockdown which began on March 25. The lockdown was initially imposed for a 21-day period till April 14. However, it has been extended thrice. The current phase of the lockdown will last till May 31.The schedule for the board exams has been decided in order to ensure that they are completed before competitive examinations. While engineering entrance exam JEE-Mains is scheduled to be held from July 18 to July 23, medical entrance exam NEET is scheduled for July 26.

The course will commence in early June.“Besides these five BSF officers, three more officers of the same rank have been kept in reserve,” a BSF officer said. The course is designed for officers of the rank of DIG and Commandant and consists of about 20 participants.The three-week refresher course was initiated by the ITBP last year after the force felt it necessary to put middle and senior rung officers through a training regimen to keep up their fitness levels. The syllabus has a component of physical exercises as well as theory classes.ITBP officers of the rank of Commandant and Inspector General from the general duty cadre and all officers from the non-general duty cadre are required to attend the refresher courses in batches.While the fundamental charter of the border guarding forces, which function under the Ministry of Home Affairs, is same, they function in vastly different terrain and climatic conditions. The ITBP is deployed in cold, high altitude areas while the BSF mans borders in the plans, deserts and marches. The Assam Rifles’ territory is the hilly forests of the north-east.Fitness is also an important service aspect for non-border guarding forces like the Central Reserve Police Force and the Central Industrial Security Force as they are deployed in internal security duties, counter-terrorist operations and anti-naxal operations.“These operating environments impose huge demands of physical as well as mental fitness and stress levels can run high,” an ITBP officer said. “This is the first time we are training senior BSF officers on this aspect and we are open to expanding the scope of our training to include more officers from other forces and assist them in formulating their own such training programmes,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/itbp-to-train-senior-officers-of-other-forces-in-physical-fitness-92421
31-05-2020||New Delhi||Mann ki Baat: PM Modi stresses on keeping up the vigil against coronavirus||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday stressed on keeping up the vigil against coronavirus even though there is a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, underlining, that the combat against the pandemic would be a long haul.In his monthly radio programme, ‘Mann Ki Baat’, Modi said that the disease and its concomitant challenges are new and gigantic to the world community, including India.He commended the people of India for fighting the disease unitedly with a fortitude which has helped contain it in a country as diverse and big as India.“The campaign against the disease is people-driven,” Modi said, adding that ennobling and admirable features of the Indian society have surfaced starkly during the national health crisis.The world has taken note of India’s fight against the disease and is anticipating innovative ways from it.He referred to a number of cases of selfless community services rendered by people. He noted the success stories of technological innovations by people to deal with life thrown out of gear by coronavirus.In this context, Modi referred to humanitarian service rendered by one Bhai Raju, a resident of Pathankot in Punjab. The good samaritan is physically-challenged and hails from the economically weaker section. He arranged for 3,000 face masks and food ration for 100 families during the lockdown.He said that poor, workers and labourers, including migrants, have been affected the most due to the lockdown.“Their hardships are ineffable,” Modi said and added that Centre, state governments and local self-governments, etc are all working to help them.Extolling the virtues of India’s ancient Ayurveda discipline of medicine and cure, Modi said world leaders have been evincing interest in it in the search for anti-dote to coronavirus during his interactions with them.He made a mention of Yoga, which he said has a suite of routine and postures which strengthen the respiratory system, as also steels immune system.In the context of the pandemic, and health issues-which was the overarching theme of his Mann Ki Baat address, he said that “Ayushman Bharat Yojana” has provided benefit to more than one crore people. As much as 80 per cent of them hail from rural areas of which 50 per cent are women.This Centre’s flagship health scheme has saved a total of Rs 14,000 crore of the beneficiaries which they would have had to incur on medical treatment.He urged for the conservation of rainwater in the coming monsoon, protection of the environment, country’s ecology and biodiversity.He appealed for the success of the “Aatma Nirbhar Bharat” campaign and said it has started gathering momentum. There is a growing echo of “vocal for local”.The government has taken measures to give a push to the country achieving “self-reliance”.“Reports say that people have started making a list of locally made products for consumptions.”Delving on India’s macro political-economy, Modi stressed on the significance of progress and advancement of eastern parts of India.“The development of eastern parts of the country is important for the development of the entire country. I have given importance to the issue. Several measures have been taken in this regard,” Modi said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mann-ki-baat-pm-modi-stresses-on-keeping-up-the-vigil-against-coronavirus-92420
31-05-2020||Chandigarh||18 Mohali institutes alumni pass out from NDA sans parade, parents||The Passing out Parade at the tri-service National Defence Academy (NDA), Kharakvasla on Saturday, saw as many as 18 alumni of Maharaja Ranjit Singh Armed Forces Preparatory Institute (AFPI), Mohali making the final step through its portals before joining their respective service academies for pre-commission training.They were part of the 138th NDA Course that completed its three-year rigorous training in the journey of a cadet towards becoming an officer. While the passing out parade is a grand affair, with parents and siblings of cadets as well as military and civilian dignitaries invited to the event, this time it was a low-key affair due to prevailing conditions of COVID-19.Instead of the customary outdoor parade in the revered Khetarpal Drill Square, a solemn ceremony was held in Habibulah Hall, the NDAs main auditorium. Only cadets of the passing out course and some members of the faculty attended the event, which was presided over by the Commandant, Lt Gen Asit Mistry.The passing out parade at the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, scheduled to be held next week, will also see a similar setting.A total of 335 cadets graduated from the NDA which includes 226 Army cadets, 44 Naval cadets and 65 Air Force cadets. In addition, there were 20 cadets from friendly foreign countries including Bhutan, Tajikistan, Maldives, Vietnam, Tanzania, Mauritius, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Turkmenistan, Fiji, Uzbekistan, Sudan, Mongolia and Bangladesh.In the normal course the cadets would have been given some leave on completion of their training to go home, but this year that has not been possible. They will be proceeding directly to their respective service academies and will possibly their due leave only when conditions permit. The AFPI alumni passing out on May 30 were from the 5th AFPI Course 2016 – 17. Several of them held senior appointments in the passing out course including Academy Cadet Adjutant Loveneet Singh, Battalion Cadet Captain Rajdeep Singh and Squadron Cadet Captain Arunav Laroiya. Loveneet Singh was awarded the Commandants Medal for Dedication to Duty and Arunav Laroiya was awarded the Commandants Medal for Exceptional Leadership.Loveneet’s father, Rupinder Singh, is a farmer who belongs to Jalalabad and Arunav’s father is an assistant general manager (IT) from Patiala. Both of Rajdeep’s parents are teachers, and they belong to village Nangli in Punjab.The 8th AFPI Course has completed its training in the Institute in April this year and selected candidates were scheduled to join NDA in July, but the commencement of the next NDA course is likely to be delayed as it has not been possible to complete all SSB interviews so far. As of now 17 cadets of this course have already qualified to join the next NDA course. Currently, the 9th and 10th courses are undergoing training at AFPI. This training is being conducted in the form of online classes for the time being.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/18-mohali-institutes-alumni-pass-out-from-nda-sans-parade-parents-92418

31-05-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||UK, US for including India in expanded G-7||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 31India may be invited to join the G-7 grouping if proposals by the US and the UK for its expansion are accepted by the other five members, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and France.Senior officials of the G-7 countries are expected to discuss the expansion in the weeks leading to a rescheduled Summit in the US in September.Seeking the entry of four countries in the G-7 with the express purpose of isolating China, US President Donald Trump said he would invite leaders of these nations — India, Russia, Australia and South Korea — as special invitees to the rescheduled G-7 summit.Three of these countries, barring Russia, are already partnering the US in a “Quad” grouping that aims to counter Chinese assertion in the South China Sea. After being isolated at the previous two summits, US President Donald Trump has called the grouping “outdated”.If the invites are sent, India will attend its second successive G-7 summit as a special invitee. Usually, special invitees, who also include chiefs of multilateral organisations, interact for about four hours with the G-7 leaders over two sessions.The then PM Manmohan Singh, along with the then Chinese President Hu Jintao, had attended five successive G-8 (Russia was then a member) summits from 2005 onwards as part of the G-5, which also included Mexico, Brazil and South Africa.  After just over a decade, India is the only survivor from that G-5 club. The other G-5 members — China, South Africa, Mexico and Brazil — do not appear to be eligible for the global high table.US President Donald Trump has suggested the inclusion of India, Australia, South Korea and Russia while the UK proposal wants the G-7 to exclude Russia and include the three democracies of India, Australia and South Korea.When India hosted the BRICS summit, it had invited leaders from the BIMSTEC countries, instead of the SAARC, to keep out Pakistan.France, with its deep economic and security interests in Africa, has always invited several countries from that continent at all summits it has hosted.Bangladesh is another country from the subcontinent that has earned several invites for the G-7 summits in the past with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina having attended two of them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uk-us-for-including-india-in-expanded-g-7-92407
31-05-2020||Delhi||Overnight rain, gusty winds bring mercury down in Delhi||Overnight rain, accompanied with gusty winds of up to 60 km per hour, brought the mercury down in the national capital on Sunday, the weather department said.The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative figures for the city, recorded 9.2 mm rainfall. On Saturday, it recorded the maximum temperature of six notches below normal.The Palam Observatory gauged 5mm rainfall overnight.The weatherman has predicted light rain and thunderstorm with winds gusting up to 50 kilometres per hour over Delhi-NCR on Sunday.Maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to hover around 35 and 22 degrees Celsius respectively.With another western disturbance being expected in northwest India in the first week of June, a heatwave is not likely to return to Delhi-NCR before June 8, the weather department.Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the India Meteorological Department's regional forecasting centre, said the effect of the current western disturbance and easterly winds will reduce significantly by Sunday evening.He said the maximum temperature in Delhi-NCR is likely to increase by two to four degrees Celsius from June 1 to June 3."However, the mercury will remain below 40 degrees Celsius over most places and heatwave conditions will not return," he said.A fresh western disturbance and southwesterly winds along with the formation of a low-pressure system in the Arabian Sea will bring moisture to Delhi-NCR, Srivastava said.These two systems will lead to thunderstorm and light rain over Delhi-NCR between June 3 and June 5."A heatwave is unlikely over northwest India till June 8," he said.

31-05-2020||Yavatmal (Maharashtra)||81-year-old Sikh man feeds 2 million on remote Maharashtra highway||Since the past over two months of lockdown, thousands of bus, trucks, tempos and other vehicles passing near Karanji on National Highway-7 make it a point to halt at a ramshackle tin shed with plastic sheets, beside the dry and dusty road.This is the only spot on a stretch of around 450 kms where a decent meal is available - free of cost - courtesy the services of Baba Karnail Singh Khaira, who is revered as Khaira Babaji in the region.“This is a remote, tribal region. Behind us for nearly 150-km, and ahead for nearly 300 km, there’s not a single dhaba or restaurant... So most people prefer to halt at ‘Guru ka langar’ and avail of our round-the-clock services,” Khaira Babaji told IANS.A simple ochre-colour board indicates ‘Gurudwara Sahib’, and ‘Dera Kar Seva Gurudwara Langar Sahib’, this tiny ‘Guru ka langar’ is linked with the historic Gurudwara Bhagod Sahib, Wai, located around 11 km away in a forested area, visited mostly by Sikhs.It was the spot where the 10th Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh had stayed in 1705, while en route to Nanded, some 250 km away, where he was assassinated on October 7, 1708. Nearly 125 years later, it bloomed as the world-famous ‘Gurudwara Takht Hazuri Sahib Sachkhand’ (Nanded), one of the Five Takhts in Sikhism.“Since the Gurudwara Bhagod Sahib is away from the main road, in 1988 (32 years ago), this free ‘langar’ came up here as its branch. I was assigned to manage it with the blessings and guidance of Nanded Gurudwara Sahib’s Baba Narinder Singhji and Baba Balwinder Singhji,” said Khaira Baba.A regular ‘langar’ for years, it was only from the March 24 lockdown that it became a saviour for thousands of hungry people including stranded migrants, travellers, truckers and villagers.“We had hordes of people coming daily and we kept continuously cooking food for them... We welcomed all with smiles and folded hands, irrespective of caste, religion... My regular team of 17 ‘sevaks’, including 11 cooks and other helpers were overworked, but ensured a non-stop supply of fresh, piping hot food,” Khaira Baba said.Luckily, his youngest brother Baba Gurbax Singh Khaira, 67, settled in New Jersey, USA, has pitched in with huge donations from the local (USA) Sikh community and Pandharkawada philanthropists like Pawanjit Kapoor, Salim Jetani or Kishore Tiwari, to keep the ‘Guru ka langar’ fires burning during lockdown.The services include breakfast of tea with hard bread or biscuits, and all meals are plain rice with tuvar dal, aloo-vadi and aloo vanga, and providing soap and borewell water for bathing to the weary visitors.Based on the number of disposable plates in which the crowds were served, Khaira Baba was himself astounded to learn that more than 15 lakh people were fed in the past 10 weeks, plus more than five lakhs took away parcels from the ‘langar’, and still counting.Another unique aspect here is feeding chapati-jaggery daily to around 250 dogs, plus cats, stray cattle and other mute animals in the vicinity grappling with a hunger crisis in lockdown.“I was born in Meerut (Uttar Pradesh), but left home at the age of 11 to answer ‘a mysterious call for service to humankind’, as a kid, I helped build a bridge on River Godavari here...,” he said, offering a peek into his background.Later, he lived in the Middle-East countries for around four years and spent another five years in Germany and other European countries organising funds for Gurudwara ‘langars’ and other services.“Though illiterate, I speak fluent English, Hindi, Punjabi, Arabic, Dutch and German, besides of course, Marathi,” Khaira Baba smiled with a tinge of pride.When asked what motivates him to sit in the blazing sun with barely anybody to even talk with, Khaira Baba points at the sky and says: “It’s the ‘marzi’ (will) of Wahe Guru... We are only his instruments in the service to humanity. See, three vehicles are donated by devotees to this ‘langar’...but my only belongings on earth are the three sets of clothes, I live and sleep here, eat the same food served to the people,” he said softly.The ‘Guru ka langar’ has kept two donation boxes outside in which people offer as per their desire and capacity, but it is never counted and the money is again ploughed back into the ‘langar’.Saturday was a big day when Khaira Baba personally served ‘sherbet’ to all the people as part of the month-long ceremonies to mark the 414th anniversary of martyrdom of Guru Arjan Dev, the Fifth Sikh Guru, on May 30, 1606.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/81-year-old-sikh-man-feeds-2-million-on-remote-maharashtra-highway-92396

As the boys look back at the past two months of the lockdown spent at Gurugram where they worked and struggled, all they feel is gratitude, so do their families.“We can’t believe that the government, CRPF and activists came together to accomplish the impossible. Transporting seven boys who can’t communicate in the language of the world, arranging their permissions to travel from Gurugram to Srinagar, addressing their special needs along the way, feels like a dream,” says Baramulla-based Sajjad Lone, Khalid’s brother, who had lost all hopes that his disabled kin, who worked with Flipkart in Gurugram, would escape the lockdown.But a rescue mission mounted by Kashmir-based initiative Yakjah, the governments of Jammu Kashmir, Haryana and Delhi, a sign language interpreter from Indore and CRPF’s Madadgaar helpline ensured the boys were found, understood and sent home safely.“Disabled persons are the worst hit in pandemics. So when the first COVID lockdown was imposed, we formed a pandemic response group. Within days we heard of seven Kashmiri youth, all speech and hearing challenged, stranded in Gurugram with no money and support. Most worked at local MNCs that had shut businesses. So we decided to rescue them and a chain was formed which included government officers, CRPF personnel and NGO partners,” says Ashima Kaul, Yakjah founder.Nothing was possible without first understanding what the boys were saying. So Monica Purohit, the sign interpreter from MP, became the most vital link in the chain. “The boys would record videos and share them with Monica. She would convert them into voice notes. This back and forth went on for days,” Kaul says.The evacuation was fast tracked at every level starting mid-May when Yakjah learnt of the challenge. It was a coincidence that women led the mission with Kaul saying, “women handle emergencies better”. Among those involved in this evacuation were Additional Commissioner J-K House, New Delhi, Rimpy Ohri, Disability in charge of J-K Shabnam Kamli and CRPF DIG Nitu Bhattacharya. Throughout the road journey from Gurugram to Srinagar, CRPF Madadgaar helped the boys – Jehangir, Peer Mohammad, Imran Khan, Asif Aziz, Irfan, Khalid and Arif – with food and night stays. Back in Srinagar, the group was quarantined at a hotel before being sent home this week. All the boys have tested negative for COVID.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stuck-in-gurugram-7-hearing-impaired-kashmiri-youths-back-home-finally-92121

31-05-2020||New Delhi||India needs intelligent exit plan to prevent growth collapse: SBI study||India needs to implement an intelligent lockdown exit strategy to prevent irreversible growth collapse, the SBI said in a research report on Saturday. India’s economic growth slipped to an 11-year low of 4.2 per cent in 2019-20 and to 3.1 per cent in January-March, the lowest in the last 40 quarters.The nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid with effect from March 25 has hit economic activities. The fourth phase of the lockdown is set to expire on Sunday. “We now believe that we should implement an intelligent lockdown exit strategy as the discussion has moved from debate between lives and livelihood to also between lives and lives as an elongated lockdown will only prolong irreversible growth collapse,” SBI’s research report ‘Ecowrap’ said.Going by past experience, recovery from recession often tends to be slow and takes five to 10 years to reach the former peak levels of economic activity, it said. Commenting on the GDP data released on Friday, the report said loss of economic activity due to the lockdown in the last few days of March has dragged the GDP growth to a 40-quarter low of 3.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2019-20.With this, the full year 2019-20 GDP growth comes to 4.2 per cent (11-year low) compared to 6.1 per cent in the preceding financial year.In terms of sectors, the only silver lining was agriculture, it said. Agriculture and allied activities grew at 4 per cent in the fiscal that ended in March 2020, compared to the year-ago growth of 2.4 per cent.However, the Central Statistical Office (CSO) has significantly revised the previous quarters’ growth rates (compared to third quarter release), which is “quite puzzling and raises questions on data quality and remarkable volatility in the new series and we believe that a methodological note from the CSO explaining the frequent revisions will be very useful,” it said. — PTIRecovery tends to be slow||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-needs-intelligent-exit-plan-to-prevent-growth-collapse-sbi-study-92176

Singh’s statement, made to a TV channel, is the first from a senior Central minister on the standoff.‘Want good relations with all’India’s policy has been clear that we should have good relations with all neighbours. This has been a long standing effort. But sometimes, circumstances arise with China that things like this happen. — Rajnath Singh, Defence ministerBoth countries had made it clear that they wanted to resolve the problem, Rajnath said, adding that there was no need for the US to mediate since the two countries already had a mechanism to resolve problems and it had been set in motion.“The country should be assured that we will not allow India’s dignity to be hurt under any circumstances,” he added.US President Donald Trump this week told reporters that he was “ready, willing and able to mediate” between India and China to help resolve tension at the border. The offer has been rejected by foreign ministries of the two countries.The offer also figured in a conversation between Singh and US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper when they spoke on Friday. “I told him (Esper) that India and China already had a mechanism that if there is any problem between the two countries, it is resolved by military and diplomatic dialogue. That mechanism is in place,” Singh said. He also pointed to statements from Beijing on similar lines. India’s policy has been clear that we should have good relations with all neighbours. This has been a long standing effort. But sometimes, circumstances arise with China that things like this happen, the Defence Minister said.Referring to the 2017 Doklam faceoff, he said “It appeared at that time that the situation was very tense. But we did not step back… Ultimately, we were able to resolve the situation.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/talks-on-to-resolve-ladakh-standoff-rajnath-92198

PM Modi was able to bridge the development gap of 60 years in six years with decisiveness and bold decisions, bringing a “cultural change in the political arena” of the country, he said.Momentum helpedWhen PM Modi took over in 2014, the country was at a standstill. In the first term he gave a momentum to governance. In the second... it was already in momentum due to which bold steps could be taken. — JP Nadda, BJP President“When PM Modi took over in 2014, the country was at a standstill. In the first term, he gave momentum to governance. In the second term (in 2019), it was already in momentum due to which bold and decisive steps could be taken, some also before time,” Nadda said.Decisions like abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A were a result of PM’s ‘ichha shakti’ (willpower), the ‘sutradhaar’ (anchor) of which became Home Minister Amit Shah, he said.The BJP president said during the Covid-19 crisis, the PM led from the front, taking bold and timely decisions by involving people to combat the infection at a time when many big, powerful countries found themselves helpless. “Timely lockdown led to a situation where the country is a stable situation,” he said.Slamming Rahul Gandhi for his criticism of the Modi government’s handling of the situation, Nadda said the Congress leader’s understanding of the issues was “limited” and “all about politics”.“His statements are not about addressing the crisis. The Congress has not behaved responsibly,” he said, adding all Gandhi had done so far was “confuse” the country.Citing Citizenship Amendment Act, scrapping of Article 370, strengthening of anti-terror laws, bank mergers among the key successes, Nadda said the bold decisions helped strengthen the country and realise the objective of ‘one nation, one Constitution’. Nadda accused the Congress of delaying the decision on the Ayodhya case.A huge disappointment, says CongressThe Congress termed first year of NDA-II a huge disappointment marked by disastrous mismanagement of lockdown. Party leaders KC Venugopal and Randeep Surjewala sought resignation of Railway Minister Piyush Goyal for ‘failure to manage safe return of migrants’ and the Himachal CM over alleged PPE scam.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bold-steps-marked-modi-2-0-first-year-92209

This prompted Railway Minister Piyush Goyal to issue an appeal on Friday. “I appeal to people suffering from serious ailments, pregnant women and those above 65 years and below 10 years of age to travel only if necessary in Shramik trains”A total of 52 lakh migrants have been ferried on 3,840 such trains, Railway Board Chairman VK Yadav had told a press conference on Friday. He refused to give the number and cause of deaths, saying the doctors were looking into the matter.“In case of deaths, local zones investigate the reasons... there are allegations that they (migrants) died of hunger when there was no shortage of food. We will issue the figure in a few days. The Railways has a control system wherein the train is immediately stopped if someone is found ill and he/she is sent to the nearest hospital. Many such passengers were attended to. Many deliveries took place too,” he said.The Railways had on Wednesday clarified that most of those who had died were “chronic patients”, who were under treatment in hospitals in cities but had boarded Shramik Specials to rush to their native places. The Railway Protection Force and the Government Railway Police Force, that deals with security issues on the ground at stations, are collating data.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/80-deaths-on-board-shramik-trains-railways-ascertaining-reasons-92210
