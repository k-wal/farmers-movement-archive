She delivered a baby around 9.30 pm. The baby’s condition was not fine and was, hence, taken to another facility, Green City Hospital, at 10 pm,” Chief Medical Officer Deepak Ohri said.“The baby was kept at the Green City hospital for two hours on ventilator support and thereafter referred elsewhere,” he said.The CMO said the Shri Krishna Lifeline Hospital “made error” on three counts.“The hospital did not provide an ambulance for the ventilated patient. There was no healthcare worker to attend to the ventilated patient. It did not give a referral slip for the patient,” the senior doctor said in a statement.He said the baby’s father had to then arrange for an ambulance using the 108 service.“Due to the lack of a proper referral slip, the newborn was first taken to a community health care centre in Dadri and since no child specialist was available there, the baby was then taken to the Child PGI in Sector 30, Noida,” he said.“The baby died before he could reach the Child PGI,” the CMO said.A notice has also been issued to the Green City hospital and strong action is being taken, Ohri said.The health department has also constituted a team of doctors, including Sanjeev Malik and Sunil Dohare, to investigate the matter and present a report so that action could be taken against the guilty, according to the statement.

26-05-2020||Lucknow||Priyanka Gandhi defends UP Cong chief, says he always fought for marginalised people||Defending her party’s Uttar Pradesh unit chief Ajay Kumar Lallu who was arrested in a case of cheating and forgery, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday said he has always fought for displaced and marginalised people.Her remarks come ahead of Lallu’s bail plea hearing which according to UP Congress media coordinator Lalan Kumar will take place on Thursday.In a series of tweets, Priyanka Gandhi accused the Yogi Adityanath government of violating all humanitarian principles.“Having lived a life of struggle, perseverance and grit, UP Congress President Shri. Ajay Kumar Lallu knows well the suffering of displaced and marginalised people. He has fought for them steadfastly throughout his career,” she said.     “Throwing him into prison on baseless charges during a pandemic reveals the undemocratic and single mindedly opportunistic mindset of the Yogi Government and violates all humanitarian principles,” she added.The Congress general secretary said the party will continue to fight for him.The party’s state unit president was arrested twice on May 20 -- first in Agra for sitting on a dharna to protest against the UP government for not granting permission to allow buses arranged for migrants by the party to enter the state.He was granted bail by an Agra court and released, before being re-arrested by a team of the Lucknow police in a second case filed here in connection with the Congress’ standoff with the state government.He was booked under Indian Penal Code sections related to cheating and forging documents.Convenor of UP Congress’ media department Lalan Kumar said the special MP/MLA court will hear the bail plea on May 28.The Congress on Sunday had asked Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to withdraw “false” cases against Ajay Kumar Lallu.UP Congress spokesperson Ashok Singh had said that Ajay Kumar Lallu was booked for helping migrant workers and labourers returning to the state and putting him in jail was “high-handedness” on the part of the Yogi Adityanath government.

26-05-2020||Lucknow||14.75 lakh migrants workers register as UP govt plans to employ them in MSMEs, other industries||With 25 lakh people returning to Uttar Pradesh during the COVID-19 lockdown, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, on Tuesday, directed officials to complete the skill-mapping of migrant labourers in 15 days and get a survey conducted to employ them in the MSMEs and industrial units, officials said.In the first phase of skill mapping, more than 14.75 lakh workers registered themselves, Additional Chief Secretary (Home and Information) Awanish Awasthi said.At a meeting with senior state officials to review the lockdown situation, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said skill-mapping should be completed in 15 days and the data should be prepared, an official spokesperson said.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath asked for all-out efforts to increase industrial activity and directed that a survey be conducted in different industries, including the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), for adjusting the labourers and workers in accordance with their skills, the spokesperson said.Awasthi said Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed that information about the qualifications of all workers should be collected through a call centre of 200 people.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath pressed for a continuous dialogue between the Chief Minister Helpline and the migrant labourers and workers, and reiterated that his government was committed to ensuring a safe and respectable return of the workers, for which the state and Central Government had made arrangements of free travel by trains and buses, the officials said.He directed the officials to write to other state governments for getting a list of labourers and workers who were willing to come back to Uttar Pradesh.Stressing on the need for proper screening of all workers returning from other states, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said they should be put in quarantine centres, before sending them for home quarantine.Awasthi said that more than 25 lakh people had returned to UP so far.“Till Tuesday, as many as 1,265 trains have arrived in UP ferrying over 17 lakh people,” he said.While allowing morning walk in parks at a scheduled time, Adityanath said there should be adequate patrolling to ensure security and social distancing there.With the start of domestic flights, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also directed that taxis be allowed to ply from airport with two passengers and a driver.He said home-delivery system in the COVID-19 containment zones should also continue.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also directed the officials to ensure a proper supply of PPE kits, N95 masks, gloves, hand-sanitiser and other things required in checking the infection in all COVID hospitals, while seeing that they remained active round the clock.He called for efforts for effectively controlling the infection in jails and among police personnel.Asking the officials to increase the bed capacity in the L1, L2 and L3 COVID hospitals to one lakh by month-end, he said that maximum number of people should be tested for the virus.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the work to have at least one testing laboratory in every district should be given momentum.While adopting all safety measures to check the infection, the work on starting emergency services and necessary operations should begin in the non-COVID hospitals, he said.He also laid stress on equipping the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI), King George’s Medical University (KGMU) and Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute with all modern facilities.In view of the prevailing heatwave conditions, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed the officials to ensure proper drinking water supply in the water-scarce Bundelkhand region and tankers in urban areas.

26-05-2020||Beijing||Scale-up battle preparedness, Xi tells Chinese military||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday ordered the military to scale up the battle preparedness, visualising the worst-case scenarios and asked them to resolutely defend the country's sovereignty.Xi, 66, who is also the General Secretary of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and head of the two-million-strong military with prospects of lifelong tenure in power, made the remarks while attending a plenary meeting of the delegation of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and People's Armed Police Force during the current parliament session being held here.Xi ordered the military to think about worst-case scenarios, scale up training and battle preparedness, promptly and effectively deal with all sorts of complex situations and resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, state-run Xinhua news agency reported, without mentioning any specific issues that posed a threat to the country.His comments came in the backdrop of the continuing standoff between the militaries of India and China at the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Several areas along the LAC in Ladakh and North Sikkim have witnessed major military build-up by both the Indian and Chinese armies recently, in a clear signal of escalating tension and hardening of respective positions by the two sides even two weeks after they were engaged in two separate face-offs.The nearly 3,500-km-long LAC is the de-facto border between the two countries.The US-China military frictions were also on the rise with the US navy stepping its patrols in the disputed South China Sea as well as the Taiwan Straits. Washington and Beijing are also engaged in a war of words over the origin of the coronavirus pandemic.On Sunday, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi criticised the attempts of some US politicians to blame China for the pandemic. The US, he said, was pushing ties with China to "the brink of a new Cold War".On May 22, China, the second-largest military spender after the US, hiked its defence budget by 6.6 per cent to USD 179 billion, nearly three times that of India, the lowest increment in recent years amidst the massive disruption caused to the communist giant's economy by the COVID-19 pandemic.In his meeting with a PLA delegation on Tuesday, he stressed on achieving the targets and missions of strengthening the national defence and armed forces for 2020, while maintaining effective epidemic control on a regular basis.He listened to speeches by the military deputies on fulfilling epidemic control tasks, strengthening training amid the epidemic, and accelerating capacity building on biosecurity defence, among others.Commending their role in battling the COVID-19, Xi said the people's armed forces have once again proven themselves to be heroic forces that can be fully trusted by the Communist Party and the people.Xi said the epidemic has brought a profound impact on the global landscape and on China's security and development as well.Xi demanded reform and innovation to address new situations and problems exposed in the epidemic and ordered accelerating the research and development on COVID-19 drugs and vaccines by tapping the advantages of military medical research.Noting that this year marks the end of the 13th five-year plan for military development, Xi said extraordinary measures must be taken to overcome the impact of the epidemic to ensure major tasks on the military building are achieved.On defence expenditure, Xi said “every penny must be well spent to produce maximum results”.Xi has been stressing on the troops battle preparedness ever since he came to power in 2012 insisting on real time exercises to win wars.He has also revamped defence forces, cutting the PLA's strength by three lakh troops and enhanced its naval and air power as Beijing expanded its influence abroad.Meanwhile, a Chinese expert commented that unlike the previous standoffs between the Chinese and Indian armies, the latest border friction was not caused by accident, but was a planned move of New Delhi."India has been crossing the boundary line into the Galwan Valley region and entering Chinese territory. Indian soldiers have also deliberately instigated conflicts with their Chinese counterparts. If India failed to stop such provocations as soon as possible, it will impact on Beijing-New Delhi ties - and may even exceed the sort of intensity of the Doklam standoff, an article in the state-run Global Times written by Long Xingchun, president of Chengdu Institute of World Affairs, said.India has said the Chinese military was hindering normal patrolling by its troops along the LAC in Ladakh and Sikkim and strongly refuted Beijing's contention that the escalating tension between the two armies was triggered by trespassing of Indian forces across the Chinese side.The Ministry of External Affairs said all Indian activities were carried out on its side of the border, asserting that India has always taken a very responsible approach towards border management. At the same time, it said, India was deeply committed to protect its sovereignty and security."Any suggestion that Indian troops had undertaken activity across the LAC in the Western sector or the Sikkim sector is not accurate. Indian troops are fully familiar with the alignment of the Line of Actual Control in the India-China border areas and abide by it scrupulously," MEA Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at an online media briefing last week.

26-05-2020||New Delhi||PM Modi meets India’s top military brass amid escalating border tension with China||In the midst of escalating border tension between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Tuesday, held a meeting with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and the three service chiefs with a focus on bolstering India’s military preparedness to deal with external security challenges, government sources said.The military brass is learnt to have apprised Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the evolving situation in eastern Ladakh, though the officials maintained that the agenda of the pre-scheduled meeting was to discuss the ambitious military reforms and ways to boost India’s combat prowess.The meeting came hours after the top four generals briefed Defence Minister Rajnath Singh about the situation in Pangong Tso lake, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldi where the Indian and Chinese troops were engaged in aggressive posturing for the last 20 days.People in the military establishment said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was briefed about the situation in Ladakh. There was no official comment or details available about the meeting.Official sources said NSA Doval had been closely monitoring the evolving situation along the LAC in Ladakh as well as in north Sikkim and Uttarakhand.“China’s strategy to put military pressure on India will not work. We want restoration of the status quo along the LAC,” said an official on the condition of anonymity.In the meeting, the top military brass is learnt to have apprised Modi about the implementation of key infrastructure projects along the LAC, the de-facto border with China.Official sources said India would not stop infrastructure development projects in strategic areas along the nearly 3,500-km Sino-India border, notwithstanding China’s well-coordinated efforts to stall them by attempting to vitiate the situation in areas like eastern Ladakh.It is learnt that Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had already conveyed to top military brass that there was no need for reviewing the implementation of any of the key projects along the LAC in Ladakh, Sikkim, Uttarakhand or in Arunachal Pradesh.In view of the nearly 20-day standoff between the two sides, the Indian Army had significantly ramped up its presence in sensitive border areas in North Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh besides Ladakh to send across a message that India would not be wilting under any aggressive military posturing by China, the sources said.The Chinese side has been particularly peeved at India laying a key road in the finger area of Pangong Tso Lake region besides another road connecting the Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie road in Galwan Valley.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on the evening of May 5 which spilled over to the next day before the two sides agreed to “disengage” following a meeting at the level of local commanders.Over 100 Indian and Chinese soldiers were injured in the violence. The trigger for the incident was China’s strong objection to the road being laid by India in the Finger area in Pangong Tso lake.The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in North Sikkim on May 9.Since then, the Chinese military has increased its strength in Pangong Tso lake, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldi, and resorting to “aggressive patrolling” in these areas. The India Army is also carrying out a similar exercise in the region, sources said.India last week said the Chinese military was hindering normal patrolling by its troops and asserted that India has always taken a very responsible approach towards border management.At a media briefing, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava also strongly refuted China’s contention that the tension was triggered due to trespassing by Indian forces on the Chinese side.India’s response came two days after China accused the Indian Army of trespassing into its territory, claiming that it was an “attempt to unilaterally change the status” of the LAC in Sikkim and Ladakh.On May 5, the Indian and Chinese army personnel clashed with iron rods, sticks, and even resorted to stone-pelting in the Pangong Tso lake area in which soldiers on both sides sustained injuries.In a separate incident, nearly 150 Indian and Chinese military personnel were engaged in a face-off near Naku La Pass in the Sikkim sector on May 9. At least 10 soldiers from both sides sustained injuries.The troops of India and China were engaged in a 73-day stand-off in Doklam tri-junction in 2017 which even triggered fears of a war between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.In the meeting with the prime minister, sources said, Gen Rawat apprised him about the implementation of the recommendations by the Lt Gen (retd) Shekatkar committee for military modernisation.The government has accepted almost all recommendations of the panel including ways to bolster border infrastructure.

26-05-2020||New Delhi||From 3.38 pc in April, fatality rate in India comes down to 2.87 per cent: Health Ministry||The COVID-19 fatality rate in India is among the lowest in the world at 2.87 per cent, the government said on Tuesday, attributing the timely lockdown, early detection and management of coronavirus infection cases as the main reasons for the low death toll.From 3.38 per cent in April, the fatality rate in the country has come down to 2.87 per cent as against 6.4 per cent globally.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 4,167 and the number of cases climbed to 1, 45,380 in the country registering an increase of 146 deaths and 6,535 cases in a 24-hour span till Tuesday 8 am, according to the Union Health Ministry.Responding to a question at a press briefing on why the country’s death rate is one of the lowest in the word, ICMR Director-General Balram Bhargava said there was no substantiated factor behind it.“We have surprisingly found a low fatality rate in India and which is a very good thing. Ultimately, we are interested in a patient surviving whether he gets COVID-19 or not. There are several hypotheses such as we are living in bad hygiene, have higher immunity and have been given certain vaccines such as BCG and those for tuberculosis, but these all are hypothesis and we cannot say anything clearly on any factor. So long as the fatality rate is low it a good thing and I hope it continues,” he said.Joint secretary Lav Agarwal, however, said that the country’s graded response to COVID-19 and timely identification of cases along with their clinical management played a major role in keeping the death rate low.One of the main components of infectious diseases was early identification, he said.“We had started screening of passengers and activated our healthcare workers even 13 days before the WHO declared it a public health emergency of international concern. If cases are detected on time they do not turn serious and to the extent automatically the fatality rate will be low,” he said.France has a fatality rate of 19.9 per cent followed by Belgium at 16.3, Italy at 14.3, UK at 14.2, Spain 12.2, Sweden 11.9, Canada 7.6, Brazil 6.3, the US at 6.0, China 5.5 and Germany at 4.6 per cent.India had 0.3 deaths per lakh population as against the 4.5 deaths globally, which is among the lowest in the world. This has been due to lockdown, timely identification and management of COVID-19 cases, Aggarwal said.Referring to the WHO Situation Report 126 dated May 25, he said Belgium has 81.2 death per lakh population while Spain has 61.5 deaths per population and UK has reported 55.3 deaths per lakh population.Italy, France, Sweden, US, Canada, Brazil and Germany have 54.3, 42.3, 39.3, 29.3, 17.2, 10.5 and 10.0 deaths per lakh population, respectively.Aggarwal further said while Belgium has reported 800.72 deaths per million, Spain, Italy, UK, France, US and Russia had reported 614.95, 542.24, 541.98, 434.59, 295.22 and 24.96 deaths per million, respectively.“India has reported only 3.08 deaths per million. Further, the trajectory is relatively flat, there is no spike in the curve,” Aggarwal said showing a graph to present global perspective: death per million population (as per European CDC situation update dated May 25).The recovery rate has improved from 7.1 per cent in March when the lockdown was initiated to 11.42 per cent during the second phase and 26.59 per cent in the third phase to 41.61 per cent now.The fatality rate remained the lowest in the world at 2.87 per cent now.

26-05-2020||New Delhi||Centre to develop Punjab, Haryana as fish export hub||The central government is planning expand prawn farming in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and west Uttar Pradesh as it plans to turn India into a major hub for exporting fish.Union Minister for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying Giriraj Singh said that the central government was considering a proposal to introduce prawns and fish that are typically found in the sea to the saline waters of India’s northern states that are usually considered the country’s foodgrain bowl.  “So far, south India was a major export hub for fishes. Now we are planning to make north India as an export hub. This includes almost 2.25 lakh hectares in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh where there is saline water,” he said at a conference regarding new scheme Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY).“We will promote prawns and other species that can be exported. After we got (positive) results from assessments we took it up with State governments,” Singh said.The PMMSY scheme aims at enhancing India’s fish production to 220 lakh metric tons by 2024-25 from 137.58 lakh metric tons in 2018-19 at an average annual growth rate of about 9 per cent.It will be “economic revolution through blue revolution” Singh said adding that the country exported fish valued Rs 46,589 crore during the 2018-19 fiscal.Exports from India are expected to decline due to Covid-19 lockdown by around 5-10 per cent in 2019-20 due to demand compression. The US, Middle East, UK and China are main export destinations for fish.Asserting that there was a huge potential to increase exports in the coming years, the minister said the government also planned to promote export of seaweed and ornamental fish.Singh said the ambitious scheme will result in doubling export earnings to Rs 1,00,000 crore and generate about 55 lakh direct and indirect employment opportunities in fisheries sector over a period of next five years.The scheme envisages an estimated investment of Rs 20,050 crore comprising central share of Rs 9,407 crore, state share of Rs 4,880 crore and beneficiaries’ contribution of Rs 5,763 crore. The thrust will be given towards enhancement of fish production and productivity, quality, sustainability, technology infusion, post-harvest infrastructure, modernisation and strengthening of value chain, standards and traceability in fisheries sector from ‘catch to consumer’, establishing a robust fisheries management framework, fishers’ welfare, enhancement of fisheries export competitiveness.  The sector recorded an Average Annual Growth Rate of 10.88 per cent during 2014-15 to 2018-19, 7.53 per cent average annual growth in fish production and 9.71 per cent average annual growth in export earnings, with 18 per cent share in agricultural exportsThe Gross Value Added (GVA) of Fisheries sector in the national economy during 2018-19 stood at Rs 2,12,915 crore which constituted 1.24 per cent of the total National GVA and 7.28 per cent share of Agricultural GVA, official figures show.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-to-develop-punjab-haryana-as-fish-export-hub-90226
26-05-2020||New Delhi||3,276 Shramik Special trains ferried more than 44 lakh migrants: Railways||The Indian Railways has ferried over 44 lakh migrant workers on board 3,276 Shramik Special trains since May 1, according to official data.Of the total trains, 2,875 have terminated, while 401 are in transit.On May 25, as many as 223 Shramik Specials ferried 2.8 lakh passengers, the Railways said.The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) has distributed over 74 lakh free meals and more than one crore water bottles to travelling migrants so far.“Over and above inter-state movement, the railways has been assisting state governments for intra-state movement of passengers by providing MEMU/DEMU and other train services. Over 11 lakh passengers have been moved within states till now,” the railways said.The top five states and union territories from where maximum trains originated are Gujarat (897), Maharashtra (590), Punjab (358), Uttar Pradesh (232) and Delhi (200).The top five states where maximum trains terminated are Uttar Pradesh (1,428), Bihar (1,178), Jharkhand (164), Odisha (128) and Madhya Pradesh (120), the railways said.The Shramik Special trains are being operated primarily on the request of states, which want to send migrant workers stranded due to the COVID-19-induced lockdown to their native places.While the Indian Railways is bearing 85 per cent of the total cost of running each train, the rest is being borne by the states in the form of fares.The COVID-triggered lockdown has had a devastating impact on the economy as well as on the livelihoods of lakhs of migrant workers.The plight of migrant workers who were walking from several urban centres to their villages hundreds of kilometres away had grabbed headlines for almost two months.There have been incidents of many of them being killed in road accidents. A number of migrant labourers were even killed by a speeding train after they fell asleep on the tracks.The Indian Railways also said that the rail route congestion, which was witnessed on May 23 and 24, is now over.“The congestion had occurred due to convergence of more than two-third rail traffic on routes to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and late clearance of terminals due to health protocols etc. that needed to be completed by state authorities,” it said.“The matter has been resolved through active consultation with state governments and also finding other feasible routes for the journey,” it added.On May 1, the Indian Railways started the migrant special trains to facilitate the movement of such workers back to their home states.While on the first day, four such trains were operated, the number was increased to 279 on May 20.In the last four days, the Railways has operated 260 trains on an average daily carrying about three lakh passengers.

Adjacent to mine is Dhruv Narayan Shahi’s orchard. We noticed that a large number of bats were lying lifeless and many more were dying,” Pankaj Shahi of Belghat said.“We informed the forest department and they took the dead bats and asked us to keep water for them as they could have died due to extremely hot weather,” he said.After getting information, Khajni forest ranger Devendra Kumar reached the spot.“The bat carcasses are being sent for examination. Prima facie it seems that the bats died due to excessive heat and lack of water as ponds and lakes in the area have also dried up,” he said.An intense heat wave is currently sweeping northern India with the mercury crossing 45 degrees Celsius mark in many areas.Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Avinash Kumar said that the reason behind the death of bats can be clearly stated once they get a report from IVRI.

26-05-2020||---||8 seafarers, including Mohali-based Captain, back home from Jakarta||Chandigarh, May 26India may have resumed crew changes for its seafarers, who are caught in the pandemic-related restrictions, but many countries are still refusing clearance, causing stress and confusion.Amid this grim scenario, the homecoming of eight seafarers, thanks to the efforts of owners of the companies, has come as a huge relief for families and colleagues.PT Selebes Sarana, vessel owner, and Asia World Shipping Pte Ltd, a technical management company, along with its crewing agent, Crew Sarge Maritime Pvt Ltd, succeeded in repatriating the seafarers, who were stranded on MT Roil Orchid ever since their contract ended on May 1, from Jakarta to Delhi with “fully paid wages”.“During this difficult time, it is a challenge for all ship owners to repatriate seafarers whose contract has ended, with many countries imposing travel bans and restrictions. The emotional well-being of the crew should not be overlooked. It was an obligation for me to bring them home safely,” said JS Gill, Director, Asia World Shipping Pte Ltd.“Our success would not have been possible without the support of the Jakarta consulate and the Government of India,” Gill added. “All quarantine costs were covered by the owners.”Mohali-based Captain Vikram Sudarshanlal Sharma, Master, MT Roil Orchid, who was one of the repatriated seafarers, said, “When all big shipping companies are looking for a way out, our employers soldiered on to find ways and means to get us home safely. We were overwhelmed by their support and care.”The Jakarta consulate went out of the way to help, he added. “It’s a lesson for many shipping giants, who are not working towards repatriating their seafarers citing restrictions on permissions.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/8-seafarers-including-mohali-based-captain-%C2%A0back-home-from-jakarta-90214
26-05-2020||New Delhi||China resists, but India to go ahead with infra projects along LAC||India will not stop infrastructure development projects in strategic areas along the nearly 3,500-km Sino-India border, notwithstanding China’s well-coordinated efforts to stall them by attempting to vitiate the situation in areas like eastern Ladakh, government sources said on Tuesday.It is learnt that Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had conveyed to top military brass that there was no need for reviewing the implementation of any of the key projects along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, Sikkim, Uttarakhand or in Arunachal Pradesh in view of the aggressive behaviour by Chinese troops in several sensitive areas.Also read PM Modi meets India’s top military brass amid escalating border tension with ChinaIn view of the nearly 20-day standoff between the two sides, the Indian Army has significantly ramped up its presence in sensitive border areas in North Sikkim, Uttarakhand and Arunachal Pradesh besides Ladakh to send across a message that India will not be wilting under any aggressive military posturing by China, the sources said.They said Army Chief Gen MM Naravane had been briefing the Defence Minister about the fast-evolving situation in eastern Ladakh on an almost daily basis and it has been decided to put up a stiff counter to China's transgressions into Indian areas along the LAC, the de-facto boundary between the two countries.The Chinese side has been particularly peeved at India laying a key road in the finger area of Pangong Tso Lake region besides another road connecting the Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie road in Galwan Valley.Singh, on Tuesday, held a meeting with three service chiefs on the implementation of a wide range of reform measures in the armed forces. It is not immediately clear whether the situation in eastern Ladakh figured in the deliberations.In the last five years, India has been focusing on improving road and other key infrastructure along the LAC as part of efforts to bolster military preparedness to deal with any challenge from the Chinese side.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on the evening of May 5 which spilt over to the next day before the two sides agreed to "disengage" following a meeting at the level of local commanders.Over 100 Indian and Chinese soldiers were injured in the violence. The trigger for the incident was China's strong objection to the road being laid by India in the Finger area in Pangong Tso lake.Also read: Govt should be more transparent on what is happening at border with China: RahulThe incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in North Sikkim on May 9. Since then, the Chinese military has increased its strength in Pangong Tso lake, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldi, and is resorting to “aggressive patrolling” in these areas. The India Army was also carrying out a similar exercise in the region, sources said.India last week said the Chinese military was hindering normal patrolling by its troops and asserted that India has always taken a very responsible approach towards border management.At a media briefing, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava also strongly refuted China's contention that the tension was triggered due to trespassing by Indian forces on the Chinese side.India’s response came two days after China accused the Indian Army of trespassing into its territory, claiming that it was an “attempt to unilaterally change the status” of the LAC in Sikkim and Ladakh.On May 5, the Indian and Chinese army personnel clashed with iron rods, sticks, and even resorted to stone-pelting in the Pangong Tso lake area in which soldiers on both sides sustained injuries.In a separate incident, nearly 150 Indian and Chinese military personnel were engaged in a face-off near Naku La Pass in the Sikkim sector on May 9. At least 10 soldiers from both sides sustained injuries.The troops of India and China were engaged in a 73-day stand-off in Doklam tri-junction in 2017 which even triggered fears of a war between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long LAC. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it.Both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held their first informal summit in April 2018 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, months after the Doklam standoff.In the summit, the two leaders decided to issue "strategic guidance" to their militaries to strengthen communications so that they can build trust and understanding.Modi and Xi held their second informal summit in Mamallapuram near Chennai in October last year with a focus on further broadening bilateral ties.

26-05-2020||New Delhi||India, China keep LAC talks away from public glare||The reason for the stand-off between troops of India and China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh remains a subject of conjecture among foreign policy experts in the absence of any authoritative commentary from both governments.At the regular press conference on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson received no queries on the LAC stand-off, in an indication that both sides would work out the issue away from public glare and commentary.The Chinese side has generally withheld observations on the issue except for some observations by The Global Times. A regular commentator on India, Long Xingchun, wrote that most face-offs were resolved without the media getting to know about them. He, however, saw the face-off at Galwan Valley as having been planned by India in advance and cautions that unless not resolved in time it could snowball into a confrontation worse than Doklam.Like Indian commentators who are clear that China is playing the spoilsport in what is routine improvement of border infrastructure by India, the Chinese commentator in the Global Times is convinced that his side had not initiated the face-off.Former Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao has regretted that over the past 16-17 years, these confrontations have quickly turn into public spats because of “leakage of happenings” along the LAC.“We switch straight to TV babble and amphitheatre,” she commented.Recalling the most serious confrontation since the 1962 war at Sumdorong Chu in 1987, Rao recalled that the stalemate dragged on for years. Temperatures on both sides were high and harsh words exchanged. But “we were able to command the narrative in public space with much more sobriety and caution”, she observed.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has commented on the stand-off twice, on May 14 and May 21 and its Chinese counterpart Foreign Office has once briefly commented on the stand-off in which, like the MEA here, blamed the other side for the intrusion. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi did not touch on India at all during his at 90-minute especially-convened press conference on Sunday while External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has adopted a low profile on this issue.Former Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran as well as former Ambassadors to China Ashok Kantha and Gautam Bambawale are united in asserting that Chinese aggressiveness on the border is part of its pattern of pushing its advantage on territorial claims while the adversaries are engaged in Covid. This is an observation made by top US diplomat for the region Alice Wells who said the LAC standoff was a reminder that Chinese aggression is not just rhetorical.Saran has been consistent in making the point that China equates hierarchy with harmony and believes that its natural place is at the top which has to be ensured, if necessary, by coercion.However with no word coming from actual policy making circles except for few accounts of the stand-off, strategic experts from think-tanks too have been unable to foresee the end game for the issue at the LAC. Neither have they been able to decipher the motive for this Chinese aggression but for Shyam Saran interpreting it in existential terms.Comments from spokespersons of both Foreign Offices indicate that both sides are engaged on the issue. The reticence of Jaishankar and Chinese Foreign Office's comments on all global issues but on the LAC stand-off suggests that quiet diplomacy is being given a chance.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-keep-lac-talks-away-from-public-glare-90210
26-05-2020||New Delhi||No major side-effects of HCQ, should be continued as preventive treatment for COVID-19: ICMR||No major side-effects of Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had been found in studies in India and its use should be continued in preventive treatment for COVID-19, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said on Tuesday.The ICMR’s statement came against the backdrop of the World Health Organisation (WHO) suspending the testing of the drug in COVID-19 patients temporarily in its global study following safety concerns.“The COVID-19 is an evolving field and we do not know which drug is working and which is not working. A lot of drugs are being repurposed for COVID-19, whether for prophylaxis or for treatment of COVID-19. We found there were no major side-effects except for nausea, vomiting, palpitation occasionally. Hence, in our advisory, we have recommended that it should be continued for prophylaxis as there is no harm. A benefit may be there,” ICMR Director-General Balram Bhargava said.He said it had been “clearly advised that HCQ should be taken with food, not on empty stomach”.“We also laid emphasis that one ECG should be done during the treatment. We expanded the use of HCQ from healthcare workers to frontline workers also, considering the potential benefits,” he added.Bhargava was addressing a press conference on the COVID-19 situation in the country where he mentioned that the ICMR had upscaled the testing facilities and over one lakh persons were being tested every day.Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Health, said the recovery rate for COVID-19 cases in the country had seen an upwards trend.“The recovery rate in the country continues to improve and is presently 41.61 per cent. The COVID-19 fatality rate has reduced from 3.3 per cent on April 15 to 2.87 per cent which is among the lowest in the world,” he said.

The crisis of migrant labourers is even continuing today with large sections still stranded on roads, highways, railway stations and state borders’” it said.The Bench directed its Registry to serve a copy of this order to Solicitor General Tushar Mehta as also the standing counsel representing various states and union territories today itself  “so that  appropriate responses be brought before the court at the earliest.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-takes-cognisance-of-migrant-workers-plight-issues-notices-to-centre-states-uts-90205
26-05-2020||New Delhi||SC issues notice to Centre, RBI on plea against interest on loans during moratorium||The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India to respond to a plea challenging levy of interest on loans during the moratorium period, which has now been extended by another three months till August 31 due to the coronavirus pandemic.A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, hearing the matter through video-conferencing, issued notices to the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India asking them to file their replies within a week.The counsel appearing for the petitioner informed the bench, also comprising Justices S K Kaul and M R Shah, that earlier the moratorium period was for three months till May 31 but now it has been extended by another three months.The counsel argued that borrowers should not be penalised like this and banks should not add interest on the loan amount during the moratorium period. “Counsel for the Reserve Bank of India prays for and is granted a week’s time to file counter affidavit. Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General, also obtain instructions in the meantime,” the bench said in its order and posted the matter for hearing next week.On March 27, RBI had issued a slew of measures to check financial impact of the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19. It issued a circular giving liberty to all banks and financial institution to allow a moratorium of three months on payment of installments in respect of all term loans outstanding as on March 1, subject to the borrower making such a request.It had said that repayment schedule for such loans as also the residual tenor would be shifted across the board by three months after the moratorium period.Interest shall continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loans during the moratorium period, the RBI had said.Last week, RBI had extended the moratorium period by another three months to August 31.The plea, filed by Agra resident Gajendra Sharma, has sought a direction to declare the portion of RBI’s March 27 notification “as ultra vires to the extent it charges interest on the loan amount during the  moratorium period, which create hardship to the petitioner being borrower and creates hindrance and obstruction in ‘right to life’ guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of India”. It has also sought a direction to the government and the RBI to provide relief in re-payment of loan by not charging interest during the moratorium period.On April 30, the apex court had directed the RBI to ensure that its circular on three-month moratorium on loan repayment between March 1 and May 31 is implemented in its letter and spirit.The top court had told the Solicitor General, appearing for the Centre that it appears that the benefit given by the RBI was not being extended to the borrowers.

26-05-2020||New Delhi||India facing its worst recession in current fiscal, says CRISIL||India’s fourth recession since independence, the first since liberalisation and perhaps the worst to date, is here, CRISIL said on Tuesday as it predicted the economy to shrink by 5 per cent in the current fiscal because of the COVID-induced lockdown.“The first quarter (April to June 2020) will suffer a staggering 25 per cent contraction,” it said in its assessment of India’s GDP.“About 10 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in real terms could be permanently lost. So going back to the growth rates seen before the pandemic is unlikely in the next three fiscals.”In the past 69 years, India has seen a recession only thrice – as per available data – in fiscals 1958, 1966 and 1980. The reason was the same each time – a monsoon shock that hit agriculture, then a sizeable part of the economy.CRISIL said the recession in the current fiscal (April 2020 to March 2021) was different as agriculture could soften the blow this time by growing near its trend rate, assuming a normal monsoon.The COVID-19 lockdown, first imposed on March 25 and extended thrice till May 31, has curtailed economic activity severely.“The first quarter of this fiscal will be the worst affected,” it said, adding that “not only will the first quarter be a washout for the non-agricultural economy, services such as education, and travel and tourism among others could continue to see a big hit in the quarters to come. Jobs and incomes will see extended losses as these sectors are large employers.”It also saw economic activity in states with high COVID-19 cases suffering prolonged disruption as restrictions could continue longer.Stating that the economic costs now beginning to show up in the hard numbers are far worse than initial expectations, it said industrial production for March fell by over 16 per cent, exports contracted 60.3 per cent in April, and new telecom subscribers declined 35 per cent, while railway freight movement plunged 35 per cent on-year.“Indeed, given one of the most stringent lockdowns in the world, April could well be the worst-performing month for India this fiscal,” it said.Counting lockdown 4.0, Indians have had 68 days of confinement. S&P Global estimates that one month of lockdown shaves 3 per cent off annual GDP on average across Asia-Pacific, it said adding since India's lockdown has been the most stringent in Asia, the impact on economic growth will be correspondingly larger.“CRISIL forecasts India's GDP growth to fall off a cliff and contract 5 per cent in fiscal 2021,” the report said.“Earlier, on April 28, we had slashed our prediction to 1.8 per cent growth from 3.5 per cent growth. Things have only gone downhill since. While we expect non-agricultural GDP to contract 6 per cent, agriculture could cushion the blow by growing at 2.5 per cent.”On the Rs 20.9-lakh crore economic relief package announced by the government to support the economy, Crisil said the package had some short-term measures to cushion the economy but sets its sights majorly on reforms, most of which would have payoffs only over the medium term.“We estimate the fiscal cost of this package at 1.2 per cent of GDP, which is lower than what we had assumed in our earlier estimate,” it said.

26-05-2020||Ahmedabad||Yogi who claimed to have survived without food, water for 76 years dies||Prahlad Jani alias Chunriwala   Mataji, a breatharian Yogi who claimed to have survived without food or water for over 70 years, died on Tuesday morning in Gujarat's Gandhinagar district, his disciples said.He was 90.Jani breathed his last at his native village Charada, a statement said.He had a big following in Gujarat.Jani's claims of surviving without food or water were tested in 2003 and 2010 by scientists.He used to claim that he didn't need food or water because goddess sustained him.Meanwhile, Jani's body has been taken to his humble ashram-cum-cave situated near Ambaji temple in Banaskantha district."Mataji was shifted to Charada a few days back after he expressed his will to spend some time at his native place. He breathed his last early today morning. His body will be kept at his Ashram for two days to enable his devotees to pay homage. He will be given 'Samadhi' at his ashram on Thursday," said the statement issued by his disciples.Being a devout believer of goddess Amba, he used to wear a red saari (chunri) all the time and dress like a woman, because of which, he was known as Chunriwala Mataji.Jani claimed to have spent 76 years of his life without consuming food or water.Jani had left his parent's house at a very young age in pursuit of 'spiritual experience' .His followers claimed that he had stopped taking food and water at the age of 14.Jani made a small cave located near Ambaji temple his home at young age and subsequently gained popularity as a Yogi who survived only on air.In 2010, scientists and doctors associated with the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS) under the Defence Research and Development Organisation had conducted a 15-day observational study on Jani to find out how he was living without food or water.The DIPAS later stated that Jani had "some extreme form of adaptation to starvation and water restrictions".

Some went to the extent of demanding that he be sent to quarantine for 14 days."Since he came from a red zone area and crossed over from another state, he should be quarantined," said YSRCP leader G Srikant Reddy.In a letter to Director General of Police (DGP) Gautam Sawang, the ruling party leader said Naidu's followers gathered around his convoy without maintaining physical distance and without wearing masks.Another YSRCP leader from Kadapa sought action against Naidu for deliberately violating Covid-19 lockdown rules and exposing thousands to coronavirus risk.Naidu drew the ire of the YSRCP after he addressed a press briefing over video conferencing from Hyderabad in which he criticised the ruling YSRCP of failing to deal with the pandemic.The ruling party in return taunted the former Chief Minister saying he was maintaining “social distancing” by staying 300 km away from the state.YSRCP leader Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy said nobody had stopped the TDP chief from returning to the state but he preferred to remain in Hyderabad and when he finally returned, he violated all lockdown norms.State DGP had allowed Naidu to enter AP on May 24 and Naidu’s party had announced that he would visit Visakhapatnam on May 25 to console the families of the 12 people who died on May 7 due to gas leak in the LG Polymers. However, since his flight was cancelled on Monday, he arrived a day late.TDP leader K Atchan Naidu alleged that the flight resumption was deliberately postponed by YSRCP to prevent Naidu from visiting Visakhapatnam.TDP's senior leader and former minister Devineni Uma claimed that Naidu had not violated any lockdown norms and the reaction of the ruling party was only a sign of their nervousness at Naidu’s proposed visit to the families of the gas leak victims.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ysr-congress-accuses-naidu-of-violating-lockdown-norms-90195

26-05-2020||New Delhi||Mixed opinion by Indian experts on WHO's temporary pause on hydroxychloroquine trial||With the World Health Organisation deciding to temporarily drop hydroxychloroquine from its global study into experimental COVID-19 treatments, doctors in India are divided in their opinions over the repercussions the move might have on the strategy to combat the pandemic.While some experts feel that after the WHO decisions, country's medical centres will have to take HCQ and chloroquine of the treatment regimen of COVID-19 patients, others opined it is "not binding" for India to oblige with the decision of the world body."The Lancet study found out that people who were given HCQ or chloroquine or, combination of azithromycin with HCQ or chloroquine, matching with other factors, ran the risk of having higher mortality due to cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat)," city-based lung surgeon Dr Arvind Kumar said.The study was done on nearly 15,000 patients, whose conditions were compared with those who weren't administered those drugs.In a press briefing on Monday, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that in light of a paper published last week in the Lancet that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems, there would be "a temporary pause" on the hydroxychloroquine arm of its global clinical trial.The WHO said that its experts need to review all available evidence to date.As countries around the world explored the potential of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients, several experts earlier in May had sounded a note of warning to say it is not a wonder drug and may even be fatal in some cases.After the fresh announcement by the WHO, while doctors like Kumar feel the anti-malarial drug will be taken out of the treatment regimen of COVID-19 patients, other medical experts said, India may take its own call on the HCQ."This is sort of a guideline, and not a diktat from the WHO, and so India is free to decide on its own whether to go ahead with use of HCQ or halt it," said Dr Rajesh Kumar Gupta, Additional Director, Pulmonology and Critical Care, Fortis Noida.He, however, said, India has no national registry or own study to assess the impact of drugs on its own population."And, though it is not binding to accept what WHO said, we have no choice, but to accept what other experts have come up with. Otherwise, people will question, on what basis are we continuing the use of the drug on COVID-19 patients," he said.As the pandemic spread and the urgency for effective treatment of COVID-19 mounted, several countries, including the US, have already started relying heavily on HCQ, majorly used in the treatment of malaria and rheumatoid-arthritis.India has become the biggest supplier of the drug and has fulfilled large orders from countries such as the US, the UAE and the UK.With US President Donald Trump touting the anti-malaria drug as a definite cure for COVID-19, his administration has stockpiled millions of doses of HCQ despite the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issuing a safety communication regarding the known side effects of the drug.

I went to Matoshree on Monday to give feedback about Maharashtra’s response to the coronavirus crisis as I had not visited them since the death of Balasaheb Thackeray," said Pawar.Earlier on Monday, Pawar accompanied by party colleague Praful Patel visited Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari. Patel later praised Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal for the Railways' handling of the migrants.Subsequently, the social media cell of the opposition BJP got into the act and spread stories of President's Rule being imposed in Maharashtra.Former Chief Minister Narayan Rane, who moved from the Shiv Sena to the Congress and is now in the BJP, called for the dismissal of the MVA government and deployment of the Army in Mumbai to tackle the Covid-19 crisis.By Tuesday evening, the Shiv Sena and the NCP began issuing denials about the fall of the Thackeray government. "Devendra Fadnavis is getting impatient," Pawar said blaming the BJP leader for the buzz."The two leaders had a discussion for an hour and a half. If anyone is spreading news about the stability of the government, it is their stomach ache. The government is strong. No worries....," tweeted Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/strains-in-maharashtra-coalition-come-to-the-fore-90192

Keeping in consideration the COVID-19 restrictions, the celebrations will mostly be digital.According to a party communication, at least 1,000 virtual rallies and conferences will be organised where the national and state leaders and central ministers will highlight the achievements of the government in the past one year such as the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, construction of Ram Mandir, passing of Triple Talaq Act and the Citizenship Amendment Act and the Prime Minister’s latest mantra —‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ or ‘self-reliant India’.While in the normal times, the achievements which would have been highlighted via mega rallies and press conferences, they will now be propagated online.A major focus of these virtual rallies, conferences and interactions will be the Rs 20-lakh crore financial package announced by the government to revive the economy and benefit the poor and weaker sections of society.The party will release a video of the government’s work to combat the COVID-19 outbreak and has asked the state units to translate and dub it in local languagesThe BJP is also expected to distribute a copy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s handwritten letter to 10 crore households across the country. The letter will carry his vision and suggestions about combating COVID-19, the work done by his government and the message of ‘self-reliant India’, say sourcesThe letter will be distributed by booth-level workers in the areas that do not fall under containment zones while in the containment zones, they will be delivered electronically or through social media platforms, say leaders.Party chief JP Nadda will inaugurate the anniversary functions by going live on a social media platform.This is not the first time the party is relying on technology to spread its word. The BJP is almost a pioneer in the use of social media for electoral and political gains and technology to reach a wider audience in campaigns.Leaders also pointed to ‘virtual’ meetings and conferences Nadda had been having with the state units during the lockdown.Sweeping back to power in 2019 with a majority bigger than in the 2014 general elections, the Modi government 2.0 will complete one year on May 30.Citing the various achievements in the Parliament, leaders called it the “most promising and impressive” one year. The BJP communication, which describes PM Modi as the world’s “most popular leader”, says “all these achievements will be written in golden letters in history”.However, the saffron government is completing one year in power at a time when the country is passing through its worst economic crisis with declining growth, joblessness and the misery of migrant labourers adding to perceptions against it.While the leadership is aggressively countering with COVID-19 relief measures announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, political observers said economic losses and sufferings of migrants during the lockdown had dented Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s image, turning into a political fallout for the party.“The economic relief package has missed the target audience, poor, farmers, MSMEs, etc. The migrant crisis has affected Prime Minister Modi’s pro-poor image, which the BJP used to woo economically weaker sections and win many political battles in the past seven years,” they say.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/narendra-modi-govt-2-0-to-complete-one-year-on-may-30-celebrations-to-go-virtual-90188
26-05-2020||New Delhi||Day 2 of domestic operations: Cancellations continue, passenger flights resume in Andhra Pradesh||A day after the restart of air travel across India, flight cancellations continued with passengers facing difficulties, even as domestic operations resumed in Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday amid reluctance due to rising number of COVID-19 cases.Except West Bengal, domestic flights traversed the entire country on Tuesday. However, as major airports like Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad have a severe cap on the number of fights they can handle, cancellations continued on Tuesday.Just like Monday, a section of passengers reached their airports on Tuesday only to be informed that their flights have been cancelled. Many people vented their ire on social media.Chennai airport is scheduled to handle only 20 arrivals and departures each on Tuesday, said senior government officials, even though Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Sunday night said that it can handle up to 25 arrivals per day and has no limit on the number of departures.Even in Andhra Pradesh, where domestic services resumed on Tuesday, Vijayawada and Vizag airports will handle just eight flights each during the day, officials said.On Sunday night, the central government had said these two airports can handle up to 20 per cent of the pre-lockdown flights from Tuesday onwards.The Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, which is India’s largest, is scheduled to handle around 277 flights on Tuesday, the officials said.On May 23, the government officials had said they expected Delhi airport to handle around 380 flights per day from May 25 onwards.Mumbai airport, India’s second busiest airport, handled just 47 flights on Monday and is expected to handle a similar number on Tuesday.On Sunday night, the central government said it will handle a maximum of 50 flights per day from Monday.West Bengal would be resuming domestic flights from Thursday.However, its Kolkata and Bagdogra airports will handle only 20 flights each per day.On Sunday night, the central government had announced that Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal will not handle any domestic flights on Monday and major airports like Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad will see reduced operations from Monday onwards.West Bengal, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu had expressed reluctance in resuming domestic flights from Monday due to rising number of COVID-19 cases.The officials said the first flight on Tuesday to Vijayawada landed from Bengaluru at 6.55 am, carrying 79 passengers. The Spicejet flight returned to Bengaluru with 68 passengers, they added.At the Vizag airport, the first flight landed from Bengaluru at 7 am.“At Vijayawada, four flights are of IndiGo, two each are of SpiceJet and Air India,” they added.Visakhapatnam airport is scheduled to handle eight flights on Wednesday, the officials mentioned.After a two-month suspension due to the coronavirus pandemic, domestic flights resumed in India on Monday with 532 flights carrying 39,231 passengers to their destinations. Around 630 flights were cancelled.Thousands of passengers had reached airports early in the morning on Monday only to be told by the staff of airlines that some of their flights have been cancelled causing hardship to them.Gripped by anxiety and uncertainty, some came from faraway towns and were on the road for several hours wanting to catch the first flight to their respective states.The varied COVID-19 quarantine and self-isolation rules in states and also the Union Health Ministry guidelines for arriving travellers also compounded their travel woes.The airlines, which were allowed to operate one-third of their pre-lockdown domestic services from May 25, had to further truncate their flight schedules on Sunday leading to cancellations. All carriers except GoAir operated their flights on Monday and Tuesday.

26-05-2020||New Delhi||Centre doing much more for poor than what Rahul Gandhi is demanding: BJP||The BJP on Tuesday rejected Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi's statement that the lockdown had "failed" in its purpose, saying the doubling rate of coronavirus infection has fallen to 13 days from three before the lockdown, which, it asserted, is a "success" of India. BJP leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar said the Modi government's decision to impose the lockdown has ensured that India suffered much less than countries like the US, France and Spain. He took a swipe at the Congress, saying it is doing politics at a time when the nation is fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. India's efforts to combat coronavirus have drawn praise from the world over but attracted opposition from the Congress, he said. "Rahul Gandhi's press conference today is an example of the politics the Congress is doing. What he said is wrong as well. The COVID-19 doubling rate was three days before the lockdown and it is 13 now. This is India's success," Javadekar said.   He said the Congress earlier asked why the lockdown was imposed and is now raising questions again when it is being relaxed. "This highlights double-speak and hypocrisy of the Congress," the senior BJP leader said. He said over 45 lakh migrant labourers have been ferried back home in over 3000 trains, and this is historic, he said. On Gandhi's demand that the Centre give cash to the poor, he said BJP-ruled states like Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka have given cash to migrants and asked which Congress-run state has done so. Citing various welfare provisions of the the Centre, including five month free ration for over 80 crore poor, transfer of Rs 2000 to nine crore farmers and Rs 500 to 20 crore women, and free gas cylinders to eight crore households, Javasekar said these measures in real term are more than Rs 7,500 demanded by Gandhi for the poor. "People don't like such negative politics. The country is speaking in one tune and the Congress has struck a different chord. That is why the party is becoming disconnected with people," he said. Gandhi on Tuesday said the four phases of nationwide lockdown have "failed" and not given the results that Prime Minister Narendra Modi expected as he urged the Centre to spell out its strategy for "opening up" the country.The Congress leader expressed concern that if the government functions haphazardly during the non-lockdown period, the country will face a second wave of coronavirus which will be "extremely devastating".

I need emergency access," Rohatgi told the Bench during hearing on the company's petition against a National Green Tribunal's order directing it to deposit Rs 50 crore and setting up a committee to look into the accident.As Rohatgi said the company would seek transfer of matters pending in the Andhra Pradesh High Court and the NGT, the Bench made it clear that it was not inclined to intervene. The company can raise its grievances before the high court, it said.The Supreme Court had on May 19 refuses to interfere with the NGT's order asking LG Polymers to deposit Rs 50 Crore and setting up a committee to look into the accident. Taking suo motu cognisance of the industrial accident, an Bench headed by Chairman Justice AK Goel had directed the company to deposit Rs 50 Crore with Vishakhapatnam District Magistrate.It had also set up a five-member Committee headed by former Andhra Pradesh High Court Judge BS Reddy to inquire into the tragedy.The company -- which had already deposited the money --  questioned setting up of several committees by the Andhra Pradesh High Court, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the Central Government to look into the gas leakage accident.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vizag-gas-leak-sc-allows-lg-polymers-to-have-access-to-its-chemical-plant-90180
26-05-2020||New Delhi||What happened to my father shouldn’t happen to anyone: Son of deceased AIIMS sanitation chief||Two days after his father Heera Lal, senior sanitation supervisor at AIIMS New Delhi, died of COVID-19 at the institute’s trauma centre, Prahlad Kumar is still in shock.“My father got the infection on May 15 and passed away on May 24, within nine days. He was still on duty when he first developed uneasiness and illness. Routine checks were done at AIIMS on the morning of May 15. COVID test was not done and the doctors on duty suggested that my father should return for a COVID test after he develops symptoms. By the time visible symptoms developed around May 19, my father was already in need of a ventilator," says Prahlad urging asymptomatic people to get tested as soon as possible.Every day is crucial in the fight against this disease as it doesn’t give you any time to respond, says the young man who, like his father, is a permanent staffer at AIIMS.Prahlad also raises the question of quality of protective gear available to sanitation staff, cleaners, sweepers, ward boys and other workers at the institute.While acknowledging the pressures of COVID management on AIIMS, the distraught son says that the N-95 masks provided to the sanitation workers at AIIMS were of low quality.“We are all given four N-95 masks with four envelopes for 15 days and we a supposed to use one each day, store the others and then repeat the cycle. Since the COVID outbreak, I’ve only received eight masks till now. My father also had the same mask and its quality is very low as compared to the quality of filter N-95 masks you get in the markets. We do not get gloves. Sanitizers are also not freely available and we are mostly encouraged to use soap and water. But because the sanitation staffers’ job is prone to infection they should get the best quality masks, head caps, gloves and full disinfection kits. What happened to my father should not happen to anyone,” Prahlad said, urging the government to increase testing of asymptomatic people.Heera Lal’s sudden demise has now brought the lens on the safety of cleaners and ward boys across top COVID hospitals.Questions also arise on whether Heera Lal had received Hydroxychloroquine preventive drug against COVID consideringICMR recently revised its HCQ guidelines to include asymptotic COVID warriors in containment zones.When contacted AIIMS medical superintendent DK Sharma ruled out laxity on the part of AIIMS in handling the Heera Lal case.Sharma also said AIIMS had issued HCQ for all its COVID warriors much in advance of ICMR’s revised guidelines covering all frontline staffers in containment areas and provided its staffers with all the necessary protection.“Why wouldn’t we care for our own staff? We managed the case of Heera Lal the moment he came to us,” said DK Sharma.Amid conflicting versions from the family and the institute administration, it’s unclear where the truth lies.What’s clear is, COVID warriors remain vulnerable to the disease and must do all they can to protect themselves.“Masks have to be properly worn, social distance maintained and handwashing practised by all security and sanitation staff,” advises AS Malhi, former President of AIIMS New Delhi Resident Doctors Association.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/what-happened-to-my-father-shouldnt-happen-to-anyone-son-of-deceased-aiims-sanitation-chief-90178
26-05-2020||---||Uber India lays off 600 people||New Delhi, May 26Uber on Tuesday said it is laying off about 600 employees in India—about a quarter of its staff in the country— as business has taken a major hit amid COVID-19 pandemic.The development comes days after rival Ola had announced laying off 1,400 people from its rides, financial services and food business.Uber, in an e-mailed response, said the impacted positions include its driver and rider support operations, and other functions in India.“The impact of COVID-19 and the unpredictable nature of the recovery has left Uber India South Asia with no choice but to reduce the size of its workforce. Around 600 full-time positions across driver and rider support, as well as other functions, are being impacted,” Uber India and South Asia President Pradeep Parameswaran said.These reductions are part of previously announced global job cuts this month, he added.Earlier this month, Uber had announced a reduction of customer support and recruiting teams by approximately 6,700 full-time employee roles and attributed the move to lower trip volumes and current hiring freeze.Parameswaran said each impacted employee will receive a minimum 10 weeks payout, medical insurance coverage for the next six months, out-placement support, and will be allowed to retain their laptops and given the option to join the Uber talent directory.“Today is an incredibly sad day for colleagues leaving the Uber family and all of us at the company. We made the decision now, so we can look to the future with confidence. I want to apologise to departing colleagues, and extend my heartfelt thanks to them for their contributions...,” he said.Uber has, in the past, spoken of the importance of the Indian market in its global business as a strategic market and for tech and engineering talent.In the past few weeks, a number of tech-led businesses like Zomato, Swiggy and ShareChat have announced layoffs as the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown dried up demand and ravaged businesses.Zomato has laid off 13 per cent of its 4,000-staff, while Swiggy said it will let go off 1,100 employees. ShareChat reduced headcount by 101 people.India had announced a nationwide lockdown from March 25, which left driver-partners of cab companies with no source of income as these firms were not allowed to operate.After 40 days of lockdown, some relaxations were provided in the third phase (May 4 onwards) and these companies were allowed to operate in orange and green zones.In the fourth phase (which ends May 31), these players have been allowed to operate in most areas (except containment areas) depending on state regulations.However, ride volumes have remained abysmally low compared to pre-COVID days. Industry watchers attribute the low demand volume to lack of trips that people make to offices, malls and airports. They are hopeful of demand picking up as more offices open and people resume work.Ola CEO Bhavish Aggarwal, in an email to employees last week, had said the company’s revenues had declined by 95 per cent in the last two months due to coronavirus pandemic. He had also made it clear that the prognosis ahead for the business is “very unclear and uncertain” and the impact of this crisis is “definitely going to be long-drawn for us”. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uber-india-lays-off-600-people-90177
26-05-2020||New Delhi||Easing of travel restrictions, movement of migrants behind surge in Covid-19 cases: Experts||With India now in the bracket of top 10 nations worst hit by the novel coronavirus, experts have attributed the surge in cases to easing of travel restrictions and movement of migrants besides enhanced testing capacity.According to AIIMS Director, Randeep Guleria, the present rise in cases has been reported predominantly from hotspot areas but there is a possibility of further rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in the coming few days due to increased travel.“Those who are asymptomatic or are in pre-symptomatic stage will pass through screening mechanisms and may reach areas where there have been minimal or less cases,” Guleria said.He said there was a need for more intense surveillance and monitoring in areas where migrants have returned to contain the spread of the disease.If proper social distancing and hand hygiene is not maintained at a time when people are out on roads, the coronavirus infection will transmit much faster, he said.Guleria also noted that testing capacity has been significantly ramped up which is reflecting in the increasing number of cases being detected.Commenting on the partial resumption of rail and road transport services and migrants returning to their native places, Dr Chandrakant S Pandav, former president of the Indian Public Health Association and Indian Association of Preventive and social medicine, said the floodgates have been opened.“This is a classic case of creating an enabling environment for coronavirus to spread like wildfire. In the coming few days, the number will rise dramatically. While it is true that lockdown cannot go on forever, the opening up should have been in a measured, calibrated and informed manner,” he said.“Travelling leads to spread of the infection. Now, the government will have to ensure even stronger surveillance to curb the infection but if that will be done is something to be observed,” he said.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 4,167 and the number of cases climbed to 1, 45,380 in the country, registering an increase of 146 deaths and 6,535 cases since Monday 8 am, according to the Union Health Ministry. Dr K K Aggarwal, President of the Confederation of Medical Association of Asia and Oceania (CMAAO), and former IMA President, said there will be a further surge in cases in the coming days if migration continues without any proper social distancing.“Within the next ten days, the cases will cross two lakh. The very fact that number of cases was rising before the end of the third lockdown and continuing during the fourth lockdown means that people are not following physical distancing as required,” he said.“Even in the last week of May when the temperature is very high, the rising number of cases would mean that human-to-human transmission is more important than surface-to-human transmission. Normally in heat the surface-to-human transmission should have reduced the new cases by half which has not happened,” Aggarwal said.However, Professor K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, said an increase in the number of cases reflects both an increase in testing rates and an increase in spread.“What we need to see is the number of new tests performed per day and the number of new cases that were identified from them. That gives a better idea of the rate of spread than the total number of new cases alone.    “We also have to see if the testing criteria has remained the same between the two periods of comparison. We may open up gradually but will have to continue case detection, contact tracing and follow personal protection measures as vigorously as possible,” he added. A total of 31,26,119 samples have been tested as on May 26, 9 am and 92,528 samples have been tested in the last 24 hours, ICMR officials said.India is the tenth most affected nation by the pandemic after the US, Russia, UK, Spain, Italy, Brazil, Germany, Turkey and France, as per the John Hopkins University data. The country has recorded 6,088, 6,654, 6,767 and 6977 cases on May 22, 23, 24 and 25 respectively. Also, the number of RT-PCR tests for detection of COVID-19 in the country crossed the 30-lakh mark on Monday.The first two phases of the lockdown led to 14-29 lakh COVID-19 cases being averted, while the number of lives saved in that period was between 37,000 and 78,000, the government said last Friday, citing various studies, and asserted that the unprecedented shutdown has paid “rich dividends” in the fight against the pandemic. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/easing-of-travel-restrictions-movement-of-migrants-behind-surge-in-covid-19-cases-experts-90174

It has now been extended to six months till August 31, 2020.A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan — which had earlier asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to seek instruction in the matter — chose to issue formal notices after being informed that the responses were yet to come.It asked the Centre and RBI to respond in a week to the petition filed by Gajendra SharmaOn behalf of Sharma, senior coulsel Rajiv Dutta submitted that at a time when COVID-19 lockdown was in place, charging of interest on the loan despite moratorium announced by RBI was causing lots of hardships to borrowers.Terming it a violation of right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, the petitioner said, "Charging interest during the moratorium period is completely devastating, wrong and in a way has taken away the benefit of imposing moratorium."Earlier, the top court had asked the RBI to examine if benefits of its policy decisions were being passed on to borrowers."It appears that whatever benefits are being given by RBI, they are not being extended to the borrowers. There should be proper guidelines," it had said.However, it refused to interfere in the matter as the petitioner in that case was not a borrower.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/loan-moratorium-sc-issues-notice-to-centre-rbi-on-plea-seeking-interest-waiver-90173

As many as 60 days have passed. The goals of lockdown as stated by the PM have not been achieved. Disease is progressing and cases are rising even as we enter the last phase of Lockdown 4. We want to humbly ask the government what its plan is on disease management, revival of the economy, help to the poor and migrants and financial support to small and medium enterprises,” Gandhi said in a virtual press conference, his third since Covid outbreak.The Congress leader, commenting on the party-ruled Maharashtra having the maximum cases of Covid in India, said, “In Maharashtra we are not in a decision-making role. We are part of a coalition government. We are supporting the government. There is a difference between supporting and running a government. We have a strategy in all Congress-ruled states on how to give cash to the poor and what to do but no state strategy can succeed without the help from the Centre. The Centre must help the states.”Rahul said India was the only country that was relaxing the lockdown when the disease graph was rising. “The situation is going to get very dangerous. The cases are progressing. Unless the government gives a cash injection to the poor and immediately helps the small industries, there will be an economic disaster,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lockdown-has-failed-what-next-rahul-asks-pm-90164

Besides hate speech, he has also been charged with sedition and certain provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.A Bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan — which had earlier asked the Delhi Government to respond to his petition — issued notice to other states where cases have been registered against him after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said notice to Delhi alone was not enough. Other states also needed to be heard, he added.Mehta, however, said Delhi Government's reply was ready and it would be filed by Wednesday.On behalf of Imam, senior advocate Siddharth Dave cited the court's recent order in Republic TV Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami's case in which multiple identical FIRs arising out of the same cause of action were quashed, except the one being probed by the Mumbai Police.Mehta vehemently opposed it, saying in Goswami's case all the FIRs were verbatim copies of each other. Imam's case was not comparable to Goswami's, he said.Asking the states to file their response, the Bench posted the matter for further hearing after two weeks.Imam has contended that five FIRs based on the same speech and same facts had been registered against him in Delhi, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh"There is nothing wrong in police registering FIR. If they come to know about some cognizable offence," the top court had said on May 1.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-4-states-on-sharjeel-imams-plea-90163

After his rediscovery of the caves in 1844, he made extensive copies of the Buddhist cave paintings.The first Buddhist cave monuments at Ajanta date from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. During the Gupta period (5th and 6th centuries AD), many more richly decorated caves were added to the original group. The paintings and sculptures of Ajanta, considered masterpieces of Buddhist religious art, have had a considerable artistic influence.“It pains me to notice that the tomb has been defaced in the last five-six years,” Mahanor said in a facebook post, expressing his anger and pain over some words carved on the marble plaque at her tomb at Ajanta village, around 10 km from the caves.“Ajanta caves symbolise the thoughts and path to peace shown by Gautam Buddha. The caves were in the dark for around 2000 years before being rediscovered by Major Gill. Paro was his shadow when he was working in the dense forest of Ajanta for 12 years,” Mahanor wrote.The poet said Gill could complete his work only due to the help and companionship rendered by Paro, a local tribal girl from Lenapur settlement near the caves. The officer built a small memorial for her at Ajanta but the marble plaque which underlined Paro’s role was damaged by miscreants.Mahanor, a Padma Shri and Sahitya Akademi awardee, said he will install a new marble plaque at the spot and also undertake the renovation of the tomb, which is next to a police station.Major Gill, who died at 74, was buried at Bhusawal in adjoining Jalgaon district.Ajintha, a Marathi movie depicting the love story of Paro and the British army officer was released in 2012 and met with a lukewarm response at the box office.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tomb-of-woman-who-aided-british-army-officer-in-rediscovery-of-ajanta-caves-to-be-repaired-90161

26-05-2020||Hyderabad||24-year-old Bihar man kills 9 people to hide lover’s murder in Telangana||To hide the murder of a woman, a man from Bihar committed nine more murders by throwing the victims into a well in Telangana's Warangal district last week, the police said on Monday.Cracking the mystery behind the nine bodies recovered from an open well at Gorrekunta village near Warangal town on May 21 and 22, the police arrested Sanjay Kumar Yadav (24), who confessed to committing the gruesome crime to hide the murder of a woman with whom he had live-in relationship.Revealing the details of the macabre murders, Warangal Police Commissioner V. Ravinder told a news conference that the accused killed nine persons, including six members of one family, by mixing sleeping pills in their food and then throwing them one by one into a nearby well.As all the victims were sedated after having their food laced with sleeping pills, the accused put each person in a gunny bag, dragged them one by one and threw them into the well, about 100 metres away from a godown of a gunny bag making unit where the family of a migrant worker from West Bengal and two Bihari youth were living. Another migrant from Tripura, who was also present in the building, was also murdered.The bodies of Mohammed Maqsood Alam (55), his wife Nisha (48), both natives of West Bengal working in the gunny bag manufacturing unit for the last 20 years, their daughter Bushra Khatoon (22) and Bushra's three-year-old son were found in the well on May 21.The next day after emptying the well, the police found the bodies of Maqsood's sons Shabaaz Alam (20) and Sohail Alam (18), Bihari workers Sriram Kumar Shah (26), Shyam Kumar Shah (21) and a migrant from Tripura, Mohammed Shakeel (40).Investigations revealed that Yadav, who was also working at the gunny bag unit, developed a relationship with Nisha's niece Rafiqa (37), who had come from West Bengal with three children after separation from her husband and was employed in the same factory.Yadav had taken a room on rent and was living with her. Police investigations revealed that Rafiqa had recently admonished him for trying to sexually exploit her daughter.The accused hatched a plan to kill Rafiqa and informed Maqsood's family that he is taking her to West Bengal to talk to her elders for marriage. They boarded the Garib Rath train to Visakhapatnam on March 6, but during the journey, he bought butter milk and after mixing sleeping pills, served it to Rafiqa. After she fell asleep, he strangulated her and threw the body from the train near Nidadavole in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh.The accused got down from the train at Rajahmundry and returned to Warangal. When Nisha and her husband enquired about Rafiqa, he said she had reached her village and would come back later.When Maqsood's family threatened to approach the police, he hatched a plan to eliminate all of them.As May 20 was Shabaaz's birthday, he came to their house in the evening and mixed sleeping pills in the food prepared at home.As two Bihari youth living in the same building had seen him at Maqsood's house, he went to their room and mixed sedatives in their food to wipe out the evidence.Shakeel, a native of Tripura who had come to Maqsood's house at the latter's invitation, too became Yadav's victim.The police commissioner said the CCTV footage of the accused leaving his house on the evening of May 20 and returning the next morning provided the vital clue to the investigating team."We have no evidence that there is any other person involved in the crime," the police chief said, dismissing reports that four people were picked up in connection with the case.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/24-year-old-bihar-man-kills-9-people-to-hide-lovers-murder-in-telangana-90143
26-05-2020||Mumbai||Thackeray meets Pawar, Sena says Maharashtra govt strong||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting with NCP president Sharad Pawar here, senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said on Tuesday while asserting that the state government is "strong".The two leaders met for about one-and-a-half hours late Monday evening, Raut said while dismissing speculations about the Thackeray-led government's stability.The Sena Rajya Sabha MP, however, did not reveal what transpired between the two leaders.The meeting between Thackeray and Pawar took place after the NCP chief met state Governor B S Koshyari on Monday morning.NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had a meeting for one-and-a-half hours. Those doubting about the stability of this government are doing so out of their own grudge. This government is strong," Raut tweeted in Marathi.Earlier, Pawar met Koshyari on Monday morning, following which the NCP claimed the meeting took place on the invitation of the governor and no political issues came up for discussion.However, the timing of the meeting is significant as it took place against the backdrop of strained relations between the Shiv Sena, which heads the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, and the Raj Bhavan.The NCP is one of the key constituents of MVA.Pawar was one of the key leaders from Maharashtra who had openly complained about Koshyari's "intervention" in the functioning of the state administration.Recently, senior BJP leader and former state chief minister Devendra Fadnavis complained to the governor about the "failure" of the Thackeray government in handling the COVID-19 crisis.

26-05-2020||New Delhi||India's COVID-19 tally reaches 1.47 lakh; Odisha, Assam, Bihar see rapid increase||The nationwide tally of COVID-19 cases crossed 1.47 lakh on Tuesday with states like Bihar, West Bengal, Assam and Odisha reporting significant rise in their numbers amid large-scale return of migrant workers from other states. Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik warned of more challenging days ahead and called for a new strategy to check the pandemic.The numbers rose further in the worst-hit states including Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu as well, while Delhi, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh also figured among the states and union territories reporting new cases.Some experts flagged an urgent need for more intense surveillance and monitoring in areas where migrants have returned to contain the outbreak and warned that their tallies may go up due to resumption of domestic flights on top of the special trains and flights.The Union Health Ministry, however, said the recovery rate for COVID-19 cases in the country has seen an upwards trend and is better than many other countries, while the fatality has fallen further.At a press briefing, Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said, "The recovery rate in the country continues to improve and is presently 41.61 per cent. The COVID-19 fatality rate has reduced from 3.3 per cent on April 15 to 2.87 per cent which is among the lowest in the world." In its morning update, the Ministry said the COVID-19 death toll has risen to 4,167 and the number of cases has climbed to 1,45,380 in the country, registering an increase of 146 deaths and 6,535 cases since Monday 8 AM. It put the number of active cases at more than 80,000 and recoveries at over 60,000.However, a PTI tally of figures announced by different states and UTs, as of 9.30 PM, put the total number of confirmed cases across the country at 1,47,505 and a death toll of 4,268. It also showed a higher number of recoveries at over 63,500.The Union Health Ministry suggested to the five states reporting a surge in COVID-19 cases over the last three weeks to analyse the trends in containment zones and adopt course correction measures through proper implementation of micro-plans. These states are Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.Several states have been attributing the increase in their tallies to arrival of people from outside in special trains, being run since May 1 to ferry migrant workers to their native places, and special international flights that began on May 1 to bring back stranded Indians and expatriates from abroad.Besides, domestic flights have also begun since Monday in a phased manner. However, a passenger on a Chennai-Coimbatore flight, on Monday itself, tested positive, prompting IndiGo to ground the crew that operated the flight. This is possibly the first case of a passenger on-board being detected coronavirus positive after domestic flights resumed services on Monday.During a review meeting on the COVID-19 situation in Odisha, which saw its tally rising to 1,517 with 79 new cases, Patnaik said a new strategy would be needed to deal with the pandemic."With flight and train services having been restored, the next 15 to 30 days will be challenging, but I am sure we will be able to handle it all in a professional manner," he said.More than three lakh people have returned to the state in Shramik Special trains and buses in a span of just 24 days.Overall, Indian Railways has ferried over 44 lakh migrant workers on board 3,276 'Shramik Special' trains since May 1, according to official data.The maximum number of these trains have originated from Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, while the highest number of those have terminated in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh.The Delhi government has sent around 2.41 lakh people back to their home states in 196 trains since May 7, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said on Tuesday. Of these, nearly 1.25 lakh people were sent to Bihar, 96,610 to Uttar Pradesh, 3,000 to Jharkhand, 2,500 to West Bengal and 2,100 to Madhya Pradesh.Many experts have warned that the return of migrant workers to their native places may create a huge labour shortage and further hit the economy, which is facing a deep recession due to the pandemic and restrictions related to the nationwide lockdown, in force since March 25.Rating agency CRISIL predicted a GDP decline of 5 per cent for the current fiscal and a staggering 25 per cent contraction in the current quarter (April-June 2020)."About 10 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in real terms could be permanently lost. So going back to the growth rates seen before the pandemic is unlikely in the next three fiscals," it said.Several relaxations have been given in the ongoing fourth phase of the lockdown, which began on May 18 and is scheduled to continue till May 31, to revive economic activities. While domestic flights have also resumed, a chaotic situation continued for the second day amid several cancellations.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the four phases of the nationwide lockdown have "failed" and not given the results that Prime Minister Narendra Modi expected.Addressing an online press conference, he urged the Centre to spell out its strategy for "opening up" the country and expressed concern that India is the only country which is relaxing the lockdown when the virus is "exponentially rising".The ruling BJP, however, said the doubling rate of coronavirus infection has fallen to 13 days from three before the lockdown and called it a "success" of India.BJP leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar said the Modi government's decision to impose the lockdown has ensured that India suffered much less than countries like the US, France and Spain. He took a swipe at the Congress, saying it is doing politics at a time when the nation is fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.India is now among the ten worst hit countries by the novel coronavirus and several experts have attributed the surge in cases to easing of travel restrictions and movement of migrants besides enhanced testing capacity.According to AIIMS Director, Randeep Guleria, the present rise in cases has been reported predominantly from hotspot areas but there is a possibility of further rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in the coming few days due to increased travel."Those who are asymptomatic or are in a pre-symptomatic stage will pass through screening mechanisms and may reach areas where there have been minimal or less cases," Guleria said.He said there was a need for more intense surveillance and monitoring in areas where migrants have returned to contain the spread of the disease.Commenting on the partial resumption of rail and road transport services and migrants returning to their native places, Dr Chandrakant S Pandav, former president of the Indian Public Health Association and Indian Association of Preventive and social medicine, said the floodgates have been opened."This is a classic case of creating an enabling environment for coronavirus to spread like wildfire. In the coming few days, the number will rise dramatically. While it is true that lockdown cannot go on forever, the opening up should have been in a measured, calibrated and informed manner," he said.The coronavirus death toll in Delhi itself has mounted to 288, while 412 fresh cases of COVID-19 infection were reported during the day, taking the virus tally in the city to 14,465.In West Bengal, the tally crossed the 4,000-mark with 193 more people testing positive for the disease. Besides, at least five persons have died due to the infection in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll in the state to 211.Assam also reported 47 new cases, its total to 595.In Kerala, 67 new cases were reported, the highest single-day spike so far. The total Covid tally in the state has touched 963 with 415 presently under treatment and over 1.4 lakh under observation.Tamil Nadu saw its tally of confirmed cases rising to 17,728 and the death toll to 127.Gujarat reported 361 new cases and 27 more deaths, taking the total case count to 14,829 and fatalities to 915.Maharashtra reported 97 coronavirus deaths -- highest in a day -- and 2,091 new patients. Mumbai alone accounted for 39 deaths for the day.The death toll due to COVID-19 in the state has risen to 1,792 while the tally of coronavirus cases reached 54,758.

26-05-2020||Lucknow||UP nod must for re-employing migrant workers||In a two-pronged strategy, the Uttar Pradesh government has decided to set up a migration commission to help find jobs for workers returning home and also said that any state that wants labourers from UP has to seek its permission.They are our people... and if some states want them back, they have to seek permission from the state government — Yogi Adityanath, CMAdditional Chief Secretary (Home and Information) Awanish Awasthi announced the plan to set up a migrants’ commission on Sunday.On the same day, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said in an interaction with RSS-affiliated publications ‘Panchjanya’ and ‘Organiser’ that other states will need permission from the UP government if they want to make use of labourers from Uttar Pradesh.About 25 lakh migrants, workers and their families have returned to Uttar Pradesh after being stranded for weeks in other states due to the lockdown imposed to fight coronavirus.At a meeting with senior officials on Monday, Adityanath reiterated that his government was committed to a safe and respectable homecoming for the workers and to providing them with jobs and social security.He said this was the reason for the decision on a separate commission for them and told officials to take prompt steps for setting it up.Adityanath has earlier told officials to work on insurance and job security for returning workers, according to government statements.The planned commission will look into workers’ rights, prevent their exploitation and provide an official framework to ensure socio-economic and legal support for them, the government said.Adityanath had claimed that UP’s workers were “not properly taken care of” by various states during the coronavirus lockdown. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-nod-must-for-re-employing-migrant-workers-90005

26-05-2020||Indervir Grewal||Balbir Sr: Stalwart player, free India’s first sports icon||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, May 25Balbir Singh Dosanjh was a “simple” man. But that is not to say that it is simple to define the man and his life.Balbir Singh played the game at the biggest of stages, but he never stopped going to the local hockey ground in the morning to watch children train.He was honoured with the most prestigious of awards around the world, but he rarely missed a chance to be a guest and a patron at a local tournament. He was one of the greatest names to have managed the Indian team, but he always showed great respect to his players, be it the stars or the newcomers.Balbir Singh played during the best era of Indian hockey, but he never tried to belittle the efforts of the future teams that failed to return with a medal. He achieved more than most people could even dream of, but he never stopped hoping to one day see Indian hockey return to the top of the world and win an Olympics gold.Peerless“It is not possible for us to measure his life and his achievements,” said Olympics and World Cup medallist Harcharan Singh.“He was a pioneer who put Indian hockey on the world map. Obviously, there had been great players earlier as well, but he was probably post-independence India’s first sports icon,” added Harcharan Singh, who was part of the 1975 World Cup-winning team. Balbir Singh started his hockey career in unified Punjab, where competition was so tough that it was supposedly easier to get into the national team than the Punjab team. A centre forward with a knack for scoring goals, Balbir Senior, as he was fondly known, rose through the ranks to make his international debut in 1947.Golden hat-trickHe made his Olympics debut at the 1948 London Olympics, which he later recalled on many occasions as a special experience. Balbir Senior scored two goals in the final against Great Britain, helping India win its first gold as an independent nation. “As our national anthem was being played and the tricolour was going up, I felt that I too was flying with the flag,” Balbir Senior later recalled.Four years later at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, Balbir Senior was no longer new to the Olympics. But his hunger for success was just as great. And he was probably at his peak. He scored three goals in India’s 3-1 semifinal win over Great Britain before hammering five past the Netherlands in the 6-1 win in the final. His record for most goals by an individual in an Olympics final still stands.In the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Balbir Senior captained India to a “golden hat-trick” for the second time in history. Except this time, it was an independent India. Balbir Senior had secured his legacy. “He was a pillar of Indian hockey,” said Olympics and World Cup medallist Ajit Pal Singh. “In terms of medals and achievements, he has the same sort of records as Dada Dhyan Chand.”But it was not just about records. Balbir Senior inspired generations of future hockey champions. “When we started playing as children, people such as Udham Singh, Balbir Singh and others were our role models. I didn’t see Balbir Senior play, but everyone knew who he was,” added Ajit Pal Singh, who captained the 1975 World Cup team.Father figureBut hockey was not about fame for Balbir Senior. Despite his international retirement in the late 1950s, he kept playing for Punjab Police at the national level. And for a long time, he was attached with the national team set-up. He was the manager of the Indian teams that won the silver at the 1970 Asian Games, bronze at the 1971 World Cup and gold at the 1975 World Cup. It is India’s only World Cup gold. “He was a father figure for everyone,” said Harcharan Singh. “He was a simple, straightforward person. There was no hypocrisy, no politics. He behaved the same way with the junior and senior players.”Ashok Diwan, another member of the 1975 team, said he would always be indebted to Balbir Senior for giving him the big break. “It was because of him that I played in the World Cup. I was one of the younger players, but he believed in me. He was a thorough gentleman. He was such a big name but so humble,” Diwan said.“I remember before the final against Pakistan at the 1970 Asian Games, he told me: ‘You alone are enough to defeat Pakistan’. To hear that from a player of his stature filled you with confidence,” said Harcharan.Balbir Senior then got into administration as the Sports Director of Punjab. “He was a multi-faceted man. His demise is an irreparable loss,” said Ajit Pal Singh.Balbir Singh Dosanjh was an icon, a father figure, a gentleman, a pioneer, a pillar. He was a player of rare talents and the manager of great teams. He was a motivator, a fighter and an eternal optimist. And hockey was his life.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/balbir-sr-stalwart-player-free-indias-first-sports-icon-90007

26-05-2020||Mukesh Ranjan||630 flights cancelled on first day||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, May 25The first day of the resumption of domestic commercial flights in the country had its fare share of challenges, leading to chaos at almost all major airports as nearly 630 flights were cancelled due to states’ restrictions and airline operational issues. The confusion was further compounded by a variety of quarantine protocols by state governments, leaving several flyers high and dry.Read also: Airlines draw flakAirlines drew flak for lack of communication. The airlines said they could not disclose cancellations until two hours before departure. With the new SOPs dictating that passengers arrive at least two hours early, this led to many turning up at airport only to find out that there would be no flight.532 flights take offFrom no flights on Sunday to 532 on Monday, action has returned. With Andhra and WB set to resume ops, these numbers are all set to increase further— Hardeep Singh Puri, Aviation ministerThe government had on May 21 announced the resumption of domestic flights from May 25 after a gap of nearly two months in the wake of the Covid-induced nationwide lockdown.The two busiest airports Delhi and Mumbai witnessed cancellation of nearly 80 and 20 flights, respectively. Officials at Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi, said the cancellations were mostly on account of some states, including West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh, refusing to allow flight operations and also because of some operational issues like low load factor faced by airline operators.“Around 80 flights to and from Delhi have been cancelled. The IGI airport was scheduled to handle a total of 125 departures and 118 arrivals today,” an official said. The Mumbai airport, the country’s second busiest airport after Delhi, was supposed to initially handle 175 flights daily. It curtailed them to 50 yesterday, and today further cancelled 20 flights.Andhra Pradesh did not allow flight operations today; it will begin services from tomorrow while West Bengal will resume them from May 28. The two states have two airports each.Smaller airports too had their share of cancellations, and had passengers complaining that they were not informed until they arrived at airports. Air India, in particular, has received criticism on social media for lack of communication with its passengers.The airline, however, maintained that it could not disclose cancellations until two hours before the flight departure. But with the new SOPs dictating that passengers should arrive at least two hours before their flight, this means many turned up at the airport only to find out that there would be no flight.Meanwhile, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri hailed the resumption of air travel by tweeting a live image of air traffic in the skies. “Indians soar in the skies again! A beautiful live capture from #flightradar24 shows how our skies look busy again as domestic civil aviation recommences in India from today,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/630-flights-cancelled-on-first-day-89979

26-05-2020||Bishan Singh Bedi||Goodbye Balbir Singh, hockey legend and good friend: Bishan Singh Bedi||Today I mourn the passing of hockey legend Balbir Singh Dosanjh, a man I am proud to call a friend.Edit: Death of a sporting hero‘Balbir’ means all-powerful in body and spirit, and Balbir Singh was definitely an all-powerful centre-forward, the best in Indian hockey since Independence.Read also: Growing up in the 1950s, I heard of him pretty early in my youth and had the good fortune of getting to know him well. I’d known Balbir Singh since 1969, when he came home for a family function in Amritsar. Someone pinched his shoes there and not once did he let me know of it – till March 2020, when I was asked to present him with a Lifetime Achievement Award! It was then that he told me that he had to go back barefoot from my place 50 years earlier!There was a time when Indian hockey had a plethora of ‘Balbirs’ and they all were powerful wielders of the hockey stick. But one of them became known as ‘Senior’, thanks to his seniority as well as his stature as a winner of three gold medals in the Olympics. Thus Balbir Singh became synonymous with the overall glory of Indian hockey.Honestly, I can’t visualise a more unassuming sports icon than Balbir Singh, who wore the Tricolour on his sleeve. He could have easily passed the gates of humility without ever having to bow before the high and the mighty. Since 1969, I had the good fortune of knowing and meeting the great centre-forward on numerous occasions, and every time he gave me a fresh lesson in calmness and humility. Honestly, I’ve often wondered if Balbir Singh ever got angry or upset.He loved to be addressed as ‘Sardar’, without ever losing his cool. In the last decade or so, I’ve seen Sardar Balbir Singh dribble past death on pretty consistent terms and with match-winning tenacity. But alas, in the war of life and death, the latter must eventually prevail.I’ve been a witness to his tenacity from very close quarters due to my proximity with his daughter Sushbir and grandson Kabir, remaining in touch on a daily basis. I can’t ever think of another daughter or grandson who might have toiled so tirelessly to keep their ‘old man’ in a good shape and humour. My heart reaches out to them — and to Indian hockey. The void can never be filled.Rest in peace, Sardar Balbir Singh ji Senior!The writer is an ex-captain of the Indian cricket team||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/goodbye-balbir-singh-hockey-legend-and-good-friend-bishan-singh-bedi-90003

However, with the imposition of national lockdown on March 23, all operations came to a standstill.The crop had ripened by then and was ready for harvesting. Considering this, the Centre gave relaxation to start agricultural and related activities during the lockdown period and the procurement could start from April 15 in most of the procuring states, officials said. In Haryana it started little late on April 20.Officials said their biggest challenge was to ensure that procurement was done in a safe manner during the pandemic, which was achieved through a multi-pronged strategy of awareness creation, social distancing and deployment of technology.A number of purchase centres were increased substantially reducing farmer footfalls in individual purchase centers. New centers were set up using every facility available at gram panchayat level and the numbers were increased sharply in major procuring states like Punjab where it went up from 1,836 to 3,681 and from 599 to 1,800 in Haryana and from 3,545 to 4,494 in Madhya Pradesh. Using technology, farmers were provided specific dates and slots to bring their produce which helped in avoiding overcrowding.Strict social distancing norms were followed and sanitisation activities were undertaken regularly. In Punjab, every farmer was allotted specific spaces earmarked for dumping of stocks and nobody else was allowed to enter those areas. Only people, who were directly associated, were allowed to be present during daily auctions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/wheat-procurement-surpasses-last-years-figures-punjab-leads-90004
