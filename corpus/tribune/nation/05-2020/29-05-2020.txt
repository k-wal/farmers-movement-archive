Congrats to all spellers and congrats to our champion, Navneeth Murali! Here are the final ranks:#2020spellpunditbee #spellpundit #spellingbee #spelling pic.twitter.com/HkkngkHZGl  The prestigious Scripps Spelling Bee tournament, which has been dominated by Indian-Americans over the years, has been cancelled for 2020 in view of the coronavirus pandemic, for the first time since World War-II.The competition, which is broadcast nationally on ESPN and gives USD 50,000 prize money, will return on June 1, 2021. The organisers of the Scripps National Spelling Bee cancelled the event citing "no clear path to safely set a new date in 2020".Murali, who finished in the fifth place as a sixth-grader and 11th place as a seventh-grader at the earlier editions of the Spelling Bee, will now take home USD 3,000 as the winner of the SpellPundit.“I knew all the words in the bee. I just didn't want to be overconfident, because you never know what can happen in a spelling bee because no one knows the dictionary completely,” he said.The SpellPundit test consisted of a written spelling and vocabulary test, then oral spelling, just like Scripps.The only other time the spelling bee, an annual event since 1925, was cancelled was from 1943 to 1945 because of World War II.Last year, after running out of words that were challenging enough for the contestants, the Spelling Bee ended in an eight-way tie resulting in an unprecedented octo-champs. Six of the champions were Indian-Americans. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-american-student-wins-spelling-contest-similar-to-spelling-bee-91682
29-05-2020||Raipur||Ajit Jogi: quintessential politician who never gave up||Ajit Pramod Kumar Jogi, the first chief minister of Chhattisgarh, was known in the political circles as someone who never gave up despite defeats, controversies and debilitating health issues.Jogi, 74, who died at a private hospital here on Friday, was the quintessential politician who enjoyed support among tribal and scheduled caste communities because of his easy accessibility.Born into a family of modest means in Pendra Road area of the then Bilaspur district, Jogi earned his engineering degree with a gold medal from a university in Ujjain in 1964.After that he qualified first for the Indian Police Service and then the Indian Administrative Service.After serving as collector for 12 years in various districts, including Indore and Raipur, Jogi resigned in 1986 and joined the Congress. The party sent him to the Rajya Sabha for two terms -- 1986-92 and 1992-98.His rise in politics was meteoric, and he became chief minister of the newly formed Chhattisgarh state in November 2000, trumping rivals such as Congress stalwart Vidyacharan Shukla.As chief minister, he was credited with setting up a state-of-the-art heart hospital in Raipur under the Public- Private-Partnership mode.Jogi focused on improving health infrastructure in the tribal-dominated backward state and also laid the foundation stone of the new capital city near Abhanpur area of Raipur.His ambitious ‘Jogi Dabri scheme’ to develop small water sources won praise, but was later marred by corruption allegations.He was accused for splitting the opposition BJP after 12 of its MLAs joined the ruling Congress in 2002.Jogi succeeded in sidelining Vidyacharan Shukla, who was seeking to become Rajya Sabha MP in 2002. Shukla then joined Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party.In January 2003, Jogi faced a major political setback when he and his son Amit were named as suspects in the murder of Ram Avtar Jaggi, then treasurer of the state NCP. Amit Jogi was also arrested but was later acquitted by the trial court.The BJP cashed in on the issue during the Assembly elections held towards the end of 2003, in which the Congress suffered a humiliating defeat.After coming to power, the BJP released an audio tape which purportedly suggested that Jogi had tried to bribe BJP MLAs in an attempt to engineer a split.Jogi was suspended from the party, but a few months later the Congress fielded him against Shukla who was contesting on BJP ticket in the 2004 Lok Sabha election from Mahasamund.During the campaign, Jogi met with a road accident near Rajim and was permanently confined to a wheelchair. But he went on to defeat Shukla.During the 15-year-long tenure of Raman Singh that followed 2003 assembly polls, Jogi was often dubbed as ‘Team B’ of the BJP for his perceived closeness to the ruling party.When the Congress lost a third Assembly election in a row in 2013, knives were out for Jogi, and the party then made Bhupesh Baghel the state unit chief despite the fact that he did not share any bonhomie with Jogi.Isolated, Jogi quit the Congress in 2016 after he and his son were accused of involvement in alleged fixing of the by-election to Antagarh Assembly seat in 2014.After the scandal broke in 2015, Baghel expelled Amit Jogi from the Congress. In June 2016, Ajit Jogi formed the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J).Ahead of the 2018 assembly elections, Jogi sprang a surprise by forming alliance with Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party. It was expected that the alliance will play the role of kingmaker.But the Congress won a landslide by bagging 68 out of 90 seats. Jogi-Mayawati combine won only seven seats.Ajit Jogi himself managed to win his traditional Marwahi seat, banking on his charisma.Jogi’s status as the member of a tribal community had been the subject of controversy since he entered politics.After he became chief minister, BJP leader Sant Kumar Netam had complained to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes that his claim of belonging to a Scheduled Tribe was based on forged documents.With the Congress’ return to power, he and his family members faced several fresh allegations with regard to Antagarh bypoll and the caste status issue.Though sidelined in the state’s politics, the four-time MLA never lost his sharp sense of humour, especially while targeting his opponents. His political legacy is now expected to be carried on by his son and JCC chief Amit Jogi. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ajit-jogi-quintessential-politician-who-never-gave-up-91681
29-05-2020||New Delhi||Union Health Ministry releases rap song to discourage spitting in public places||The Union Health Ministry, on Friday, put up a rap song on its website exhorting people not to spit in public places as COVID-19 can spread through saliva.The one-minute-25-second video clip explains why one should not spit in public places and how spitting following consumption of smokeless tobacco can lead to the spread of COVID-19.Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had appealed to all states and Union Territories to ban smokeless tobacco and spitting in public places to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection.#IndiaFightsCoronaथोड़ा तो सोचो, कोरोना को रोको। सार्वजनिक स्थानों पर थूकने से #COVID19 के संक्रमण का खतरा बढ़ता है। थूकना वर्जित, स्वास्थ्य अर्जित। #SwasthaBharat #CoronaOutbreak @PMOIndia @drharshvardhan @AshwiniKChoubey @PIB_India @CovidIndiaSeva @COVIDNewsByMIB pic.twitter.com/Hab3BnkEzk  In a letter addressed to all state health ministers, Vardhan said smokeless tobacco users had a tendency to spit in public places or otherwise and therefore, increased health risks, especially those of spreading infectious and contagious diseases such as COVID-19, tuberculosis, swine flu, encephalitis.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had also appealed to the general public to not consume and spit smokeless tobacco products in public places stating “chewing smokeless tobacco products (‘gutka’, ‘pan masala’ with tobacco, ‘paan’ and other chewing tobacco products) and areca nut (‘supari’) increased the production of saliva followed by a very strong urge to spit. Spitting in public places could enhance the spread of the COVID-19 virus.”The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 4,706 and the number of cases climbed to 1, 65,799 in the country registering an increase of 175 deaths and a record jump of 7,466 cases in the last 24 hours till Friday 8 am, according to the Union Health Ministry.

29-05-2020||---||Govt sensitive to job losses as economic activity restarts||New Delhi, May 29The government is still collecting data on job losses and salary cuts but highly placed sources conceded that many production units would find it tough to begin operations as soon as the lockdown ends due to labour shortage.The Labour and Finance Ministries are engaged with each other on collecting and analysing data on job losses. But there is enough information with the government to suggest that economic activity has restarted, although at a fraction of the production capacity. At most places it has ranged from 20 to 25 per cent and in some places up to 35 per cent of the production capacity.The sources said the flight of labour was due to the “natural human feeling” of panic due to the lockdown and production shutdowns.“Skilled and unskilled labour is a major contributor to the Indian economy. It (migration) will have an impact on those production units if they begin operations immediately after lockdown ends,” they felt and suggested some units should recast their business models by recruiting local labour.The government’s Covid stimulus, primarily consisting of easy loans, is expected to lift the economy though there is a temporary mismatch between disbursal of credit and the sanctions by public sector banks. While banks have sanctioned Rs 4 lakh crore, many recipients have informed that they would lift the credit after the lockdown ends.“Where do banks sit with the money if there is a disbursal and sanction mismatch?” asked the sources while hoping that the amount that banks park with RBI will reduce once the lockdown ends and industries pick up the sanctioned credit.The observation came on a day when core sector indices crashed into negative territory in the month of April.The sources said the stimulus package was arrived at after extensive consultations that took all the factors into consideration. But they were opposed to confetti-style distribution as that would still leave out many sectors and segments of the population. The present package “would kick-start the economy. Money for sure will reach those points that will trigger economy”, said the sources.However, they were unwilling to be drawn into setting quantifiable objectives as the lockdown was still on.On the demand to lower GST on essential commodities to boost consumption, the sources said it was for GST Council to decide at its next meeting in June. But their view was the economy should improve on all counts. “Demand from all sides for every good has to be induced,” they observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-sensitive-to-job-losses-as-economic-activity-restarts-91675

29-05-2020||New Delhi||Shramik Specials not regular trains, can be extended, diverted to benefit migrant workers: Railways||The Railways defended itself on Friday in the face of severe criticism over delays by Shramik Specials in reaching their destinations, saying they were not regular trains and can be extended or short-terminated, and their stoppages and routes could be changed for the benefit of migrant workers.At a press conference, Railway Board Chairman VK Yadav clarified that no train can ever be “lost” and of the 3,840 trains operated since May 1, only four have taken over 72 hours to reach their destinations.The clarifications came amid criticism that the migrant trains were getting “lost” before reaching their destinations. Railways data shows 36.5 per cent of all Shramik trains have ended up in Bihar and 42.2 per cent have terminated in Uttar Pradesh, leading to unequal pressure on these routes.Repeatedly stating that these were “unusual times”, Yadav also defended the Railways against the flak over lack of food and water on board the delayed trains, saying 85 lakh meals and 1.25 crore water bottles were supplied free of cost to passengers.He said complaints from passengers aboard specific trains have been investigated and it was found that there were no discrepancies in supply of meals.“Because of COVID0-19, many contractors did not want to board the trains to distribute food. We would initially give the packets for them to take on their own. But now our employees are using masks and gloves to enter the trains and distribute food. So, out of the 3,840 trains, these incidents are maybe in one or two per cent trains. In 98 to 99 per cent cases, this has gone smoothly,” he asserted.Yadav said the Railways was compiling a list of people who died on the Shramik Specials as he urged everyone with pre-existing health conditions, pregnant women and the aged to avoid unnecessary travel.“The Indian Railways has a control system; the train is immediately stopped if someone is found ill and doctors try to save their lives. Many passengers have been attended to by Railway doctors, 31 successful deliveries have been done. In many cases they were sent to the nearest hospital base. I understand they are travelling in desperate times. Each death is investigated. We are compiling the data on deaths and the reasons behind the deaths from state governments. We will make it public when we have the numbers, I don't want to comment on this without the numbers,” he said responding to a question on the number of deaths aboard these trains.He also said 90 per cent of the migrant trains ran with an average speed higher than regular mail express trains.“There was some fake news that a train reached Siwan (from Surat) in nine days... We diverted only 1.8 per cent trains. From 20-24 May, 71 trains were diverted because of high demand for trains to UP, Bihar, where 90 per cent trains were going from across the country,” Yadav said.He said in one case, a train which was to go to Allahabad was sent to Lucknow and was reported as “lost”. It was diverted to the Uttar Pradesh capital when it was realised that there were fewer people destined for Allahabad and more on the Lucknow route.“We spoke to the state government and we took a decision in Kanpur to take the train to Lucknow. These trains are not normal trains, Railways has maintained full flexibility in them. State governments have been given full flexibility to short-terminate trains, extend trains, change stoppages and change routes. We will do whatever it takes to help migrant workers reach home,” he said.Among the destination-states for which the trains were diverted were Bihar (51), Uttar Pradesh (16), Jharkhand (2), Assam and Manipur (1 each).The originating-states for which trains were diverted included Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan.Till May 28, Yadav said, 3,840 Shramik Specials operated ferrying a total of 52 lakh passengers. He said 1,524 Shramik trains operated in last one week and over 20 lakh passengers were ferried.“Railways has accommodated almost all requests received from the sending states and we are ready to meet all demand of Shramik movements. Requirement of states as on May 24 was 923 trains, as per requirement yesterday, the figure is now 449 trains,” he said.He said meals — beakfast, lunch, dinner — were served at en-route stations and the state governments provided food and water at starting stations. IRCTC and various railway divisions arranged free meals and water for migrants in trains enroute and over 85 lakh meals and 1.25 crore water bottles were supplied free.“NGOs supplemented efforts. Railway divisions mobilized local halwais, bakeries at various stations to prepare snacks and food for Shramiks,” he said.Yadav again sought to address the controversy around the payment of Shramik fares, reiterating that no migrant is being made to pay for their tickets.He said of the total cost involved in running a Shramik train, 85 per cent is being borne by Railways, while states are paying 15 per cent in the form of ticket fares. He also said the decision to not run migrant trains free of cost was a deliberate one.“Even now, we have cases wherein states have made demands for trains, and yet the trains have had to go empty to a large extent. If there was no cost for running these trains, it would not have been possible for the Railways to handle the demands.”Earlier this week, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said that several trains requested by the Maharashtra government had to return empty since the state did not arrange for passengers to come to the station.

He was 77.Known by his first name in film circles, Yogesh was a prominent lyricist in the 1970s Hindi cinema and gave some of his best songs in the middle-of-the-road films of Hrishikesh Mukherjee and Basu Chatterjee. Imbued with a sense of longing and nostalgia, his lyrics have survived the test of time by staying fresh in the memory of music lovers.Some of his evergreen hits are “Badi Sooni Sooni Hai”, “Maine Kaha Phoolon Se’ from Mukherjee’s “Mili”; “Rajinigandha Phool Tumhare”, “Kai Baar Yunhi Dekha Hai” from from “Rajinigandha” and “Na Jaane Kyon Hota Hia Yeh Zindagi Ke Saath” and the quirky “Jaaneman Jaaneman Tere Do Nayan” from “Ek Chhoti Si Baat”.Veteran playback singer Lata Mangeshkar expressed her grief over the death of Gaur.“I just got to know about the death of Yogesh Ji and I am deeply saddened. He wrote so many heart-warming songs. I have sung many songs written by him. He was a very calm and composed man. I pay my respects to him,” Mangeshkar wrote on Twitter.Writer-lyricist Varun Grover said, “Alvida Yogesh saab. Writer of so many gems (‘Kahin Door Jab’, ‘Rimjim Gire Saawan’, ‘Zindagi Kaisi Hai Paheli’ et al) he always managed to find the sweet spot between simplicity and depth.”            Gaur was born in Lucknow and later he moved to Mumbai in search of work at the age of 16 through the help of a relative.His breakout film was Hrishikesh Mukherjee’s “Anand”.His discography also includes songs such as ‘Rimjhim Gire Saawan’ from “Manzil”, ‘Badi Suni Suni Hai’ from “Mili”, ‘Na Bole Tum Na Maine Kuch Kaha’ from “Baton Baton Mein”, among many others.

Climate change has increased the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. These events could be even more dangerous this year as some of the measures normally used to protect people in emergencies will be less readily available to populations dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.Risk of extreme heat and wildfires would also increase over the coming weeks, with the peak of Northern Hemisphere heat typically arriving from July and August, and the most dangerous fires usually starting around from the same time, and sometimes running for several months, said organisations, including the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, the UNICEF France, the Lancet Countdown, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), the Earth System Science Center, Pennsylvania State University, and the Nairobi-based think tank Power Shift Africa.India and Bangladesh have already been hit by the first major storm of the year — Cyclone Amphan — one of the strongest on record in the region.According to Prof Maarten van Aalst of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre: “It’s critical that we do the immediate response work on COVID-19, including social distancing, but at the same time we must prepare for and respond to the continuing climate hazards, adjusting our contingency plans to the realities of the current pandemic. This precise dilemma has already been faced in places as far apart as the US with tornadoes, the South Pacific with Cyclone Harold, in the Philippines with Typhoon Ambo, and in Bangladesh and India with Cyclone Amphan.”The year 2020 is expected to be the world’s hottest year on record. The Global Heat Health Information Network has released urgent guidance on how to handle the combined impact of heatwaves and COVID-19.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/health-environment-experts-issue-warning-as-northern-hemisphere-enters-heat-and-storm-season-next-week-91657

Like others, he had been left without work due to the abruptly-enforced lockdown.Boarding a bus, Mohan Lal managed to reach Jhansi on May 23, after which he and other migrant workers boarded a Shramik Special train for Gorakhpur, some 70 kilometres away from his home district of Basti.After boarding the train, Mohan Lal had spoken to a relative on his mobile phone asking him to meet him at Gorakhpur on May 24. When the relative reached Gorakhpur railway station, he could not locate Mohan Lal and found his mobile phone switched off.The train returned to Jhansi on Wednesday. As the railways staff was disinfecting the coaches, they stumbled upon Mohan Lal’s body in the toilet.Defending the Railways, a spokesperson from the North Central Railways, Manoj Kumar Singh, said Mohan Lal had boarded the train only “after medical screening as laid down for travel during the COVID-19 outbreak”.He also claimed that he or anybody else on his behalf had sought no medical assistance during the journey.“This was an empty rake and empty rakes are usually locked. During maintenance, the body was discovered. None of the railway doctors in any division along the train’s route received any calls that someone was ill,” the Railways spokesperson claimed.Speaking to a news channel, Mohan Lal’s relative Madan Murari said: “He had called me in Jhansi after he boarded the train. He told me that he would be reaching Gorakhpur a day later and asked me to receive him at the railway station.”According to Murari, he tried to call Mohan Lal on May 24but his phone was switched off.On Thursday, we were told that Mohan Lal had died, Murari said.The police said a post-mortem was being conducted on Mohan Lal’s body and it would be handed over to the family after the results of the COVID-19 test were released.Over 21.65 lakh migrants have already returned to UP over the past two months with many more are expected in the days to come.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/migrant-found-dead-in-toilet-of-shramik-special-train-91651

There is no special license required for other two categories but they should be sourced from a licensed manufacturer and have labels clearly mentioning ingredients, expiry etc as per mandate of WHO.“Not only this, but there are also set conditions for storage of sanitizers. They cannot be sold at shops selling plumbing electrical needs and being handled by gloveless hands. We conducted raids and took samples and seized the stock of the drug sanitizers,” said Gurugram Drug Controller Amandeep Chauhan.It may be noted that the department had prior to this busted many manufacturing units where alcohol was being mixed with aloe vera extracts along with bathroom water and filled in bottles.The department had then rung alarm bells seeking coordinated crackdown on all these products being sold under garb of cosmetic and ayurvedic products.“People should buy sanitizers from authorized stores and from a licensed manufacturer as only then will it be an effective precaution. In case of sub-standard products, the user gets carefree trusting he is safe and this may further worsen the transmission. The concerned departments need to regularly check manufacture or sale of spurious sanitizers,” said CMO JS Punia.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sanitizer-and-masks-being-sold-at-hardware-and-book-shops-in-gurugram-91647
29-05-2020||Lucknow||UP govt signs pacts with industry bodies for 11 lakh jobs to migrant workers||The Uttar Pradesh government, on Friday, signed initial agreements with various industry bodies to help in providing 11 lakh jobs to migrant labourers who have returned to the state in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.Of this 11 lakh employment opportunities, the Federation of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and Indian Industries Association (IIA) accounted for three lakh jobs each, while realtors’ body NARDECO and the Laghu Udyog Bharati attend to 2.5 lakh jobs each for migrant labourers, state MSME Minister Sidharth Nath Singh said.All memoranda of understanding (MoUs) were signed in the presence of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, whose promise to provide jobs to migrants returning to the state was fulfilled by the MSME department of the UP government, he said.Commenting on the signing of pacts, Adityanath said it was the “top priority” of his government to provide employment to workers according to their ability, at the local level.“Skill mapping of every worker, returning from other states, is being done by the Skill Development and Revenue Department,” he said, noting that small scale industries were the biggest means to provide employment to workers in the state.The government is committed to provide employment to all, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said, adding that skill mapping of about 18 lakh workers had been completed so far.“Safe and dignified return of other workers is also our commitment,” Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said.“I thank you wholeheartedly for the strength with which you all acted on the call of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the fight against global epidemic Corona,” an official release quoted him as addressing to the industry bodies.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the government was constantly trying to provide employment to all workers living in the state or coming from outside.“All workers who are returning are our strength and capital, and now we will use them to build a new Uttar Pradesh. And the process has already started,” he added.To date, around 28 lakh migrant labourers have returned to UP through various transport modes.According to an official spokesperson, the state government is working on the policy of “job for every hand”.Under this policy, the chief minister has appealed to investors to accelerate the production of indigenous goods in the state which will also help many people get employment.The UP MSME Minister, Singh, said: “To those who had raised questions as to how the state government will carry out the gigantic task of providing 11 lakh jobs to skilled and semi-skilled labourers, the MSME department has given the answer.”The minister, who is also a state government spokesperson, pointed out that certain states had considered UP labourers as liability, “but, Adityanath converted them into assets”.He said Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has invited investors while emphasising on the production of indigenous goods.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said with increasing production of indigenous goods in the state, employment opportunities would also increase and its benefit will be given to workers.Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, earlier this week, had directed officials to complete the skill-mapping of migrant labourers in 15 days and get a survey conducted for their adjustment in MSMEs and industrial units.At a meeting with senior state officials to review the lockdown situation, he had asked for all-out efforts to increase industrial activity and directed that a survey be conducted in different industries, including the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), for adjusting the labourers and workers in accordance with their skills.Adityanath directed for a continuous communication through the Chief Minister Helpline with migrant workers and reiterated that his government is committed to ensuring a safe and respectable return of the workers, for which the state and central governments have made arrangements of free travel by trains and buses.He instructed the officials to write to different state governments for getting a list of those labourers and workers who are willing to come back to Uttar Pradesh.Meanwhile, NAREDCO-UP President RK Arora said: “We have signed an MoU with the UP government for providing employment opportunities to 2.5 lakh labourers of UP who have returned from different states because of COVID-19.”Around 1.25 lakh workers will be absorbed at Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida in the national capital region, while the remaining 1.25 lakh will be taken for projects across other cities in UP.The association would also provide training to labourers to undertake construction works, RK Arora said, adding that implementation of this MoU was expected to start within 15-20 days.

29-05-2020||New Delhi||Centre likely to retain limited role, allow states have more say after Lockdown 4.0||The Centre is likely to retain a limited role and allow states and Union Territories to take decisions on whether to tighten or give additional relaxations in the nationwide lockdown in their respective jurisdictions from June 1, officials said on Friday.The Central Government may, however, advise the state authorities to continue with strict curbs in the COVID-19 containment zones in the worst-affected 30 municipal areas that account for 80 per cent of the positive cases in the country.These 30 municipal areas are from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Odisha.“There is every possibility that the Centre will have very limited role with regards to imposing restrictions or giving relaxations from June 1. The states and UTs will take decisions on such issues depending on the situation locally,” a senior government said.The Central Government may continue with the suspension on operation of international flights and political gatherings as well as closure of malls and cinema halls, besides ordering mandatory wearing of face mask by people in public places and maintenance of social distancing norms everywhere.On reopening of schools or restarting metro train services, the states may be allowed to take a call.“From now onwards, lockdown measures will be reviewed every fortnight where states will have major say in every decision related to their respective jurisdictions,” the official said.The states may also be allowed to take a decision on allowing religious places, which have been shut since March 25, when the lockdown had begun.Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa had recently said that he had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting him that Karnataka be allowed to reopen temples, mosques, churches and other religious places.The nationwide lockdown was first announced by the Prime Minister on March 24 for 21 days in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. It was first extended till May 3 and then again till May 17. The lockdown has been further extended till May 31.Hectic parleys are still going on in the central government to assess the impact of the lockdown so far and the role to be played by the centre government and the states and Union Territories after the fourth phase of the curb comes to an end on Sunday.The Central Government is particularly concerned over the COVID-19 situation in 30 cities, including four metros of Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai, where positive cases are spiralling.On Thursday, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba had a meeting with municipal commissioners and District Magistrates of 13 of these 30 cities and took stock of their work to check the virus.The 13 cities are Chennai, Delhi/New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Thane, Pune, Hyderabad, Kolkata/Howrah, Indore, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Chengalpattu and Thiruvallur.To take views of the state governments on the future course of action with regards to the lockdown, Union Home Minister Amit Shah has spoken to all Chief Ministers of the country.During his talks with the Chief Ministers, Shah sought to know the areas of concern of the states and the sectors they want to open up further from June 1, another official said.Interestingly, till now, it was Prime Minister Modi who had interacted with all Chief Ministers through video-conferencing before the extension of each phase of the COVID-induced lockdown and sought their views.This was for the first time that the home minister spoke to the chief ministers individually before the end of another phase of the lockdown.Amit Shah was present in all conferences of Chief Ministers along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.It was understood that majority of the chief ministers wanted the lockdown to continue in some form but also favoured opening up of the economic activities and gradual return of the normal life, the official said.After his talks with Shah, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said he felt the lockdown may be extended for 15 more days.“However, we want some more relaxations like opening of restaurants with social distancing at 50 per cent capacity,” he said.The Central Government is also taking into account the rapid increase of coronavirus cases in states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam and Karnataka after arrival of migrant workers and other people from big cities or virus-hit regions.“Some states want curb on travel of people from outside. However, such blanket decisions are not acceptable to everyone,” the official said.The Karnataka government, on Thursday, decided to suspend air travel from Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, saying a large number of people arriving from these states have tested positive for COVID-19.While extending the fourth phase of the lockdown from May 18 till May 31, the Central Government had announced continuation of prohibition on opening of schools, colleges and malls but allowed opening of shops and markets.The government, however, allowed limited operations of train and domestic flights. The Indian Railways is also running special trains since May 1 for transportation of migrant workers from different parts of the country to their native states.The number of COVID-19 cases in India has climbed to 1,65,799 on Friday, making it the world's ninth worst-hit country by the coronavirus pandemic. The Health Ministry said the death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 4,706 in the country.

29-05-2020||Shiv Kumar||Mumbai runs out of operational ICUs, oxygen-supported beds for COVID-19 patients||Tribune News ServiceMumbai, May 29Mumbai has run out of operational intensive care units (ICUs) and oxygen-supported beds for patients suffering from the COVID-19 as there are not enough healthcare workers to man additional facilities, according to civic officials.“We are gradually adding beds at various facilities as we need adequate healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses, to manage them,” Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani said.The official admitted that plans to augment the number of beds available at several places had slowed down due to the shortage of trained personnel.On Friday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said there were just 645 ICU beds and 4,292 beds with oxygen support for COVID-19 patients in Mumbai.More than 35,000 people have already tested positive for the virus in the country’s financial capital with the daily tally nearly 1,500 cases as on Thursday, according to the data available with the civic body.Mumbai’s Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, had earlier this week, told reporters that the 75,000 hospital beds which would be increased to 1 lakh by June 15.However, these facilities, set up at a number of places — the NSCI grounds at Worli, MMRDA grounds at the Bandra-Kurla Complex, Bombay Exhibition Centre in suburban Goregaon and an office building offered by actor Shah Rukh Khan — are only partially operational or not operational at all due to shortage of personnel.“Many of these facilities are simply functioning as quarantine centres for mildly symptomatic patients,” a civic official pointed out.According to doctors from private hospitals, who have volunteered to be part of the team to fight the war on the virus, said the suspension of Mumbai’s train services had affected the movement of healthcare personnel.“Many junior doctors, nurses, technicians, ward boys and other staff live in the distant suburbs and commute by train. It is not possible for them to come to work without public transport,” a doctor from a private hospital said.Meanwhile, even seriously ill patients are being turned away from hospitals as a result of which several of them have died while rushing from one hospital to another.The BMC has now put out advertisements offering double the salaries for healthcare personnel, in addition to food and accommodation apart from a 15-day quarantine for every 15-days worked in a COVID-19 ward.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-runs-out-of-operational-icus-oxygen-supported-beds-for-covid-19-patients-91623

29-05-2020||Patna||Cops forbid RJD workers from visiting Gopalganj; Tejashwi meets speaker||RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav met Speaker Vijay Kumar Chaudhary on Friday and urged him to convene a special session of the assembly on law and order and other pressing issues, shortly after he was stopped by police from going to Gopalganj district in a massive procession.The police personnel, who thwarted his attempt to proceed towards Gopalganj, took exception to RJD workers flouting social-distancing norms.Earlier, a high drama unfolded outside the residence of former chief minister Rabri Devi which Tejashwi Yadav shares with her and where he had summoned party workers, including all members of the legislature, to join him in the march towards Gopalganj.Yadav has been upset over the “failure” of the police to arrest JD(U) MLA Amar Nath Pandey alias Pappu Pandey who is named in an FIR lodged following an attack on RJD worker JP Yadav at Gopalganj, on Sunday last, which the party activist survived but his brother and parents died.After a few hours of slogan-shouting and shoving on the pathways leading to 10, Circular Road, the palatial bungalow allotted to Rabri Devi, a stone’s throw from Raj Bhavan and the official residence of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, Yadav relented and decided to meet the assembly speaker instead.Emerging after the meeting where he was accompanied by elder brother and MLA Tej Pratap Yadav, RJD state president Jagadanand Singh and national general secretary Alok Mehta, a visibly chastened Tejashwi Yadav told reporters: “It must have been the first instance in the history of democratic politics when the leader of the opposition had to seek permission from authorities before meeting the speaker.”The 30-year-old younger son of RJD chief Lalu Prasad, whom the party has named its chief ministerial candidate, said he has demanded convening of a special session on the delicate situation prevailing in Bihar where law and order has evidently collapsed.“The government is indifferent to the lot of migrants who have returned in large numbers during the lockdown and the health system is far from adequate to handle a crisis like COVID-19,” he said.He also lashed out at the government for depriving the opposition party of its right to stage a democratic protest and said: “We were not going to Gopalganj with the intent of ‘maara-peeti’ (brawl). We fail to understand why we were restrained from travelling despite the assurance that we will follow social-distancing norms.”The incident, meanwhile, brought to the fore fissures within the Grand Alliance which comprises five parties but is headed by the RJD.Smaller partners such as the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) and the Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) questioned the RJD leaders’ “selective” volubility on an issue that involved members of his own caste and the district to which Lalu Prasad belonged.“It seems Tejashwi Yadav and his RJD think nothing of coalition partners. Any protest against the government should involve all opposition parties but they chose to proceed on their own,” lamented Jitan Ram Manjhi who heads the HAM.Manjhi said he did not disagree with the RJD leaders’ contention that the government was performing badly on all fronts but wondered why he chooses to focus on selective issues.“He is the leader of the entire opposition. He cannot act in the interests of his own party,” he said.The RLSP national secretary-general, Madhaw Anand, said: “I second Tejashwi Yadav’s demand for a special session. But I reiterate that if the demand is accepted, he should lend his voice to all victims of violence.”“He must not be silent when the perpetrator happens to be a Yadav and the victim an upper caste,” Anand said.The Congress is also part of the opposition coalition in Bihar, but there has been no immediate comment on the episode from any party leader.

29-05-2020||Mumbai||Amitabh Bachchan sends migrant workers to UP from Mumbai in 10 buses||Moved by the plight of stranded migrants, Bollywood veteran Amitabh Bachchan has come forward to contribute his mite to their cause.After the Friday afternoon 'namaz', a fleet of 10 buses carrying around 225 excited migrants, including women and 43 children, were flagged off for various destinations in Uttar Pradesh.As the green flag was shown to the Bachchan-sponsored initiative, the weary but cheerful migrants let out collective cheers of joy and relief, with 'thumbs up' or 'V' signs, looking forward to their long journey home.Five of the buses are on the way to Prayagraj, two buses each are headed for Gorakhpur and Bhadoi, while one bus will arrive at Lucknow. The migrants will then have to proceed to their respective villages from these towns.The flag-off was attended by ABCL Managing Director Rajesh Yadav, Suhail Khandwani, Managing Trustee of the Mahim Dargah Trust and Trustee of Haji Ali Dargah Trust, officials and top representatives of both the trusts including Mohammed Ahmed."It was the brainchild of Bachchan sahab, who has been deeply concerned by the sufferings of the migrants since the lockdown. He made a proposal and the Haji Ali Dargah and Mahim Dargah responded by offering to make all the arrangements," Sabir Sayed, Mahim Dargah's IT-Director told IANS.The Haji Ali Dargah, incidentally, has an emotional connect with Bachchan and his fans. He had shot the climax of his 1983 superhit "Coolie" at the historic shrine. The Manmohan Desai entertainer is still recalled for the grievous accident that the superstar suffered on the film's set, following which he was hospitalised for months.While on his current initiative, Bachchan had been feeding hundreds of migrants at various locations and also providing them with medicines over two weeks, without much fanfare.They were also given footwear, as many migrants were developing sores or blisters or gashes on their legs due to long hours of walking in the scorching sun.Bachchan, through Yadav, and the trustees of the two mausoleums, got down to the nitty-gritties of organising the massive operation over the past two weeks."It was tough work. Finally, after securing all permissions, clearances from the Maharashtra and other state governments, the fleet of buses finally started on their trips today, well before the onset of monsoon," said Sayed.Mahim Dargah Trustee (Dr) Mudassar Lambe informed IANS that a thorough medical screening of each migrant passenger was carried out, taking into account various criteria."Besides, to ensure a hassle-free journey, each passenger has been given a full kit of masks, sanitisers, gloves, water bottles and food packets for the entire journey. Each bus has a full-fledged emergency medical kit with essential medicines, fruit juices, glucose, etc," Lambe added.Owing to the social distancing norms, the 52-seater buses will accommodate around 25 passengers, and the bigger buses will seat 30 travellers.The migrants hailing from all religions prayed at the Haji Ali Dargah, and later the bus halted briefly at the Mahim Dargah before zooming off to their respective destinations, said M. Imran (Ibrahim) Khan, the Covid-19 reliefs executive for the Haji Ali Dargah.Bachchan's is the second major effort by a Bollywood personality after actor Sono Sood, who organised several buses for migrants over the past days and an AirAsia flight from Kochi to Bhubaneshwar with 167 migrants today.Besides this, the National Law School, Bengaluru alumni along with an IIT team sent 175 migrants by an AirAsia flight from Mumbai to Ranchi, Jharkhand, on May 27.Alongside the Maharashtra government, scores of other individuals, NGOs and organisations are also engaged daily in the huge humanitarian efforts to ensure the safe repatriation of hundreds of migrants to the safety of their homes. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amitabh-bachchan-sends-migrant-workers-to-up-from-mumbai-in-10-buses-91617

This service is available only in a handful of cities.Doorstep delivery of petrol and CNG is said to pose risks due to highly inflammable nature of the fuel, and safe and secure modes approved by relevant authorities need to be evolved.Speaking at a function to inaugurate 56 new CNG stations in 11 states, Pradhan said the government has already started mobile dispensers for diesel.It “would like to expand the same for petrol and LNG,” an official statement quoted him as saying. “Pradhan said that people would be able to get the home delivery of the fuel in future.”     The government, he said, is working on energy efficiency, affordability, security and accessibility.He envisioned that soon, the customers will have to go to only one place, where all types of fuels---petrol, diesel, CNG, LNG and LPG will be made available.The minister said city gas network of CNG supplies to automobiles and piped cooking gas to kitchens will soon cover 72 per cent of the country’s population.He was speaking on the occasion of inauguration of 56 new CNG stations in 11 states including Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, New Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.“Lauding the efforts of all the stakeholders in the expansion of the gas network in the country, Pradhan said that 72 per cent population of the country will soon be covered through the City Gas Distribution (CGD) network, with spread over 53 per cent of the geographical area,” the statement said.CGD network, comprising of over 2,200 CNG outlets and nearly 61 lakh piped natural gas users, presently covers about half of the country’s population.Stating that the country is moving towards a gas-based economy, he said the number of piped natural gas (PNG) users has gone up from 25.4 lakh in 2014 to 60.68 lakh. Industrial gas connections have risen to 41,000 from 28,000 and the number of CNG vehicles has gone up from 22 lakh to 34 lakh.He said that it is a matter of satisfaction that besides the public sector, private companies are taking part in the expansion of gas infrastructure in the country.Oil Secretary Tarun Kapoor said that India is the third-largest energy consumer of the world, and is working to raise the share of natural gas in its energy basket to 15 per cent from current 6.2 per cent.He said that as the economic activity and consumption level goes up in the country, the energy consumption is bound to go up.The government will promote and support gas as an environment-friendly, energy-efficient and economically efficient fuel, he said.“Completion of work at these stations was affected due to the countrywide lockdown imposed to prevent the spread of coronavirus. However, after easing of restrictions last month, the work gathered pace and was carried out ensuring all safety and social distancing norms. This ensured minimum delay in commissioning of these stations as against the original schedule,” the statement said.With the addition of these stations to India’s CNG network, the daily filling capacity in the country has gone up by over 50,000 vehicles.

The video was found derogatory and the same has been taken down with immediate effect. Shemaroo is committed to ensure our content is neutral and unbiased towards any religion, caste, creed or culture. We apologize to all brothers and sisters of the Iskcon community whose sentiments we might have unintentionally hurt. We extend our assurance that such matters will be dealt meticulously and with extreme sensitivity," said Shemaroo Entertainment in a statement they tweeted on social media.On Friday morning Shemaroo tweeted again, announcing disassociation with comedian Surleen Kaur. "Further to our unconditional apology to ISKCON community for the comments made by Ms. Surleen Kaur, we have decided to disassociate ourselves from any further involvement with Ms Surleen Kaur and Mr Balraj Syal as they failed to meet our standards of public decency," the company declared.Earlier, ISKCON vice president and spokesperson Radharamn Das wrote a letter to the Commissioner of Mumbai Police requesting him to register an FIR against the comedian and Shemaroo Entertainment Ltd over defamatory language towards ISKCON community and Hinduism.Das tweeted a copy of his letter tagging the Commissioner of Mumbai Police Param Bir Singh.It reads: "Dear Sir @CPMumbaiPolice Pls find our complaint against Surleen Kaur and @ShemarooEnt for using inappropriate words for ISKCON, for our Rishis, Hindus. This is very unfortunate that there has been narrative building against the followers of Sanatan Dharma on different platforms."In the said video, which was released a few months ago and widely circulated on social media, Surleen allegedly says: "Beshak hum sab ISKCON waley hain, par andar se sab harami porn waley hain (Undoubtedly we are from ISKCON, but inherently we are all porn people)."The comedian also took a dig at Hindu saints: "Dhanya ho humaare rishi muni jinhone thodisi Sanskrit use karke apne bade bade kaand chhupaye hain... Kamasutra. (praised be our saints who used a little bit of Sanskrit to hide all big misdeeds)."In his letter, Das wrote: "This is highly objectionable and defamatory and it has caused great pain to the followers of Sanatan Dharma, Hindus and ISKCON worldwide devotees.""There is a growing trend in India, where Hinduism/Sanatan Dharma and our Rishi-Munis, Deities etc are being constantly abused by a group of people and organizations. They are misusing the tolerant nature of the followers of Sanatan Dharma and their abuses and language and volume of abuse has only grown louder day by day.""There is a hidden propaganda and conspiracy to defame Sanatan Dharma, our Rishi Munis so that the youths can be easily manipulated. Through app's like Tik-Tok etc the focus of the foreign power's is to destroy the character of the masses so that country can be easily controlled and destroyed," wrote Das.

29-05-2020||Sheikhpura (Bihar)||Migrants fall ill after having dinner at quarantine centre in Bihar||Twelve migrants, two of them women, fell seriously ill after having dinner at their quarantine centre here, an official said on Friday.District Programme Manager, Shyam Kumar Nirmal, said the migrants had been lodged at the isolation facility in Karki under Ariyari police station area, about 25 km from the district headquarters.“On Thursday night, soon after having dinner they began to vomit and complain of severe abdominal pain. They were immediately rushed to a hospital where their condition is now stated to be stable”, Nirmal said.Investigations are on to ascertain which item caused the food poisoning following which suitable action would be taken, he added.More than 1.5 million migrants have returned to Bihar since the beginning of this month from places across the country where they had been stuck during the lockdown.The state government is offering Rs 1000 each to the returnees, inclusive of their train fares, following completion of a mandatory 14-day quarantine set up at district, block or panchayat levels.Upkeep of many of these quarantine centres, including the quality of food served there, has been a matter of concern.A PIL was recently filed in the Patna High Court seeking intervention in the matter.Moreover, the state government has drawn flak over a recent communication whereby officials have been directed to ban the entry of journalists into these quarantine centres, understandably to check the spread of COVID 19 which has reported a very high incidence among migrants.Opposition parties have, however, alleged that the move was aimed at preventing the condition of these quarantine facilities from getting exposed.

29-05-2020||---||SC to hear plea seeking replacement of word ‘India’  with ‘Bharat’ on June 2||New Delhi, May 29Seventy years after the Constitution of India came into force, a PIL in the Supreme Court wants ‘India’ to be replaced with ‘Bharat’ or ‘Hindustan’ as the name of the country, saying it will “instil a sense of pride in our own nationality”.Filed by Namaha, a Delhi-based man, the PIL contended that such an amendment would “ensure the citizens of this country to get over the colonial past”.At present, Article 1 of the Constitution states, “India, that is ‘Bharat’, shall be a Union of States.”However, the petitioner said: “The removal of the English name though appears symbolic, will instil a sense of pride in our own nationality, especially for the future generations to come. In fact, the word ‘India’ being replaced with ‘Bharat’ will justify the hard-fought freedom by our ancestors.”The PIL sought a direction to the government to introduce an amendment to Article 1 of the Constitution for the purpose.Referring to the Constituent Assembly debates on Article 1, the petitioner said even at that time there was a “strong wave” in favour of naming the country as ‘Bharat’ or ‘Hindustan’.“However, now the time is ripe to recognise the country by its original and authentic name — ‘Bharat’’, especially when our cities have been renamed to identify with the Indian ethos.”The PIL was listed for hearing on Friday but it could not be taken up as Chief Justice of India SA Bobde was not available.Now, it will be heard on June 2.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-hear-plea-seeking-replacement-of-word-india-with-bharat-on-june-2-91601

At around 1:30 pm on Friday he suffered another cardiac arrest following which doctors made efforts to revive him, but failed. He breathed his last at around 3:30 pm,” Dr Khemka said.Jogi, a former Congress leader, was the incumbent MLA from his traditional Marwahi seat.A bureaucrat-turned politician, Jogi, then in the Congress, had served as the first chief minister of Chhattisgarh, which came into existence in November 2000. He served in the post from November 2000 to November 2003.He parted ways with the Congress on a bitter note in 2016 after he and his son got embroiled in a controversy over alleged fixing of the assembly by-election held for the Antagarh seat in Kanker district in 2014.Jogi, who was wheelchair-bound since a road accident in 2004, subsequently formed his own outfit, the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) - which is now headed by his son Amit Jogi.A mass leader, Jogi remained an influential but controversial figure in Chhattisgarh though his regional party had limited appeal in the tribal-dominated state which has a bipolar politics with the Congress and the BJP forming the two poles.Leaders across the political divide paid him rich tributes.Baghel tweeted, “The death of the first chief minister of state is an irreparable political loss to the politics. He will remain alive in the memories of the people of state”.He also declared a three-day state mourning from Friday during which the national flag will fly at half-mast.The final rites of Jogi will be held with full state honour, Baghel said.The 20-year-old young state of Chhattisgarh has lost its father figure. Not only me but the Chhattisgarh has lost its father, not a leader. Honourable Ajit Jogi left for heavenly abode leaving behind his family of 2.5 crore people (population of the state), Amit Jogi tweeted.In this moment of pain, I am speechless. May god rest his soul in peace and give strength to all of us. His final rites will be held in Gaurela (Gaurela-Pendra-Marwahi district), his birthplace, tomorrow, Amit Jogi added.We are all saddened by the untimely demise of former Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh Mr Ajit Jogi. He attained the highest position in Indian politics and social life.“His loss is irreparable loss for all of us, Leader of Opposition Dharamlal Kaushik of the BJP tweeted.

During the COVID-19 crisis, they are also becoming a lifesaver all because of an initiative by the members of the community associated with the ruling BJP, who are turning them into face masks.“A Sikh can give up life for his turban, it is a symbol of unity and integrity for the community, in fact, the entire country,” says BJP Sikh cell co-convenor Jaspreet Singh Matta as he explains about the campaign that has drawn an “overwhelming response from the community across the country”.Matta said not only the BJP workers but also “Sikh brothers from all over the country have come forward to give us turbans”.Apart from Delhi, similar initiatives are also being run by members of the community associated with the BJP in cities namely Jabalpur, Hyderabad, Amritsar and Jammu, Matta added.“Last month, BJP national secretary RP Singh urged the Sikhs associated with the party to give unused turbans at home for making the face masks,” the co-convener said.Interestingly, though the Delhi unit started with a target of 25,000 to 35,000 face masks, given the response, it has now been increased to one and a half lakh. The masks will be distributed among school students under the Municipal Corporation of Delhi once they reopen.

In fact, they underlined that no conversation had taken place between the two leaders since April 4 when they spoke on the hydroxychloroquine export.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) for days has been stressing on bilateralism to resolve the dispute even as the US, first by senior diplomat Alice Wells and later Trump, have sought to triangulate it.For the first time the Chinese Foreign Office also spoke against the US offer for mediation. “We are capable of properly resolving the issues between us through dialogue and consultation. We do not need the intervention of a third party,” its spokesperson said at a media briefing here. “Between China and India we have existing border-related mechanisms and communication channels,” he added.The clarification from both India and China was prompt after Trump said in response to a question that he had spoken to PM Modi and went on to say that the Indian PM was not in a “good mood’’ over the “big conflict’’ between India and China.A day earlier, the MEA had said that India was directly in touch with China through established mechanisms and diplomatic contacts to resolve the border stand-off.Trump has offered at least half a dozen times to mediate between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue which was always turned down by New Delhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-china-reject-trumps-mediation-offer-on-border-standoff-91586

29-05-2020||Washington||India, US could strike a 'smaller' trade deal in coming weeks: Indian envoy||India and the US could strike a “smaller” trade deal in the coming weeks, India's ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu has said while acknowledging that the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic has been a "bit of a setback" in moving ahead as the governments are focused on tackling the health crisis.Addressing the virtual West Coast Summit of US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), Sandhu said that India's supply of antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to the US has given the two countries enough confidence and have played an important foundation.India, which is one of the major manufacturers of the drug, has sent several million doses of the HCQ to the US as part of its humanitarian gesture.“The top leadership has also been talking about it and I feel that perhaps in the coming few weeks, we should be able to strike the smaller trade deal,” Sandhu said.“I continue to be very optimistic about the trade deal. I must mention that this current unprecedented challenge has given a bit of a setback in the sense that the focus of all the governments got to tackle the health crisis,” Sandhu said.He told the leaders of the top US companies that the trade officials from the two countries have been in constant communication over this issue.The understanding between the leadership of the two countries was that they will go for the smaller one and then immediately start negotiations on the bigger trade deal, he said.The current global situation, he noted, has made it even more opportune time to have this trade deal.The trade deal also relates some of the top sectors for which “it will be a win-win situation” for both sides.“It will help in the overall confidence building because during this particular phase, the United States and India have been reliable partners. And I think that everybody has seen in our case whatever the supply chain at stakes, especially in pharma sector, which we weren't involving whatever the United States requested us, keeping in view our huge domestic requirements, but it was ensured that all those were supplied and at the same price,” Sandhu said.“I think that has certainly had an impact. That has given them confidence and I feel that will be an important foundation to ensure that this smaller trade gets announced soon enough and then we move ahead,” Sandhu said.Ahead of US President Donald Trump's maiden visit to India in February, there were reports that the two sides would sign the first phase of a mega trade deal.After his talks with Trump on February 25, Prime Minister Modi said both the sides agreed to start negotiations for a "big trade deal" and hoped that it will yield good results in mutual interest.The two countries have been negotiating a trade package to iron out certain issues and further boost two-way commerce.India is demanding exemption from high duties imposed by the US on certain steel and aluminium products, resumption of export benefits to certain domestic products under their Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), and greater market access for its products from sectors like agriculture, automobile, auto components and engineering.On the other hand, the US wants greater market access for its farm and manufacturing products, dairy items and medical devices, data localisation, and cut on import duties on some information and communication technology (ICT) products. The US has also raised concerns over high trade deficit with India.Keith Krach, Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and Environment, spoke about the importance of being able to access talent."Being the former chairman of Purdue University, I attended multiple graduation ceremonies, and probably 35 per cent of the PhDs in Engineering came from India. We would love to be able to stamp that Green Card right to their diplomas. It's a very complex issue that we continue to beat the drum on," he said.Expressing optimism for the US-India ties, Raj Subramaniam of FedEx said that there is absolutely no reason why the US-India trade cannot be five or 10 times of the current levels.“The hope is that a startup like Uniphore, as a part of this community at USISPF, becomes a USD 100 billion entity in the next five years,” he said.Speaking about the disruptions caused due to the health crisis, chairman, president and CEO of Adobe Shantanu Narayen said, “From my perspective, unprecedented times are the best times for disruption. We are not going back to the old normal and that represents a very significant and unique opportunity for all startups.”The “Startup Connect Program” at its virtually held West Coast Summit focused on strengthening US-India bilateral ties through startups. The summit brought together over 300 executives including 100 startups, 100 Fortune 500 companies, and senior officials from both governments.USISPF president and CEO Mukesh Aghi shared data on job creation and entrepreneurial immigration between the US and India.“A sample of 12 Indian-born startups shows they have created 634 high-paying jobs in the United States, and over 6,200 jobs worldwide,” he said.“For every H1/L1 visa issued to these startups, they created 40 jobs in the United States at a median income of USD 175,000, and for each high-paying job in the US, there are eight jobs that are being created in India. Entrepreneurial immigration in the US-India corridor is creating some true win-win opportunities for both countries,” Aghi said.

29-05-2020||New Delhi||India denies Trump claims of talks with PM Modi over China logjam||Top government sources on Friday virtually contradicted US President Donald Trump's claim of a conversation between him and Prime Minister Narenda Modi on India's ongoing military standoff with China in eastern Ladakh.There has been no recent contact between Prime Minister Modi and President Trump, the sources said.The clarification came hours after Trump said in Washington that he had spoken to Modi and that the Indian prime minister is not in a "good mood" over the "big conflict" between India and China.The sources said the last conversation between the two leaders was on April 4 on the issue of hydroxychloroquine.They said the Ministry of External Affairs on Thursday made it clear that India was directly in touch with China through established mechanisms and diplomatic contacts to resolve the border row in eastern Ladakh.Troops of India and China were engaged in a major standoff for over three weeks in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie in eastern Ladakh, in what is turning out to be the biggest confrontation between the two countries after the Doklam episode in 2017.The trigger for the face-off was China's stiff opposition to India laying a key road in the Finger area around the Pangong Tso Lake besides construction of another road connecting the Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie road in Galwan Valley.In the midst of the flare-ups between Indian and Chinese armies, Trump on Wednesday said he was "ready, willing and able to mediate" between the two countries.In its reaction, India on Thursday said it was engaged with China to peacefully resolve the border row, signalling that it was not open to accept the offer of mediation by the US president.On Thursday, Trump reiterated his offer to mediate between India and China, and said that he spoke to Modi, who is not in a "good mood" over the "big conflict"."I can tell you; I did speak to Prime Minister Modi. He is not in a good mood about what is going on with China," the US president said during an interaction with journalists in the White House.Trump previously offered to mediate between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue but New Delhi rejected the proposal.MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava on Thursday said India was engaged with China at military and diplomatic levels to resolve the ongoing standoff with China, but at the same time asserted that the country is "firm" in its resolve to protect its sovereignty and national security.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on the evening of May 5 which spilled over to the next day before the two sides agreed to "disengage".However, the standoff continued.The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.The troops of India and China were engaged in a 73-day stand-off in the Doklam tri-junction in 2017 which even triggered fears of a war between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long LAC. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of southern Tibet while India contests it.Both sides have been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it is necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.

29-05-2020||---||Under fire, Labour Ministry out with social media platform||New Delhi, May 28Under fire from various quarters, including workers’ bodies, for its allegedly improper handling of labour issues during the lockdown, the Union Labour Ministry has launched a social media platform for the Labour Bureau to provide latest statistics relating to the sector.A Twitter handle, @LabourDG, was inaugurated by Union Labour Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar. He tweeted that this handle will be a regular source of updated Indian labour market indicators. A majority of Central Trade Unions (CTUs) had expressed unhappiness and resorted to protests over the “inept” handling of labour issues since the lockdown was clamped.The launch of the platform comes on the heels of the Labour Ministry reportedly asking the state governments not to tinker with the existing labour laws. At least eight BJP and non-BJP state governments either diluted the laws or freezed them in the midst of the lockdown with justification of “revival of economies of the states”.The Labour Bureau, an attached office of Ministry of Labour and Employment, has been collecting and disseminating information on various facets of labour like wages, earnings, productivity, absenteeism, labour turnover, industrial relations, working and living conditions and evaluation of working of various labour enactments etc. The information disseminated by the bureau plays an important role in advising the government for formulation of employment policies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/under-fire-labour-ministry-out-with-social-media-platform-91508

Troops of both sides are holding positions as before.THE STANDOFFThe Chinese have stopped Indian troops from patrolling crucial areas along the north bank of lake Pangong TsoIndia assumes LAC to be at ‘Finger 4’. China is trying to push Indian troops back to ‘Finger 2’, which is more than 10 km awayThe Chinese continue making military-style bunkers and trenches. Military trucks are there by dozens. Even a warehouse is coming up. Indian agencies have picked up movement of Chinese tanks less than 10 km away. Large parts of Ladakh are flat plateau where tanks can be used. India has T-72 tanks at those heights.The Chinese have unilaterally stopped Indian troops from patrolling crucial areas along the north bank of Pangong Tso (a 135-km glacial melt lake). Eight mountain spurs of the Chang Chenmo range end at the north bank of this lake. Each spur or ridgeline is identified as ‘finger’ in military parlance and each ridgeline is separated by 2-5 km. On the night intervening May 5-6, troops of both sides had clashed, resulting in injuries to many.India assumes the LAC to be at ‘Finger 4’. China is trying to push Indian troops back to ‘Finger 2’, which is a distance of more than 10 km. India was patrolling till ‘Finger 4’ but the Chinese are not allowing patrols to pass. In a carefully crafted move, the Chinese troops have reached the confluence of the Shyok and Galwan rivers in sub-sector north (SSN), close to the 255-km Darbuk-Shyok-DBO road. The Chinese have moved both men and machines there. Galwan is not a disputed section along the LAC.The DSDBO road provides all-weather access to the DBO, Depsang plains and Karakoram pass. Opposite the road or eastwards is the Aksai Chin plateau, illegally occupied by China. Other than these two spots, there is a disputed section near Gogra at the edge of “hot springs” in Ladakh.On Wednesday, both the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Beijing and Chinese Ambassador to India Sun Weidung had underlined the need for constant communication to resolve the differences.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-change-troops-in-ladakh-continue-to-hold-positions-91387

The Indian response came shortly after a conference by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang during which he did not touch the border flare-up.Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Anurag Shrivastav refuted an earlier claim by the Chinese Foreign Office that Indian troops had intruded into its territory. “India is committed to maintaining peace.… At the same time, we remain firm in our resolve to ensuring our sovereignty,” he said. India and China are also utilising military mechanisms to “peacefully resolve” the situation. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-delhi-prefers-bilateralism-to-mediation-by-us-91390
