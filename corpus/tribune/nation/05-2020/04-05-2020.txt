04-05-2020||New Delhi||Jamia violence: Delhi court dismisses Sharjeel Imam’s application for statutory bail||A Delhi court on Monday dismissed an application of former JNU student and anti-CAA activist Sharjeel Imam, booked under stringent anti-terror law—Unlawful Activities(Prevention) Act—seeking bail on the ground that the investigation was not concluded within the statutory period of 90 days.   Imam was arrested on January 28 from Bihar in the case related to violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act near the Jamia Millia Islamia University in December last year.The statutory period 90 days would have concluded on April 27.In the application, he contended that the trial court’s April 25 order extending the period of investigation in the case to 90 days more is bad in law. Rejecting the contention, Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana, said the order extending period of investigation was passed before expiry of statutory time period of 90 days.        “Since the time period to conclude investigation has already been extended as per section 43 D (2) of UAPA, I am of the considered opinion that application for release of the accused on statutory bail is bereft of merits and the same is accordingly dismissed,” the court said.                 Section 43-D (2) of UAPA provides that if it is not possible to complete the investigation within the 90 days period, then upon the report of the public prosecutor indicating the progress of the probe and the specific reasons for the detention of the accused beyond the 90 days period, after satisfaction, the court can extend the period of probe to 180 days.             Imam is currently lodged in Guwahati jail in a case related to UAPA registered by the Assam Police. The counsel for Imam argued that the investigating agency did not conclude the probe within the specified time limit and hence the accused has an indefeasible right to be released on statutory bail.   The lawyer submitted that although on April 25, period of investigation was extended for a further period of 90 days by a Roster Judge, that order is not in consonance with the statutory provisions.The counsel further contended that the court which passed the order for extension of probe period was not competent enough and no report was filed by the public prosecutor and thus the order was non est (does not exist) in the eyes of law.       “Even no notice was served upon the accused before extension of time and in the absence of any notice, the court could not have extended the statutory time period,” he submitted.                          Additional Public Prosecutor opposed the application saying the Roster Judge was empowered to deal with the application under the UAPA and was well within his powers to entertain and dispose of the application of the prosecutor for extension of time.               The prosecutor argued that the counsel for the accused was duly intimated by way of WhatsApp about the application and despite intimation the counsel opted not to appear before the court and now the accused cannot cry foul.The trial court had on April 25 given 90 days more to the police to complete their investigation in the case. The order was passed after the police had told the court that due to global COVID-19 pandemic in the country and the ongoing lockdown, the pace of investigation was seriously disrupted.      The police further informed the court that they are yet to interrogate the members of WhatsApp group “Muslim students of JNU”, persons who provided their accounts to arrange for money to get printed the pamphlets and Imam’s friends and persons who initially video recorded the speech at Jamia are yet to be identified.    It said that results in respect of hard disk of laptop and the mobile phone and the alleged videos are yet to be received from the forensic lab and the replies from Facebook, Twitter and Cert-In are yet to be received and analysed and the requisite sanctions are also to be obtained.                Initially a case under section 124 A (sedition) and 153 A IPC (promoting enmity between classes) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Crime Branch, New Delhi, pursuant to the alleged speeches addressed by Imam, allegedly instigating a particular religious section of the society to disrupt/block the access to North East region of India from rest of India, police claimed.               The police had earlier charged Imam with sedition, alleging his speech promoted enmity between people that led to riots.                  The mob indulged in large-scale rioting, stone-pelting and arson, and in the process destroyed several public and private properties while a number of police personnel and people were injured in the riots, the police had told the court.          Imam was arrested from Bihar”s Jehanabad on January 28.         He was involved in organising protests at Shaheen Bagh but came into limelight after a video showed him making controversial comments before a gathering at Aligarh Muslim University, following which he was booked under sedition charges. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jamia-violence-delhi-court-dismisses-sharjeel-imams-application-for-statutory-bail-80338

04-05-2020||---||PM Modi calls for global reform in post-Covid world||New Delhi, May 4Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the Covid epidemic has shown the need for more representative international institutions. “Covid has shown us the limitations. In the post-Covid world, we need a new template of globalisation, based on fairness, equality, and humanity,” he said at a video conference of Non Aligned Movement’s (NAM) Covid Contact Group organised by President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev.“We need to promote human welfare, and not focus on economic growth alone. India has long championed such initiatives,” he said while citing the Indian initiative of “International Day of Yoga”, the International Solar Alliance, also initiated by India, and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure which has organised disaster management drills in the region and beyondThe PM also asked his NAM colleagues to call on the international community and World Health Organisation (WHO) to focus on building health capacities in developing countries.“We should develop a platform for all NAM countries to pull our experience, best practices, crises management processes, research and resources. In the founding spirit of movement let us aim today to come together not grow apart,” he advised at the conference where about 40 NAM leaders besides heads of UN, WHO, European Union and the Africa Union spoke. Pakistan fielded its Health Minister while Presidents of Iran, Cuba, Indonesia, Egypt and Venezuela were among the other prominent speakers.India, under PM Modi, sent the Vice President to the two previous NAM summits. The last Indian Prime Ministerial representation to a NAM summit was in Tehran eight years back. However, PM Modi put faith in the ability of NAM to promote global solidarity as it has often been the “world's moral voice”. To retain this role, NAM must remain inclusive, he added. While the summit of G-20 and that of the Foreign Ministers of BRICS countries was an exercise in restraint, at the NAM summit, Iran, Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua accused the US of crippling their response to the pandemic by imposing unilateral sanctions.Iran President Hassan Rouhani described the US slashing its funding to WHO as “untimely, unjustifiable and irresponsible” which has deprived the WHO of much-needed finances. This decision should be considered as another strategic error by the US which would hobble the global joint battle against the pandemic. “One couldn’t have expected otherwise from this administration which has time and again withdrawn from international accords and violated its national laws,” he observed.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-calls-for-global-reform-in-post-covid-world-80333

04-05-2020||New Delhi||Rail fare row: Karnataka, Maharashtra, Kerala not paying for migrant labourers’ travel||Amidst criticism over the Railways charging stranded migrant workers for ferrying them home, payments for 45 special trains that have run so far have been made by originating states, barring Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka, sources said on Monday.Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in a press conference on Monday also ruled out paying the fare for migrant workers.Sources said states like Rajasthan, Telangana and Gujarat—from where Shramik Special trains have originated—are paying on behalf of the migrant workers, while Jharkhand, which has only received such trains, has also paid for the travel of workers.The Gujarat Government has roped in an NGO to pay part of the travel cost, sources said.States like Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka—from where some trains originated—are charging the labourers for the trips, the sources said.A controversy erupted on Monday after several opposition parties demanded that migrant workers not be charged for the train tickets.      As the Congress offered to pay for the workers, the BJP hit back, saying the Railways was already providing subsidised tickets bearing 85 percent of the travel costs.In the Standard Operating Procedures for these Shramik Special Trains, the Railways had said on Saturday the “local state government shall handover the tickets for these passengers cleared by them and collect the ticket fare and hand over the total amount to Railways.”          The Central government in a press conference, however, on Monday said, “The Government of India has not ever talked of charging train fare from workers. Eighty-five per cent of fare will be borne by the Indian Railways, 15% by state government,” said Health Minister Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal.The Railways is yet to issue an official statement on the issue, which it, unofficially, said was a “political battle”.Officials, however, have been maintaining that it was charging only standard fare for these special trains from the state governments which is just 15 percent of the total cost incurred.In fact, the Railways’ sleeper class tickets even during normal times is subsidised by around 43 per cent, the officials said, while also pointing out the additional operational costs of running an empty train back to originating station and booking of only 54 seats instead of all 72 per coach.“The Railways are running Shramik Special Trains keeping berths empty in each coach to maintain social distancing. The trains are returning empty from destinations under lock and key,” a senior Railway official said.“Free food and bottled water is being given to migrants by the Railways. We have run 45 such trains so far and we will continue to do so. Nowhere in our SOP, we have said that the fares be collected from travelling migrants,” said a senior official of the Railways.It also said that if these trains were made free of cost, then it would have been difficult to regulate the crowd.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has requested the Centre not to charge any amount from migrant labourers for travelling by train during the coronavirus-enforced lockdown.Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in a video statement on Monday said the state government has been giving money to the Railways for the transport of migrants.“No migrant needs to pay for their travel,” he said.The Kerala chief minister said the state had no plans of paying for the tickets of migrants.“The guest workers have booked their tickets by themselves for their travel. We thought that the Centre would bear the expense but that is not happening,” said Vijayan.When asked if the state has any plans to bear the ticket charges, he said, “No. The state government was not planning for anything like that.”In Karnataka’s capital Bengaluru, a government official confirmed the workers were paying their own way home on the Shramik Special Trains.“No, the passengers themselves are paying,” said the official when asked if the state government was paying for the migrant labourers.Sources said that Odisha, which has till now only received migrants is unlikely to pay for their tickets.The migrant workers who have come back to the state from southern states have paid for their own tickets, sources said.Madhya Pradesh, which till now has only received migrants, is also yet to be billed by the Railways.The Railways is charging the fare of sleeper class tickets in mail/express trains, plus a super-fast charge of Rs 30 and an additional charge of Rs 20 for the Shramik Special Trains.

04-05-2020||New Delhi||RBI may extend moratorium on loans by another 3 months||With the further extension of the nationwide lockdown, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is considering a proposal for extending the moratorium on bank loans by another three months to help people and industry impacted by the ongoing lockdown to contain COVID-19.Suggestions from various quarters, including from the Indian Banks’ Association, have come for the further extension of the moratorium and the RBI is actively considering them, according to sources.The government, on Saturday, extended the lockdown for further two weeks till May 17 with certain relaxations in red, orange and green zones.Income stream would not resume due to the continuation of the nationwide lockdown, the sources said, adding that so many entities and individuals would be unable to service their debt in these circumstances at the end of the present moratorium period ending on May 31.So, the extension of moratorium by another three months would be a practical approach from the regulator, a senior public sector bank official said. It will help both borrowers and banks in these difficult times, the official added.The RBI had, on March 27, allowed banks and financial institutions to offer a moratorium of three months on payment of instalments of all term loans outstanding as on March 1 to help mitigate the hardship faced by borrowers.“All commercial banks (including regional rural banks, small finance banks and local area banks), co-operative banks, All-India Financial Institutions, and NBFCs (including housing finance companies and micro-finance institutions) (“lending institutions”) are being permitted to allow a moratorium of three months on payment of instalments in respect of all term loans outstanding as on March 1, 2020,” the RBI had said.Accordingly, it had said the repayment schedule and all subsequent due dates, as also the tenor for such loans, might be shifted across the board by three months.As a result of this moratorium, individuals’ EMI repayments of loans taken were not deducted from their bank accounts, providing much-needed liquidity.The loan EMI payments will restart only once the moratorium time period of 3 months expires.RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, on Saturday, held a meeting with public and private sector banks where the issue of loan moratorium was also reviewed.Credit flows to different sectors of the economy, including liquidity to non-banking financial companies, microfinance institutions, housing finance companies, mutual funds, etc, and post lockdown credit flows including the provision of working capital, with special focus on credit flows to the MSMEs were also deliberated.The Supreme Court, earlier this week, directed the RBI to ensure that its March 27 guidelines, directing lending institutions to allow a three-month moratorium to all borrowers, is implemented in letter and spirit.

As the Centre had earlier announced the lockdown would continue till May 17, the Cabinet will discuss the new guidelines and relaxations,” an official said even though Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) is personally believed to be in favour of extending the lockdown to keep pressure off the healthcare system.With dipping revenue, the Cabinet is expected to take a decision and work out a formula for opening of the liquor vends.Standalone wine shops may be opened from May 8. As per the guidelines issued by the Centre, sale of liquor in standalone shops will be allowed with certain conditions in all zones—green, orange and red—barring containment areas.On Sunday, the chief minister reviewed the arrangements in the state with senior officers and discussed the prevailing situation in districts.Given the chaotic scene witnessed in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh over opening of liquor vends, the Telangana Government is working out a way to avoid violation of the social distancing norms by people wanting to buy liquor.In Andhra Pradesh, long queues were seen today at retail liquor outlets at many places with the police finding it hard to control crowds and ensuring social distancing norms.The customers lined up outside the shops long before they opened at 11 am. Serpentine queues were seen atliquor shops in Krishna, Guntur, Nellore, Visakhapatnam, Chittoor, Anantapur and other districts.There was chaos at shops, as the increased prices were not updated online, resulting in delay in sale transactions.At a village in Nellore district, women forced the closure of liquor shops. Fearing that large gathering may lead to spread of coronavirus, they pressured the authorities to shut the outlet.The Prohibition and Excise Department has issued guidelines for the sale of liquor at the retail outlets run by state-owned Andhra Pradesh State Beverages Corporation Limited (APSBCL).The reopening of liquor shops has come under criticism from main opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP).TDP state chief Kala Venkat Rao said instead of opening liquor shops, the government should open canteens to provide free food to the people going hungry because of the lockdown.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/crucial-telangana-cabinet-meeting-to-decide-on-easing-lockdown-on-may-5-80321

04-05-2020||New Delhi||Severe weather activity over northwest India to continue for next two-three days: IMD||The “severe weather activity” over the northwest is expected to recur for couple of more days, till Wednesday or Thursday, the IMD said on Monday.It was not just the northwest, a vast expanse extending from the northwest to east and northeast India experienced “severe weather activity”—rains, thunderstorm accompanied with lightning, hail and squally winds with speed reaching 50-60 kmph on Sunday, due to more than one weather system at the same time.According to the IMD, convergence of moist easterly winds and conducive upper level features resulted in weather conditions over the northwest (Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh) yesterday and similar weather is likely to continue over the region during the next three days.Likewise, fairly widespread to widespread rain/thundershowers are also expected over Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura and sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim over the next three to four days and also Odisha, gangetic West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand, it said. Thunder squalls (50-60 kmph) and hailstorm at isolated places are likely during this period.Isolated to scattered rain/thundershower are also expected over south peninsular India during next the four/five days while heat wave conditions will prevail over Vidarbha and Telangana.Several factors are contributing to the weather situation over so many parts of the country. A western disturbance, a trough in mid tropospheric westerlies, a  cyclonic circulation over northeast Bangladesh and  neighbourhood and  a cyclonic circulation over Haryana and neighbourhood.There is an east-west trough extending from the cyclonic circulation over Haryana and neighbourhood to the cyclonic circulation over northeast Bangladesh and neighbourhood across Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal. A cyclonic circulation also persists over southeast Arabian Sea off the Kerala coast a trough/wind discontinuity from east Madhya Pradesh to south interior Tamil Nadu across east Vidarbha, Telangana and Rayalaseema.The low pressure area over south Andaman Sea and adjoining southeast Bay of Bengal and associated cyclonic circulation persists.It is very likely to persist meandering over south Andaman Sea and adjoining southeast Bay of Bengal during the next five days. The system is under continuous watch by the IMD.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/severe-weather-activity-over-northwest-india-to-continue-for-next-two-three-days-imd-80310
04-05-2020||Guwahati||African swine fever detected in India for 1st time; 2,500 pigs die in Assam||The first instance of African swine fever has been reported in the country in Assam where the disease has killed around 2,500 pigs across 306 villages, Animal Husbandry Minister Atul Bora said.Despite the go-ahead from the Centre, the state government will not cull the animals immediately and choose an alternative option to prevent the spread of the disease, Bora told a press conference on Sunday.While swine flu can spread from animals to humans, swine fever does not, and therefore is not a public health threat.“The National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, has confirmed that it is African Swine Fever (ASF). The Central government has informed us that it is the first instance of the disease in the country,” Bora said.According to a 2019 census by the department, the pig population in the state was 21 lakh which has increased in recent times to around 30 lakh, he added.“We have discussed with experts if we can save the pigs without culling them. The death percentage of the pigs affected by the disease is almost 100 per cent. So we have made some strategies to save the pigs, which are not affected by the virus,” Bora said.The department will collect samples within one km radius of the areas affected and test them, he said.“After testing, we will cull only those pigs which will be found infected. We are avoiding the immediate culling of the pigs. We will have daily updates and take a decision as and when the situation demands,” Bora said.Further testing will be done in three Assam laboratories itself, he said.“The virus spreads through pig’s meat, saliva, blood and tissue. So there will also be no transportation of pigs between districts. We will also see what can be done about pigs passing through our state.“We will have a surveillance zone within 10 km radius so that no pigs are transported out of the area or no feed is moved from a different location. We will also do GPS mapping,” Bora said.He, however, said the spread of the disease so far has been limited to 306 villages in seven districts of the state.The disease was detected towards the end of February.It started in April 2019 at a village in Xizang province in China bordering Arunachal Pradesh, Bora said.Usually stray pigs get infected with such viruses, but of late those in the farms have also been found afflicted with the disease.The animal husbandry department initially started administering classical swine flu vaccine but it was stopped due to the scare that the disease could spread through the doctor.“However, it (African swine fever) never affects humans. There is no problem in consuming pork from the areas where there is no infection. We will conduct awareness and training of farmers. We have selected 13 districts for this purpose,” the minister said.He also said the government has formed district level committees to enforce the relevant guidelines like not allowing the animals to roam freely and keeping them in enclosures.

04-05-2020||---||SC reserves order on restoration of 4G services in J&K||New Delhi, May 4The Supreme Court, on Monday, reserved its order on petitions seeking restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir even as the administration sought to justify the restrictions citing prevailing security situation.A three-judge Bench, headed by Justice NV Ramana, reserved its order after hearing lengthy arguments from Attorney General KK Venugopal and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta for the Centre and J&K Administration, respectively, and senior advocates Huzefa Ahmadi and Salman Khurshid for the petitioners.Citing a recent encounter in which five security personnel, including a Colonel, were killed in Kashmir, the J&K administration opposed the petitions, contending restoration of 4G internet services would lead to further surge in terror activities.The Apex Court seized of three petitions on the issue, including one each by the Foundation for Media Professionals and the Private Schools Association of Jammu and Kashmir.On April 27, restrictions on 4G internet speed were extended till May 11.Earlier, in an affidavit filed in response to these petitions, the J&K administration said reasonable restrictions were unavoidable in view of peculiar geo-political situation.Asserting that the right to access the internet was not a fundamental right, the UT administration said it could be curtailed in the interest of the “sovereignty”, “security” and “integrity” of India.On behalf of the Foundation for Media Professionals, Ahmadi contended that 2G internet speed was not enough for access to online education and healthcare services during the COVID-19 lockdown, and the restriction violated citizens’ Right to Education and Right to Health, which were part of Right to Life and Liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.“Even Arogya Setu app can’t be downloaded and operated by people in the valley,” Ahmadi said.Contesting Ahmadi’s submissions, Mehta asserted on behalf of the J&K administration that healthcare services were working.“There are other areas in the country where there is either no internet or only 2G is available. There is no information that someone has died of COVID-19 because they didn’t have internet access,” Mehta said.Khurshid argued that private schools were under direction to provide education through video-conferencing, but in the absence of 4G services, it was not possible.Venugopal said faster 4G internet speed would give the enemy information even about troop movements.“This is about protection of lives of the entire population of J&K. On Sunday, there were some tragic events...The enemy could know the troop movements if they had 4G,” the AG said.Noting that there was no study to suggest such a possible connection, Ahmadi said, “Most of the terrorist activities happened in J&K during the 1990s when there was no internet.”He said the orders restricting internet speed went against the Apex Court’s order in Anuradha Bhasin’s case as the orders were neither placed before a review committee nor made public.As the Bench asked if the orders were perused by the committee at all, Mehta said: “The orders were not mechanical and had been passed taking the ground situation into consideration.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-reserves-order-on-restoration-of-4g-services-in-jk-80303

The IMCT team leader wrote that this put the figure of mortality rate in the state to 12.8 per cent which was “by far the highest in the country”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-has-the-highest-mortality-rate-of-covid-19-patients-imct-80301
04-05-2020||New Delhi||Never talked of charging migrant workers; 85 pc fare borne by railways, 15 pc by states: Centre||The government has not talked about charging anything from migrant workers as 85 per cent of the transportation cost is borne by the railways and 15 per cent by state governments, the Centre said on Monday amid a row over the national transporter allegedly charging the workers for ferrying them home during the COVID-19-induced lockdown.The government also said the process of transporting the stranded migrant labourers was being coordinated by states “except for one or two states”.Read: Rail fare row: Karnataka, Maharashtra, Kerala not paying for migrant labourers’ travelAsked if the migrant labourers were being charged for being ferried home, Joint Secretary at the Health Ministry Lav Agarwal said as far as migrant labourers are concerned, the guidelines have clearly stated that under the infectious disease management one should stay where he or she is.“Based on the request given from states for particular cases, permission was given to run special trains. Be it government of India or the Railways, we have not talked about charging from workers. Eighty-five per cent of the transportation cost is borne by the Railways, while states have to bear 15 per cent of the cost,” he told reporters.“Based on the request of the states the process that started, under which limited number of stranded migrant labourers have to be transported for a particular reason, is being coordinated by the state governments, except for one or two states,” Agarwal said.At the daily briefing on the COVID-19 situation, Agarwal also said that in the last 24 hours, 1,074 COVID-19 patients have recovered, the highest number of recoveries in one day.The recovery rate stands at 27.52 per cent with 11,706 COVID-19 patients cured till now, he said.Agarwal said in the last 24 hours, 2,553 novel coronavirus cases were reported, taking the number of overall cases to 42,533. The total number of active cases stands at 29,453, he said.The joint secretary also said that the COVID-19 curve is relatively flat as of now and it was not right to talk in terms of when the peak would come.“If we collectively work then the peak might not ever come, while if we fail in any way we might experience a spike in cases,” he said.Amitabh Kant, Chairman of the Empowered Group dealing with civil society, NGOs, industries and international partners, said in 112 aspirational districts, “we worked with the collectors and in these 112 districts only 610 cases have been reported which is two per cent of the national level infection”.In these 112 districts, 22 per cent of India’s population resides, he said.In a few districts like Baramulla, Nuh Rachi, Kupwara and Jaisalmer more than 30 cases have been reported, while in the rest of the places very few cases are there, Kant said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/never-talked-of-charging-migrant-workers-85-pc-fare-borne-by-railways-15-pc-by-states-centre-80300

We can’t do anything more than their primary health check-up,” the official said.Asked about private vehicles being allowed to transport migrant labourers to their respective states, he said, except Rajasthan, no other state has shown willingness to allow migrant labourers to travel by bus and private vehicles.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/35-000-migrant-workers-sent-to-hometowns-so-far-maharashta-official-80297
04-05-2020||New Delhi||Google blocked and removed over 5,000 ‘bad ads’ a minute in 2019||Google on Monday said it blocked and removed 2.7 billion “bad ads”---more than 5,000 bad ads per minute ---in 2019, and suspended nearly one million advertiser accounts for policy violations as part of its efforts to protect users from misleading ads.The tech giant also noted that there has been a sharp spike in fraudulent ads for in-demand products like face masks amid the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed lakhs of lives globally.“Preserving the integrity of the ads on our platforms, as we’re doing during the COVID-19 outbreak, is a continuation of the work we do every day to minimise content that violates our policies and stop malicious actors. We have thousands of people working across our teams to make sure we’re protecting our users and enabling a safe ecosystem for advertisers and publishers,” Google said in a blogpost.The post, written by Google Vice President of Product Management Ads Privacy and Safety Scott Spencer, noted that 2.7 billion bad ads were blocked and removed in 2019.“We also suspended nearly 1 million advertiser accounts for policy violations. On the publisher side, we terminated over 1.2 million accounts and removed ads from over 21 million web pages that are part of our publisher network for violating our policies,” the blog said.It added that terminating accounts--- not just removing an individual ad or page---is an especially effective enforcement tool that Google uses if advertisers or publishers engage in egregious policy violations or have a history of violating policy.“People trust Google when they’re looking for information, and we’re committed to ensuring they can trust the ads they see on our platforms, too. This commitment is especially important in times of uncertainty, such as the past few months as the world has confronted COVID-19,” the blog said.Google said since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, it has been closely monitoring advertiser behaviour to protect users from ads “looking to take advantage of the crisis”.“These often come from sophisticated actors attempting to evade our enforcement systems with advanced tactics. For example, as the situation evolved, we saw a sharp spike in fraudulent ads for in-demand products like face masks. These ads promoted products listed significantly above market price, misrepresented the product quality to trick people into making a purchase or were placed by merchants who never fulfilled the orders,” the blog said.Google pointed out that there is a dedicated COVID-19 task force that has been working round-the-clock that has built new detection technology and has also improved existing enforcement systems to stop bad actors.“These concerted efforts are working. We’ve blocked and removed tens of millions of coronavirus-related ads over the past few months for policy violations including price-gouging, capitalising on global medical supply shortages, making misleading claims about cures and promoting illegitimate unemployment benefits,” it added.Simultaneously, Google is working on ways to allow advertisers across industries to share relevant updates with their audiences. It explained that over the past several weeks, Google has helped NGOs, governments, hospitals and healthcare providers run public service announcements. “We continue to take a measured approach to adjusting our enforcement to ensure that we are protecting users while prioritising critical information from trusted advertisers. Maintaining trust in the digital advertising ecosystem is a top priority for Google,” it said.

04-05-2020||New Delhi||COVID-19: SC asks Bombay HC to decide plea seeking stay on burial in three Mumbai cemeteries||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Bombay High Court to decide a petition filed by a man from Mumbai seeking stay on burial at three cemeteries in densely populated Bandra West area of the metropolis to prevent spread of COVID-19.A Bench headed by Justice Rohinton F Nariman said since the interim order was passed in the absence of any report or affidavit filed by the State of Maharashtra or Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), it would be proper that the issue was finally decided by the Bombay High Court.The Bench asked the high court to decide the matter in two weeks.Petitioner Pradeep Gandhy had challenged a Bombay High Court order dated April 27 dismissing his plea against the permission given by BMC for the use of Bandra West cemeteries to bury dead bodies of COVID-19 victims.Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind—a prominent Islamic body in India—had sought to join the issue, contending that burial is an integral part of Islam. It has urged the top court to give it a hearing in the matter.The HC had directed the BMC to remove three locks put up by local residents on April 13 at the gates of the cemetery.The petitioner contended before SC that the present “unprecedented health situation” should take precedence over the right to religion of COVID-19 victims’ family members.Maintaining that his demand was precautionary in nature, he said it was imperative to be safe rather than sorry in these extraordinary times as there was no cure to COVID-19.Gandhy—whose house is situated near Konkani Muslim Kabrastan—contended that local residents were afraid of community spread of COVID-19.Citing guidelines issued by Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for the last rites of COVID-19 victims, Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind said the disease is mainly transmitted through droplets.“...there is unlikely to be an increased risk of COVID infection from a dead body to health workers or family members who follow standard precautions while handling body,” it contended.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-sc-asks-bombay-hc-to-decide-plea-seeking-stay-on-burial-in-three-mumbai-cemeteries-80294

The migrant labourers are being taken from railway stations to their respective block headquarters where they have to stay in quarantine for 21 days. Once they come out, they will be reimbursed the full expenses and get an additional aid of Rs 500 each. Thus, each worker will be getting a minimum of Rs 1,000, he added.Kumar said the students returning to the state from places like Kota and elsewhere will not have to cough up money by way of fare.

"We will begin trials immediately on around 35 patients," said Dr Sanjay Mukherjee, Secretary, Medical Education and Drugs Department of the Government of Maharashtra.Initial trials will start at BJ Medical College in Pune, according the health department. While some of the participants in the trial will be those with moderate Covid-19 symptoms, others will be those with severe symptoms.According to sources here, it’s the first time that the BCG vaccine used to inoculate newborns against tuberculosis, is being considered as a treatment for the Covid-19 virus. Earlier, researchers at the Haffkine Institute were considering it as a vaccine against the novel coronavirus. Several frontline medical personnel in Maharashtra have already volunteered in a trial where they have been inoculated with the BCG vaccine.The Maharashtra government's decision to consider the vaccine as treatment for the virus comes after it showed encouraging results after it was administered to some patients, according to Dr Mukherjee.The BCG vaccine (Bacillus Calmette Guerin) is used to prevent meningitis. It was developed between 1908 and 1921, by French bacteriologists Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin, who named the product Bacillus Calmette Guerin, or BCG.The vaccine is considered relatively harmless since it is even administered on newborns.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-institute-to-soon-begin-trials-of-bcg-vaccine-as-treatment-for-covid-19-80265

04-05-2020||New Delhi||Many liquor shops in Delhi shut after crowd turns unruly||Many government-run liquor shops, which opened after over 40 days in the national capital on Monday, had to be shut as people who gathered outside the outlets did not follow social distancing norms, forcing the police to use mild force to disperse the unruly crowd.People queued up in large numbers in the morning at the liquor shops.According to an official, about 150 government-run liquor shops were allowed to open from 9 am to 6.30 pm in accordance with the latest lockdown relaxations given by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).Many people were not aware that only government shops were allowed to open.In most areas, including Burari, Mayur Vihar, Gandhi Vihar, Rohini and Janakpuri, a large number of people had lined up outside the outlets.An official said an alcohol vend had to be closed in Mayur Vihar in east Delhi as people failed to maintain social-distancing norms. Similar cases were reported from north and central Delhi.With people gathering in large numbers, the police had to resort to mild force. “Shops were asked to shut in places where social-distancing norms were violated. At some places, mild force was also used to disperse the crowd,” a senior police official said.Liquor shops in Karol Bagh, Daryagang and DB Gupta road in central Delhi were also shut by the police after crowds, gathered to purchase liquor, did not maintain social-distancing norms, said another senior police official.While liquor shops in Anand Parbat and Ranjeet Nagar did not open, liquor vends in Paharganj area, which opened at around 9 am, was closed by 12 noon as people gathered there failed to maintain social distancing norms, said another senior official from Central district.In northeast Delhi, liquor outlets in Jyoti Nagar and Dayalpur were also closed within an hour after it opened due to overcrowding and violation of social-distancing norms, the police official.“According to an order issued by the government, liquor shops were directed to deploy marshals at the outlets to maintain social distancing. However, a liquor shop near Apsara Border was asked to close since they did not deploy a marshal at their outlet nor were able to maintain social-distancing norms.“A large number of people gathered even before the shop opened at around 10 am and within minutes, we asked the liquor shop to shut,” said a senior police official from Shahdara district.Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) Jasmeet Singh said: “Two liquor shops opened in Kotla village, Mayur Vihar and Khichripur in east Delhi between 9 to 10 am. However, they were closed within 15 minutes after people did not follow police instructions. No marshal was deployed at these shops.” In Khichadipur, people barged inside one of the shops to buy liquor, he added.There were many who waited outside liquor shops but were not lucky enough.Amit, in his late forties, had come all the way from Paharganj to buy liquor from a vend in Gole Market, but without any luck. The area has three alcohol shops. With a large number of people gathering, the police dispersed the crowd.“They (liquor shops) have said they will open the shop after 12 noon. I will wait until then,” an unrelenting Amit said, refusing to go as he sought refuge in a lane.Outside another liquor shop behind the Regal Cinema, a police volunteer pasted a notice “The shop will not be opened until further notice”.Atul Gupta, who had come there from the trans Yamuna area, said he had come in the hope of buying alcohol, but with no luck.A police constable waiting outside the shop said they had to disperse people as a large number had queued outside, without heeding to the social-distancing norms.Delhi government earns a revenue of Rs 5,000 crore from the sale of liquor.The government has directed four state-run agencies, which were responsible to sell liquor, to deploy adequate marshals at these shops.There are around 850 liquor shops in the city, including those run by government agencies and private individuals. In an order on Sunday night, the Excise Department also directed officials to identify liquor shops, which are being run by private individuals (L-7 licensee) and fulfil conditions laid down by the MHA.The officials have been asked to submit a report within three days. The government has so far allowed only those liquor shops (L-6 and L-8) to operate which are being run by the four state-run agencies.“All liquor shops in malls and markets will remain closed. The government-run shops allowed will operate from 9 am to 6.30 pm. The four agencies will deploy marshals to ensure that not more than five people are present at one time at the shop,” the official said.The department has asked agencies to coordinate with the local administration and police to maintain law and order. According to the order, bonded warehouses have also been allowed to resume operation from 7 am to 6.30 pm.The Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation, the Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation, the Delhi State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited and the Delhi Consumers Cooperative Wholesale Store have been given the permission to open liquor shops in public places, except malls and market complexes.The agencies will have to give an undertaking stating that liquor shops being allowed to open will fulfil all MHA guidelines, according to the excise department.

There will be no registration. We will provide the money needed. The process has already begun,” KC Venugopal, AICC General Secretary KC Venugopal said.Surjewala said the Congress decision was in the spirit of Gandhian service and no politics should be played on it. “It’s a matter of clear intent,” Surjewala said, replying to questions on how the modalities of financial help to workers would be worked out.He said the Congress would still welcome any government decision to transport migrants free.The Karnataka state unit, the Congress claimed, had already submitted Rs 1 crore with the state chief secretary.Meanwhile, P Chidambaram, senior Congress leader, called Sonia’s decision to bear the cost of migrants travel as historic, adding “it puts the government of India to shame”.Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma also hailed Gandhi’s decision.The Government, meanwhile, is likely to issue a notification on costs of migrant return.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/political-row-as-cong-says-will-submit-migrant-ticket-costs-to-state-chief-secretaries-railways-80258

04-05-2020||New Delhi||India's manufacturing sector activity hits record low in April amid lockdown||The country's manufacturing sector activity witnessed unprecedented contraction in April amid national lockdown restrictions, following which new business orders collapsed at a record pace and firms sharply reduced their staff numbers, a monthly survey said on Monday.The headline seasonally adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 27.4 in April, from 51.8 in March, reflecting the sharpest deterioration in business conditions across the sector since data collection began over 15 years ago. The index slipped into contraction mode, after remaining in the growth territory for 32 consecutive months.In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.Amid widespread business closures, demand conditions were severely hampered in April. New orders fell for the first time in two-and-a-half years and at the sharpest rate in the survey's history, far outpacing that seen during the global financial crisis, the survey said."After making it through March relatively unscathed, the Indian manufacturing sector felt the full force of the coronavirus pandemic in April," said Eliot Kerr, Economist at IHS Markit.Panellists attributed lower production to temporary factory closures that were triggered by restrictive measures to limit the spread of COVID-19.Export orders also witnessed a sharp decline. Following the first reduction since October 2017 during March, foreign sales fell at a quicker rate in April. "In fact, the rate of decline accelerated to the fastest since the series began over 15 years ago," the survey said. On the employment front, deteriorating demand conditions saw manufacturers drastically cut back staff numbers in April. The reduction in employment was the quickest in the survey's history. "In the latest survey period, record contractions in output, new orders and employment pointed to a severe deterioration in demand conditions.“Meanwhile, there was evidence of unprecedented supply-side disruption, with input delivery times lengthening to the greatest extent since data collection began in March 2005," Kerr said.On the prices front, both input costs and output prices were lowered markedly as suppliers and manufacturers themselves offered discounts in an attempt to secure orders.Going ahead, sentiment regarding the 12-month outlook for production ticked up from March's recent low on hopes that demand will rebound once the COVID-19 threat has diminished and lockdown restrictions eased."There was a hint of positivity when looking at firms' 12-month outlooks, with sentiment towards future activity rebounding from March's record low. That said, the degree of optimism remained well below the historical average," Kerr said.In India, the death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 1,373 and the number of cases climbed to 42,533 as on Monday, according to the health ministry.Meanwhile, the coronavirus-induced lockdown has been extended beyond May 4, for another two weeks in the country.

04-05-2020||---||Congress to bear cost of rail travel of every needy migrant worker: Sonia||New Delhi, May 5The Congress party on Monday announced that its state units would pay for the travel undertaken by migrant workers returning home on trains.In a statement, Congress president Sonia Gandhi sought to know why the Central Government which spent Rs100 crore to transport and provide food for people for one public event in Gujarat cannot extend the same courtesy to the workers. "These essential members of our nation’s fabric be given a fraction of the same courtesy, especially free rail travel, at this hour of acute distress,” she said."The Indian National Congress has, therefore, taken a decision that every Pradesh Congress Committee will bear the cost for the rail travel of every needy worker and migrant labourer and will take necessary steps in this regard. This will be the Indian National Congress’s humble contribution in service of our compatriots and to stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity with them,” she said.Workers and labourers form the backbone of Indian economy and it is their hard work and sacrifice that are the foundation of the country, she said, adding that the Central Government barely gave a four-hour notice of the lockdown, workers and migrant labourers were denied the opportunity to return to their homes."Post Partition, this is the first time India witnessed a tragedy with such a massive human cost as thousands of migrant workers and labourers were forced to walk home several hundred kilometres on foot, without food, without medicines, without money, without transportation, without anything except for the desire to return to their families and loved ones.”“The very thought of their plight is enough to break people's hearts as there was also the outpouring of support from fellow Indians for their inspiring resolve. But what is the responsibility of our Government? Even today, lakhs of workers and migrant labourers are languishing in different parts of the country and wish to return to their homes and families but there is neither adequate money nor provision for free transport. What is particularly disturbing is that the Central Government and the Rail Ministry are charging them for train tickets in this hour of crisis.”“The Indian National Congress has been raising this issue from the outset of the lockdown. There needs to be provisions for the safe and free rail travel of migrant workers and labourers to their home-towns. However, despite our repeated demands, the Central Government and the Rail Ministry have chosen to completely ignore the same,” she said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-to-bear-cost-of-rail-travel-of-every-needy-migrant-worker-sonia-80221

04-05-2020||By Satya Prakash||Abortion: Need to go beyond pro-choice, pro-life debate||IT has been almost 11 years since the Supreme Court allowed a mentally challenged rape victim from Chandigarh to give birth to her child. Taking a pro-life stand, a three-judge Bench headed by the then CJI KG Balakrishnan had said, “Nature will take care (of the mother and child) on its own.”But since then the Supreme Court and various high courts have virtually turned “pro-choice”, allowing termination of unwanted pregnancies even beyond the statutory period of 20 weeks, particularly in cases involving rape victims.Acknowledging a woman’s right over her body, constitutional courts have maintained that she alone could take the decision whether to become a mother or not.And now, an amendment to The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 seeks to enlarge the ambit of the law to give women greater access to safe and legal abortion. Passed by the Lok Sabha on March 17, MTP (Amendment) Bill is expected to arrest the trend of women frequently knocking at the doors of courts in recent years.The MTP Act, 1971 allows abortion of up to 20-week pregnancy, if there is risk to the life of the woman or grave injury to her physical/mental health. Abortion in cases where there is risk of the baby suffering from physical/mental abnormalities which could leave it handicapped is also allowed.If the pregnancy is up to 12-week old, it can be terminated on the advice of one doctor but if it’s more than 12 weeks but less than 20 weeks, two registered medical practitioners are to be consulted.MTP Act is considered to be a “pro-choice” law as an adult woman does not need anyone else’s consent. But if the woman is a minor or of unsound mind, consent of guardian is needed. If pregnancy is due to rape, the anguish caused by such pregnancy shall be presumed to constitute a grave injury to the woman’s mental health, it clarifies.The present law has mainly two problems. First is about rape survivors with 20-week plus pregnancies seeking abortion. Second, it does not offer any solution to pregnancies beyond 20-week period where the foetus has developed some abnormalities.The amendment proposes to enhance the upper gestation limit from 20 to 24 weeks for special categories of women including survivors of rape, victims of incest and other vulnerable women such as differently abled and minors. Such decisions would be taken by a medical board. It also seeks to protect privacy of the woman whose pregnancy has been terminated.There is a need to go beyond “pro-life” and “pro-choice” ideological debate over abortion in India as often it’s a question of dignity and survival of a woman in a society and system which lack compassion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/abortion-need-to-go-beyond-pro-choice-pro-life-debate-79897

Dhankhar claimed that he was instrumental in making arrangement for the train.“Had discussions with Railway Minister Piyush Goyal yesterday for facilitating return of migrants to our state. One special train likely to reach and terminate at Durgapur via Asansol on May 5 scheduled to be departed from Rajasthan (Ajmer) carrying migrant from WB,” the Governor tweeted.Mamata may see the tweet as an attempt to step into her domain. On Saturday, she sent a strongly worded letter to Dhankhar warning him against trying to “usurp power”. She also accused Dhankhar of attempting to destroy the “singularity of the real executive organ of the state.”The Railways has started operating special trains for transporting stranded people. The West Bengal government recently evacuated students from the state stranded in Kota, Rajasthan. More than 90 buses were deployed for this purpose.The state government has also announced engaging senior IAS officers to coordinate with other states to bring back stranded migrant labourers. It, however, wants proper health screening of labourers before they begin their journey. “The state government is setting up proper quarantine facilities to house migrants on their return,” said an official. It is still not clear whether those travelling by special train will be required to buy ticket.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-governor-claims-credit-for-special-train-for-migrants-79933
