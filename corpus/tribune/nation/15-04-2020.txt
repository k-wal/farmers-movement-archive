An argument broke out between Prashant and Gullu when the former coughed.“Gullu got angry thinking Prashant was doing it deliberately and asked if he wanted to infect him (with coronavirus),” a police official told PTI.“As the argument intensified, Gullu pulled out a pistol and shot at Prashant,” he said.An injured Prashant was rushed to a private hospital, the police said, adding that an FIR was registered against the accused and efforts were on to arrest him.Coughing, fever and difficulty in breathing are some of the symptoms of the novel coronavirus, a highly contagious disease which has forced a nationwide lockdown since March 25.

Mauritius and Seychelles have already received the first batch of medicines that also includes HCQ tablets, said an official news release.India’s gesture elicited gratitude from Dominican Republic Foreign Minister Miguel Vargas in a letter to External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar. "In these trying time for our country and indeed the whole world, the possibility of procuring this medicine from India will make a tremendous difference because each life saved brings hope to our people,’’ he wrote.Significantly, as Chair of the UNSC for the month of April, Dominican Republic has overseen a closed-door discussion on Covid which China has stonewalled when it held the Chair of UNSC last month.The two island nations of Mauritius and Seychelles became the first countries to receive supplies of the anti-Covid drug Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Significantly India is eyeing a closer security relationship with both these countries that are strategically placed in the western Indian Ocean. Vice Prime Minister of Mauritius Leela Devi received the first batch of 5 lakh tablets of HCQ sent via a special Air India cargo flight from Delhi, said an official release. "The shipment was made possible as a special gesture although a restriction on its export from India continues to be in force in view of the unprecedented prevailing difficult situation because of Covid-19 global pandemic,’’ reminded the release.This is the first such consignment of essential medicines and a second consignment will follow in the coming days.Seychelles also received the first consignment of four tonnes of essential lifesaving medicines sent by an Air India special chartered flight.  This too, said the official release, was a "special arrangement made in view of the special relations with Seychelles" and is "yet another manifestation of India’s unwavering commitment to stand with Seychelles, in rain and in shine".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-indias-hcq-largesse-for-unsc-chair-71568

Eight new cases came to light in West Godavari district, six in Kurnool, four in Guntur district, and one in Krishna district.The development comes as states across grapple with a migrant crisis sparked by the lockdown. Migrants clashed with police in Mumbai on Tuesday demanding transport facilities to take them back home after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of extending the lockdown until May 3.The migrant crisis, first seen last month after Modi first announced lockdown in an attempt to slow the spread of coronavirus, has sparked fear of acceleration of the contagion. Several migrants died of exhaustion as they walked hundreds of kilometres to make their way back home.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-to-hold-construction-firms-responsible-for-migrants-on-state-roads-71567

The petitioner said these equipment should be given to sanitation workers.The PIL sought to highlight that safai karamcharis/sanitation workers are at the forefront in the fight against COVID-19 as they were providing essential services during the nationwide lockdown due to the pandemic.Last week, the Supreme Court had directed the government to ensure availability of appropriate personal protective equipment for all doctors, nurses and other health workers actively attending to COVID-19 patients in metro cities, tier-2 and tier-3 cities across India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid19-sc-refuses-to-entertain-pil-demanding-protective-gear-for-sanitation-workers-71566

15-04-2020||New Delhi||India to battle Covid with SCO members, Russia and China||After having initiated coordination within the SAARC neighbourhood, India will be looking to utilise the upcoming virtual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to further streamline the fight against Covid on a wider regional scale.The first SCO summit via teleconferencing will be attended by the likes of Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi, Imran Khan and heads of four Central Asian countries all of which are in the grip of Covid in varying degrees.For an organisation that covers three-fifths of the Eurasian continent and nearly half of the human population, sources expect SCO to contribute more significantly than SAARC to information sharing, exchanging best practices and smoothening out medical aid bottlenecks because of the presence of world’s three major net providers of pharmaceuticals, medical expertise and equipment in India, Russia and China, respectively.Sources did not expect the current deep freeze in India-Pakistan ties to be an inhibiting factor for Islamabad’s participation.In case of the SAARC virtual summit, Pakistan had opted to depute a junior official to attend a virtual summit that had heads of government of all other SAARC members.But in case of SCO, Pakistan has no such qualms. Sources pointed out that Indian Army’s general rank officer had attended the SCO working group meeting of defence and security experts in Islamabad in late February.This SCO virtual summit will hold more promise because it will be in an expanded format. Thus not just SCO part-timers like Iran and Afghanistan, also in need of succour from the epidemic, but others such as the World Health Organisation will also be invited to participate.  Nepal, which by right should join SCO as it is sandwiched between two members, Russia and India, may also get invited, thus brightening its chances of becoming a regular participant.For most countries, including India which has recently borrowed from the World Bank and the IMF, the SCO’s ability to provide a coordinated fiscal stimulus to the region is of great attraction.Sources said China has already offered to provide funds from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) if members came up with specific action plans on macroeconomic measures that have participation from the concerned country’s developmental financial institution.SCO is among the few regional organisations that had factored in pandemic as a threat to the existing order.In June 2018, the heads of the SCO countries had issued a statement on joint efforts against the threat of epidemics in SCO.And in December 2019, it resolved to regularly hold exercises to identify and learn to respond to sanitary and epidemiological emergencies, including by using mobile laboratories.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-battle-covid-with-sco-members-russia-and-china-71555

No non-essential service will be allowed in these districts and there will be entry and exit points to these districts where surveillance teams will keep records of people going in and out.In the 207 non-hotspot districts which are reporting few cases but have the potential to convert into hotspots, the Centre has asked states to start cluster containment work through active contact tracing and checking of people for pneumonia or influenza like illness.Even in green districts the Centre has asked states to look for people with respiratory distress and test them.As of today, India has 11,439 cases and 377 deaths with the Centre reiterating that there’s no community transmission in India yet and lockdown and containment strategy is meant to ensure infections are controlled and managed within the 377 districts and do not spread out.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/170-districts-in-india-declared-covid-hotspots-govt-asks-states-to-start-active-containment-71554

When objected upon by the accompanying doctor, the patient gathered a large number of other patients admitted in the ward and started threatening the doctors and staff on duty. The health care workers had to rush to the duty room and hide inside while all the time the patient with the mob tried to break open the door.The letter highlights the lack of security to doctors on duty and asks for an urgent deployment of armed policemen in coronavirus wards, action against security officers as well as against the floor in charge.Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain called the incident ‘indecent behaviour” and promised action.The incident occurred on the same day when reports said a relative of a coronavirus patient assaulted a junior doctor in Hyderabad.On April 1, a duty doctor and staff at Hyderabad’s Gandhi Hospital were allegedly attacked by a family member of a coronavirus patient who died during treatment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/doctor-on-coronavirus-duty-assaulted-in-delhi-health-minister-promises-action-71546

Wherever we find any problem, steps will be taken to ensure that the lockdown is imposed there, but that doesn’t mean shops would remain closed... We are keeping a close watch,” she had said.Dhankhar has been at loggerheads with the state government over a host of issues ever since taking office in July last year.

15-04-2020||Yash GoyalOur CorrespondentJaipur||Young architect designs 'Pandemic Sample Collection Unit' based on South Korea pattern||Based on South Korean pattern to safeguard health workers and doctors to deal with the COVID-19 patients, an Udaipur based young architect has designed a foolproof 'Sample Collection Unit' to create fast and effective temporary collection centres for throat and nose swabs.Neuberg Supratech Lab, an institution accredited for COVID-19 test, has approved it for making and usage.This unit will save and protect the person coming forward for the test, and the health workers and doctors collecting the samples.Anup Gupte, B. Arch and PG-Design Alumni of National Institute of Design Ahmedabad, told reporters on an interactive portal on Wednesday.The design envisions to formalize a temporary sample collection facility with 3 booths in a 40ft X 40ft areas.In this proposal, the doctor remains in isolation, away from people getting tested and hence the chances of contamination are minimized, according to Gupte. South Korean doctors have used it successfully, and so far no Indian company has designed it. He claimed. A manufacturing of complete unit would cost Rs.2.5 lakh, he estimated."I have sent a proposal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Ministers of the states including Rajasthan, and Collectors to pay attention on it as a few of manufacturing units are ready to build the booths free of cost to serve human suffering", he mentioned.As soon as the sample is collected, it is taken away by a health worker. Booth is disinfected and kit is replaced. While this disinfection is being done, the next person to be tested can enter the second booth and so on. This technique reduces inter-contamination of people getting tested. Additionally, the number of people to be tested increases tremendously, also reducing the number of PPE kit requirements. We need to design our infrastructure to be able to effectively win against this invisible enemy, he claimed.Neuberg Supratech Micropath Laboratory, a CAP and NABL accredited institute in Ahmedabad, have approved the design with a certificate. "It is a secure and protective COVID sample collection unit. It is systematic in design and does rule out the possibility of personnel involved in the collection of case samples to be completely isolated from the possibility of catching the highly contagious virus. At the same time it prevents cross-contamination to the cases coming to give the samples".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/young-architect-designs-pandemic-sample-collection-unit-based-on-south-korea-pattern-71540

Apart from an inter-state call centre for better coordination for movement of perishables like vegetables and fruits and agri-inputs like seeds, pesticides and fertilisers the government has announced a slew of measures to facilitate farmers and farming activities during the lockdown period. It has also initiated a dialogue with exporters of agri and allied commodities to address issues affecting the sector due the lockdown, especially availability and movement of labour, inter-state transport bottlenecks and shortage of raw materials.Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal held a video-conference to get first-hand account of problems faced by exporters and initiate steps in which exporters, representatives of associations of producers/exporters of fruits, vegetables, basmati and non-basmati rice, seeds, flowers, plants, organic produce, agriculture equipment and machinery participated.Majority of issues related to availability and movement of labour, inter-state transport bottlenecks, shortage of raw materials due to closure of ‘mandis’, closure of courier services thereby hampering movement of shipping documents, availability of freight services, access to ports/yards and clearance of goods for imports/exports.Industries relating to food processing, spices, cashew nuts and machine and equipment (M&E) sectors asked for permission to open/operate at least on 25-30% strength and committed proper health advisory in functioning. Internal transport is being addressed by the Home Ministry which has issued necessary directives, said officials, adding that issues pertaining to port and ocean freight services, courier services are also being considered for necessary resolution.Apart from a large population being engaged in farm activities, India is also a net exporter of agricultural and allied commodities. Its agricultural and allied exports during 2018-19 were Rs 2.73 lakh crore and the sector has always been positive in balance of trade, say officials. Agricultural exports help farmers/producers/exporters to take advantage of wider international market and increase their income.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supply-chain-%C2%A0agriculture-food-processing-and-rural-india-among-top-focus-areas-in-lockdown-guidelines-71513

15-04-2020||Mumbai/ Bengaluru||'How to make alcohol at home' trends as liquor prices soar amid coronavirus lockdown||Alcohol prices in India's grey market have more than quadrupled and online searches for how to make homemade alcohol have soared during India's nationwide coronavirus lockdown, with bars and liquor stores shut for weeks across most parts of the country.Many are turning to illegal liquor, say customs and police officials, who have seen a marked increase in seizures of hooch, which has in the past claimed thousands of lives among the poor unable to afford branded booze."I paid 700 rupees ($9) for a 170 rupees whisky bottle," said Manish, who was asked to visit a nearby milk shop in Mumbai at dawn to take delivery clandestinely."Many are willing to pay even higher prices for liquor, but can't get any. I was lucky as I at least got some," said Manish, who gave only his first name.Higher availability of disposable income and a burgeoning urban population has led to an increase in alcohol consumption in India over recent years.According to Google Trends, online searches for "how to make alcohol at home" peaked in India during the week of March 22-28, the same week Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed the nationwide lockdown.In late March, grey-market sellers were charging double the price, but premiums have been rising daily with liquor shops being sealed to prevent illegal sales, say, excise officials.India's lockdown has now been extended into early May as the number of virus cases crossed 10,000."Even habitual drinkers hold limited stocks which must have been exhausted by now. In coming weeks, more and more consumers will try to buy from the grey market," said an excise official from the western state of Maharashtra.As branded liquor prices have surged, some consumers such as Naresh, from the central Indian town of Indore, have been forced to drink homemade drinks, often known as "country liquor"."Even hooch is so expensive. In normal circumstances I could have bought branded liquor at this price," he said, declining to give his family name.More than a dozen consumers Reuters spoke to said a 180 ml hooch bottle was now selling at over 250 rupees, up from roughly 60 rupees. All declined to be fully identified.In the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, two people died last week after drinking home-brewed liquor, while five others were admitted to hospital in critical condition, police said.Liquor scarcity has also sparked break-ins at wine shops and fraud, with buyers conned into making online payments for liquor that never arrived, a police official in the city of Pune said.Local media have reported at least a dozen cases of suicide due to alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and at least two states in India's northeast have opted to reopen alcohol stores this week to address consumer demand."I feel good that (liquor) shops have opened today. I used to get bored at home as we were only sitting (at home) but now this (liquor) will entertain me," a customer who gave his name as Santosh said in Guwahati, Assam. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/how-to-make-alcohol-at-home-trends-as-liquor-prices-soar-amid-coronavirus-lockdown-71508

There is a need for proactive surveillance of zoonotic infections in bats. Such surveillance will provide leads for the development of diagnostic and help us prepare better for emergent viruses, thereby quickly containing them,” the ICMR said today.The research titled “Detection of coronaviruses in Pteropus and Rousettus species of bats from different states of India” comes when the world is battling Covid-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suspected to have a strong association with bats.Bats have been recognised as natural reservoirs of pathogenic viruses like rabies, Hendra, Marburg, Nipah and Ebola.They also harbour coronaviruses (CoVs), which have earlier been detected in bats in other Asia countries, Europe, Africa, North and South America and Australia.In the last two decades, bat coronaviruses have gained considerable attention as potential human pathogens. SARS-CoV-2 causing the current pandemic is also a member of this same genus (CoVs) and is found to be similar to certain bat-derived CoV strains. Related viruses have already been sampled in bat populations in China.The ICMR’s National Institute of Virology at Pune earlier found several viruses in bats, including Nipah virus in Pteropus medius.“Nipah viral RNA antibodies could be detected in Pteropus bats from many states and the possible link of transmission from bats could be established during the Nipah outbreak in Kerala in 2018 and 2019,” the ICMR says. This is the first time the ICMR has detected CoVs in Indian bats.

15-04-2020||---||Lockdown extended till May 3, migrants throng railway station||New Delhi, APRIL 14Extending the countrywide lockdown till May 3 as a measure to contain the spread of Covid-19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced a graded relaxation plan would come into force after April 20 in select areas subject to strict enforcement and benchmarks in the run-up.Also readWith the 21-day lockdown period approaching its end this midnight, PM Modi in his address to the nation said the extension suggestion came from all around. It was the collective strength and resolve of the people that was reflected in the fight against the global health pandemic and was a real tribute to the architect of the Constitution, BR Ambedkar, whose birth anniversary falls on April 14.He said that until April 20, every town, police station, district, would be evaluated on how much the lockdown was being followed and taking note of the extent to which the region protected itself from the virus. “Areas that will succeed in this litmus test, which will not be in the hotspot category, and will have less likelihood to turn into a hotspot, maybe allowed to open up to select necessary activities from April 20. However, keep in mind, this permission will be conditional, and the rules for going out will be very strict. Permission will be withdrawn immediately if lockdown rules are broken, and the spread of coronavirus risked. Hence, we must make sure we ourselves don’t become careless, not allow anyone else do so. A detailed guideline will be issued by the government tomorrow in this regard,” he said, adding that the limited exemptions were being given keeping in mind the livelihood of the poor and daily earners.He pressed for full wages for the workforce during the lockdown period.Explaining how the Centre remained ahead in taking steps to prevent the spread of the virus, he said that while it wasn’t appropriate to have comparisons with other countries, the rate of progression in India was far less than some countries that have greater resources and better health infrastructure.Attempting to blunt the criticism that India had delayed taking preventive steps, the PM said the country began screening at airports even before the first case was detected, started mandatory 14-day quarantine of those arriving in India before 100 people tested positive and declared a nationwide lockdown when 550 cases were recorded.Outlining seven steps each citizen should take against the spread of the virus, he advised all to take extra care of senior citizens, especially those with health ailments; follow social distancing and lockdown while using homemade face mask; download Aarogya Setu app; help the poor to the extent possible and take care of their food requirement; increase personal immunity; show empathy towards employees and do not remove them from work; and respect frontline warriors engaged in fighting the pandemic.Cane-charge at Bandra, Surat restive tooPM outlines 7 steps to tackle pandemicPM’s address hollow on specifics: CongNew Delhi: The Congress on Tuesday termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address a “rhetoric” and “hollow on specifics”, saying he should spell out the government's strategy to tackle Covid-19 and solve people’s problems, rather than talk of what he expected of them.Silicon Valley braces for layoffs, pay cutsThe Silicon Valley is bracing for a post-Covid period with layoffs, pay cuts and job freeze, according to top venture capitalist M Rangaswami.
