22-04-2020||New Delhi||Use rapid test kits for surveillance purpose, RT-PCR test a must: ICMR||A day after advising states not to use the newly distributed rapid testing kits to detect coronavirus infection for the next two days, the ICMR issued a protocol reiterating their usage for surveillance purpose while stating that RT-PCR tests must be continued vigorously as the principal diagnostic test for COVID-19.   In view of the issues raised by a few states about the rapid test kits, Additional Director General of Indian Council of Medical research (ICMR), Dr GS Toteja in his letter to Chief Secretaries of states and UTs on Wednesday said ICMR has always emphasised that RT-PCR test of throat and/or nasal swab is the confirmatory test for detection of COVID-19 at an early stage.It said that in its advisory dated April 17, the apex medical research body had clearly laid down the scope, purpose and usage of the rapid antibody tests.“I would like to reiterate that antibody rapid tests are largely to be used as a tool for surveillance with respect to formation of antibody in persons exposed to the virus,” Toteja said.He further said that globally also, the utility of this test is evolving and it is currently being used for detection of antibodies in individuals.“These test results are also dependent on field conditions. We have been given to understand that many states have procured such kits and on state request, ICMR has also arranged and made available rapid antibody test kits with a clear understanding that these kits cannot replace the RT-PCR test diagnosis for COVID-19 cases,” he said in his letter.“However, to further assist the state, ICMR will continue to collect data from various states to assess the scope and extent of utility of these rapid antibody tests in field conditions of our country and will keep advising the states on regular basis,” the letter added.He advised the states to follow the prescribed protocol for these tests and use it for the purpose for which these kits are meant.“It is reiterated that to contain coronavirus infection, RT-PCR tests must be continued vigorously as the principal diagnostic tests,” Toteja stated. At a press briefing held on Tuesday, Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at the ICMR, Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar, advised states to stop using the rapid antibody test kits procured from China for the next two days till it examines their quality in the wake of complaints that they are not fully effective.He also said the companies which supplied the kits will be asked to replace them if the kits are found to be faulty. “High variations ranging from 6 to 71 per cent have been reported between the results of the rapid tests and RT-PCR tests. We will advise states not to use these testing kits for the next two days,” he had said.These kits will be tested and validated in the field by teams from our eight institutes after which we will issue a clear-cut advisory for the states, Gangakhedkar had said.Last week, India procured five lakh rapid antibody test kits from two Chinese firms and they were distributed to several states reporting rising cases of coronavirus infection. The Rajasthan Government on Tuesday said the kits were giving out inaccurate results. At present, the government uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect coronavirus from throat or nasal swab samples of people. These take around five to six hours to show the results. In the rapid antibody tests, the blood samples of suspected patients are taken, and it normally takes around 15-30 minutes to give the result.The government has recommended the use of rapid antibody tests in hotspot areas.According to the ICMR protocol, officials said only those showing symptoms of influenza-like illness such as fever, cough and cold for seven days or more in hotspot areas should be made to undergo a rapid antibody test.Those who will be found positive must be quarantined at least for seven days and contract tracing should be initiated. Those who test negative should also remain under home quarantine for at least seven days.“The RT-PCR test should be performed to confirm diagnosis of COVID-19 if clinical suspicion is high,” an official had said.The death toll due to COVID-19 rose to 652 and the number of cases climbed to 20,471 in the country on Wednesday, registering an increase of 49 deaths and 1,486 cases since Tuesday evening, according to the Union Health Ministry.

22-04-2020||New Delhi||Govt cuts subsidy rates for individual nutrients of non-urea fertilisers||The Centre on Wednesday slashed the subsidy rates for individual nutrients of non-urea fertilisers, but said the overall subsidy outgo would still be higher in the current fiscal by an estimate 5-7 per cent.A decision in this regard was taken at the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“The CCEA has given its approval for fixation of nutrient-based subsidy (NBS) rates for phosphatic and potassic (P&K) fertilisers for 2020-21. The expected expenditure for release of subsidy on P&K fertilisers during 2020-21 will be Rs 22,186.55 crore,” Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar told the media.There is a 5-7 per cent increase in the subsidy amount, he said.The subsidy for nitrogen has been reduced to Rs 18.78 per kg, phosphorous at Rs 14.88 per kg, potash at Rs 10.11 per kg and sulphur at Rs 2.37 per kg for the current financial year, the fertiliser ministry said in a statement.For 2019-20, the subsidy for nitrogen was fixed at Rs 18.90 per kg, phosphorous at Rs 15.21 per kg, potash at Rs 11.12 per kg and sulphur at Rs 3.56 per kg. And, the expected expenditure was Rs 22,875 crore during 2019-20.The CCEA also approved the inclusion of a complex fertiliser namely ammonium phosphate (NP 14:28:0:0) under the NBS scheme.In 2010, the government had launched the nutrient-based subsidy (NBS) programme under which a fixed amount of subsidy, decided on an annual basis, is provided on each grade of subsidised phosphatic and potassic (P&K) fertilisers, except for urea, based on the nutrient content present in them.Retail prices of non-urea fertilisers such as Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP), Muriate of Potash (MoP) and NPK are decontrolled and are determined by manufacturers, while Centre gives a fixed subsidy each year.The government is making available fertilisers, namely urea and 21 grades of P&K fertilisers to farmers at subsidised prices through manufacturers/importers.In case of urea, the government fixes the maximum retail price (MRP). The difference between the production cost and the MRP is reimbursed to manufacturers. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-cuts-subsidy-rates-for-individual-nutrients-of-non-urea-fertilisers-74663

22-04-2020||Vibha Sharma||Earth Day: India reminds developed nations of 'broken promises'||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 22Stating that sustainable development cannot be achieved in isolation, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar today told developed nations to fulfil their promises on technology transfer and monetary help for adaptation and mitigation as promised in climate change agreements and conferences.India stands committed to achieving its targets on renewable energy, carbon sinks and reducing emissions but they (developed nations) must also be taken to task on “broken promises”, Environment Minister said speaking on the occasion of the 2020 Earth Day: Impact of Covid-19 on climate action.“The biggest hurdle to sustainable development is broken promises. If you (developed nations) are not helping the poor and continuing without changing your existing lifestyles you cannot achieve sustainable development,” Javadekar said, adding that India will raise the issue of “broken promises” at the upcoming Petersberg Climate Dialogue.“The pandemic has shown that the World needs to think over the way we are living.  We need to think what we live and what we are living for,” he said talking of the “environment friendly Indian lifestyle and its response to the pandemic which has shown the World how to move ahead”.“People have realised the importance of sustainable development in past one month when they saw clean rivers, green flora and fauna, clean skies, stars in the skies and from Jalandhar Himalayas and many other things. That is how we used to live in villages, when we created cities because of our needs and increasing populations“Let us understand we cannot be too romantic on this. If we want everything to be clean, green, blue then you have to stop a few things. You cannot have vehicles, you cannot have industries, you will have to go back to your olds days of village but then you can sustain only 30 crore people and not 130 crore people that also we must understand and think of it in holistic manner.     “It is the choice earlier generation has made, it is now part of history. Our challenge is to make environment sustainable even in these circumstances,” he said evoking PM Narendra Modi’s  stress on lifestyle and climate justice.Taking on the developed nations, in particular America and Europe, Javadekar said India’ power consumption was just 1,000 units per year per person in comparison to 12,000 units per year per person in the US.“We have only 25 cars per 1,000 population in comparison to the West which has 400 to 600.  What America and Europe have done is they have exported their pollutions to China and other countries so that they get clean goods and someone else gets blamed.“But I can say with confidence that it is the consumer who is responsible for pollution and not the producer. We have to have sustainable lifestyle as a core value.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/earth-day-india-reminds-developed-nations-of-broken-promises-74647

The scheme is effective from December 1, 2018.From December 1, 2019, release of benefits is done only through Aadhaar seeded data of beneficiaries uploaded by the State/UT governments on the PM-KISAN portal, except in case of the states of Assam and Meghalaya and the UTs of J&K and Ladakh, which have been given exemption from this requirement till March 31, 2020, as Aadhaar penetration there has been miniscule, the government said.The total number of beneficiary farmers in these States and UTs, who have been paid at least one instalment as on April 8, 2020 are 27,09,586  in Assam, 98,915 in Meghalaya and 10,01,668 in J&K, including Ladakh, the government said in the statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aadhaar-seeding-norms-for-pm-kisan-relaxed-in-jk-ladakh-assam-meghalaya-74635

The police personnel on duty are not considering the I-cards issued by the hospitals or by even the government. For making passes from District Magistrate Uttar Pradesh, the internet site is showing error after filling data. In fact in the category for which passes to be issued, nurses are not included as they were allowed by showing their I-card till date”. She further added, “If the nurses are not allowed to cross the border then how will the hospitals and other COVID health facilities function because a large number of nurses reside in Noida, Greater Noida, Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Gurugram, Palwal and Sonipat, etc.” “Yesterday (Tuesday) UP Police stopped all the cars whether they are driven by nurses themselves or by their family members, who come to drop or pick up for duty. The same behaviour is shown to doctors and other health personnel. Nurses are standing on the border and not allowed to cross even after showing their own I-cards along with COVID duty pass.”The letter said, “This is a very urgent situation and needs your special attention to address this issue in no time.” The federation has demanded from Shah to intervene in the matter and said that proper policy should be laid down in such a manner that nurses and their family members (Who come to pick and drop) are allowed to cross the border.The copy of the letter has also been sent to Union and Delhi Health Ministry officials and Director General of DGHS.  IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stuck-at-delhi-up-haryana-borders-nurses-write-to-home-minister-amit-shah-74630

22-04-2020||Lucknow||AMU doctor suspended for negligence, 46 medical staff sent to quarantine||Following the death of Aligarh’s first COVID-19 patient on Tuesday, the negligence of a doctor of Aligarh Muslim University’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College has forced 46 staff members of the hospital, including 16 doctors, to be quarantined.The doctor, Anjum Mirza Chugtai, was instrumental in getting a suspected 55-year old COVID-19 patient with breathing problems admitted to the AMU hospital’s general trauma ward late on Sunday night. Later, he tested positive and succumbed to the disease.AMU registrar Abdul Hamid has suspended the Dr Chugtai, an assistant professor in the department of medicine with immediate effect for “negligence in duty and violating the COVID 19 protocol”.According to AMU’s Public Relations in-charge Shafey Kidwai, Dr Chugtai has been suspended and a case of misconduct and negligence has been made out against him. A departmental enquiry has also been instituted.Sources claim that Dr Chugtai had got the suspected COVID-19 patient admitted to the hospital’s general Trauma ward exposing the other doctors, medical staff, and patients to the virus.After nearly an hour, the suspected COVID-19 patient was shifted to the hospital’s special isolation ward where he tested positive for the deadly disease. He succumbed to the disease becoming the first COVID-19 death in the district.According to Kidwai, Dr Chugtai was not on duty at the university’s medical college at the time of admission late on Sunday. However, he put pressure on a junior resident to admit the suspected COVID-19 patient in the general Trauma ward.Sources claim that Dr Chugtai had been attending the patient in a private nursing home for several days and had referred him to the AMU hospital only when his condition had worsened.During his treatment at the private nursing home, Dr Chugtai had even referred the patient to a private diagnostic centre for a chest X-ray. Since then the Aligarh administration has cancelled the license of the diagnostic centre.Aligarh district magistrate Chandra Bhushan has also sent a notice to the JLN Medical College to explain how the patient was admitted to the general emergency instead of the isolation facility.Similarly, on April 14 in Lucknow’s King George Medical University at least 65 staff members of the Trauma Centre had to be put under institutional quarantined after a 64-year old patient they were treating was tested positive for COVID 19 and later died.Of them, 13 were resident doctors and 52 were nurses and paramedics. Here also a senior doctor had put pressure on the Trauma centre resident doctors to admit the suspected COVID 19 patient to the general emergency.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amu-doctor-suspended-for-negligence-46-medical-staff-sent-to-quarantine-74623

They should stay at home, release a grant of Rs.1 lakh crore to meet the exigency on account of pandemic coronavirus, and resolve the migration of Rajasthan's labourers' stuck in other states, Gehlot suggested the IMCT members.  "The state government had ordered 31,000 and got 10000 kits.

22-04-2020||New Delhi||Coronavirus pandemic: West Bengal writes to MHA, assures cooperation to Central teams||The West Bengal government has said “it is not a fact” that there was no cooperation with the Central team deputed to assess the COVID-19 situation in the state and gave an assurance that it will abide by all Union government orders on lockdown.The assurance came hours after the Centre accused the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government of obstructing a Central team deputed to assess the coronavirus ground situation.In a letter to Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla, West Bengal Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha said it was not a fact that the two Inter Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) have not been provided with any cooperation by the state government since he had two meetings with one team and also was in touch with the other.“This is to convey my highest assurances for the implementation of the orders of central government issued under the Disaster Management Act as well as the directions of the Honb’le Supreme Court,” the state chief secretary told the union home secretary.A home ministry spokesperson welcomed the West Bengal government’s assurance of cooperation to the two visiting teams.The West Bengal chief secretary sent the letter Tuesday night, hours after the central government had directed the state government not to obstruct working of the two central teams.The Centre had also accused the West Bengal government of not cooperating with the central teams and also said that the state government was specifically restraining the teams from interacting with health workers and touring the affected areas.The West Bengal chief secretary wrote: “It is not a fact that the IMCT has not been provided with any cooperation by the state government”.“In fact the teams had arrived without any prior consultation with us and, therefore, there was neither such opportunity to provide any logistic support as envisaged in the order dated April 19 nor the team asked for any help,” he said.The chief secretary said the team, visiting Kolkata and nearby districts, went to the BSF guest house in Kolkata and the team, which is visiting Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and Kalimpong, went to the SSB guest house in Siliguri on their own.“In this connection, this is to inform that the IMCT in Kolkata led by Apurva Chandra met me in my office on April 20 and had an interaction about the implementation of lockdown measures and other efforts of the state government to contain and combat COVID-19.“I am also in touch with Vineet Joshi of IMCT at Siliguri and have apprised him of the steps taken by the state government along with sharing of our reports on mail,” Sinha said.He also said that he had another meeting with the team in Kolkata on April 21 at their place of stay at the BSF mess, Kolkata and shared the up to date reports.         “They are visiting different parts of the city to make an on the spot assessment of the implementation of the lockdown measures” the chief secretary said.Sinha also referred to his telephonic discussions with Bhalla on April 21 and highlighted “the pro-active steps taken by the state government for effective implementation of lockdown measures to contain the spread of COVID-19”.A total of six IMCTs have been deputed to Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and West Bengal to review the implementation of the lockdown measures after making on-spot assessment of the situation prevailing in identified select districts.Two of these teams have been sent to West Bengal—one team to Kolkata, Howrah, North 24 Parganas and East Medinipur and the other team to Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and Kalimpong.The first team was led by Chandra while the second team was led by Joshi, both additional secretary-rank officers in the central government.The teams comprise public health specialists and officers of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), whose expertise can be leveraged by the state government for management of COVID-19 pandemic.The teams were deputed under the authority conferred on the Central Government under Section 35 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 which states that “…the central government shall take all such measures as it deems necessary or expedient for the purpose of Disaster Management”.Bhalla, in his Tuesday’s letter, also quoted a recent Supreme Court observation that the state governments will faithfully comply with the directives and orders issued by the Union of India in letter and spirit in the interest of public safety.     The said observations of the Apex Court, the home secretary said, must be treated as directions and faithfully complied with.The home ministry had on Monday said COVID-19 situation is “especially serious” in Mumbai, Pune, Indore, Jaipur, Kolkata and a few other places in West Bengal, and violation of lockdown measures risk the spread of the novel Coronavirus.West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress, however, dubbed the visit of the central teams as “adventure tourism” and asked why such delegations were not sent to states with much higher numbers of infections and hotspots.TMC MPs Derek O’Brien and Sudip Bandyopadhyay on Tuesday claimed that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was informed about the teams’ visit three hours after their arrival in the state, which they said was unacceptable.

22-04-2020||New Delhi||'Virtual wedding' a hit in the times of coronavirus||Avinash and Kirti had an online wedding on April 14 which was virtually attended by 80 of their close friends and relatives. They also held an online mehendi, and a sangeet ceremony apart from the marriage which was performed according to the Hindu custom wherein a 'pandit' (priest) was chanting Hindu matras while being connected on a video call.The lockdown has forced many couples to postpone their weddings planned for March and April. But those who hold their fixed wedding date close to their heart and want to get married on the same date amid this nation shutdown are not hesitant to try the idea of 'virtual wedding'."We had a grand wedding planned in Satna, Madhya Pradesh, with over 8,000 expected guests. But things got changed a bit. We did not want our wedding to go beyond April. So we thought of an online wedding. We had a proper Hindu marriage but online. And we are happy about it," said Avinash.Mumbai-based Sushen and Kirti from Bareily also had an arranged marriage online on April 19. Sushen said: "Even if the lockdown gets lifted in the next few days, I doubt we will be allowed to organise a social gathering like a marriage anytime soon. We did not want to wait for our wedding. And being responsible citizens, we felt this was one way to maintain social distance and at the same time making sure that we had all the fun like a typical wedding. So it was like an entire party we had online. It was a really cool idea and being a part of it is much more exciting to us." Their weddings were facilitated by Shaadi.com who has introduced 'Wedding from Home' service to help couple tie the knot by making arrangements for all the online ceremonies even during the time of coronavirus when social distancing is the need of the hour. Adhish Zaveri, Director - Marketing, Shaadi.com, said: "There is no greater act than getting two people married. We realized that there are a lot of people who have planned their wedding during this period and the fact that we won't be able to do it was very disheartening for them. We decided that even if you can't be there in person, you can tie the knot virtually. That is something we can take very seriously and try to make it as close to a real wedding." It starts with sending out e-invites for guests, followed by mehendi ceremony where we have a mehendi artiste takes online tutorial. We have make-up artiste who teaches the bride how you can get the bridal look at the comfort of your house. Overall grooming tips are taught virtually. Finally, we have a 'panditji' who performs all the wedding rituals.Twelve Muslim couples in Madhya Pradesh also entered into wedlock on April 17, despite the lockdown, through video conference. Reformist Muslims have been organizing mass marriages at Guna every April for some years now. Just as the coronavirus crisis seemed to disrupt this year's schedule, the Sheher Qazi of Guna offered to conduct the 'nikah' online. All the 12 grooms and brides offered their consent to the marriage on a video call. In less than an hour, they were married without stepping out of their homes.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/virtual-wedding-a-hit-in-the-times-of-coronavirus-74577

"If the central government feels the coronavirus spread will be more from April 30 till May 15, it should consider if the stranded labourers can be sent back to their homes before that. If it is possible, guidelines in this regard should be issued," Thackeray said.The Centre should consider if the stranded labourers can be monitored "end-to-end" and quarantined after they reach their homes to ensure there is no spread of the coronavirus, Thackeray said, and urged the Union government to take a timely decision.                The chief minister said 80 per cent of the coronavirus patients in the state are asymptomatic and wondered what could be the reason for it.He also expressed the need to study what steps are being taken in Dubai to contain the disease.  "We all know what is happening in the US, but need to study what steps are being taken in Dubai. The coronavirus entered Maharashtra through these two places," he said.Thackeray also reiterated the demand for more personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators and other medical equipment from the Centre. He also sought the Centre's guidance for construction of hospitals by the Army on war-footing, if needed.Thackeray also sought relaxation of central government rules to provide food grains to those who don't have a ration cards.

22-04-2020||Washington||Trump suspends issuing of new green cards for 60 days||President Donald Trump has said that he will halt the issuing of the new green cards or legal permanent residency for the next 60 days as part of his executive order to temporarily suspend immigration into the US.Trump, however, said on Tuesday that the move will not have any impact on those entering the country on a temporary basis.As per the existing law, the US can issue a maximum of 1,40,000 employment-based green cards every year with a per country cap of seven per cent.Accordingly, in fiscal year 2019, Indian nationals received 9,008 category 1 (EB1), 2,908 category 2 (EB2), and 5,083 category 3 (EB3) green cards. EB1-3 are different categories of employment-based green cards.Many have interpreted that those on non-immigrant work visas like the much sought-after H-1B, popular among Indian professionals, issued mainly to foreign technology professionals will not be impacted. The seasonal immigrant workers for agricultural purposes too will not be impacted.In any case, the executive order to be signed by Trump on Wednesday will impact a large number of tens and thousands of Indian-Americans, who are waiting to get a Green Card. This is expected to further delay the process."We must first take care of the American worker... This pause will be in effect for 60 days, after which need for any extension or modification will be evaluated by myself and a group of people based on economic conditions at the time," Trump told reporters at his daily White House news conference on coronavirus."This order will only apply to individuals seeking a permanent residency, in other words, those receiving green cards, big factor, will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis," he asserted.Without elaborating, he said, that there will be exemptions."Some people will be able to get in. We have to do that, obviously, even from a humane standpoint," he said."We have a solemn duty to ensure these unemployed Americans regain their jobs and their livelihoods. Therefore, in order to protect American workers, I will be issuing a temporary suspension of immigration into the United States."You heard about that last night. By pausing immigration, we'll help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens," he said.It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labour flown in from abroad, he asserted.Trump said, moving forward, his administration will examine what additional immigration related measures should be put in place to protect US workers."We want to protect our US workers, and I think as we move forward, we will become more and more protective of them," he said, indicating that more such measures were being prepared.As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, more than 22 million American workers have applied for unemployment benefits, which is a record in itself.In the coming weeks, several more millions are expected to be laid off as the US economy is in tatters.Trump said that this pause on new immigration will also help to conserve vital medical resources for American citizens."A short break from new immigration, depending on the time we're talking about, will protect the solvency of our healthcare system and provide relief to jobless Americans," he said.Responding to questions, Trump explained that he has to take this unprecedented measure because of the massive impact that coronavirus is having on the US economy."The last thing we want to do is take American workers' jobs. It's one thing when we were at essentially--they used to call it full employment and it's another thing right now,” he said."Right now, we have people that have lost their jobs and we hope they're going to come back and come back fast and then we can have an even deeper discussion. But right now, we have to have jobs for Americans,” he asserted. According to a recent report by Congressional Research Service (CRS), currently there are almost 1 million lawfully present foreign workers and their family members waiting to receive a green card.This employment-based backlog is projected to double by financial year 2030."Under current law, and owing to a limited number of green card issuances, the current backlog of 568,414 Indian nationals would require an estimated 195 years to disappear,” CRS said.

22-04-2020||New York||Facebook buying 9.99 pc stake in Jio for Rs 43,574 cr||It's official. Social media and tech giant Facebook is pouring in Rs 43,574 crore for a 9.99 per cent stake in India's oil-retail-telecom conglomerate Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) led Jio Platforms -- the largest investment for a minority stake by a technology company anywhere in the world and the largest FDI in the Indian tech sector, according to an RIL statement on Wednesday."This investment by Facebook values Jio Platforms at Rs 4.62 lakh crore ($65.95 billion) pre-money enterprise value, agreed at a conversion rate of Rs 70 to a US Dollar. Facebook's investment will translate into a 9.99% equity stake in Jio Platforms on a fully diluted basis," RIL said.RIL chairman and managing director and Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani said "the synergy between Jio and Facebook will help realise Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 'Digital India' Mission with its two ambitious goals -- 'Ease of Living' and 'Ease of Doing Business' -- for every single category of Indian people without exception"."I want to thank Mukesh Ambani and the entire Jio team for their partnership. We're looking forward to getting started," Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his personal Facebook page. In USD terms, Facebook's chief revenue officer values the investment at $5.7 billion.The digital transformation of India's neighbourhood grocers or 'kirana' stores occupies a central role in the early outcomes expected from the Facebook-Jio deal."Concurrent" with the latest development, RIL's statement confirmed that Jio Platforms, Reliance Retail and WhatsApp are working together to turbocharge Reliance Retail's JioMart platform connecting 'kirana' shops to customers, enabling home delivery over Jio's mobile interface.RIL hopes to leverage the power of complementary platforms across Jio and Facebook "especially" to modernise India's small businesses."Our focus will be India's 60 million micro, small and medium businesses, 120 million farmers, 30 million small merchants and millions of small and medium enterprises in the informal sector," RIL said.Jio Platforms, wholly-owned by Reliance Industries Limited, brings together Jio's digital apps, ecosystems and a high speed connectivity platform under one umbrella.For Facebook, the deal with Jio allows it to wade deeper into the Indian market where its WhatsApp messaging platform alone has 400m users. India is home to some of Facebook's most thriving communities on WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram.Facebook daily active users (DAU) in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines have been key sources of growth for the company. Facebook DAUs were 1.66 billion on average for December 2019. This number excludes users on WhatsApp and Instagram.Launched in 2016 with free voice calls and cheap data, Reliance Jio has upended Indian telecoms and risen to become the country's leading telecom operator with 388 million subscribers at last count. Three in 5 smartphone users in India are now on the Jio network.Speculating on the likely deal a month ago, a Financial Times report said "Mukesh Ambani's Reliance has emerged as the only Indian company capable of competing with US tech groups in the fast-growing Indian market, expanding from mobile telecoms into everything from home broadband to ecommerce." RIL's core business is oil refining and it runs the world's biggest oil refining complex in Jamnagar. The company is also India's largest retailer with over 10,000 stores selling everything from groceries and consumer electronics to apparel, Jio is India's largest mobile telecom operator in barely three years since launch.RIL posted a record quarterly profit in results released January. Retail and telecom topline rose more than 25 per cent in the December quarter."In the post-Corona era, I am confident of India's economic recovery and resurgence in the shortest period of time. The partnership between WhatsApp and Jio will surely make an important contribution to this transformation," Ambani said.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/facebook-buying-9-99-pc-stake-in-jio-for-rs-43-574-cr-74556

It lay in a morgue, hundreds of kilometres away in Delhi.Crippled by poverty and the Covid lockdown, Sunil’s family in Dumrikhurd village under the Chauri Chaura police station area was forced to conduct a dummy funeral for him, setting an effigy on fire.The family did not have the money to get the body of the 38-year-old transported from Delhi and the lockdown made it almost impossible for them to travel to conduct the last rites there.The body will be cremated in Delhi on Wednesday after a postmortem, Chauri Chaura Sub Divisional Magistrate Arpit Gupta said.Sunil’s contractor called the family in Gorakhpur on April 11, telling them that Sunil was sick with “chechak”, a possible reference to measles.“We tried calling Sunil, but he never answered the phone, as he was in hospital,” his father Radheyshyam said.A policeman called from Sunil’s phone on April 14, telling them that he had died, his parents said.“We were not able to bring back the body as the charges were Rs 25,000 and we can’t pay such a big amount.” His wife Poonam sent a letter through SDM Arpit Gupta to Delhi Police, asking them to conduct a postmortem and the cremation.And last Thursday, the family conducted the “cremation” back home, with Sunil’s son lighting the pyre, the parents said.“The entire village is in a state of shock after the family performed the dummy cremation,” Gupta said.The local administration has raised Rs 75,000 and deposited the amount in his wife’s bank account and provided the family with groceries, he said.“We will also provide free education to the children of the deceased,” Gupta said. He had five children – four daughters and a son.

According to ISSF, after the qualification period ends, quotas can be allocated on the basis of rankings to athletes by name. Karnal shooter Bhanwala, 17, had won gold in the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in 2018.“After the qualification period ends and all member federations/NOCs (National Olympic Committees) receive the official List of Quota Places, the ISSF will check each individual Olympic Event World Ranking List (dated May 31, 2020) in the order of the events listed in the distribution table starting with AR60, FR3X40 etc,” ISSF disclosed.“The highest ranked athlete not yet qualified in any event and provided that the athlete’s NOC does not have a quota place in that specific event, then the athlete will obtain one quota place. These quota places are allocated to the athletes by name,” it added.But there is a catch — this quota place cannot be passed on to another shooter from the same country. So if Bhanwala does get the quota, only he would be entitled to represent India. If he can’t participate due to any reason, there will be no Indian representation in the 25m Rapid Fire discipline at next year’s Tokyo Olympics.National Rifle Association of India president Raninder Singh confirmed that India has a good chance of getting a quota place in the 25m Rapid Fire discipline.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/haryana-teen-likely-to-get-olympics-quota-74496

Social distancing norms were followed at the ceremony.Among the new entrants in the Cabinet, two ex-Congress MLAs Tulsi Silawat and Govind Singh Rajput, are supporters of former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, who along with 22 MLAs, including six ministers, quit the Congress last month to join the BJP. The other ministers who took oath are Narottam Mishra (Brahmin), Meena Singh (Scheduled Tribe) and Kamal Patel (OBC), all sitting BJP MLAs.The 15-month-old Congress government headed by Kamal Nath collapsed last month after 22 MLAs of the then ruling party — supporters of Scindia — revolted and resigned, paving the way for the BJP to assume power in the key central state where the saffron party had narrowly lost polls in 2018. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chouhan-expands-cabinet-rewards-2-congress-rebels-74495

Eighty nine per cent of those surveyed say they have not been paid any wages since the lockdown,” Bhushan said.The government said it will pay Rs 5,000 to construction workers.

We advise the states should suspend the use of rapid antibody tests for two days. After two days we will issue an advisory and if need be, we would go in for replacement of faulty kits,” ICMR scientist Raman Gangakhedkar said as the country’s case count reached 18,985 with 603 deaths and 3,259 cured.India had recently imported five lakh rapid test kits from two Chinese firms.After West Bengal and Rajasthan reported inaccuracies in test results, the ICMR said it had consulted three more states and decided to test the kits for their sensitivity and efficiency.“We received a complaint from one state yesterday that rapid kits were leading to lesser detections. So today we sought feedback from three states. The kits are displaying massive variations in results, which is not good. We are seeing that positive samples of RT-PCR, the standard test for Covid, are showing huge variations when tested by rapid antibody test kits and the variations range 6 to 71 per cent,” Gangakhedkar said.Earlier when the ICMR tested the kits in Delhi, it found results to be positive in 71 per cent cases where the results were positive from RT-PCR tests. The ICMR had clarified rapid kits were only to determine trends of the disease in areas and not for specific diagnosis. “The gold standard test for Covid is RT-PCR, which uses throat and nasal swabs samples. Rapid kits use blood samples,” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/icmr-halts-rapid-tests-for-2-days-to-verify-chinese-kits-74408

The drug works by boosting body immunity. Our immune response system has two arms — Th1 and Th2. The first arm Th1 consists of cells that offer specific and strong response to infections while Th2 offers non-specific immune response.“Mycobacterium w boosts the body’s Th1 cells, improving the immune capacity.
