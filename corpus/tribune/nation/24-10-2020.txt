The whole country is proud of you,” he said.The defence minister also talked about the rich history of the Trishakti Corps.“The Trishakti Corps has a great golden history. Especially in 1962, 1967, 1971 and 1975, this Corps demonstrated examples of valour. It has been excellent,” he said.“I extend my best wishes to all of you and your family for the festival of Vijayadashami,” the defence minister’s office tweeted quoting him as saying.Officials said Singh will perform ‘Shastra puja’(worship of weapons) at Sherathang area in Sikkim on Sunday morning on the occasion of Dussehra.The defence minister had performed ‘Shastra Puja’ in the French port city of Bordeaux during Dussehra last year as he was on a bilateral visit to the country then.Singh has been performing ‘Shastra Puja’ during Dussehra for the last several years including during his tenure as the Union Home Minister in the previous NDA government.Almost all formations of the Indian Army along the LAC are on a very high-level of alert in view of the border row with China in eastern Ladakh.India and China are locked in an over five-month-long bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh that has significantly strained their ties.Both sides held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the row.

24-10-2020||New Delhi||Govt waives interest on interest for loans up to Rs 2 crore||In a relief to borrowers at the onset of the festive season, the government on late Friday night announced waiver of interest on interest for loans up to Rs 2 crore irrespective of whether moratorium was availed or not.The Department of Financial Services came out with operational guidelines in the backdrop of Supreme Court’s direction to implement the interest waiver scheme, which is likely to cost the exchequer Rs 6,500 crore.The apex court on October 14 directed the Centre to implement “as soon as possible” interest waiver on loans of up to Rs 2 crore under the RBI moratorium scheme in view of the COVID-19 pandemic saying the common man’s Diwali is in the government’s hands.As per the guidelines, the scheme can be availed by borrowers in specified loan accounts for a period from March 1 to August 31, 2020.“Borrowers who have loan accounts having sanctioned limits and outstanding amount of not exceeding Rs 2 crore (aggregate of all facilities with lending institutions) as on February 29 shall be eligible for the scheme,” it said.As per the eligibility criteria mentioned in the guidelines, the accounts should be standard as on February 29 which means that it should not be Non-Performing Asset (NPA).Housing loan, education loans, credit card dues, auto loans, MSME loans, consumer durable loans and consumption loans are covered under the scheme.As per the scheme, the lending institutions shall credit the difference between compound interest and simple interest with regard to the eligible borrowers in respective accounts for the said period irrespective of whether the borrower fully or partially availed the moratorium on repayment of loan announced by the RBI on March 27, 2020.The scheme is also applicable on those who have not availed the moratorium scheme and continued with the repayment of loans.The lending institutions after crediting the amount will claim the reimbursement from the central government.                 Hearing the matter on October 14, the Supreme Court observed that it was concerned about how the benefit of interest waiver would be given to borrowers and said the Centre has taken a “welcome decision” by taking note of plight of the common man, but authorities have not issued any order in this regard.“Something concrete has to be done,” a bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan had said, adding, “Benefits of waivers to borrowers up to Rs 2 crore must be implemented as soon as possible.”                  The top court, which posted the matter for hearing on November 2, told the advocates appearing for the Centre and banks that “Diwali is in your hand”.The Centre recently told the apex court that going any further than the fiscal policy decisions already taken, such as waiver of compound interest charged on loans of up to Rs 2 crore for six months moratorium period, may be “detrimental” to the overall economic scenario, the national economy and banks may not take “inevitable financial constraints”.The top court is hearing a batch of petitions which have raised issues concerning the six-month loan moratorium period announced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.The bench, also comprising Justices R S Reddy and M R Shah, said when authorities have decided something then it has to be implemented.

24-10-2020||New Delhi||BJP politicising Hoshiarpur rape-murder due to Bihar polls: Congress||The Congress on Saturday accused the BJP of showing insensitivity towards the Hoshiarpur rape victim and said the ruling party was politicising the issue due to Bihar elections.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said that unlike the Uttar Pradesh government, the Punjab government was not denying that the girl was raped and it was not blocking justice.He said if they did, he would go there and fight for justice too.“Unlike in UP, the governments of Punjab and Rajasthan are not denying that the girl was raped, threatening her family and blocking the course of justice. If they do, I will go there to fight for justice,” he tweeted.Asking top BJP ministers Nirmala Sitharaman, Prakash Javadekar and Harsh Vardhan where they were during the Hathras incident, Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev said they were only raking up the Punjab rape case for political gains in Bihar.“I hope that Nirmala Sithraman ji will stop displaying insensitivity towards a sensitive issue like this. Don’t politicise it. The nation understands that you have suddenly woken up from your deep sleep because Bihar is in election mode.“Your party, your leaders, your prime minister do not see beyond elections and that’s why, all of a sudden, you have decided to make Hoshiarpur an issue,” she told reporters.Drawing a distinction between Hathras and Hoshiarpur rape cases, she said while the Opposition parties felt the need to visit the Hathras victim’s family due to the insensitivity of the Uttar Pradesh government, “they may not feel the same need in the case of Punjab”.She claimed that Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and the state DGP are personally looking into the matter and have already invoked sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act (POCSO), besides standing with the victim’s family.She said the Chief Minister has insisted on exemplary punishment.The Punjab State Women’s Commission and the SC Commission have taken cognisance and asked for a report from the SSP in the case, she said, claiming that the UP government did not even register an FIR for the offence of rape and intimidated the victim’s family in the Hathras case.Speaking after the BJP attacked the Congress asking why Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had not visited Hoshiarpur like they had Hathras, Dev asked if anyone can accuse the Punjab government of threatening the victim’s family like the UP government did.“Another reason why opposition leaders felt the need to visit Hathras and not Punjab is that the additional director general of UP said there is no rape in the Hathras case. Can anybody say that the Punjab Police or any police officer in Punjab is denying rape? In fact POCSO has been invoked,” she said.The Mahila Congress chief said while Uttar Pradesh beat up media people, Punjab has not tried to hush up this case.“Where were you Nirmala Sitharaman ji, when BJP leaders in Hathras were rallying with the accused and victim-shaming Hathras’ daughter who was killed so brutally? Where were you, why were you silent,” she asked, asserting that she was “appalled, disgusted and disheartened to see the finance minister spend a lot of time to raise the issue.Separately, Rahul Gandhi attacked the government on economic issues and tweeted, “Our PM teaches India how to run from the truth. Millions of people have lost their dignity and livelihoods as a result.” He cited media reports quoting the RBI Monetary Policy Committee meeting saying that it may take years to regain the lost GDP.

Kishan Reddy made the announcement in his address at the 59th Raising Day function, in Greater Noida, of the ITBP—one of the seven Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) under the Ministry of Home Affairs and responsible to guard 3,488 km India-China border.The Minister also said that 28 types of new vehicles have been provided to the ITBP, which has been allotted a budget of Rs 7,223 crore.In his address, Reddy said that Indian culture speaks about “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which gives the message of world peace, but, “at the same time, our culture also gives us the mantra to fully empower ourselves for every kind of adverse situation created by the enemy”.Noting that since its inception in 1962, the ITBP has been protecting India’s borders, he said: “No matter whatever the difficulties, ITBP jawans perform their duties with high morale and patriotism in the service of Mother India.”Acknowledging the services rendered by the ITBP, Reddy said that the force is working with zeal and high order of professionalism even in the uncongenial and extreme conditions on our mountainous borders.He said whether it is battling terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir or Left-Wing Extremism in Chhattisgarh, the ITBP has performed with excellence.The Minister also cited the selfless service rendered by the ITBP in various efforts to tackle the spread of Covid-19 pandemic in the country.“The ITBP also contributes significantly to the nation’s economic development. The ITBP has played a part in thwarting efforts from across the border aimed at slowing our economic development.” Reddy presented six Presidential Police Medals and 23 Police Medals for Meritorious Services to ITBP personnel.Raised on October 24, 1962, during the India-China war, the ITBP primarily guards the borders in the Himalayas at the BOPs located at altitudes ranging from 3,000 to 18,800 feet.It has also been deployed for anti-Maoist operations and other internal security duties. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-tension-with-china-itbp-gets-nod-to-set-up-47-new-outposts-along-lac-160540
24-10-2020||Kathmandu||Oli's office rejects claims of using country's old map in PM's Dussehra greeting||Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has been criticised by netizens for deliberately not using the updated map of Nepal, showing three Indian areas as part of its territory, in his Dussehra greetings, a claim rejected by his office which said the revised map was not visible due to its tiny size.In June, Nepal's Parliament approved the new political map of the country featuring Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura which is part of Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand.Oli in a Twitter message on Friday conveyed his best wishes to the people of Nepal for Vijayadashami or Dussehra.Many people on social media, including Facebook and Twitter, commented that the Prime Minister's office deliberately removed the updated map after his meeting with India's Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) chief Samant Kumar Goel.“How can we consider using Nepal's old map in the PM's greeting without incorporating Limpiyadhura as a simple error?" asked main Opposition Nepali Congress spokesperson Bishwa Prakash Sharma.Many people in their social media posts asked why did the Prime Minister's office remove the government's coat of arms from the map which includes Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura.In response to the criticism, Prime Minister's Press Advisor Surya Thapa in a statement claimed that the revised map was used in the Prime Minister's message, but was not visible due to its tiny size.“It is natural for the map to appear in such a manner due to its tiny size but the same map, if enlarged, may clearly show the updated areas,” he claimed.           He also asked the people not to be misled by such pre-planned efforts to spread rumours about the map included in the greetings."There should not be any confusion that the map used in the greetings is the updated version which was endorsed by Nepal's Parliament," said Thapa.The Press Advisor in his press note issued through social media also included an enlarged version of the map, which clearly shows the map which includes all the three territories.The ties between the two countries came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated an 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal protested the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through its territory.Days later, Nepal came out with the new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as its territories.India too had published a new map in November 2019 showing the areas as its territories.After Nepal released the map, India reacted sharply, calling it a "unilateral act" and cautioning Kathmandu that such "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims will not be acceptable to it.In its reaction, after Nepal's lower house of Parliament approved the bill, India termed as untenable the "artificial enlargement" of territorial claims by the neighbouring country.India said Nepal's action violates an understanding reached between the two countries to resolve the boundary issues through talks.Prime Minister Oli has been asserting that Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura belong to his country and vowed to "reclaim" them from India.

24-10-2020||New Delhi||Mehbooba disrespecting Indian flag; Article 370 won’t be restored, says Prasad||The BJP on Saturday accused PDP president Mehbooba Mufti of “disrespecting” the Indian flag and asserted that the revocation of Article 370 was done constitutionally and that it will not be restored.Her comments that she will not hold the Tricolour till the Kashmiri flag is restored is “downright denunciation” of the National Flag’s sanctity, senior BJP leader and Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said.The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister had on Friday said that she was not interested in contesting elections or holding the Tricolour till the constitutional changes enforced on August 5 last year were rolled back.She said she would hold the Tricolour only when the separate flag of the erstwhile state is restored.Prasad asserted that Article 370, which gave the erstwhile state a special status and was revoked last year, will not be restored.It was removed following a proper constitutional process and both Houses of Parliament approved it with overwhelming numbers, he said.Revoking it was our commitment to the nation and people have appreciated it, he said.In many ways, Mufti has shown serious disrespect to the very image of India which the Tricolour represents, he added.The minister also hit out at other opposition parties, saying they have maintained a stony silence at her remarks showing serious disrespect to the National Flag, even as they criticise the saffron party at the “slightest of issues”.“This is hypocrisy and double standard,” Prasad said.He claimed that the revocation of the Article 370 has led to increased development in the Union Territory with the weaker sections of society, like SCs, STs, OBCs and women, enjoying the same rights that they do in the rest of the country.People participated in local polls in Jammu and Kashmir with joy and happiness, he said.“Some people and families who used to rule with impunity and without accountability are going to have problems,” he said.

24-10-2020||---||BJP leader moves SC for transfer of petitions on definition of ‘minority’||New Delhi, October 24Delhi BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay has moved the Supreme Court seeking transfer to itself of all petitions pending in various high courts challenging the validity of Section 2© of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992.The Supreme Court should hear all cases on the issue to avoid the multiplicity of litigation and conflicting views on the interpretation of Articles 29 and 30 of the Constitution that deal with the protection of interests of minorities, and the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions, he said.An authoritative pronouncement on this crucial issue was needed, Upadhyay—who has been filing petitions on this issue before various fora—told The Tribune.Currently, various high courts, including Delhi, Guwahati, and Meghalaya, were seized of petitions challenging the constitutionality of Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) Act, 1992. Section 2(c) simply says, “minority”, for the purposes of this Act, means a community notified as such by the Central Government.However, the Act doesn’t lay down any guidelines for determination of claim of any religious or linguistic group to be declared as “minority” under the NCM Act and the Centre has identified “minorities” on the national basis and not on the basis of a community’s number in a particular state. It has led to an anomalous situation as in many states a community having a higher population has been declared as “minority”, he said.Upadhyay said “the minority rights of Hindus are being siphoned off illegally and arbitrarily to the majority population because neither the Centre nor respective States have notified them as ‘minority’ under Section 2(c) of the NCM Act. Hence, Hindus are being deprived of their basic rights and protections guaranteed under Articles 29-30.”Describing the Supreme Court as custodian of the Constitution and protector of fundamental rights, Upadhyay urged it to direct the Ministry of Home Affairs to identify and notify religious and linguistic minorities at the state level in the spirit of the Constitution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-leader-moves-sc-for-transfer-of-petitions-on-definition-of-minority-160527

24-10-2020||Alauli/Teghra (Bihar)||Alauli rally: Bihar CM Nitish refrains from speaking against Chirag Paswan or LJP||Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Saturday addressed a poll rally in LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan’s native Alauli Assembly seat, but refrained from speaking anything either against the party or its president Chirag Paswan who has been attacking him regularly.After dissociating his party from the ruling NDA in Bihar, Chirag has been hitting out at the chief minister almost on a daily basis in his election meetings as well as in the social media, but Kumar has chosen not to react to him.Kumar maintained the same approach and avoided making any reference either about Chirag or his party at his rally in Alauli during the day.Alauli reserved seat includes Paswan’s birth place Saharbbani village in the Khagaria district.Ram Vilas Paswan had started his political innings by winning from Alauli constituency on Samyukta Socialist Party (SSY) in 1969.His younger brother Pashupati Kumar Paras, presently Lok Sabha member from the family pocket borough Hajipur, kept contact with the Alauli constituency for many years winning from there seven times in the past.In 2015 Paras had lost to Chandan Kumar of the RJD.In the present polls, the constiuency is witnessing three-cornered contest between the JD(U), RJD and the LJP.Kumar’s party has fielded Sadhna Sada, RJD has given ticket to Rambriksha Sada while Chirag’s LJP has put Ramchandra Sada on the seat that will go to vote in the second phase on November 3.While Kumar highlighted development work done in the area and also launched a scathing attack on the RJD in his address, he abjured talking anything on the LJP.Taking a swipe at his bete noire Lalu Prasad’s party, Kumar said “those who neglected education, health and roads construction and spent time in encouragig ‘jungle raj’ are today talking about development...its nothing but a joke.” They spent long time in power before the NDA took over the reins of the state in 2005 end, but “utilised it only for serving interest of the family.”“We ended ‘jungle raj’ and established rule of law,” Kumar said and cited National Crime Record Bureau latest report that puts Bihar on the 23rd position in terms of crime to drive home the point.He reiterated all this in his speech at Teghra in Begusarai too. The public meeting at Teghra saw some people speaking against the state government on which Kumar rebuked them and said he knew they have been sent by the rivals for political gains.Taking a veiled dig at the opposition chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav, Kumar said “we want everybody to study but a few persons want to get everything without education.”Tejashwi is a Class 9 dropout.“Some people who do not even have knowledge of alphabets or experience are talking of providing jobs to others...this is laughable,” he said deriding thw RJD’s promise of creating 10 lakh government jobs in the state if voted to power.Kumar, who has been declared as the NDA CM face, listed achievements of his successive governments in the last 15 years and promised to further speed up the development wrok if voted back to power.

Farmers have cut off oil supply from private pumps since October 1 in an attempt to escalate protests against controversial farm laws that the Parliament passed last month.Dealers of these companies had sent letters to the unions entreating them to allow their petrol pumps to function normally.Shingara Singh Mann, a leader from BKU, said the meeting on October 28 will consider whether to allow petrol pumps to function.Farmers have barricaded private dealerships in the state as a pressure tactic---a move that dealers claim has brought down sales by half, and in some cases, completely.Private dealers have since been posting messages and videos on social media asking them to allow them to function normally.A private dealer said on the condition of anonymity that he was staring at huge losses“My petrol pump has been closed for a month now. By boycotting our petrol pumps, the farmers are causing a direct loss to dealers like us, not the owners,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmer-unions-call-meeting-on-oct-28-to-decide-on-protests-at-petrol-pumps-160509

Funding for the project has been received from the World Bank.Sedimentation is the process where loose soil, silt, rock and debris flow in with the water that enters reservoirs and deposit on the bed. The level of sedimentation depends upon the terrain, geology and environmental conditions of the area through which the feeding rivers and tributaries flow.Sedimentation, according to sources, is unavoidable and over a period of time, reduces the storage capacity of the reservoirs. This has detrimental effects on the dam’s intended benefits such are provision of water for drinking and irrigation, flood control and power generation.Large-scale deforestation, unscientific agricultural practices, industrial processes and anthropogenic activities in catchment areas tend to increase silt load in rivers and aggravate sedimentation of reservoirs.Citing the example of the Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej in Himachal, an official said that over the past about 50 years, the designed capacity of the dam’s reservoir may have reduced by almost 25 per cent due to deposit of silt.Sources said that the surveys and studies would be carried out through integrated hydrographic survey systems and integrated bathymetric systems that include the employment of drones and the use of artificial intelligence and powerful software tools. Execution of the project is open to both Indian as well as global firms having the requisite expertise and experience.The project is aimed at assessing and reviewing the life expectancy of reservoirs, particularly in view of reports in certain quarters about increase in the rate of sedimentation in many reservoirs.The study, in which each reservoir would be taken up separately, would also recommend suitable measures for increasing benefits and enhancing the reservoir life specific measures for soil conservation and catchment area treatment.Besides topographical mapping of the reservoir bed and peripheral areas, a database would also be created for developing regional sediment indices and facilitating rational sedimentation planning for future reservoirs, sources said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-environmental-concerns-grow-central-water-commission-to-study-sedimentation-in-major-reservoirs-160500

They should make it clear whether they have the same stance with regard to the CBI at the national level too,” he told reporters.On October 13, the Kerala High Court had stayed for two months the CBI probe into alleged irregularities, including of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act,in Life Mission, a state housing project envisaging total housing for the homeless.The opposition has alleged that there was corruption in selection of the contractor by Red Crescent, an international humanitarian organisation and that Swapna Suresh,a key accused in the gold smuggling case,had admitted before an NIA court to having received Rs one crore as commission from the project.Red Crescent had agreed to provide Rs 20 crore funds towards the Life Mission scheme.Life Mission had submitted before the court that the two companies which had signed an agreement with Red Crescent do not come under categories of persons prohibited from receiving any foreign contribution under an act of the FCRA.

It is stated that letters have been written to the states. This step by itself can hardly be enough to discharge the public trust reposed in the Ministry of Jal Shakti,” the bench said.“Apart from writing a letter, there has to be specific time-bound action plans and monitoring which should include coercive measures for enforcement,” it added.

We, as a party, always want to see justice is delivered to victims as quickly as possible. But given the situation, the silence on the part of Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi, or for that matter all 35 MPs, who wanted to go for a ‘picnic tour to Hathras’ has forced us to ask them why are not they speaking on the Hoshiarpur incident.”The BJP leader, with an eye on the ongoing Bihar polls, said Rahul Gandhi, who addressed public rallies in the state along with RJD’s Tejaswi Yadav, did not speak a word about the rape and murder of a minor daughter of a Bihari migrant worker.Echoing Sitharaman, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said: “The incident of rape and murder of the 6-year-old Dalit girl (from Bihar) in Hoshiarpur is very shocking. We demand strict action against the culprits. Instead of going on political tours, Rahul Gandhi should visit Tanda (Punjab) and Rajasthan to take cognisance of incidents of crime against women.”Targeting RJD leader, Javadekar said: “Tejashwi Yadav is sharing the stage and campaigning with the people who are committing atrocities on Bihar’s daughter. How will it go?”Capt Amarinder trashes BJP’s criticismMeanwhile, trashing the BJP senior leadership’s attack on his government, the Punjab CM on Saturday termed the remarks of Sitharaman and Javadekar as “political puffery”, with no substance or basis to support their criticism, a press release by the state government said.Contrary to what these leaders were claiming, there was no comparison between the Hoshiarpur and the Hathras cases, said Captain Amarinder, pointing out in the latter instance, the Uttar Pradesh government and the police did not only fail to initiate stern action but in fact, was seemingly trying to cover up the matter to benefit the upper-caste accused.“This,” he said, “was in sharp contrast to the prompt action taken by the Punjab Police, who immediately arrested the accused and were now preparing to file the challan within a week.” “I had directed the DGP to ensure that the case is fast-tracked by the courts to ensure strict and exemplary action for the accused,” added the Chief Minister.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hoshiarpur-rape-murder-case-bjp-questions-cong-leaders-silence-capt-amarinder-terms-it-political-puffery-160474

We certainly want to ensure that the situation doesn't escalate,” the official said.“These are all areas where we cooperate with the Indians, and not just as it relates to the tensions in the Himalayas,” the official said.India and China are locked in a bitter border standoff in eastern Ladakh since early May that has significantly strained the bilateral ties.Both sides have held a series of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the row. However, no breakthrough has been achieved.China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory on the southern bank of Pangong Lake in the last week of August.In response to a question, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US was having an ongoing dialogue with India about increased cooperation in Southeast Asia, and not simply about the South China Sea.“And we encourage their involvement. That cuts across development investments, it cuts across security cooperation, and then it also involves presence. So, we welcome greater Indian participation in Southeast Asia across all three of those areas,” said the official.The senior official’s remarks came in the midst of a growing global concern over China’s expansionist behaviour.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China’s increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers.The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China’s growing assertiveness.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its man-made islands in the past few years.Beijing claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. But Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims. In the East China Sea, China has territorial disputes with Japan.The South China Sea and the East China Sea are stated to be rich in minerals, oil, and other natural resources. They are also vital to global trade.Although the US lays no claims to the disputed waters, it has challenged China’s growing territorial claims in the South China Sea by deploying warships and fighter jets to assert freedom of navigation and over-flight patrols in the strategically vital region.

Right from Jammu and Kashmir to Arunachal Pradesh, we are fully prepared. If required, the people of Arunachal will not hesitate to stand behind the Indian Army,” he said.China does not recognise Arunachal Pradesh as an Indian state but as a part of southern Tibet, a claim that has been rejected outright by India.Speaking on the changes in the last six decades since 1962, the Chief Minister said infrastructure development along the border areas has received a major thrust under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“The development of border areas, especially roads, is important. It is being done in full speed in Arunachal Pradesh and we will soon witness several such infrastructural revamps in the state,” he said.Khandu was at Bum La to pay tribute to Subedar Joginder Singh on his 58th death anniversary. He recalled the supreme sacrifice of Singh, who laid down his life fighting the Chinese army in the 1962 Indo-China war.Singh, who was a subedar in the 1st battalion of the Sikh Regiment, was commanding a platoon at Bum La in the then North East Frontier Agency, now Arunachal Pradesh.“Fighting against all odds, Subedar Singh attained martyrdom on this day during the 1962 India-China war. The people of Arunachal salute his bravery and will always remember the supreme sacrifice he made for the nation,” Khandu said.Though heavily outnumbered, Singh had led his troops against a Chinese assault and defended his post until he was wounded and captured. He died of his injuries while in Chinese custody and is believed to have single-handedly killed several Chinese soldiers and created history in the annals of the Indian Army.He was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, the highest military gallantry award of the country, in 1962.Kulwant Kaur, Singh’s daughter, inaugurated a newly-built war memorial in her father’s name at the programme.The memorial has been built by the Arunachal Pradesh government just below the famous IB Ridge to commemorate Singh’s heroic defence against the People’s Liberation Army of China.

We, on behalf of our client Mahesh Bhatt, refute the allegations. Such allegations are not only false and defamatory but have serious consequences in law. Our client will take such action in accordance with law as advised," said the statement issued on behalf of Bhatt.The statement, posted on the verified Instagram account of Vishesh Films, is signed Naik Naik & Co., legal counsel for Vishesh Films.Earlier, on Friday, Luviena Lodh posted a one minute, 48-second video on her verified Instagram page claiming that Mahesh Bhatt has been harassing her. She also claimed that she had been married to Bhatt's nephew Sumit Sabharwal, adding that she had filed for a divorce on getting to know that he supplies drugs to actors like Amyra Dastur and Sapna Pabbi.She also alleged that he was into supplying women and that Mahesh Bhatt was aware of the fact.Speaking in Hindi, Luviena says in her video: "Namaste. My name is Laviena Lodh, and I'm filming this video for the safety of my family and myself. My marriage took place with Mahesh Bhatt's nephew Sumit Sabharwal and I have filed for a divorce on getting to know that he supplies drugs to actors like Amyra Dastur and Sapna Pabbi etc. His phone contains images of numerous girls that he shows to directors, and so he also supplies women."Mahesh Bhatt is aware of these things. Mahesh Bhatt is the biggest don of the industry. He operates this entire system and if you don't play by their rules they make life miserable for you. Mahesh Bhatt has destroyed many lives—he has ensured many actors, directors and composers lose their jobs. He makes a call and people lose their jobs, and they don't even get to know about it. He has destroyed many lives in this manner, and since the time I filed a case against him he is after my life. He has tried to enter my home in different ways and has also tries his best to get me thrown out of my house."When I try to file an NC (non-cognisable complaint) at a police station, no one is willing to lodge the complaint. If at all an NC is filed, no action is taken. If something should happen to me and my family, the only people who are responsible are Mahesh Bhatt, Mukesh Bhatt, Sumit Sabharwal, Sahil Saigal, and Kumkum Saigal. People should at least get to know of how many lives they have destroyed behind closed doors and the things they can do, because Mahesh Bhatt is extremely powerful and influential. Thank you."I m being harrased by Mahesh Bhatt & family.

24-10-2020||New Delhi||No more scotch? India bans imported goods at Army canteens: Report||India has ordered its 4,000 military shops to stop buying imported goods, according to a document reviewed by Reuters, a move that could send an unwelcome signal to foreign liquor firms such as Diageo and Pernod Ricard.India's defence canteens sell liquor, electronics and other goods at discounted prices to soldiers, ex-servicemen and their families. With annual sales of over $2 billion, they make up one of the largest retail chains in India.The October 19 internal order from the defence ministry, reviewed by Reuters, said that in the future, "procurement of direct imported items shall not be undertaken".The order said the issue had been discussed with the Army, Air Force and Navy in May and July, and was aimed at supporting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's campaign to promote domestic goods. A defence ministry spokesman declined to comment.The order did not specify which products would be targeted.However, industry sources said they believed imported liquor could be on the list.Imports make up around 6-7% of total sales value in the defence shops, according to an August research column of the government-funded Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA). Chinese products such as diapers, vacuum cleaners, handbags and laptops, account for the bulk if it, it said.Reuters reported in June that Pernod and Diageo had briefly stopped receiving orders for their imported brands from such government stores. Diageo did not respond to a request for comment, while a Pernod spokesman declined comment.While imported liquor sales at defence stores generate only about $17 million in annual sales, the order would send a negative signal, said an executive whose company sells products at defence stores."The (foreign liquor) sales are small - but why would a government which is wanting to attract foreign investments do this? It's a confusing, conflicting signal," said the executive.India has in recent months taken steps to curb Chinese businesses and investments following a border clash in June that killed 20 Indian soldiers. — Reuters||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-more-scotch%C2%A0india-bans-imported-goods-at-army-canteens-report-160433

The aim is to garner support to counter China“We’re watching the situation closely. I think both sides have expressed a desire to de-escalate violence,” he added. The two sides are in the process of finalising several agreements with a military pact called Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) for geo-spatial cooperation also in the works.Officials said instead of talking of countering China, the US would prefer to frame a discussion in a more positive trajectory with the end goal to “empower these countries to push back”.Like the MEA here, US diplomats sought to convey the impression that the diplomatic calendar has its own dynamics.Pompeo and Esper, possibly accompanied by their spouses, will hold a series of meetings in Delhi. They will call on PM Narendra Modi and NSA Ajit Doval, separately meet their counterparts and hold the 2+2 meeting that is “reserved for our closest friends and partners”, said Dean Thompson, State Department’s Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs. “LAC tensions will figure at some point during these meetings,” he elaborated.Pompeo will carry on to Sri Lanka, Maldives and Indonesia in a bridge building exercise with Asian countries sitting astride key shipping lanes.The focus areas of the Pompeo-Esper visit listed by the US side were similar to those mentioned by the MEA. The US side mentioned global cooperation, challenges in the Indo-Pacific, people-to-people ties and security cooperation as the priority areas.In case of Sri Lanka, which is close to China, the message from the US will be stark. Colombo will be asked to review “the options we offer in contrast to discriminatory and opaque practices” (by China). “We want to partner on sustainable economic development and a free Indo-Pacific,” said Thompson.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-military-pact-on-the-table-for-india-us-talks-160310
