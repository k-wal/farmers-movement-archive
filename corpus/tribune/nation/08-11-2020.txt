Singh, a confidante of Lalu Prasad, told the partymen that Tejashwi laboured hard to win people’s faith in the party and its duty of everybody to maintain it.RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari said the party’s own assessment from their sources on ground suggests that it will win more seats than predicted in exit polls.“There is a wave in support of Mahagathbandhan and Tejashwi Yadav. We will win with a two-thirds majority,” he told PTI.The RJDs election campaign was centred on Tejashwi Yadavs promise of providing 10 lakh government jobs to youths in Bihar.Its rival kept attacking the party over its record on and law and order, and also berated as “jungle raj” during the 15-year rule of Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi.In a rally during the polls, BJP chief JP Nadda had assailed the RJD over its reputation of preferring muscle power to ideology, saying the party has a history of conducting ‘Tail Piyawan, Danda Bhanjan (dipping lathis in oil and wielding them to assert power)’ rally.Naddas reference to Tel Piyawan, Danda Bhanjan was a throwback to an RJD rally in 2003, two years before the party was ousted from power in Bihar.As the name suggests, the party workers and supporters carrying ‘lathi’ (stick) had participated in that rally at Gandhi maidan in the state capital.In its second tweet on Sunday, the RJD asked its workers to keep in mind that irrespective of the results “at the centre of your politics is public upliftment and their convenience”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rjd-warns-its-workers-against-celebratory-firing-on-bihar-poll-result-day-167975
08-11-2020||New Delhi||Ladakh standoff: India, China likely to hold another round of military talks this week||India and China are likely to hold another round of military talks this week to discuss specific proposals for a possible breakthrough in the long-negotiated disengagement process in eastern Ladakh, where their two armies are locked in an over six-month border standoff, authoritative sources said on Sunday.The eighth round of Corps Commander-level talks on Friday had broadly discussed disengagement of troops from specific friction points and both sides would like to take forward the “constructive” dialogue to the next round with detailed deliberations, they said.“Another round of talks is likely this week to discuss the proposals,” said a source. The next round of talks will also be at the level of Corps Commanders.In a joint statement released earlier in the day, the Indian Army and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) described the Friday talks as candid, in-depth and constructive.The statement said it was agreed to earnestly implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries and ensure that the frontline troops exercise restraint and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation.The statement released both in Beijing and New Delhi said both sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels, and take forward the discussions for the settlement of outstanding issues.The talks were held in Chushul on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. It lasted for nearly 11 hours.At the talks, the two sides also agreed to have another round of meeting soon.The joint statement said the two sides had a candid, in-depth and constructive exchange of views on disengagement along the LAC in the Western Sector of India-China border areas.“Both sides agreed to earnestly implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, ensure their frontline troops exercise restraint and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation,” the statement said.“Both sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels, and, taking forward the discussions at this meeting, push for the settlement of other outstanding issues, so as to jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas,” it added.Government sources stated that at the talks, the Indian Army strongly insisted on early disengagement of troops by China from all the friction points in eastern Ladakh.Nearly 50,000 troops of the Indian Army are currently deployed in a high state of combat readiness in various mountainous locations in eastern Ladakh in sub-zero conditions as multiple rounds of talks between the two sides have not yielded any concrete outcome yet to resolve the standoff.China has also deployed an equal number of troops, according to officials. The standoff between the two sides erupted in early May.Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat on Friday said India would not accept any shifting of the LAC, and noted that the possibility of transgressions and confrontations on the border spiralling into a larger conflict could not be ruled out.The Indian delegation at the eighth round of military talks was led by Lt Gen PGK Menon, the newly-appointed Commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps. Naveen Srivastava, Joint Secretary (East Asia) in the Ministry of External Affairs, was also part of the Indian delegation.Also read: LAC standoff: India-China talks fail to break deadlockAt the seventh round of talks too, both sides had agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for disengagement “as early as possible”.India has all along been maintaining that the onus was on China to carry forward the process of disengagement and de-escalation at the friction points in eastern Ladakh.Following the sixth round of military talks, the two sides announced a slew of decisions including not to send more troops to the frontline, refrain from unilaterally changing the situation on the ground and avoid taking any actions that may further complicate matters.The sixth round was held with a specific agenda of exploring ways to implement a five-point agreement reached between External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi at a meeting in Moscow on September 10 on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) conclave.The pact included measures like quick disengagement of troops, avoiding action that could escalate tensions, adherence to all agreements and protocols on border management and steps to restore peace along the LAC.When asked about the six-month-long military standoff, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at a media briefing on Friday that both sides continue to maintain close communication at the military and diplomatic levels to achieve complete disengagement along the LAC.

08-11-2020||Sandeep Dikshit||Biden to restore balance in Indo-US ties||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 8The new Joe Biden administration is expected to restore the balance in India-US relationship that had got heavily skewed to the security side during the last four years of the Trump administration.One such example took place during US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s tour to the region last month. In India, the focus was on the BECA military agreement just as it has been on another military pact CISMOA signed a week back.But when Pompeo landed in Indonesia, he announced the restoration of its duty free exports to the US under the General System of Preferences (GSP).  India had simultaneously lost the duty-free GSP access on Rs 40,000 crore of its exports to the US. There was no mention in the latest Indo-US 2+2 joint statement and the Trump administration avoided a mini trade deal. Instead, India stepped deeper into an energy relationship purchasing a record Rs 7 lakh crore from US oil behemoths last year at the cost of some of its long-standing quasi-allies.The focus on Asia Pacific is likely to remain. Biden was a key participant in Obama’s “Pivot to Asia” which also had the same security related goals – retain US superiority in the maritime domain with India as a new ally. But there was a matching accent on economics. The architecture of Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) -- to create China-free supply chains—was beginning to take shape when the Trump administration junked it.Biden’s plans to increase visas may not take shape immediately but will be a major improvement over the near-total clampdown by Trump. There is no doubt though that eventually Biden will ease norms for high-skilled visas, including H-1B, and Green Cards.But with Kamala Harris as Vice President, Biden is expected to keep up the pressure on human rights, from CAA and NRC to Kashmir.It remains to be seen if the presence of a vocal pro-Modi Indian diaspora in the US and a much closer energy and security relationship since the 90s will encourage Biden to keep private conversations with New Delhi on human rights and Islamophobia. Trump had adopted a similar approach following reports of forcible closure of churches in some parts of India during Modi’s first term as PM.But the free pass during the Trump term is unlikely. On Kashmir, Biden promises to work against “restrictions on dissent, such as preventing peaceful protests or shutting or slowing down the Internet, weaken democracy”, while Harris has said “there is a need to intervene if the situation demands”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/biden-to-restore-balance-in-indo-us-ties-167961

He was burnt to death for not repaying that money," Narendra Saluja, media coordinator of MP Congress president Kamal Nath, claimed on Sunday.District Collector Kumar Purushottam said financial assistance of Rs 8.5 lakh will be given to the kin of the deceased and arrangement for his children's education will also be made. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tribal-burnt-to-death-over-loan-in-mp-congress-slams-govt-167953

08-11-2020||Shubhadeep Choudhury||Former Meghalaya Guv asks Shillong Bengalis to emulate Sikhs||Tribune News ServiceKolkata, November 8Former Meghalaya Governor Tathagata Roy, whose term ended in August this year, has asked Bengali Hindu residents of Shillong to defend themselves against racial violence by emulating “the sardarjis”.Lamenting that the state government in Meghalaya was having no concern for the safety of non-tribals and it acted as if Meghalaya was not a part of India and the question of rights of non-tribals was quite immaterial, Roy, who lives in Kolkata, tweeted citing the example of the Sikhs of Shillong (who were successful in defending themselves against violence).“Meghalaya unfortunately has a government which has chosen to forget that they are part of India and non-tribals are equal citizens of India.But Bengali Hindus must unite and fend for themselves. Can any of these anti-non tribals dare to take on the Sardarjis of Punjabi Lane?” Roy, who is a senior ideologue of BJP but evidently quite disillusioned with the BJP-backed Conrad Sangma-led government of Meghalaya, tweeted  on Saturday.Shillong, capital of Meghalaya, has been facing a fresh wave of ethnic violence targeting Bengalis following a clash in Ichamati village located on the state’s border with Bangladesh.Khasi Students Union (KSU), an organisation notorious for unleashing violence against  Bengalis and other non-tribal residents of Shillong, put up banners in various parts of Shillong recently which read, “All Meghalaya Bengalis are Bangladeshis”, “Khasi land for Khasis”, “Foreigners Go Away”, and so on.The Punjabi Lane of Shillong is located close to the city’s two prime commercial districts, namely, Police Bazar and Burra Bazar. Residents of Punjabi Lane primarily consist of Sikhs. KSU wants them to relocate or simply leave Shillong.But, racial violence, which has worked very well against the Bengalis and resulted in their steady exodus from Shillong, has failed to intimidate the Sikhs whose ancestors had come to Shillong with British colonialists.Meghalaya government’s brazen attempts to evict the Sikh residents of Punjabi Lane has also come to a nought owing to the strong evidence favouring the residence of the Sikhs in the neighbourhood.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/former-meghalaya-guv-asks-shillong-bengalis-to-emulate-sikhs-167947
08-11-2020||   Kolkata||Sikh FB group remembers Kamala Harris’s chequered past||A Sikh Facebook group has refused to get swept off by Kamala Harris’s election as Vice-President of USA and has reminded its followers about her questionable role in a lawsuit filed by a Sikh man challenging an official agency of California for denial of a job to him because of his beard.According to an article circulated by citysikhs.org.uk, one of the largest International Sikh groups on Facebook, Trilochan Oberoi, a former commander in the Indian Navy, was denied job as a state corrections officer in California in USA in 2005 because he refused to shave his beard. The beard was posing problem for the mandated gas-mask fitting.When Oberoi appealed, an arbitration board ruled in his favour and said the state agency had discriminated against him by making “no effort” to find an alternative for Jolly, like giving him a mask different from the ones in use.Oberoi reapplied for the position and was again denied. He then sued the state.In the court filings, Harris, who was sworn in as California’s first Indian-American attorney general only three days before, backed the Department of Correction, arguing that Oberoi couldn’t be properly fitted for a gas mask unless he shaved and that no exception to the rule had been made since the policy came into effect in 2004.The case returned to haunt Harris when she announced her intention to run for the post of the US President. A report published in Religion News Service (RNS) on July 2, 2019, under the headline “Sikh activists ask Kamala Harris for apology over beard ban for California prison guards” quoted Oberoi as having said that trimming the beard was against his religion.Kate Waters, spokeswoman for the Harris campaign, explained to the RNS in an email that Harris’s hands were tied.  “Attorney General of California, Senator Harris was obligated to defend state clients including the Department of Corrections,” Waters said.The RNS, an independent, non-profit and award-winning source of global news source on religion founded back in 1934, quoted Rajdeep Singh Jolly, a Washington-based Sikh lawyer, as having said that the clarification by Harris’s campaign office was “not true at all” .“Attorneys generals have discretion. They have the power to exercise discretion about how they’re going to allocate their resources, what kinds of cases they’re going to take,” Jolly said.The state settled the case in 2011, six years after Oberoi had originally applied for the job, paying Oberoi $295,000 in damages and giving him a manager position in the corrections department. But no change was made to the no-beard policy.In 2012, the Governor of California signed a bill to protect workers wearing religious clothing or hairstyles.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sikh-fb-group-remembers-kamala-harriss-chequered-past-167946

08-11-2020||Naveen S Garewal ||Telangana CM lashes at Centre for ‘ignoring’ state||Tribune News Service Hyderabad, November 8 Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) has lashed out at the Union Government for ignoring the state during its recent unprecedented floods that caused damage human life and properties. The state has estimated damages to exceed Rs 5,000 crore and had sought central assistance for distribution among the affected. “The Union Government only makes empty promises as all requests by the state to advance Rs 1,350 crore for immediate relief have been ignored,” KCR said while accusing the NDA Government at the Centre of playing a partisan role towards BJP-ruled states at the cost of non-BJP ruled states. He said it was highly regrettable that no help came from the Union Government, even after city like Hyderabad suffered heavy losses and central teams came and witnessed the extensive damage.  The Union Government’s attitude has been exposed to be selective as it failed to release even a single rupee as assistance in this regard, he said releasing an official statement on the issue. It may be recalled that the Union Minister of State for Home, G Kishan Reddy, who is an MP from Secundrabad had himself surveyed the damage and asked the officials to release the compensation at the earliest. The President, Vice President and the PM had expressed shock over the heavy rains and floods and spoke to the CM and inquired about the situation in which 70 people had died.  The state is undergoing a huge financial strain as it is now estimated that the overall loss in revenue to the state during financial year 2020-21 due to the impact of COVID-19 would be to the tune of Rs 52,750 crore. A change to the state budget for the current fiscal has been proposed accordingly. For the state a fall in revenues will translate into a considerable decrease of the state’s share in Union Government taxes. Meanwhile, Telangana’s ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) Party working president and Municipal Minister KT Rama Rao also slammed the Centre for being partial towards the BJP-ruled states in extending financial support during the natural calamities. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi turned a deaf ear to the requests from KCR to provide financial support towards relief and rehabilitation measures in flood-hit areas of Hyderabad. Giving details he said, “Prime Minister Modi sanctioned Rs 669 crore within four days after Karnataka witnessed floods recently. In 2017, he personally visited Gujarat during floods and released Rs 500 crore. But despite Chief Minister Chandrashekhar Rao writing a letter and seeking release of Rs 1,350 crore as immediate relief measure, there is no response from the Prime Minister.”Speaking to mediapersons at Telangana Bhavan here, the TRS working president termed the floods as a man-made disaster and blamed the previous governments in erstwhile Andhra Pradesh for ignoring the encroachment of tanks and nalas as well as unauthorised constructions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-cm-lashes-at-centre-for-ignoring-state-167939

08-11-2020||Beijing||Xi orders advancing construction of rail line in Tibet, close to Arunachal||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday instructed officials to expedite the construction of the new USD 47.8 billion railway project connecting the country’s southwest Sichuan province to Linzhi in Tibet close to the Indian border in Arunachal Pradesh, saying it would play a key role in safeguarding stability in the border areas.The Sichuan-Tibet Railway will be the second railway line into Tibet after the Qinghai-Tibet Railway project. It will go through the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, one of the world’s most geologically active areas, according to the Chinese official media.The Sichuan-Tibet Railway starts from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan province and travels through Ya’an and enters Tibet via Qamdo, shortening the journey from Chengdu to Lhasa from 48 hours to 13 hours.Linzhi, also known as Nyingchi, is located close to Arunachal Pradesh border.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control, the de-facto border between the two countries. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of south Tibet which is firmly rejected by India.Linzhi also has an airport which is one of the five airports built by China in the Himalayan region.The Ya’an-Linzhi section runs 1,011 km with 26 stations. Trains are expected to run at speeds between 120 and 200 km per hour. The total cost of the entire Sichuan-Tibet Railway project is around 319.8 billion yuan (USD 47.8 billion), according to a recent report by the state-run Global Times.In a video conference, ahead of the commencement of the construction of the project, Xi identified it as a major measure in facilitating the ruling Communist Party’s general plan for governing Tibet in the new era, and stressed the project’s important role in safeguarding national unity, promoting ethnic solidarity and consolidating stability in border areas.He made the instruction ahead of the beginning of the construction of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway’s Ya’an-Nyingchi section on Sunday, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.The Sichuan-Tibet Railway will not only accelerate and enhance the overall economic development of the Tibet region, but will play an important role in safeguarding border stability, the Global Times said.The project would significantly contribute to the economic and social development of the western region, especially in Sichuan province and Tibet Autonomous Region, Xi said.Underlining the complex geological and climatic conditions, as well as fragile ecological environment along the project line, he called for leveraging China’s advantage of concentrating resources to get things done to accomplish this historic task, which is arduous but glorious.The construction should be carried out in a scientific, safe and eco-friendly way, Xi said, apparently referring to the fragility of the area as it is one of the world’s most active seismic regions.Speaking at the meeting, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang emphasised prioritising the safety, reliability and quality of the project, and called for coordinated efforts in promoting construction, epidemic prevention and people’s well-being.The 1,011-km section between Ya’an in Sichuan and NyingChi in Tibet is the third part of the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, which will be carried out by the China State Railway Group Co., Ltd.The project’s Chengdu-Ya’an section became operational in December 2018, and the construction of the Lhasa-Nyingchi section started in June 2015, the Xinhua report added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/xi-orders-advancing-construction-of-rail-line-in-tibet-close-to-arunachal-167932

The blockade in Assam will also be lifted and traffic movement is likely to resume on Sunday evening or Monday,” he said.Chuaungo said the Centre was keen on resolving the inter-state dispute between Mizoram and Assam, and was constantly in touch with both the governments.Three companies of the BSF had arrived in the state on Saturday, he said.One company and two platoons of the BSF will be deployed at Vairengte, two platoons at Saihapui ‘V’ village in Kolasib district and one company at Thinghlun village in the Mamit district.However, a section of the state forces would remain deployed on the disputed areas to maintain peace among the Mizo people, he said.The border dispute between Mizoram and Assam intensified on October 9 when a hut and plantations were destroyed allegedly by officials of Assam’s Karimganj district on a farmland near Thinghlun village in west Mizoram’s Mamit district.The tension further escalated when residents of Vairengte in Mizoram’s Kolasib set on fire several temporary bamboo huts and stalls during a violent clash on the night of October 17. At least seven people from Mizoram and few others from Assam were injured in the clash.Though several dialogues were held, normalcy could not be restored in the area.

They tried to paint Maharashtra as a lawless state where farming of drugs and narcotic substances happens.”“But, the fact is that we received investments worth crores of rupees for which MoUs were signed, and now work would also start soon,” said the chief minister who heads the tripartite government of the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress.While MoUs worth Rs 17,000 crore were signed in June this year, deals of Rs 35,000 crore were inked recently, the chief minister added.He said the new deals would generate employment opportunities in different sectors including electronics, logistics etc, for at least 23,182 people.“In the next few years, Maharashtra will become the hub of logistics and data,” the chief minister added.Referring to recent floods and heavy rains in the state, Thackeray said crops on the area of 41 lakh hectares were damaged.He said the state government promptly announced a relief package of Rs 10,000 crore to mitigate the hardships of farmers.Thackeray also hailed the success of “My family, my responsibility” campaign against COVID-19 which was held between September 15 and October 24 in two phases.He said 99 per cent of the population in the state was covered under the campaign.“Our health workers covered 2.74 crore households and detected more than 51,000 COVID-19 patients,” the chief minister said, adding that the drive may be relaunched in December.Speaking on the gradual unlocking of various sectors and services, the chief minister said deliberations were being held with the ministry of Railways for resumption of suburban train services for all in Mumbai.

He detailed the assault being inflicted on him during this custody and pleaded, hands folded, to the Supreme Court for intervention and bail," she said in the statement."An innocent man and journalist of decades of repute, who is doing his duty for the nation, has been assaulted, harassed and framed on fake charges. He has been thrown into jail with no reprieve, she said.Meanwhile, former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya in a tweet said he met jailer of the Taloja prison on Sunday and the latter assured him that Goswami will not be harassed and he will also be provided required medical treatment.Goswami and two others - Feroze Shaikh and Nitish Sarda - were arrested by Alibaug police on November 4 in connection with the suicide of architect-interior designer Anvay Naik and his mother in 2018 over alleged non-payment of dues by companies of the accused.After his arrest from his Lower Parel residence in Mumbai, Goswami was taken to Alibaug, where the Chief Judicial Magistrate remanded him and the two others in judicial custody till November 18.Goswami was then kept at a local school which has been designated as a COVID-19 centre for the Alibaug prison.The Bombay High Court will on Monday pronounce its order on the interim bail application filed by Goswami and the two others in connection with the abetment of suicide case.A notice issued late Saturday night on the high court’s website said the bench would assemble at 3 pm on November 9 for pronouncement of the order. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/arnab-shifted-to-taloja-jail-for-using-mobile-phone-in-custody-167903

08-11-2020||New Delhi||Plea in SC against Centre’s notification demarcating 56,825 sq km in 6 states as Western Ghats ESA||A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court challenging the 2018 draft notification of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change demarcating an area of 56,825 square kilometre spread across six states as the Western Ghats Ecologically Sensitive Area (ESA).The Western Ghats, spread across Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, are recognised by UNESCO as one of the world’s eight most important biodiversity hotspots.  The plea filed by an NGO ‘Karshaka Shabdam’ through advocate Suvidutt MS sought directions to the Centre and Kerala to not implement the recommendations of Western Ghats Ecologically Expert Panel (WGEEP), also called the Gadgil Committee, and of the High-Level Working Group, also called the Kasturirangan Committee.The Kerala-based NGO also sought that the 2018 notification of the ministry be declared as unconstitutional as it violates the right to life and livelihood of farmers guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.In 2010, the ministry had constituted an expert panel (WGEEP) headed by Madhav Gadgil for strategising and conserving the Ghats and to lay more emphasis on the sustainable aspects of the Ghats. The panel submitted its report in 2011.          In 2013, following the criticism of the Gadgil Committee report from various quarters, a High-Level Working Group headed by K Kasturirangan was constituted to examine the report and recommendation of WGEEP, and it submitted a report the same year.        The NGO said that the 2018 notification once implemented in Kerala would affect the livelihood of lakhs of farmers as their agricultural lands would come under the demarcated Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESA).        “The petitioner herein has locus standi to file the instant Writ Petition as it stands for the wellbeing of farmers including protection of their rights, enlightening government with regard to policies and actions harmful to farmers and also works for afforestation across the region,” the plea said.It said that both the Gadgil committee and the Kasturirangan committee reports, which were aimed at preserving and conserving the Western Ghats, have made several recommendations for protection, preservation and conservation of the Western Ghats, but “it vitiates aggressively in several aspects to the state of Kerala”.The NGO said that though the Gadgil committee report was theoretically eco-friendly, factors such as population, practicality in displacement and source of livelihood were not considered.It said that the Gadgil panel’s recommendation for declaring the complete area a protected zone was considered widely “as insensitive, and hindered the development and inhabiting aspects of human-hood”.The NGO further said that the Kasturirangan report made some interesting and beneficial recommendations but it is widely criticised that the committee used remote sensing and aerial survey methods for area demarcation that it says fail to address the issues in reality.It said that as per this report, powers would vest with the bureaucrats and not with forest officials and village level officers, and many areas addressed under the report are agricultural lands. Hence, there is a greater probability of depletion of agriculture with displacement.        The petitioner NGO said that the needs and aspirations of the local and indigenous people, sustainable development and environmental integrity of the region and to suggest steps and the way forward to prevent further degradation of the fragile ecology of the Western Ghats get mentioned in the draft notification.   “However, it is only lip service and the people friendly sustainable measures recommended by the HLWG don’t find mention in the draft notification,” the petition says. “The rationale behind issuing the draft notification, without the inclusion of the measures to incentivise green growth advocated by the HLWG and those proposed in the National Agroforestry Policy, 2014, is questionable,” it said.       The petition alleged that instead of allowing people to continue with their livelihoods that have been pursued over centuries in consonance with nature, the intent of the draft notification seems to disrupt lives and discourage agriculture.The plea sought a direction to Kerala to not implement the recommendations of WGEEP and HLWG reports on the Western Ghats.The plea also sought implementation of the recommendations of the Oommen V Oommen committee constituted in 2014 by the Kerala government to review the Kasturirangan committee report.The projects and activities to be prohibited or regulated in the eco-sensitive area include mining, no new construction of thermal power plants and buildings. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-in-sc-against-centres-notification-demarcating-56-825-sq-km-in-6-states-as-western-ghats-esa-167897

I enjoyed it and no I was not afraid. My granddaughter, who is 17 years old, went before me but she was a little scared. I did not tremble at all because I wanted to know what it feels like to fly,” Lepcha said.She flew for nearly six minutes at an elevation of about 4,500 feet as her family, onlookers and the members of the Paragliding Association of Sikkim cheered on.Lepcha said this was not the first adventure sport she has participated in nor is it her last.In 2016 she went scuba diving off Andaman coast.

08-11-2020||London||Indians urged to name a star in memory of soldiers killed in World Wars||The UK-based Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) is calling on Indians to join a global virtual remembrance ceremony to honour soldiers killed in the World Wars by naming a star after them and looking up into the night sky at 7 pm on November 11 to remember Indian servicemen and women.The CWGC said the #ShineOn ceremony has been devised as an “inclusive, accessible, digital” remembrance event that is free and open to all at a time of the coronavirus pandemic lockdown.November 11 is marked annually as Armistice Day around the world as the day that marked the end of the World War-I. As many as 74,000 Indian servicemen and women are known to have sacrificed their lives in that war.“For more than a century, we have gathered at the same time on the same day, to bow our heads and think of those who sacrificed their lives for ours, during the two World Wars. But this year’s different,” said CWGC’s Director General Barry Murphy.“Whilst we can’t come together in person, we can still make sure their names burn bright. Not just for one day, but for all the days (and nights) to come. So, this year, on Remembrance Day, we’ll look up to the stars in our night sky to remember those who fell,” he said.By the time the war ended in November 1918, more than 1.1 million Indian personnel had been sent overseas. They served with distinction in every theatre of war – from France to modern-day Iraq; from Egypt to East Africa; and from Greece to Gallipoli in Turkey.The servicemen and women of India earned more than 9,200 decorations for bravery, including 11 Victoria Crosses – the highest military award for bravery.“The contribution and sacrifice made by India during the First World War was vital to Allied success,” the CWGC said.Through a virtual experience on the CWGC website, making use of the Commission’s existing extensive records and search facility, the worldwide public will be able to name stars after any one of the 1.7 million Commonwealth war dead in the CWGC’s care.As no mass gatherings at war memorials would be possible this year and a communal two-minute silence also being difficult due to lockdown this year, the CWGC said it wants to ensure that the sacrifices of Commonwealth soldiers are marked on this Armistice Day.It comes as Queen Elizabeth II led the UK’s Remembrance Sunday ceremony and a two-minute silence observed at 11 am local time to commemorate the British and Commonwealth veterans of both the World Wars. This year, the wreath-laying ceremony at the Cenotaph in London’s Whitehall has been considerably scaled down due to the coronavirus lockdown restrictions.With 2.5 million men, the Indian Army of the Second World War was the largest volunteer army in history. Indians served in theatres of war across the world: India and Burma; Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong; the Middle East and North Africa; Greece and Italy.

How to avoid crowds and ensure physical distancing in places of worship will be worked out and a standard operating procedure will be drafted after Diwali.“We are so involved in offering prayers and may neglect COVID-19 safety protocols. What if a coronavirus positive person infects senior citizens from our families who visit the places of worship,” he said.Thackeray said wearing of masks will be mandatory in places of worship. He also appealed to people to avoid bursting firecrackers in public places. “I don’t want to enforce a ban. Let us have faith and trust in each other,” he said.He said Delhi is seeing a surge in coronavirus cases, adding it is said pollution was the cause.“Let us have self control and restrain from bursting firecrackers which will lead to pollution. Let us not waste nine months’ of hard work against the pandemic during four days of Diwali celebrations,” he said.

08-11-2020||New Delhi||Over 1,100 candidates with criminal antecedents contested Bihar Assembly polls||Over 1,100 candidates with criminal antecedents contested the Bihar Assembly polls, according to data collated by the Election Commission.A total of 3,733 candidates were in the fray in the three-phase elections, including 371 women, as per data given out by the Commission on Saturday after the last phase of polling concluded.A total of 1,157 candidates have criminal antecedents, according to the poll watchdog.Following a Supreme Court direction in February this year, the Election Commission had in March asked political parties to justify why they chose candidates with criminal history to contest elections.Assembly elections in Bihar were the first full-fledged polls where such details of their candidates were made public by parties.In September, the EC had made the norms of publicity of criminal antecedents of candidates stringent by putting a timeline on when such advertisements should be published and broadcast during electioneering.In October 2018, the Commission had issued directions making it compulsory for candidates contesting elections and the parties fielding them to advertise their criminal antecedents in TV and newspapers at least three times during electioneering.Now, the EC has made it clear that the first “publicity” of criminal records should be within first four days of the last date of withdrawal of candidature.It said the second publicity should be between fifth and eighth day of the last date of withdrawal.The third and final publicity should be from ninth day till the last day of campaign—two days prior to polling day.“This timeline will help the voters in exercising their choices in more informed manner,” a statement by the Commission had said.An EC official said the timeline would ensure that the advertisements attract the public eye. There was a feeling that candidates time the publicity of their criminal records in such a way that it fails to grab attention.

08-11-2020||Indore||Computer Baba held during demolition drive at his ashram in MP||Self-styled godman Namdeo Tyagi, who had MoS status in the previous Congress government in Madhya Pradesh, was on Sunday arrested along with his six associates in preventive action during the demolition of alleged illegal construction at his ashram near here, police said.Tyagi, who is popularly known as Computer Baba, was appointed as the chairman of a river trust by the previous Kamal Nath-led Congress government in the state.According to Indore administration officials, during an investigation, illegal constructions and encroachments were found on two acres of government land in his ashram premises on the city's outskirts.The ashram is spread over 40 acres land, the market value of it is estimated at Rs 80 crore, they said."The preventive arrests were made under Section 151 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) during the demolition of illegal construction on government land in Tyagi's ashram at Jamburdi Hapsi village on Indore's outskirts," Superintendent of Police (western region) Maheshchandra Jain said.Tyagi and six of his associates have been sent to jail, he added.According to local administration officials, the revenue department imposed a fine of Rs 2,000 on the ashram office-bearers some days back and asked them to remove illegal constructions from the government land.However, as the illegal constructions were not removed, the administration took out the ashram belongings on Sunday and removed the encroachments amid heavy police security, they said.A gaushala (cowshed) and a religious place would be developed on this land now, the officials said.Before being appointed head of a river trust in the Kamal Nath government, Tyagi was given the minister of state status by the previous BJP-led government also in the state.Ahead of the 2018 state Assembly elections, Tyagi parted ways with the then Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government, alleging that illegal sand mining was going on in the Narmada river.Recently, in the run-up to the November 3 by-elections to 28 Assembly seats in the state, Tyagi launched a 'Save Democracy Campaign' and dubbed 22 rebel Congress MLAs who joined the BJP earlier this year as 'gaddar' (traitors).The resignations of the 22 MLAs had led to the collapse of the Kamal Nath-led government in March this year, paving the way for the BJP's return to power in the state.These former Congress MLAs contested the recent by-polls as BJP candidates.

08-11-2020||New Delhi||AG refuses to reconsider decision declining consent to initiate contempt against CM Reddy||Attorney General KK Venugopal has refused to reconsider his November 2 decision declining consent to BJP leader and lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay to initiate contempt proceedings against the Andhra Pradesh chief minister and his principal advisor for making allegations against judges.The topmost law officer, in his reply to Upadhyay’s letter seeking reconsideration of the decision, reiterated his stand saying that the issue of contempt was between Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and Chief Minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy and his principal advisor Ajeya Kallam.Venugopal on Saturday also said in the response that the lawyer was not precluded from raising this issue on his own before apex court judges or during the hearing of a PIL filed by him only seeking the lifetime ban on convicted lawmakers.Upadhyay, on November 5, had urged Venugopal to have a relook on the decision and said, “I humbly request you to peruse these points (particularly the fact that the question of contempt is not pending anywhere else) and kindly reconsider the granting of consent to my request.          “This is an issue of great importance at a time when our judiciary continues to be besieged by attacks, and a strong stand needs to be taken by those of us who are a part of the institution,” he said.In the November 7 reply, Venugopal referred to his earlier response and said, “The very crux of the alleged contempt lies in the contents of the letter written by Y S Jaganmohan Reddy to the Chief Justice of India, and thus open to the Supreme Court to take up the matter of contempt suo motu as provided by the Contempt of Courts Act, and the rules made there under.”               “Given that the CJI is seized of the matter, it would not be appropriate for me to grant consent and preclude the determination of the Chief Justice of India on the matter. As you are no doubt aware, contempt is a matter between court and contemnor, and no person as of right can insist upon the initiation of contempt proceedings,” he said.Venugopal said his decision does not precluded Upadhyay from bringing these facts to the notice of the judges of the Supreme Court with a prayer for initiation of suo motu action.“You may exercise this right by way of information placed on the administrative side or by bringing it to the attention of the court during the hearing of ...where you are already a petitioner in person,” Venugopal said in his letter.Taking the consent of the law officer is a condition precedent for initiating criminal contempt against a person.In an unprecedented move, the chief minister, on October 6, had written to the CJI alleging that the Andhra Pradesh High Court was being used to “destabilise and topple my democratically elected government”.Upadhyay then sought consent of the Attorney General for initiating the contempt against the CM and his advisor.Venugopal, on November 2, termed as “prima facie contumacious” the conduct of Reddy and Kallam for making allegations against the judiciary, but had declined consent to Upadhyay to initiate contempt against them on the grounds that CJI Bobde was seized of the matter.The plea for relook has also been declined.

You take so much work from drivers, this should not be done,” Modi said.Solanki said due to the ferry service he would not require more drivers, to which Modi replied that the ferry service is starting from today.“The thing is when drivers are overworked, they fall asleep while driving which can cause accidents and whatever you have earned will go away with that accident,” Modi said and took a promise from Solanki that he will employ more drivers.On a lighter note, Modi also said the Income Tax department will not raid Solanki if he reveals his plan to purchase more trucks.The comment came after the transporter smiled when the PM asked him if he is planning to buy more trucks.During the video conference, Modi interacted with people from Surat and Bhavnagar on how their life will be impacted by the introduction of the new Ro-Pax ferry service.The service will reduce the 375-km road distance between Bhavnagar and Surat to 90-km by sea route and the travel time from 10-12 hours to about four hours, a release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) earlier said.It will save time and fuel and boost economy and religious tourism in the Saurashtra region of the state, the release said.The three-deck Ro-Pax Ferry Vessel ‘Voyage Symphony’ connecting Hazira in Surat district of south Gujarat and Ghogha in Saurashtra’s Bhavnagar has a load capacity of 30 trucks, 100 passenger cars, and 500 passengers plus 34 crew and hospitality staff, it said.

08-11-2020||New Delhi||Demonetisation 'destroyed' economy, helped few crony capitalists, alleges Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday slammed the government over demonetisation, alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's move four years ago was aimed at helping a few of his "crony capitalist friends" and had "destroyed" the Indian economy.Gandhi and the Congress have been alleging that the 2016 demonetisation was not in the interest of the people and had adverse effects on the economy, a charge the government has dismissed repeatedly.नोटबंदी PM की सोची समझी चाल थी ताकि आम जनता के पैसे से ‘मोदी-मित्र’ पूँजीपतियों का लाखों करोड़ रुपय क़र्ज़ माफ़ किया जा सके।ग़लतफ़हमी में मत रहिए- ग़लती हुई नहीं, जानबूझकर की गयी थी।इस राष्ट्रीय त्रासदी के चार साल पर आप भी अपनी आवाज़ बुलंद कीजिए। #SpeakUpAgainstDeMoDisaster pic.twitter.com/WIcAqXWBqAIn a video released as part of the party's online 'SpeakUpAgainstDeMoDisaster' campaign, Gandhi said the question is how the economy of Bangladesh "surpassed" the Indian economy as there was a time when India used to be one of the highest performing economies of the world. "The government says that the reason is COVID but if that is the reason, there is COVID in Bangladesh and elsewhere in the world also. The reason is not COVID, the reason is 'Notebandi' and GST," Gandhi said in Hindi."Four years ago Prime Minister Narendra Modi began an assault on the Indian economy. He hurt farmers, labourers and small shopkeepers. Manmohan Singh ji said the economy will lose two per cent and that is what we saw," the former Congress chief said.The prime minister had stated that it is a fight against black money, but it was not so, Gandhi said. "This was a lie. The attack was on you, Modi wanted to take your money and give it to his 2-3 crony capitalist friends. You stood in lines, not his crony capitalist friends. You put your money in banks and PM Modi gave that money to his friends and gave them a loan waiver of Rs 3,50,000 crore," Gandhi alleged. Then Modi implemented a "faulty GST" and small, middle-sized businesses were destroyed as "he cleared the way for his 3-4 crony capitalist friends", the Congress leader claimed. Gandhi alleged that now farmers were being targeted with the three new agricultural laws which, he said, would "finish off" them. Modi has "destroyed" the pride of India -- its economy, Gandhi said, and added, "We have to jointly rebuild india".Congress is observing the fourth anniversary of demonetisation as "Vikshwasghaat Diwas" (Betrayal Day).On November 8, 2016, Prime Minister Modi announced the decision to ban all currency notes of higher denomination of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 from midnight.

08-11-2020||New Delhi||CIC allows govt to withhold info on deliberations leading to resignation of Anil Goswami||The Central Information Commission has allowed the Cabinet Secretariat to withhold records of deliberations and file notes leading to the resignation of former Union Home Secretary Anil Goswami, who was asked to put down his papers following allegations of his attempts to stall the arrest of a former minister by the CBI.The panel has based its judgement on a Delhi High Court order in a separate case in which it had held that file notings and deliberations of the Group of Officers or the Disciplinary Authority cannot be disclosed.The court had, however, allowed information on action taken in relation to complaints against an officer to be provided to an applicant.Chief Information Commissioner Y K Sinha buttressed his argument to withhold the information citing a Supreme Court verdict, which had held "..professional records, including qualification, performance, evaluation reports, ACRs, disciplinary proceedings, etc. are all personal information... Such personal information is entitled to protection from unwarranted invasion of privacy and conditional access is available when stipulation of larger public interest is satisfied." Goswami was forced to resign in February 2015 for allegedly trying to stall the arrest of a former Union minister in a case by the CBI.RTI applicant and IPS officer Anurag Thakur had sought to know from the Cabinet Secretariat the details of action taken on a complaint against Goswami, including communication exchanged between various authorities and file notings.Not getting a satisfactory response, Thakur appealed before the CIC.During the hearing, he argued that he wanted the information, including file notings, in public interest "to know the sequence of events which led to the forced resignation of Anil Goswami"."The subject matter which forms the basis of the instant case is disclosure of note sheets and other correspondence exchanged by various offices in the process of considering the complaint filed against Sri Goswami," Sinha noted.He said the contentions put forth by Thakur did not establish the larger public interest which would be served by the disclosure of the noting sheet or the file."Under the circumstances, the response as provided by the Respondent is found to be justified and does not suffer from any infirmity. As such, there is no requirement to interfere with the same," he ruled.

We are against this atrocity against Goswami committed by the Maharashtra government,” he said.A senior police officer said 23 people, including Mishra and Bagga, were detained around 10.30 am as they tried to violate orders and insisted on holding a protest at Rajghat.

The city on Saturday reported 79 deaths, the highest number of fatalities in over four months.Jain, who is on an official visit to Rajasthan’s Dungarpur, said the first wave had hit its peak around June 23 and the second on September 17.“The third wave of COVID-19 is at its peak in Delhi. The number of cases suggests it is the worst wave so far. But the cases will come down soon,” Jain told reporters here.Delhi reported its first case on March 1, when a businessman in East Delhi was diagnosed with COVID-19 after returning from Italy.The minister cited aggressive testing and contact-tracing among reasons for the sudden spike in the number of cases being reported.Jain, however, said laxity on the part of the people has also been a major reason behind the surge.“Some people think nothing will happen to them if they don”t wear a mask. They are wrong. Mask is the only medicine for COVID-19 till a vaccine is developed,” he added.The National Centre for Disease Control, in a report drafted recently, had warned that Delhi needed to be prepared for about 15,000 fresh COVID-19 cases daily taking into account the winter season-related respiratory problems, large influx of patients from outside and festive gatherings.On Friday, Chief Minster Arvind Kejriwal had said that like the previous two waves of coronavirus, the third one would end soon in Delhi as he urged Delhiites to make wearing masks a movement to arrest the spread of COVID-19.“Till there is a vaccine for corona, consider face masks as the vaccine. These are the biggest protection against COVID-19 infection. We need to promote wearing face masks as a movement,” he had said.The national capital on Saturday recorded 6,953 new cases of the infection.Daily cases began rising in the city in September. It started to come down a bit by the last week.The number of people in home isolation in the city stood at 24,100 on Saturday.

As the VP, your contribution to strengthening Indo-US relations was critical and invaluable. I look forward to working closely together once again to take India-US relations to greater heights. pic.twitter.com/yAOCEcs9bN  The PM also embedded with the message a file photo of him meeting Biden.The PM said Harris’ success is path-breaking, and a matter of immense pride not “just for your chittis (aunts in Tamil), but also for all Indian-Americans”. Harris had referred to chittis in her acceptance speech for the Democratic Party ticket which had set out a Twitter storm among Indian Americans in the US.Heartiest congratulations @KamalaHarris! Your success is pathbreaking, and a matter of immense pride not just for your chittis, but also for all Indian-Americans. I am confident that the vibrant India-US ties will get even stronger with your support and leadership.  “I am confident that the vibrant India-US ties will get even stronger with your support and leadership,” he added.Though it was clear that Biden had established an unassailable lead, world leaders holding public office held back their congratulations to Biden-Harris till around midnight here after all US TV networks unanimously placed them ahead of Trump-Pence.Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Opposition MP Rahul Gandhi joined other world leaders not in office to be among the first to congratulate Biden and Harris.Much interest centred on how German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has had a few run-ins with Trump, will react to Biden’s win.As compared to 2016 when her message to Trump was circumspect and preachy, Merkel wished Biden “luck and success from the bottom of my heart”.Other major liberal leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, looked forward to working with Biden with a common set of values.UK PM Boris Johnson, who shares Trump’s worldview, too looked forward to working with the new President on “shared priorities, from climate change to trade and security”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-hopes-biden-will-take-us-india-ties-to-greater-heights-167860

The Military standoff, since May 6, is now six months old.Also read: Ladakh standoff: India, China likely to hold another round of military talks this weekOn November 6, Corps Commander Level Meeting was held in Chushul on the Indian sides and it has failed to break the deadlock. An official statement on Sunday morning said: “Both sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels, and, taking forward the discussions at this meeting, push for the settlement of other outstanding issues, so as to jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas”.They also agreed to have another round of meeting soon.Sources said the continuing disagreement is over the time-line to be followed to vacate areas along the LAC. The two countries don’t have demarcated boundary.This was eight round of talks since June 6 and last substantive positive step which emerged was during the 6th round in September when the two sides agreed not to add more troops at the standoff site.“Te two sides had a candid, in-depth and constructive exchange of views on disengagement along the LAC in the Western Sector of India-China border areas,’ a statement of the Indian Ministry of Defence said on Sunday morning.Both sides agreed to earnestly implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, ensure their frontline troops to exercise restraint and avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation, said the statement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lac-standoff-india-china-talks-fail-to-break-deadlock-167850
08-11-2020||Kolkata||Five of family found dead at their house in West Bengal||Five members of a family, including two children, were found dead at their residence in West Bengal’s Dakshin Dinajpur district on Sunday, a senior police officer said.Bodies of Anup Barman (33), his mother Ulubala Barman, wife Mallika Barman and two daughters—both under 10 years—Beauty Barman and Snigdha Barman were recovered by a team of police officers around 6 am from their residence at Jamalpur village in Tapan police station area.According to the officer, it wasn’t yet clear if this was a case of suicide or murder.Locals noticed Anup’s body hanging from the ceiling of his residence and informed the police.He was suffering from cancer and had little or no money left for his treatment, he said.It could be that all of them were murdered at their residence, or the 33-year-old might have killed his family members before taking own life, he said.“Anup had recently sold a piece of land as he needed money for his treatment. He was finding it difficult to bear household expenses due to his failing health.“Circumstantial evidence suggests Anup killed his mother, wife and children before hanging himself. We are still probing the matter,” the officer said.The bodies have been sent for post-mortem and more details would be available in the case after the report arrives, the officer added.

08-11-2020||Washington||Biden Administration to place high priority on strengthening India-US ties: Campaign||The Biden Administration will place high priority on strengthening the Indo-US relationship by pushing India to became a permanent member of the UN Security Council, continuing co-operation on terrorism, climate change, health and trade, according to a policy paper released by the Biden campaign during the presidential election.Biden, 77, defeated incumbent President Donald Trump in the bitterly-fought presidential election that attracted a record number of Americans to cast their votes.By becoming the US president, Biden has an opportunity of fulfilling his 14-year-old dream to strengthen the India-US ties that he wants to achieve in 2020.“My dream is that in 2020, the two closest nations in the world will be India and the United States. If that occurs, the world will be safer,” Biden had told the now closed down India Abroad newspaper in an interview in December 2006.While it would be tough for him to realise this in 2020, he can definitely achieve it during his presidency starting on January 20, 2021.A policy paper released by the Biden Campaign during the closely-fought election gave an inkling of how he wants to accomplish it.Topping the list is pushing India to became a permanent member of the UN Security Council, continued co-operation on terrorism, strengthening ties on issues like climate change and health working towards a multi-fold increase in bilateral trade.Biden played a lead role, both as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and as Vice President in the Barack Obama administration, in systematically deepening strategic engagement, people-to-people ties, and collaboration with India on global challenges, the policy paper said.“In 2006, Biden announced his vision for the future of US-India relations: ‘My dream is that in 2020, the two closest nations in the world will be India and the United States.’ He has also worked to make that vision a reality, including leading the charge in Congress, working with Democrats and Republicans, to approve the US-India Civil Nuclear Agreement in 2008,” it said.According to the policy paper, he will deliver on his long-standing belief that India and the US are natural partners, and a Biden administration will place a high priority on continuing to strengthen the US-India relationship.“No common global challenge can be solved without India and the US working as responsible partners. Together, we will continue strengthening India’s defense and capabilities as a counter-terrorism partner, improving health systems and pandemic response, and deepening cooperation in areas such as higher education, space exploration, and humanitarian relief,” it said.“As the world’s oldest and largest democracies, the US and India are bound together by our shared democratic values: fair and free elections, equality under the law, and the freedom of expression and religion. These core principles have endured throughout each of our nations’ histories and will continue to be the source of our strength in the future,” it said.Noting that the Obama-Biden administration continued to deepen collaboration between India and the US on strategic, defense, economic, regional, and global challenges, the policy paper said that Biden was a major champion of growing and expanding the US-India partnership.“Recognising India’s growing role on the world stage, the Obama-Biden administration formally declared US support for India’s membership in a reformed and expanded United Nations Security Council. The Obama-Biden Administration also named India a “Major Defense Partner” – a status approved by the Congress – to ensure that when it comes to the advanced and sensitive technology that India needs to strengthen its military, India is treated on par with our closest partners,” it said.“President Obama and Vice President Biden also strengthened our cooperation with India to fight terrorism in each of our countries and across the region. Biden believes there can be no tolerance for terrorism in South Asia – cross-border or otherwise. A Biden Administration will also work with India to support a rules-based and stable Indo-Pacific region in which no country, including China, is able to threaten its neighbours with impunity,” his campaign said.“The Obama-Biden Administration worked closely with India to secure the successful signing of the Paris Climate Agreement to address the global climate crisis that threatens all our peoples,” it said.“A Biden administration would bring the US back into the Paris Agreement, giving us the ability to again work closely with India to fight climate change and once more work hand in hand to reduce our carbon emissions and secure our clean energy future, without which we cannot build the green economy we need,” it said.In the 2006 interview, Biden before taking over the chairmanship of the influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee had argued that India-US relationship is the single-most important relationship that the US has to get right for its own safety’s sake.“There’s so many decades to overcome—some mistrust, some suspicion. The truth of the matter is that notwithstanding the fact that President Bush has followed on from (former president Bill) Clinton and reached out, there is still a lot of scepticism about Bush and his foreign policy ability in India. So there is a lot to overcome,” he said.“This is the single most important development in my view, that’s occurred in the last 20 years with regard to India and it’s the basis upon which we can begin to build...,” he said.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/biden-administration-to-place-high-priority-on-strengthening-india-us-ties-campaign-167841

Your efforts will lead to swifter recognition of Indian products,” Modi said, referring to students as “brand ambassadors” of “brand India”.“The nation has seen how technology can provide good governance and reach the poor and the needy in the last few years,” he said.“Technology has made last mile delivery of services efficient and reduced the scope of corruption,” he added.“You may be disappointed why Covid-19 pandemic happened during our term, but think differently. You have the first advantage to adapt to new norms emerging in the workplace and world. I have realised in every corner of India, some innovation is taking place and it directly correlates with the ideology of Atmanirbhar Bharat,” the PM told the students.A total of 2,019 graduating students were awarded degrees on Saturday.The institute awarded President’s Gold Medal, Director’s Gold Medal, Dr Shankar Dayal Sharma (former President of India) Gold Medal, Perfect Ten Gold Medals and Institute Silver Medals to the graduating students at the convocation.Addressing the students, Union Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said, “Convocation does not mean that education is over. In fact it acts as a strong foundation to your entry into the field of employment.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-promises-ease-of-doing-business-to-iit-students-167688

08-11-2020||New Delhi||Steps to create demand must: PHDCCI chief||At a time when high frequency economic and business indicators have turned positive in recent months, the industry has suggested demand creation measures to sustain this growth trajectory.Demand creation along with increased spending on infrastructure will have a multiplier effect on the economic growth trajectory by boosting private investments, creating new employment opportunities in the country and generating demand for commodities such as steel, cement and power, said Sanjay Aggarwal, president of the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.To give a fillip to the economy, the planned Rs 111 lakh-crore National Infrastructure Pipeline could be financed through borrowings from overseas markets by the issuance of overseas bonds through a special purpose vehicle, he suggested.Diversification in government borrowings will significantly reduce the dependency on the domestic market, leaving more room for the private sector to raise capital for investment. Overseas borrowing at this juncture is a feasible option also because India has significantly better external debt to GDP ratio at 20.6 per cent.While appreciating the reforms undertaken by the government during the last seven months, Aggarwal referred to IMF’s recent growth estimates to suggest that India will figure among the top 10 major economies from 2021 to 2025.Recently, a PHDCCI study estimated that the GDP growth will be around (-) 7.9 per cent for the current fiscal as compared with the median forecasts of (-) 9.3 per cent by other forecasting organisations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/steps-to-create-demand-must-phdcci-chief-167707

08-11-2020||New Delhi||Exit polls give edge to RJD alliance||Several exit polls today gave the RJD-led Opposition alliance in Bihar an edge over the ruling NDA while at least three of them predicted a clear majority for the ‘Mahagathbandhan’, which has projected Tejashwi Yadav as its chief ministerial face.The exit poll outcome appears to have mirrored the crowd surge in the election rallies of Tejashwi, who had sought to galvanise the youth in particular with a promise of 10 lakh government jobs.Most of the exit polls also predicted the RJD to again emerge as the single largest party in the 243-member Assembly along with a clear dip in the seat tally of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led JD(U). The counting of votes will be held on November 10. In 2015, the JD (U) had fought the Assembly election in alliance with the RJD and the Congress among other parties, while the LJP was in the BJP-led NDA alliance. This time, the JD(U) is back in the NDA, while the LJP fought the election alone.The last of the three-phase elections in the state concluded today with a voting percentage of nearly 58 per cent.The combined turnout for the three phases is a little over 56 per cent — 2 per cent higher than in 2015.According to one of the exit poll surveys, the Opposition alliance appeared quite popular among the young voters as it has a 12 per cent edge over the NDA among the voters in the 18-35 age group. But the trend reversed in case of older voters.This is indicative of the fact that the new voters appeared to have no memory linkage to the so-called “jungle raj” of the RJD’s 15 years of rule between 1990 and 2005, which the NDA campaigners trumpeted to the hilt.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/exit-polls-give-edge-to-rjd-alliance-167639

The difference between new cases and recoveries stood at 27,372 on October 27, which fell to 3,564 today (53,920 recoveries against 50,356 infections). For the first time, Delhi contributed the maximum cases — 7,178 — in 24 hours, followed by Kerala (7,002) and Maharashtra (6,870).

08-11-2020||New Delhi||RJD, Congress pin hope  on anti-Nitish sentiment||The RJD-Congress combine is pinning hopes on the anti-Nitish Kumar sentiment to romp home in the Bihar elections and form an alliance government in the state.With exit polls placing the grand alliance ahead of the NDA, Congress leaders today said they would bag anywhere up to 45 seats and even more if the anticipated anti-incumbency factor holds.Congress leaders privately spoke of the anti-Vasundhara Raje sentiment in the 2018 Rajasthan polls to draw parallels with Bihar and said the anger against Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in Bihar was palpable as it was against BJP’s Raje in Rajasthan. The Congress had won Rajasthan, though not comfortably.The leaders also believe Bihar would be a verdict on the BJP recent policies as it is the first state to go to polls after the anti-CAA-NRC protests, followed by the Covid outbreak and the consequent lockdown that left several migrants stranded for days.Many migrants died on their way home after Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared a national lockdown on March 25.“Bihar results will predict the mood of the people as it is the first poll after a series of disruptive developments in the form of Covid and the CAA-NRC agitation,” said a Congress leader of Bihar, a famed bellwether state.The Congress, meanwhile, wants to make sure that the blame for the NDA loss in Bihar, if it happens as predict exit polls, is not laid squarely on the doors of three-term CM Nitish Kumar alone.“If the NDA loses Bihar, the PM would have much to explain,” said a senior Congress leader.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rjd-congress-pin-hope-on-anti-nitish-sentiment-167687
