All the posts of merged cadre will be open for all members of IRMS. Fresh recruitment to IRMS will be done from UPSC civil service exam. Posts requiring technical expertise like those in RDSO will be filled up by different process like the way it is done in ISRO/DRDO,” the official said.They also said the formula for integrated seniority was still under discussion, but Yadav said during the meeting that some element of merit will be taken into account for key posts, not just seniority.The merger services had earlier been proposed by various committees that studied ways of reforming the Indian Railways including the Prakash Tandon Committee (1994), Rakesh Mohan Committee (2001), Sam Pitroda Committee (2012) and the Bibek Debroy Committee (2015).

Among the changes, Putin can run for another Presidential term in 2024.  In the last week of June and less than a fortnight after the Galwan Valley clash, Defence Minister Rajnath had visited Moscow where he met key figures from the Russian military-industrial complex, including Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu and Deputy PM Yury Borisov besides the CEOs of Rostec Corporation and Rosoboronexport.India has also placed orders worth approximately $7 billion on Russian military platforms after the LAC tensions.The MEA spokesperson said Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla spoke with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Morgulov on Tuesday, followed by talks with Russian ambassador to India Nikolai Kudashev on Wednesday. The conversations took place ahead of SCO and BRICS Foreign Ministers’ meeting. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will attend both meetings while Pakistan FM Shah Mehmood Qureshi will attend the SCO meet.Indo-Russia bilateral talks will also be held between the National Security Advisers and Defence Ministers, he added.Immediately after troops from India and China had clashed at the border, at a press conference after the Russia-India-China Foreign Ministers’ meeting, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had indicated a summit meeting of the current format could be held on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Saudi Arabia, the third time the three countries would do so. But nothing has been heard of the proposal since. However, the annual summit meeting between Modi and Putin is scheduled for October in India, provided the pandemic situation eases by then.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/full-calendar-of-engagements-with-russia-mea-122972

It said 227 of the Tablighi Jamaat left India before blacklisting and other actions were taken.The Centre had said separate orders were passed on a case-to-case basis for cancellation of visas and blacklisting of 2,765 foreign nationals for their alleged involvement in Tablighi Jamaat activities in India.It had asserted that grant of visa was not an enforceable right, let alone a fundamental right, and the blacklisted foreigners were being prosecuted under the Foreigners Act.The petitioners had alleged that around 1,500 one-liner e-mails were sent to them regarding visa cancellations and no show cause notices were issued to them for blacklisting from travel to India for 10 years.“En masse blacklisting of the aforesaid more than 2,500 foreigners of about 40 different nationalities, currently in India, without affording any opportunity to prima facie defend themselves, is an egregious and blatant violation of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution,” the petitioners had contended.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/foreign-tablighi-jamaat-members-can-leave-india-despite-pending-trials-centre-to-sc-122967

06-08-2020||New Delhi||Plea in SC seeks postponement of JEE (Main), NEET-UG exams amid COVID-19||A plea in the Supreme Court on Thursday sought postponement of JEE (Main) April 2020 and NEET-Undergraduate examinations, which are scheduled to be conducted in September, amid spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the country.  While referring to the coronavirus pandemic, the plea has sought quashing of July 3 notices issued by the National Testing Agency (NTA), by which it was decided to conduct Joint Entrance Examination (Main) April 2020 and National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET)-Undergraduate exams in September.The plea, filed by 11 students belonging to 11 states, said that the authorities be directed to conduct these exams only after the normalcy is restored.As per the public notices issued by the NTA, JEE (Main) April 2020 is scheduled from September 1-6, while NEET UG 2020 exam is scheduled for September 13.The plea, filed through advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava, has also sought direction to the authorities to increase the number of examination centres for these exams.“Conducting the aforesaid examination across India at such perilous time, is nothing else but putting lives of lakhs of young students (including petitioners herein) at utmost risk and danger of disease and death. The best recourse at this stage can be to wait for some more time, let COVID-19 crisis subside and then only conduct these exams, in order to save lives of the students and their parents,” the plea said.It claimed that NTA, which conducts entrance exams for admission in higher educational institutions in India, has decided to conduct JEE (Main) April-2020 through online mode and NEET UG-2020 exams through offline mode at 161 centres across India.It alleged that NTA has indefinitely postponed the National Council of Hotel Management Joint Entrance Examination-2020, which was scheduled to be conducted on June 22, in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.“While deciding to conduct the aforesaid JEE (Main) April-2020 and NEET UG-2020 exams in the month of September, 2020, the respondents (NTA and others) have overlooked that many states have refused to allow conducting of any professional or non-professional exams in their states at this stage and hence the same is likely to cause unimaginable harassment to the petitioners and other similarly situated students,” it said.“It is respectfully submitted that the students who are well equipped with computer and strong internet connection will give online exams while in other hand the students who are unable to give and arrange online exams, will have to come to exam centres by risking their lives. This is a discrimination between students which must be avoided,” it claimed.The plea has alleged that concerned authorities have ignored the plight of lakhs of students from Bihar, Assam and north eastern states, which are presently reeling under flood, and conducting either online or offline exams in such places may not be possible.

06-08-2020||Vibha Sharma||Basmati GI tag war: MP CM ‘condemns’ Amarinder’s letter to PM Modi||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 6Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday “condemned” Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh for his letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding Madhya Pradesh’ efforts to get a Geographical Indication (GI) tag for its “famous Basmati rice”, terming the move “inspired by politics”.“I condemn the letter written to the Prime Minister by the Congress government of Punjab in the matter of GI tagging of Basmati rice of Madhya Pradesh and consider it politically inspired.“I wish to question the Chief Minister of Punjab, Captain Amarinder Singh, as to what hostility he has with the farmers of Madhya Pradesh. It is not a matter of Madhya Pradesh or Punjab, it is a matter of farmers of the entire country and their livelihood,” an official statement said, quoting Chouhan.Referring to the historical connection of Basmati rice of Madhya Pradesh, Chouhan recently urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to grant a GI status to the state’s Basmati rice “to encourage farmers and Basmati rice based industries”.According to Madhya Pradesh officials, amidst Chouhan’s efforts to get GI tag for the famous basmati rice exported by the State, the Chief Minister of Punjab wrote a letter to Prime Minister yesterday, seeking his intervention in this regard.In his letter, Singh said it would affect the interests of Punjab and other states whose Basmati rice already has a ‘GI tag’.Singh also said Pakistan could also benefit if this happens, as per MP officials. However, according to Chouhan, “The case of Agriculture and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) with Pakistan has no connection with the claims of Madhya Pradesh.“Because it comes under the GI Act of India and has no connection with the claims of Basmati rice within the country. Exporters of Punjab and Haryana are buying Basmati from Madhya Pradesh.“The central government’s export data confirms this. The Central government has been supplying ‘breeder seed’ of basmati rice to Madhya Pradesh since the year 1999,” he said.Chouhan said it is recorded in the then ‘Scindia State’ records that in the year 1944, seeds were supplied to the farmers of the state.The Indian Institute of Rice Research, Hyderabad, has recorded in its ‘Production Oriented Survey Report’ that Basmati rice is being produced in Madhya Pradesh since the last 25 years, Chouhan said,  adding that GI tagging to Madhya Pradesh will stabilise the prices of India’s basmati rice in the international markets and boost the country’s export.“Basmati is being produced in 13 districts of Madhya Pradesh since the year 1908 and has been registered in history. Basmati rice of Madhya Pradesh is considered very tasty and is famous both in the country and abroad for its flavours and fragrance,” he said, adding that IIRR, Hyderabad, and other specialist institutions have confirmed reports in connection with the traditional cultivation of basmati in Madhya Pradesh.Chouhan has sought a Geographical Indication (GI) tag for ‘Basmati’ rice produced in his state.A GI tag is an indication used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to the origin. The tag conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness and plays a major role in trade, improving its prospects. Geographical indications are typically used for agricultural products, foodstuffs, wine and spirit drinks, handicrafts, and industrial products.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/basmati-gi-tag-war-mp-cm-condemns-amarinders-letter-to-pm-modi-122950

They have urged people to wear full-sleeves and use mosquito nets.Water coolers should be dried up when not in use as mosquitoes carrying dengue virus usually breed there. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/31-dengue-cases-in-delhi-till-aug-1-fever-clinics-set-up-campaign-intensified-122947

The CM sent first prasad to me and my family. I am thankful to him that he remembered me.”           “It’s a double delight for us. Firstly, our dream of a Ram temple has been fulfilled. Secondly, we got the first prasad. We hope that now the caste discrimination in the state will end and everyone will think of development and welfare of all,” he said.When contacted, a senior Ayodhya official said due to the COVID-19 protocol, very few people were invited for the ‘bhumi pujan’.“Now, Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra trust and the administration are distributing ‘prasad’ among the maximum number of people.

Our officer went to Mumbai after informing his counterparts there in writing and over phone. I too had sent an SMS to my counterpart in Maharashtra informing him that Tiwari will be there for three days and shared with him the details, Pandey said.Tiwari had requested for an accommodation in the IPS Mess, which was not granted. We let it go. But his forcible quarantine shortly after his reaching Mumbai is unacceptable.The IG, Patna Zone, wrote to the BMC chief quoting the guidelines of the Maharashtra government under which Tiwari could have been exempted from quarantine. It elicited no positive response, he lamented.Pandey said yesterday, when the Supreme Court also frowned upon the treatment meted out to Tiwari and called it "unprofessional", the IGP again contacted the municipal authorities, but nothing came of it."We shall now be waiting till the end of the day and consulting the Advocate General in the meantime. If all else fails, moving the court could be an option, Pandey added.Meanwhile, a four-member team of Patna police which had been camping in Mumbai for more than a week and carrying out investigation in the matter, returned from the western metropolis but refused to be drawn into any controversy relating to the matter.All went fine. We carried out our probe as per the instructions of our seniors. Whatever our findings have been, we will share these with our higher-ups, the officials said in response to a barrage of questions from journalists here upon arrival.They also side-stepped queries about reported non- cooperation by the Mumbai police.During their stay in Mumbai, they recorded the statements of Rajput's sister, his former girlfriend Ankita Lokhande, director Rumi Jaffrey, the late actor's flatmate Siddharth Pithani, his manager, cook, doctors among others, a member of the team earier said before leaving for Bihar.The team had also visited some banks to look into the financial transactions made from Rajput's accounts.The 34-year-old actor was found dead inside his Bandra residence on June 14 last and an FIR was lodged by his father K K Singh, who resides in Patna, at a local police station on July 25.A tug of war ensued between the governments of the two states with Maharashtra contending that Bihar had no jurisdiction in the matter since the death took place outside the state.A petition challenging Bihar police's jurisdiction to probe the case was also filed in the Supreme Court by actress Rhea Chakraborty, who along with her family members has been named as the main accused in the FIR lodged by Rajput's father.She has been accused of abetting the actor's suicide, keeping him in wrongful confinement, and defrauding him of crores of rupees.The impasse led the bereaved father to call up Pandey and request that the matter be handed over to the CBI which was followed, the same day, by a recommendation to the effect by the Nitish Kumar government.The Centre, too, issued a notification approving the recommendation, in an apparent rebuff to the Shiv Sena-NCP- Congress government in Maharashtra that there was no need to hand over the matter to the CBI.

06-08-2020||New Delhi||Bhushan seeks to present additional evidence if SC not satisfied with submissions on tweets||A day after the Supreme Court reserved its verdict, activist lawyer Prashant Bhushan on Thursday moved a plea seeking to present additional evidence if the court is not satisfied with his submissions that the contempt was not made out against him for his two tweets allegedly against judiciary.A Bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra, which on July 22, had issued show cause notice to Bhushan after initiating the criminal contempt against him for his two alleged derogatory tweets against the judiciary, had reserved the verdict on Wednesday.Senior advocate Dushyant Dave defended Bhushan before the Bench, which also comprised Justices R Gavai and Krishan Murari, and had said on Wednesday that the tweets were against the judges regarding their conduct in their personal capacity and did not obstruct administration of justice.In the fresh plea, filed through lawyer Kamini Jaiswal on Thursday, Bhushan said, “In case the court is not satisfied by my preliminary reply and wishes to proceed further in the matter allow me to lead further evidence u/s 17(5) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, after supplying copy of the complaint by Mehak Maheshwari to me...”           Referring to judgements in support of the plea, Bhushan said he had earlier submitted a preliminary reply to explain his tweets and the law laid down on the issue to highlight that the contempt notice was not sustainable.The plea said the second tweet was not allegedly referred to in the contempt petition filed by Maheshwari and hence, it be sent to Chief Justice SA Bobde for placing it before a Bench.“Direct that proceedings as regards the suo motu notice issued to me with respect to tweet of June 27, be placed before the Chief Justice of India for allocation of Bench as per Para 39 of Vijay Kurle...,” the plea said. The court having taken cognisance of the second tweet is required to initiate it as a separate proceeding, it said. While reserving the order in the contempt case, the top court had dismissed a separate petition filed by Bhushan seeking recall of the July 22 order by which notice was issued against him in a contempt proceeding initiated for his alleged contemptuous tweets against the judiciary.It had not agreed the contention of Dave that the separate plea had raised objection against the manner in which the contempt proceedings were started without the opinion of Attorney General K K Venugopal and it be sent to another Bench.Earlier, Bhushan, in his 142-page reply affidavit, had stood by his two tweets. He had said the expression of opinion, “however outspoken, disagreeable or unpalatable to some”, cannot constitute contempt of court. He, in the affidavit, has referred to several apex court judgements, speeches of former and serving judges on contempt of court and the “stifling of dissent” in a democracy and his views on judicial actions in some cases. While referring to the tweets by Bhushan, the apex court had said these statements are prima facie capable of “undermining the dignity and authority” of the institution of the Supreme Court in general and the office of Chief Justice of India in particular, in the eyes of the public at large. Bhushan along with former Union Minister Arun Shourie and veteran journalist N Ram have also moved the Supreme Court challenging the constitutional validity of a legal provision, dealing with criminal contempt on the ground of “scandalising the court”, saying it was violative of freedom of speech and right to equality.

However, Lt Governor Anil Baijal had overturned the government’s decision.In his recent letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had sought his direction to Baijal to allow hotels and weekly markets in the national capital.In the letter, Sisodia had also said that the AAP government would again send the proposal to Baijal to allow reopening of such establishments.

I am sharing today's letter here once again.#DraftEIA2020 https://t.co/T95z9Uj83h pic.twitter.com/fSP9eSqyFH  Javadekar said, "Provision of ex-post facto approval to bring all violators under regulatory regime by imposing heavy penalties. Companies cannot be in perpetual unregulated status."“Every project expansion will require submission of Environmental Management Plan. The draft is not meant for reducing the process of public hearing but making it more meaningful,” wrote the Union Minister.Sharing a copy of this letter on Twitter, Javadekar also criticised Ramesh for publicising his second letter which said he was still awaiting a response from the Environment Minister.Ramesh had earlier in the day tweeted a copy of his second letter saying “although I await your detailed reply, I must thank you for acknowledging and accepting the role of standing committees and Parliament”.Hours later, Javadekar responded over the tweet, “Today morning only I had sent you a detailed response to your July 25, 2020 letter, which was delivered at your residence office, still you chose to write this letter and make it public through Twitter.”"I am sharing today's letter here once again,” Javadekar tweeted while sharing a copy of his letter to the former minister.

06-08-2020||New Delhi||No benefit of plasma therapy in reducing COVID-19 mortality risk, says AIIMS trial interim analysis||Convalescent plasma therapy did not show benefit in reducing mortality risk among COVID-19 patients, according to an interim analysis of a randomised controlled trial done at AIIMS here to assess the efficacy of this mode of treatment.The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those into an active coronavirus infected patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight back the infection.AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria told PTI on Thursday no clear mortality benefit of convalescent plasma therapy was seen during a trial conducted among 30 COVID-19 patients.During the trial, one group of patients was given convalescent plasma therapy along with the standard supportive treatment while the other group only received standard treatment. The number of fatalities recorded in both the groups was equal and there was not much clinical improvement in the condition of patients, he said.“However, this is just an interim analysis and we need to do a more detailed evaluation to see if any sub-group may benefit from plasma therapy,” Dr Guleria said.He also underlined that plasma has to be tested for its safety and should have sufficient antibody to be useful to COVID-19 patients.The efficacy of convalescent plasma therapy in moderate to severe coronavirus-infected patients was discussed in the third National Clinical Grand Rounds (CGR) on COVID-19 held on Wednesday.“Plasma is safe. As far as its efficacy is concerned, we do not have a green signal yet. So the clinical use has to be very judicious and within the ambit of national guidelines,” Dr Monish Soneja, additional professor in the Medicine department at AIIMS, said at the webinar.Convalescent plasma therapy has been listed as an investigational therapy for off-label use in coronavirus infected patients because as of now there is no conclusive evidence for its efficacy, Dr Soneja said.About the initial findings of the randomised controlled trial, Soneja said, “Convalescent plasma is not a magic bullet.”    It may be used particularly in early moderate stage of the disease. There may be a subset of patients with certain characteristics who may benefit from plasma, he said, adding, “This is a work in progress as we do not know those characteristics.”               The findings highlight that relatives of the patients should not insist on plasma therapy until and unless the treating doctor considers the patient fit for it and where he may think that the mode of treatment would be beneficial, Dr Neeraj Nischal, Associate Professor in the department of medicine at AIIMS, said.He said even if the therapy has some role, then that is in the early stage of the disease. But for plasma therapy to be effective, plasma must contain a sufficient amount of neutralizing antibody against that infection, the doctor said.“This therapy also carries risks such as inadvertent transfer of blood-borne infections and reactions to serum constituents, including immunological reactions such as serum sickness, that may worsen the clinical condition,” Dr Nischal said.According to the Clinical Management Protocols for COVID-19 issued by the Union Health Ministry, off-label convalescent plasma may be considered for COVID-19 patients with moderate disease who are not improving, which means oxygen requirement is progressively increasing, despite the use of steroids.The use of off-label convalescent plasma for treating coronavirus patients in the moderate stage of the illness has been included under “investigational therapies”.ABO compatibility and cross-matching of the donor plasma is a prerequisite while considering convalescent plasma, the Health Ministry has said.The recipient should be closely monitored for several hours after transfusion for any adverse events and its use should be avoided in patients with immunoglobulin A deficiency or immunoglobulin allergy.“The dose is variable ranging from 4 to 13 ml/kg—usually 200 ml single dose given slowly over not less than two hours,” the Clinical Management Protocol stats.

An inquiry has been ordered to ascertain the circumstances under which the individual was declared fit for the course," it had said.Singh, working as a water carrier in the 114th battalion of the force, had joined the Jodhpur-based training centre to undergo a physical fitness course on July 15.These fitness courses have been initiated by DG Deswal, who has ordered that all fat and obese personnel in the border guarding force should be identified and sent for physical training.The BSF chief has also directed the medical wing of the force and other senior commanders to "regularly monitor" the eating habits of the troops and officers.He has asked his commanders to ensure that oily food is replaced with nutritious meals in all formations of the nearly 2.5 lakh-strong force tasked primarily with guarding Indian frontiers with Pakistan and Bangladesh."A balanced diet and exercise is the top-most priority. A healthy regime should be the habit in the force," the DG told his force."I am not a fair-weather friend of the country but a foul-weather friend. I have to be the first when it comes to undertaking difficult tasks when a disaster of this scale strikes, that is the pandemic of coronavirus," Deswal had told PTI in June when asked about his decision to order movement of troops held up due to the lockdown in the country.A section of officers, however, questioned the move to resume the training courses amid the rising cases of coronavirus in the country as also in the force.As per the latest data, there have been over 4,660 COVID-19 cases in the BSF till now, out of which around 1,887 personnel are under treatment, while the rest have recovered.Thirteen personnel have succumbed to the infection."The latest cases are largely of those personnel who are being tested in quarantine as they have joined back their units for regular work or are moving for training courses."The death cases are majorly in those instances where the personnel were suffering from a co-morbid condition including a death due to accident and the deceased later tested positive for coronavirus," a senior officer explained.Officials allege that a good number of new cases of COVID-19 infection are being reported from various training centres like those in Kharkan (Punjab), Hazaribagh (Jharkhand), Udhampur (Jammu and Kashmir) and Indore and Tekanpur in Madhya Pradesh."We are witnessing a high number of COVID-19 cases in the country still. While it is essential to continue regular work, it is beyond comprehension as to why the training courses have been resumed? They can be postponed further," a senior officer said.However, others reasoned that all quarantine and isolation measures have been ensured for the personnel, and a uniformed organisation like the BSF cannot just live at home or in the barracks."We will have to live with the virus now by taking all the stipulated precautions," the officer said.A June order issued by the force stating that there was "no need" for personnel to undergo quarantine while reporting for training has been "superseded" by another that says everyone reporting to a training centre will have to undergo a quarantine.The earlier order had stated that personnel should only be taken for medical care if they showed COVID-19-like symptoms.After the completion of a physical efficiency test in Delhi recently, the BSF had said that its field exercise "has helped officers re-boot their confidence level to new highs and would help set an impressive precedent of keeping all ranks combat ready and fit at all places of deployment”.

The ministry has put out an update on Chinese aggression on Line of Actual Control on its website.The report stated that the situation in Eastern Ladakh arising from “unilateral aggression by China continues to be sensitive and requiring close monitoring and prompt action based on evolving situation.” The ministry stated that Chinese aggression has been increasing along the Line of Actual Control and more particularly in Galwan Valley since May 5, 2020.The Chinese side transgressed in the areas of Kugrang Nala, Gogra and north bank of Pangong Tso lake on May 17 and May 18.“Consequent to this, ground level interactions were held between armed forces of both sides to defuse the situation. Corps Commander Level Flag Meeting was held on June 6. 2020. However, a violent face-off incident took place between the two sides on June 15, 2O2O, resulting in casualties of both sides,” the ministry stated.It further pointed out that subsequently second Corps Commander-level meeting took place on June 22, 2020 to discuss modalities of de-escalation process.“While engagement and dialogue at military and diplomatic level is continuing to arrive at mutually acceptable consensus the present stand-off is likely to be prolonged,” the report stated.

Soon, that patient's hair caught fire. I doused it immediately," Patel told reporters after giving his statement to the police.Also read: Fire at Ahmedabad Covid hospital leaves 8 patients dead"Just as I pulled the bed away from the monitor, another attendant's PPE suit caught fire. Luckily, a doctor came upstairs with a bucket of water and poured it on the attendant and saved him."Suddenly, there was a blast inside the ICU ward. Though we went up again to rescue patients, it was not possible to go inside due to thick smoke and extremely low visibility," he added.According to Patel, since other attendants and doctors were feeling uneasy due to the smoke, he decided to stay there and ask others to go downstairs for their own safety.Meanwhile, the hospital staff alerted the fire brigade.Patel added that there were 11 patients on the fourth floor at that time and their rescue was a difficult task."I was the only one left on the fourth floor and I decided to save as many as possible. I first lifted an elderly woman patient, who could not walk, in my arms and took her downstairs," he said.Patel returned to the spot others even as thick smoke had engulfed the area. He helped another elderly woman, who had fallen down and could not walk, in climbing down safely along with a male patient."Since the smoke was getting very dense and my oxygen level was dropping, I couldn't go inside again. I then climbed the fourth floor using outside pipes and tried to rescue the patients from windows, but couldn't break them," he claimed."I am glad that I was able to save three critical patients. For me, a patient's life is more important than my own life," said the attendant.Ravindra Patel, DCP Zone 1, said that the police had recorded the statements of the hospital staff as part of the probe."We also recorded the statement of the attendant, who said he has saved the lives of three elderly patients," said the official.

Now, in our increasingly interdependent world, we have a chance to make this a more peaceful century,” said Dalai Lama in a statement.“On the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, I take the opportunity to urge governments, organizations and individuals to rededicate themselves to making the achievement of peace the centrepiece of our lives,” he said.“When conflicts arise they should be settled through dialogue, not the use of force. We need to eliminate the threat of nuclear weapons, with the ultimate aim of a demilitarized world. War means killing. Violence leads to counter-violence.

06-08-2020||Mumbai||Four-member Bihar Police team probing Sushant Singh Rajput death case leaves Mumbai||The four-member Bihar Police team, which was in Mumbai to investigate the case of actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death, left the city on Thursday, an official said.The police team arrived here on July 28 to probe the ‘abetment to suicide’ case registered by Rajput’s father in Patna against the late actor’s friend Rhea Chakraborty and others.After collecting evidence and recording statements of nearly 10 people, the Bihar Police personnel left the city on Thursday morning, the official said.During their stay in Mumbai, they recorded the statements of Rajputs sister, his former girlfriend Ankita Lokhande, director Rumi Jaffrey, the late actor’s flatmate Siddharth Pithani, his manager, cook, doctors among others, he said.The Bihar Police team had also visited some banks to look into the financial transactions made from Rajput’s accounts, he said.“We collected good evidence in connection with the case and the Mumbai Police also cooperated with us,” one of the officials from the team said.Earlier, Patna City Superintendent of Police Vinay Tiwari, who came to Mumbai on Sunday to supervise the probe being conducted by his state police team, was quarantined by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation at the SRPF guest house in suburban Goregaon.The Supreme Court on Wednesday said the truth behind the actor’s death should come out, even as the Centre informed that it has accepted the recommendation of the Bihar government for a CBI probe in the matter.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and state Home Minister Anil Deshmukh have been saying that there is no need to hand over the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), despite the pressure mounting on them from various quarters.Rajput, 34, was found hanging from the ceiling of his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14.Mumbai Police had registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR) and an investigation is under way in the case.Till now, the Mumbai Police have recorded statements of more than 55 people, including Rajput’s sisters, Chakraborty and some other film personalities.Rajput’s father K K Singh last week lodged a complaint with Patna police against Chakraborty and her family members, accusing them of abetting the actor’s suicide.The Patna police registered an FIR against Chakraborty and six members of her family under various Indian Penal Code Sections, including 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement), 380 (theft in dwelling house), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) and 306 (abetment of suicide).

The Bajrang Dal, however, claimed at least 12 of its activists were injured.Meanwhile, sources said the Additional Director-General of Police (Law and Order), Gyanendra Pratap Singh, has been asked to visit the disturbed areas to assess the situation and he is already on his way.Sonitpur Superintendent of Police, Mugdhajyoti Dev Mahanta, has also been camping at the spot since Wednesday evening.The clashes broke out when the bike-borne activists were going to a temple at Bhora Singori, playing loud music and mouthing slogans.A senior official said locals objected to the booming music and questioned the presence of such a large gathering amid the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to strife.Sonitpur District Deputy Commissioner Manvendra Pratap Singh’s vehicle was vandalised when he reached the spot shortly after the incident, the official said.“To control the situation, which turned into a communal clash, police first lathicharged and then fired in the air. Additional forces were deployed after many bikes and other vehicles were torched... The activists did not have any permission for the procession,” Singh had said on Wednesday.

His outstanding loan of Rs 190 crore was settled at Rs 130 crore, although he did not deserve any concession, the officials said, adding that the probe has revealed that during the demonetisation period the group company had made cash deposits of Rs 1.44 crore and it could not explain the source of the money.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jk-bank-fraud-case-ed-raids-former-j-k-ministers-son-hilal-rather-122898
06-08-2020||Mumbai||Sheena Bora murder case: Court rejects Indrani's bail plea||A special CBI court here rejected the bail plea of Indrani Mukerjea, the prime accused in the Sheena Bora murder case, noting that the possibility of the accused influencing prosecution witnesses cannot be ruled out.After failing to secure bail multiple times on medical grounds, Mukerjea in December last year filed another plea, seeking bail on "merits" of the case.Special CBI court judge JC Jagdale rejected the plea on Wednesday. The court observed that some important case witnesses like Rahul Mukerjea, son of accused Peter Mukerjea, and Vidhi, daughter of Indrani Mukerjea and her former husband and co-accused Sanjeev Khanna, were yet to be examined."There is no doubt that the accused is an influential and wealthy person. Therefore, the possibility of influencing prosecution witnesses cannot be ruled out," said the judge.While arguing for bail, Indrani Mukerjea told court that the prosecution's case was "false and baseless" and she had nearly 120 documents to prove it.She submitted that there was no scientific evidence to prove that the crime happened.She pointed out inconsistencies in the evidence put forth by the prosecution to prove her role as a conspirator and one of the killers of her daughter Sheena Bora.She also raised doubt about the "credibility and legality" of the probe.Indrani Mukerjea claimed there were numerous contradictions in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses, including accused-turned-approver Shayamwar Rai."They have either contradicted their own statements, or the statements of other witnesses, or the prosecutions story itself," she had submitted.However, the judge in his order observed that in the middle of trial, the court cannot declare that the part evidence was either wholly reliable, or partly reliable, or totally unreliable."At the present juncture, the court cannot conclude that the evidence led by Shyamvar Rai (approver) has falsified or suffered from fatal infirmities due to cross-examination of the said witness," the court noted.The judge further observed that at this stage, the trial court could not pass a final conclusion about the evidentiary value of the witnesses."In my opinion, the accused and the advocate concerned should co-operate with the trial court to finish the said trial," the judge added.Indrani Mukerjea is currently lodged at the Byculla women's jail in Mumbai.Last month, the court rejected her another bail plea, citing the risk of contracting coronavirus in the wake of the disease outbreak in the jail.Sheena Bora (24) was allegedly strangled in a car by Indrani Mukerjea, her then driver Shyamvar Rai and Sanjeev Khanna in April 2012.Her body was burnt in a forest in neighbouring Raigad district.Indrani Mukerjea was arrested in August 2015.Former media baron Peter Mukerjea was also later arrested for allegedly being part of the conspiracy. He is currently out on bail, which was granted by the Bombay High Court earlier this year.His 17-year-old marriage to Indrani Mukerjea ended during the period of incarceration as the two got divorced in October last year.

06-08-2020||New Delhi||As heavy rains lash Mumbai, IMD predicts more||As heavy rains lashed Mumbai, the IMD predicted more along the West Coast, Central India, East India, Peninsular parts, Kerala and Karnataka, with scientists attributing the recurrent pattern to “increasing warming of the ocean, pole-ward shift on the low-level jet stream and anthropogenic (human-led) activities resulting in increased carbon emissions.”Monsoon winds over the Arabian Sea are exhibiting large fluctuations due to a warmer environment. Frequency of low-pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal has declined and extra moisture is transported in from the Arabian Sea, aiding Monsoon winds leading to extreme rain episodes across the entire Central Indian belt.Such anomalies will become a recurrent pattern with “increasing warming of the ocean and “pole-ward shift on the low-level jet stream” which impacts the Indian summer monsoon.Warm SSTs over the northern Arabian Sea result in increased moisture and large fluctuations in the monsoon winds.  Urbanisation and other land use, as well as aerosols, contribute to the localised heavy rainfall occurrences, scientists say.Meanwhile, another Low-Pressure Area is likely to develop over the Bay of Bengal around August 9According to studies, widespread extreme rain events across Central India have tripled since 1950, resulting in large scale floods and catastrophic loss for life and property across Central and Northern India – Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Odisha, Jharkhand, Assam and parts of Western Ghats (Goa, north Karnataka and South Kerala)Frequency of localised heavy rain occurrences over India has increased during 1951–2015. There have been 268 reported flooding events in India between 1950-2015, killing and leaving thousands homeless, they suggest.Notably, the rise in extreme rainfall events is taking place over a region where total monsoon rainfall is decreasing. The intensification is against the background of a declining monsoon rainfall makes it catastrophicAccording to a recent report by Ministry of Earth Sciences, ‘Climate Change Assessment over the Indian Region’, with continued global warming and expected reductions of aerosol concentrations in the future, climate models project an increase in the annual and summer monsoon mean rainfall, as well as the frequency of heavy rain occurrences over most parts of India during the twenty-first century.As per a 2017 paper in Nature Communications the frequency of low-pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal has declined and this extra moisture is transported in from the Arabian Sea, aiding Monsoon winds leading to extreme rain episodes across the entire Central Indian belt.Another study by scientists at the New York University claims that a poleward shift in the monsoon low-level jetstream (LLJ), which transports moisture from surrounding oceans to the Indian landmass, has been detected. Dr Roxy Mathew Koll from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology says: “While it is too early for an in-depth analysis of the ongoing floods, what we can say is that there is an increasing trend in heavy rainfall events on the west coast of India.“In our analysis of rainfall data over the last 70 years, we find a three-fold rise in extreme rains along the west coast and central India. This is because the monsoon winds over the Arabian Sea are now exhibiting large fluctuations, thanks to a warmer environment.“Occasional surges in the winds drive a huge amount of moisture supply from the Arabian Sea, across the entire west coast. These episodes result in an intense rainfall spread over three days.“Besides some of my colleagues at New York University have found a slight northward shift of the monsoon westerlies in recent decades, this could mean that the chances of heavy rainfall might be larger towards the north of Western Ghats— but that aspect is yet to be explored.”Dr Anjal Prakash, IPCC’s Lead Author on chapters on urbanisation and mountains, adds: “Some of the Indian cities such as Mumbai, Kolkata, Vizag and Goa are at greater risks due to its proximities to the sea or being in the high-hazard zones.“Mumbai being the richest Indian Municipalities do not have lack of resources to adapt to these climatic events. With proper adaptation measures, some of the impacts of high rainfalls could be avoided”Quoting recommendation of the Madhav Chitale committee, Anjal Prakash says the Mithi River which is the major drainage point in the north has been reduced to an open drain due to severe encroachments and discharge of industrial effluents into the river and its mangrove forests need to be protected by bringing special legislation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-heavy-rains-lash-mumbai-imd-predicts-more-122886

06-08-2020||New Delhi||Palghar lynching: SC asks Maha govt to file status report on inquiry against policemen||The Supreme Court Thursday asked the Maharashtra government to apprise it of the inquiry and action taken against the errant police personnel in the alleged lynching of three people, including two seers, in Palghar district in April.A bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan and R Subhash Reddy asked the state government to also file the charge sheet before it, saying it would like to examine the report.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said media reports suggest that the Charge sheets filed in the case comprised more than 10,000 pages.He said whether there were any policemen involved in the offence or was there any dereliction of duty calling for disciplinary action, that has to be considered by the court.The bench posted the matter after three weeks.On June 11, the top court had sought a response from the state government on two petitions seeking separate probes by the CBI and the NIA into the alleged lynching. The bench was hearing petitions including the one filed by sadhus of 'Shri Panch Dashban Juna Akhara' and relatives of the deceased seers.  Their plea alleged the investigation by the state police was being conducted in a biased manner. The other plea, seeking an NIA probe into the incident, has been filed by Ghanshyam Upadhyay. Besides the Maharashtra government, one of the petitions has arrayed the Centre, CBI and the director-general of police of Maharashtra as respondents in the matter. The three victims from Kandivali in Mumbai were travelling in a car to attend a funeral at Surat in Gujarat amid the COVID-19 nationwide lockdown when their vehicle was stopped and they were attacked and killed by a mob in Gadchinchile village on the night of April 16 in the presence of police. The victims were identified as Chikne Maharaj Kalpavrukshagiri, 70, Sushil Giri Maharaj, 35, and Nilesh Telgade, 30, who was driving the vehicle. While hearing a separate plea seeking a CBI probe in the case, the top court had on May 1 directed the Maharashtra government to submit a status report on the investigation in the matter. The plea filed by 'sadhus' of 'Shri Panch Dashban Juna Akhara' has sought transfer of the probe to the CBI, claiming that there is "reasonable apprehension of bias" if Maharashtra police proceed with the investigation."Several video clippings have emerged on social media and news reports which very clearly demonstrate the active involvement of the police present, who can be seen handing over the three persons to the unlawful assembly of persons gathered," the plea has claimed. The police have arrested over 100 people in connection with the case.

06-08-2020||Washington||China became ‘more aggressive’ during Covid-19, deployed troops along LAC: US Defence Secy||The world has seen China become “more aggressive” during the COVID-19 pandemic, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper has said, asserting that the country has deployed troops along the Line of Actual Control with India and is acting out in a way that is “inconsistent” with international norms.Esper said Beijing was trying to use the coronavirus tragedy to their advantage for “propaganda purposes”.“What we have seen with regard to what happened in the last seven months coming as part of COVID, if you will, we’ve seen China become more aggressive, trying to use the tragedy, of COVID-19 to their advantage for propaganda purposes. They have really overplayed their hand and we’ve seen them continue to try and exercise this muscle in the South China Sea,” he said on Wednesday.Beijing claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory. China has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.Beijing has impeded commercial activity like fishing or mineral exploration by countries like Vietnam and the Philippines, claiming that the ownership of territory belonged to China for hundreds of years.Responding to a question during Aspen Security Forum discussion, Esper said that the Chinese sank a Vietnamese fishing vessel a few months ago.“They continue to twist the arms of others. They’ve deployed troops along the line of actual control in India. We see them acting out in a way that is inconsistent with, you know, international norms, rules of behaviour, if you will, and many of our allies and partners are reacting as well,” he said.His remarks came amid the border face-off between India and China in eastern Ladakh.Twenty Indian Army personnel were killed during the clashes with Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15. The Chinese side also suffered casualties in the clashes but it is yet to give out details.The number of casualties on the Chinese side was 35, according to a US intelligence report.The Defence Secretary praised Australia and the UK for pushing Huawei out of their systems or lauded the Australians for a brand-new defense strategy that has long-term commitment to funding.According to Esper, the best way to take on the Chinese aggression is to multilateralise efforts against Beijing.“...The US being unable to travel, we found new ways to communicate and to do it in a multilateral way. We need to continue to advance that. We need to multilateralise those. Maybe not officially, right? But in terms of knitting things up so we talk more as a group,” he said.“That’s the best way to push back against China and its bad behaviour in the Pacific. And I see that as another positive outcome, if you will, of us being unable to travel. We found new ways to communicate and to do it in a multilateral way, and I think we need to continue to advance that,” Esper said.The threat posed by China is not region, but global, he said.“The China competition, by the way, is not limited to Indo PACOM, it is a global competition so we see them in all parts of the world. So it’s multifaceted and it requires tough decisions and look, we are making those tough decisions as best we can,” Esper said.Responding to another question, Esper said that he did not see China right now as an inevitable threat that the US is going to have a fight with.“But we do have to compete, and we have to be much more vigorous in all domains if you will whether it’s again diplomatic, informational, military, political,’ he said.

06-08-2020||New Delhi||SC to hear on August 20 Mallya's review plea on transfer of USD 40 mn to his children||The Supreme Court Thursday said it would hear on August 20 the petition filed by businessman Vijay Mallya, who has sought review of its 2017 order holding him guilty of contempt of court for transferring USD 40 million to his children.The matter came up for hearing through video-conferencing before a bench comprising Justices U U Lalit and Ashok Bhushan, which adjourned it as one of the documents was not available on the record.The apex court had in June directed its registry to explain as to why Mallya's review petition had not been listed before the concerned court for the last three years.It had directed the registry to furnish all the details including names of officials who had dealt with the file concerning the review petition in the last three years.The fugitive businessman had filed the petition seeking review of the apex court's May 9, 2017 order by which he was held guilty of contempt of court for transferring USD 40 million to his children in violation of the order.Mallya, who is an accused in a bank loan default case of over Rs 9,000 crore involving his defunct Kingfisher Airlines, is presently in the United Kingdom.The apex court's 2017 order had come on a plea by a consortium of banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI), which had said that Mallya had allegedly transferred USD 40 million received from British firm Diageo to his children in "flagrant violation" of various judicial orders.It was dealing with pleas of lending banks seeking contempt action and a direction to Mallya to deposit USD 40 million received from offshore firm Diageo respectively.The banks had then alleged that Mallya concealed the facts and diverted the money to his son Siddharth Mallya and daughters Leanna Mallya and Tanya Mallya in "flagrant violation" of the orders passed by the Karnataka High Court.Mallya had in May lost his application seeking leave to appeal his extradition to India in the UK Supreme Court, setting a 28-day clock on his removal from the UK.The UK top court's decision marks a big legal setback to the 64-year-old flamboyant businessman, who had earlier lost his high court appeal against an extradition order to India on charges of alleged fraud and money laundering related to unrecovered loans to his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines. Mallya has been based in the UK since March 2016 and remains on bail on an extradition warrant executed three years ago by Scotland Yard on April 18, 2017.

She was 63. Belonging to a family whose association with the city went back centuries, Dehlvi's Twitter profile read, “Columnist and author Sufism: The Heart of Islam & The Sufi Courtyard: Dargahs of Delhi. I live in Delhi, a city I love.” Dehlvi, who wrote about women, minorities, Islamic spirituality and Delhi's heritage and culture for more than 40 years, was laid to rest on Thursday at the city's Shidipura cemetery. A woman of many talents, Dehlvi also produced and scripted documentaries and television programmes, including "Amma and Family" (1995), with veteran actor Zohra Sehgal in the lead. She was also a close friend and confidante of the late Khushwant Singh, who dedicated his book "Not a Nice Man to Know" to her."To Sadia Dehlvi, who gave me more affection and notoriety than I deserve," he wrote. Singh's book "Men and Women in my Life", which has a chapter dedicated to her, also has Dehlvi's photo on its cover."Hers was a very illustrious family... I won't be exaggerating one bit if I tell you that the family was always leading from the front to keep Urdu alive in India,” Yasir Abbasi, who used Dehlvi's help for his book "Yeh Un Dinon ki Baat Hai", told PTI.Dehlvi, who belonged to the royal Shama family, edited the Urdu women's journal Bano. Her grandfather Hafiz Yusuf Dehlvi founded the iconic Urdu film and literary month Shama in 1938.“Under the Shama group, they launched other periodicals as well, including Bano and Khilona. Today we can't even imagine how popular the magazine Shama was. It was found in every Urdu speaking household," Abbasi said. Dehlvi was passionate about food, much like her family, which famously hosted Bollywood stars such as Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor and Waheeda Rehman in their palatial ‘haveli'."The Dehlvis' spacious house Shama Kothi in Delhi's tony diplomatic enclave of Chanakyapuri had become home to many visiting film stars. Their parties were the talk of  town. Food was something that the family was very passionate about. Sadia often talked about the many kebabs they used to serve in those parties," said Abbasi.In 1979, Dehlvi founded Al Kauser, the Chanakyapuri restaurant famous for its kebabs, with her mother. At the age of 60, she donned the hat of a chef and tied up with ITC to celebrate the capital's authentic cuisine over a six-day dinner buffet festival – Delhi Table spread.In 2017, she wrote "Jasmine & Jinns": Memories and Recipes of My Delhi", a book on Delhi's culinary history."She was in every which way ‘of Delhi'. She wrote about the food and culture of the city 30 years ago, a time when writing about Delhi was not fashionable like today. She was a true raconteur — she wrote about stories which she had not read or heard, but virtually lived," said author and friend Rakshanda Jalil."I remember Sadia was the kind of person who would travel across cities just to meet older people — her parents' friends, or her friends' parents, when they would be ailing or even otherwise, just to meet them for 10 minutes, with no agenda. That is the singular quality about her that I will always remember," Jalil told PTI.“Sad to hear about the tragic demise of Sadia Dehlvi, a well known cultural figure of Delhi, a dear friend and a wonderful human being.

06-08-2020||New Delhi||India firmly rejects China's attempt to raise Kashmir issue at UNSC||Hitting out at China for making yet another effort to raise the Kashmir issue at the UN Security Council, India on Thursday asked Beijing to draw proper conclusions from such “infructuous attempts” and “firmly” rejected its “interference” in the country’s internal affairs.China backed an attempt by Pakistan to discuss the Kashmir issue at the UN Security Council on Wednesday, coinciding with the first anniversary of the reorganisation of Jammu and Kashmir by India.However, the attempt did not succeed.In its reaction, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said it firmly rejects China’s interference in India’s internal affairs.“We have noted that China initiated a discussion in the UN Security Council on issues pertaining to the Indian Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.“This was not the first time that China has sought to raise a subject that is solely an internal matter of India. As on such previous occasions, this attempt too met with little support from the international community,” it added.The MEA further said:”We firmly reject China’s interference in our internal affairs and urge it to draw proper conclusions from such infructuous attempt.”             The fresh move by China to internationalise the Kashmir issue came at a time it is engaged in a bitter border row with India in eastern Ladakh.On August 5 last year, India announced its decision to withdraw special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcate the state into two union territories.China has been critical of India’s reorganisation of J-K, and has particularly criticised New Delhi for making Ladakh a union territory. China lays claim over several parts of Ladakh.Following India’s decision, China made multiple attempts to raise the Kashmir issue in the UN Security Council. However, these attempts were rejected by other member nations of the global body.

An FIR was registered on August 23, 2019.Shekhawat was not named an accused in the chargesheet filed by the SOG in connection with the case. In the investigation, the money trail was found to be linked to Navprabha Buildtech Private Limited.Later, a magistrate's court also rejected an application to include him in the chargesheet.The applicants then approached the ADJ court, which issued directions that their complaint should also be probed.The SOG has already sent a notice to the minister in connection with a probe into a separate case pertaining to audio clips which purportedly indicate efforts to lure MLAs away from the Congress.

06-08-2020||New Delhi||August 5: Abrogation of Article 370, last year; Ram temple, this year; UCC, next year?||August 5 is emerging as an important date for the ruling BJP in the second term of the Narendra Modi Government.Last year on August 5, the Narendra Modi government 2.0 revoked the special status granted under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution to Jammu and Kashmir, fulfilling a key promise of BJP manifestos in past years.On Tuesday, again on August 5, Prime Minister Modi laid the foundation stone for a grand temple at the site believed to be the birthplace of Lord Ram in Ayodhya, marking the formal launch of another promise by the ruling BJP three decades earlier.It was the second core issue of the BJP that saw fruition after the Central government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.The establishment of a uniform civil code in the country is the third poll plank the saffron party has been holding for decades.The issue revolving around replacing personal laws based on scriptures and customs of religious communities with a common set of rules for all citizens has been raging for decades. Speculations are rife if that will be the next issue the BJP-led NDA government has on mind for August 2021.A Ram Temple at Ayodhya, Abrogation of Article 370 and implementation of Uniform Civil Code (UCC) were three core issues of the BJP on which it had been contesting elections, repeatedly mentioning them in Lok Sabha poll manifestos.Notably, the Ram Temple in Ayodhya yesterday marked the culmination of a decades-long movement that catapulted the saffron party to the political centre stage three decades back.Incidentally, it also marked the fulfilment of PM's "resolve" to not go to Janmabhoomi in Ayodhya till he was in a position to "fulfil aspirations of millions of Hindus".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/august-5-abrogation-of-article-370-last-year-ram-temple-this-year-ucc-next-year-122848

The blaze spread in the ward within minutes,” said Kumar.According to Chirag Patel, a hospital attendant who saved the lives of three elderly patients, there were eleven patients on the fourth floor when the fire broke out.The deceased were identified as Lilavati Shah (72), Jyoti Sindhi (55), Ayesha Tirmizi (51), Navneet Shah (80), Arif Mansoori (42), Narendra Shah (62), Arvind Bhavsar (78) and Manu Rami (82).Additional Commissioner of Police RV Asari told reporters that Bharat Mahant, a trustee of the hospital, was being questioned.Chief Minister Vijay Rupani ordered an inquiry by Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Sangeeta Singh and her counterpart in the Urban Development Department Mukesh Puri.The two IAS officers have been asked to submit the inquiry report in three days, the Chief Minister’s Office said in a statement.Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel said that another attendant received 25 to 30 percent burn injuries while trying to save the patients. The attendant and 41 patients were shifted to SVP Hospital, he added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed grief over the incident and announced ex-gratia compensation of Rs 2 lakh for the kin of the deceased and Rs 50,000 for the injured.“Saddened by the tragic hospital fire in Ahmedabad.

China is advised not to comment on the internal affairs of other nations. "We have noted the comments of the Chinese MFA spokesperson on the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. The Chinese side has no locus standi whatsoever on this matter and is advised not to comment on the internal affairs of other nations," he said.India's reaction came hours after Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in Beijing that any unilateral change to status quo of Jammu and Kashmir is illegal and invalid.Earlier in the day, China had said it hoped that India and Pakistan could “properly” handle their differences through dialogue, improve relations and jointly safeguard peace, stability and development of both countries and the wider region.Responding to a question raised by a Pakistani correspondent on the completion of one year of the revocation of special status to Jammu and Kashmir and its bifurcation into two union territories — Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh — Wenbin said: “China closely follows the situation in the Kashmir region. Our position is consistent and clear. This issue is a dispute left over from history between Pakistan and India.”“Any unilateral change to the status quo is illegal and invalid. This issue should be properly resolved peacefully through dialogue and consultation between the parties concerned,” he said.

06-08-2020||Aditi Tandon||Wary Cong reacts  in differing voices||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 5Absence of the word “welcome” stood out in the responses of top Congress leaders today as Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the consecration ceremony of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.The grand old party’s lasting dilemma over the three decade-old issue was evident in the way former party president Rahul Gandhi reacted to the ground-breaking event.“Lord Ram is the ultimate embodiment of supreme human values and can never appear in cruelty, hatred or injustice,” Gandhi said today seeking to ask if the BJP’s brand of politics was a true marker of Lord Ram’s legacy. Gandhi has consistently attacked the BJP as “divisive and polarising,” and his response today gave away his hidden message.While Gandhi spoke in one voice steering clear of welcoming the event, former ministers Anand Sharma and Manish Tewari did congratulate devotees on the occasion.“The construction of a grand Ram Temple was a long-standing aspiration of devotees in Ayodhya and the world. Today that dream has been realised. Best wishes to all Ayodhya residents and Lord Ram devotees,” Anand Sharma said with Tewari also sending out congratulations to people.Former MoS Shashi Tharoor lashed out at the ruling party after its leaders shared a Twitter poster showing PM Modi walking Ram Lalla to the temple. Attacking the BJP for its “arrogance” in showing the Lord smaller to Modi (whose image was larger than Ram Lalla’s in the poster), Tharoor said , “You people have neither learnt love nor sacrifice, neither learnt compassion nor care.

He said no institution should be free from public criticism.On Tuesday, it had reserved its order in an 11-year-old contempt case against Bhushan in which the lawyer has expressed regret, but refused to apologise.With regard to the suo motu contempt case, the top court Registry refused to accept a petition filed by 16 activists seeking to intervene in it.During the hearing, Dave tried to impress upon the Bench that Bhushan’s tweets critical of CJI SA Bobde and former CJIs didn’t amount to scandalising the judiciary.“He criticises the court because of love and affection for the institution. He did not impute any motive. Please don’t misunderstand him,” Dave submitted.On behalf of Twitter, senior counsel Sajan Poovayya said his client was only an intermediary in this case. “There are 50 crore tweets every day.

Speaking about parts where Lord Rama is venerated, he said: “You will find description of Lord Rama and Rama Katha even in Iran and China”Equating the groundbreaking ceremony for Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir here today with Independence Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said just as the freedom movement, the mandir movement received people’s support from across the country.Clad in a cream dhoti, golden kurta and a mask, PM Modi laid the foundation stone for the Ram Temple at Ayodhya in the culmination of a campaign that fuelled the rise of the BJP and marked the fulfilment of one of its core poll promises.The Sikh connect“Tulsi’s Ram was with form (sagun), while Nanak’s Ram was formless (nirgun)... In Bangla, we have Krittibas Ramayan, while Guru Gobind Singh has written Gobind Ramayan,” said PMIn his 35-minute address after the ‘bhoomi pujan’, the PM said: “The way generations had struggled for Independence, which was achieved on August 15, generations had struggled for centuries for the Ram Temple cause, which is being fulfilled on August 5.“The way Dalits, adivasis and all members of society helped Mahatma Gandhi in the freedom struggle…, the construction of the Ram Temple has started due to the support of people from across the country.”“Every heart is illuminated, it is an emotional moment for the entire country... A long wait ends today,” said the PM.Expressing anguish at “Ram Lalla” (infant Ram) living in a tent for years, the PM said: “I feel fortunate to have been given the opportunity by the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust to witness this historic moment.”Stressing that Lord Ram was a common thread of unity in diversity of the nation, the PM said: “Ram belongs to all and is within all.”Describing the upcoming grand temple as the modern symbol of Indian culture, faith and national sentiment, Modi said it was the proof of a collective resolve of crores of devotees, not only in India but also around the world.In a clear departure, PM Modi started his address by raising the pre-mandir movement slogan of ‘Jai Siya Ram’, instead of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ that has come to symbolise the political ‘Ram without Sita’ associated with the mandir movement.The PM emphasised that the coming up of a grand temple would usher in economic prosperity for the region as it would bring tourists from across the world.During the minute-long auspicious window of the ‘bhoomi pujan’, PM Modi laid a 40-kg silver brick with a silver trowel marking the symbolic beginning of the construction of the temple and fulfilment of a long-standing commitment of the BJP to build a Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.Defines India’s spiritIt defines India’s spirit of social harmony and people’s zeal.

If Ashok ji (former chief of the VHP) were here, it would have been such a source of joy for us. There are also those who could come but couldn’t be called, the situation is such.”The “bhoomi pujan”, he said, was the culmination of 30 years of intense work put in by the RSS and the then sarsanghchalak, Balasaheb Deoras, had told ‘pracharaks’ like him that building the temple would take 20-30 years of sustained efforts.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-chief-salutes-kar-sevaks-122758

China on Sunday suggested this step to break the deadlock in the disengagement process along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh.New Delhi’s decision has been conveyed to Beijing through the hotline in Ladakh following a meeting of the National Security Adviser Ajit Doval- led China Study Group on Tuesday evening.At the Lt General-level meeting on Sunday, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China was adamant about not moving back (eastwards or further away from the LAC) from its position at Finger-4. The withdrawal of PLA troops from Finger-4 is one of the three conditions set by India for restoration of the status quo ante, as on April this year.Instead, China asked India to move back to break the deadlock. The area west of Finger-4 was always firmly under Indian control and Beijing asking the Indian Army to move back was not acceptable, sources said. The 3-km buffer zone between troops of either side had been established already at Finger-4 as part of the disengagement process. “To ask us to move further away from the LAC was not acceptable,” added the sources.Besides the stretch between Finger-4 and Finger-8, considered “grey area”, sources said the other areas of contention are patrolling points 17 and 17-A.
