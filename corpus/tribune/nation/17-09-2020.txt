17-09-2020||K V Prasad ||Oldest allies, Sena first and now SAD, on path of separation from BJP||Tribune News Service New Delhi, September 17 The Shiromani Akali Dal on Thursday night its fired first salvo within the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance by pulling out its lone representative in the Union Council of Ministers.The move signalled a fissure in the three-decade old association the regional party from Punjab has had with the BJP. That Harsimrat Kaur Badal referred to it in her resignation letter reflects that ties forged by the BJP veterans Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani may have lost the sheen the partnership mutually benefitted since 1996. Ironical it may seem that during the last one year, the BJP relations with two of its oldest and staunch supporters – the Shiv Sena and the SAD -- have slid down. While the Shiv Sena moving away could be explained to a political compulsion of forming a government in Maharasthra, there is no such apparent pressure on the Akalis. The elections to the State Assembly is still a good 17-odd months away. The SAD has stopped short of taking a clean break from the BJP. Now that the three Agri-Bills the SAD is opposed to are on course to get a parliamentary nod, the Akalis may have to work on its political calculations on its maintaining the alliance with the national party. Yet, it chose to step out of the Modi government on a day the BJP celebrated the birthday of the Prime Minister as a start of a ‘Sewa Saptah’ (Week of Service).||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/oldest-allies-sena-first-and-now-sad-on-path-of-separation-from-bjp-142577
17-09-2020||United Nations||India at UN cautions against linking environmental degradation to peace and security||India at the UN on Thursday cautioned against “securitisation” of environmental issues, saying linking up everything related to environmental degradation to peace and security does nothing to address climate concerns meaningfully nor does it ensure that real perpetrators adhere to their commitments on environmental issues.Environmental degradation can have humanitarian impact or effect just as many other aspects of human activity have humanitarian dimensions, India said in a statement to the UN Security Council's high-level open debate on maintenance of international peace and security: Humanitarian Effects of Environmental Degradation and Peace and Security.“However, merely to link up everything related to environmental issues with peace and security does nothing to enhance our understanding of the problem; nothing to help us address these issues in a meaningful way and does nothing to call out the real perpetrators and make them adhere to their commitments on environmental issues or help change behaviour of people at subsistence level,” it said.India said that in many cases, perpetrators of environmental degradation might well be “outside national boundaries” while the people suffering were inside.“Is peace and security then the right paradigm to address this issue or is strengthening implementation of agreements, an appropriate and probably a more effective way to do it?” it said.India said there had been an increasing tendency both in the Security Council and outside to start discussing environmental issues with a certain “disregard” for the various important principles which govern environmental discussions, including climate change and biological diversity.Principles such as common but differentiated responsibilities are sacrosanct in this matter, it said.India cautioned that “steering away from these principles and other commitments and attempting to discuss such issues by obfuscating those responsible for addressing them will only do a disservice to the real issue rather than making it more meaningful to address them”.“Consequently, linking up environmental degradation to humanitarian effect and then to peace and security does not enhance our collective effort to address environmental degradation in any meaningful way,” India said.It also said that there was need for a collective will to address such important issues multi-dimensionally without shirking commitments under important conventions such as the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, Convention on Biological Diversity, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and Paris Agreement.“What we need therefore is greater resolve to implement the commitments and contributions undertaken under environmental agreements instead of ‘securitisation' of environmental issues,” India said.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has consistently said that big emitters such as the US, China, the European Union, Japan, Russia and India must commit to carbon neutrality in 2050.He had also called on India and other G20 countries to invest in a clean, sustainable transition, particularly as they recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June launched the auction process for 41 coal blocks for commercial mining, a move that opened India's coal sector for private players, and had termed it a major step in the direction of India achieving self-reliance.Guterres has voiced concern over countries doubling down on domestic coal and opening up coal auctions, saying this strategy will only lead to further economic contraction and damaging health consequences.At the UNSC debate, India noted that there is need for a greater sensitivity in connection with the energy mix of various countries many of which are not of their choosing.“One should resist the temptation of painting all countries with varied energy mix with the same brush. The touchstone should be whether respective commitments are being adhered to and not demonising one particular energy source and calling for action without allowing for organic energy transitions which require huge financial commitments,” India said.India stressed that environmental degradation is a multi-dimensional issue and it affects not just the ecosystem but also the people who depend and live on it.New Delhi noted that environmental degradation can be caused by those who live on it due to a range of inter-related factors, which may be poverty and not necessarily greed.“In many developing countries, such problems arise from issues related to people living at subsistence levels. The question then is: Do we want to treat poverty and subsistence agriculture as peace and security issues?” India asked.India asserted that even the best science available does not indicate that environmental degradation is a threat to peace and security.Highlighting its role as the leading contributor to ‘climate action', India said over the past few years, the country has reduced 38 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually.In the course of the last decade, around three million hectares of forest and tree cover has been added, which has enhanced the combined forest and tree cover to 24.56 per cent of the total geographical area of the country, it said.Going forward, India aims to restore 26 million hectares of degraded and deforested land and achieve land-degradation neutrality by 2030.The country has also set additional targets of eliminating single-use plastic by 2022 and installing 450GW of renewable energy by 2030.

17-09-2020||Washington||US provided ‘strong and unambiguous support' to India during border crisis with China: White House official||The US provided "strong and unambiguous support” to India during its current border crisis with China, which is engaged in increasingly aggressive behaviour throughout the Indo-Pacific even during the coronavirus pandemic, a senior White House official said on Thursday. From a bilateral perspective, China's recent actions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India has further reinforced the importance of the US-India strategic partnership, Lisa Curtis, the deputy assistant to President Donald Trump, said in a virtual panel discussion organised by Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think-tank."Whether it was cutting off Vietnam's access to its fishing waters, undermining Hong Kong self-rule, deploying military submarines to threaten Japan or contesting Indian territorial sovereignty along the LAC, Beijing has engaged in increasingly aggressive behaviour throughout the Indo-Pacific, even as the global community has grappled with coronavirus pandemic,” Curtis said. The crisis has strengthened America's resolve to work towards building its relationship with India as a bulwark against Chinese aggression, she said during the discussion on research scholar Darshana Baruah's recently released paper, “India in the Indo-Pacific: New Delhi's Theater of Opportunity”. "Throughout the crisis, the US has provided strong and unambiguous support for India, and our cooperation has certainly grown closer. We are encouraged by India's strong yet responsible approach to the Chinese aggression,” said Curtis, who is the Senior Director for South and Central Asia on the National Security Council (NSC) at the White House."While always seeking to de-escalate through diplomatic means India also demonstrated military and economic resolve,” Curtis said as she asserted that the Indo-Pacific strategy, which was introduced in 2017 was designed to foster a stable free open and rules-based order."This order is not only for the benefit of the US. It is for the benefit of all countries that pride their sovereignty and independence. The Indo-Pacific strategy, of course prioritises building relations between the US and India, because we view India as an emerging global power that shares our goals of ensuring this region remains peaceful, stable, and with the prospect of growing prosperity,” she said. America's strategic partnership with India is really founded on shared commitments to freedom, democratic principles and the rule of law. It is based on a convergence of strategic interests, centred on promoting global security instability, she said. Noting that the Trump administration elevated the US relationship with India in ways not seen by any other administration, she said that the joint statement that was signed by President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi following the former's visit to India in February is testament to this administration's commitment to building the vital partnership.Curtis said that the US has strengthened the QUAD mechanism among the leadership of the US, Japan, India and Australia. At the outset of the Trump administration the Quad was really not even officially meeting."But starting in November 2017, we started regular dialogue of the QUAD at the Assistant Secretary Director General level. And by September 19, we had the quad meeting at the ministerial level for the first time ever. Additionally, President Trump has met twice in the trilateral format with Indian and Japan; first at the G-20 Buenos Aires in December, 2018, and then again in Osaka, at the G-20 in June 2019,” she said.Both the QUAD and trilateral formats are really important for strengthening the institutional support and fostering that multinational cooperation that will contribute to a free and open Indo-Pacific, Curtis said.“Such mechanisms help check Chinese aggression, and which has increased since the onset of the global pandemic," she added.Tension in eastern Ladakh increased manifold following the Galwan Valley clashes on June 15 in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. The Chinese side too suffered casualties, but it is yet to give out the details.The situation deteriorated again after China unsuccessfully attempted to occupy Indian territory in the southern bank of Pangong lake on the intervening night of August 29 and 30.China is also engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. Beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are vital to global trade.China claims almost all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims over the area.

17-09-2020||Ajay Banerjee||Lok Sabha passes 2 agri sector Bills amid protests by Opposition, farmers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, Sept 17Amid widespread protest by farmers across the country, the Lok Sabha passed two more farm sector-related Bills.This even as Shiromani Akali Dal, a part of the ruling NDA combine, protested against the bills. Harsimrat Kaur Badal, a Union minister and Akali MP, resigned from the Cabinet.The Congress and almost the entire Opposition opposed the Bills terming them as ‘anti-farmer’.The House passed the two Bills — ‘The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020’ and the ‘Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020’.More than five hours of debate ensued before the Bills were passed around 9.45 pm on Thursday.Sukhbir Singh Badal, the President of the Akali Dal and MP from Ferozepur, said “the Bills will ruin what we have created as agriculture infrastructure in Punjab in the past 50 years”. He opposed the Bills vehemently.Ravneet Singh Bittu, Congress MP from Ludhiana opposed the Bills and termed these as ‘black laws’. He asked the Central Government, “why are you intervening, agriculture is a state subject”.Bittu asked the government to not implement this in Punjab and Haryana, and try it out in other states. Punjab, he said, was a border state, ‘don’t needle it’. “Sometime you raise SYL and then you come up such Bills,” he said.Punjab Congress MPs Gurpratap Singh Aujla, Jasbir Singh Dimpa also opposed the Bills. AAP MP Bhagwant Mann was among the opposers to the Bill. The TMC, the AAP and the BSP also opposed the Bills. The Shiv Sena supported the government, the BJD wanted it to be sent to the standing committee.Justifying the Bills, Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Narendra Singh termed them as ‘revolutionary’. “Farmer will be free to sell produce anywhere and to anyone, freeing him from selling the produce only at the designated ‘mandi’. Sales done outside the mandi will attract no tax of Centre or state governments.”The Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), will remain in states, Tomar said, adding that Bills should not be criticised for political reasons. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) system will continue and no contract will be allowed between private trader and farmer that can affect land holding of farmer. Even in case of dispute, the land of the farmer cannot be sold to recover any damages.Tomar assured that Narendra Modi government is committed to protect the rights of farmers. The government has paid Rs 92,000 crore to farmers across the country through the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme.The government says the Bills will provide for the creation of an ecosystem where the farmers and traders enjoy the freedom of choice relating to sale and purchase of farmers’ produce. Also, it will provide for a national framework on farming agreements that protects and empowers farmers to engage with agri-business firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters or large retailers for farm services.On September 16, the Lok Sabha cleared the ‘Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020’, amid strong objection from Opposition MPs, who termed the move “anti-farmer and pro-hoarder and pro-corporate”.The Lok Sabha that assembled for the day at 3 pm on Thursday was adjourned till 4 pm following obituary reference to Tirupati Lok Sabha MP Balli Durga Prasad Rao. He was undergoing treatment for COVID-19 and died at a hospital in Chennai on Wednesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lok-sabha-passes-2-agri-sector-bills-amid-protests-by-opposition-farmers-142569
17-09-2020||New Delhi||BRICS NSAs prepare anti-terrorism draft||A virtual meeting of National Security Advisors (NSAs) from BRICS countries on Thursday reviewed a draft anti-terrorist strategy which will be submitted for approval during the upcoming summit.It will be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Presidents Vladimir Putin, Jair Bolsonaro, Xi Jinping and Cyril Ramaphosa.The draft strategy reflects fundamental aspects for BRICS countries such as respect for sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs, adherence to international law and recognition of the UN’s central and coordinating role in security matters.The NSAs also discussed the prospects for cooperation between the BRICS states in the field of biological security. Though Ajit Doval represented the Indian side at the videoconference chaired by his Russian counterpart Nikolai Patrushev and also attended by Yang Jeichi who was earlier China’s Foreign Minister and Special Representative on Border Affairs.Though Doval and Yang were digitally at the same conference, there was no opportunity for them to speak bilaterally.The dialogue that took place showed the unity or similarity of the approaches of BRICS members on most issues on the international agenda.The adherence to the universal as well as international law was reaffirmed, said a Russian Foreign Ministry statement. The NSAs also exchanged views on key issues of global and regional security, and discussed the main areas of practical cooperation in the field of security.As chair, Russia managed to insert its themes such as “the inadmissibility of organising colour revolutions, as well as campaigns to discredit the political leadership of unwanted countries”.The Kremlin is backing the incumbent regime of Alexander Lukashenko against a groundswell of protests alleging electoral fraud.The Russian Ministry note said, “An exchange of views took place on issues of strategic stability during which the destructive plans of the US on the deployment of weapons in space was noted.”Significantly, the NSAs reaffirmed their openness to multilateral discussion on possible measures to ensure predictability and restraint in the nuclear missile sphere.The NSAs appreciated the WHO’s coordinating role in the fight against the pandemic and noted that “at all stages of the spread of infection”, WHO acted within its mandate. The US has taken a different stand, accusing the WHO of delay in notifying the pandemic due to pressure from China.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/brics-nsas-prepare-anti-terrorism-draft-142567
17-09-2020||---||Kisan Sangharsh coordination panel calls for nationwide bandh on Sept 25||New Delhi, September 17The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) has given a call for a nationwide bandh on September 25 in protest against three agriculture Ordinances brought by the Central government.AIKSCC has decided to “forcefully go ahead with its opposition to the three Agriculture Ordinances brought by the Central Government and new bills based on these or under consideration of the Parliament”.“AIKSCC will launch a massive resistance against these new Acts on September 25 with a call for an all-India bandh and resistance protests by farmers as well as observe this year’s 114th birth anniversary of Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh on September 28 to highlight the pro-corporate, anti-farmer acts of the Central government – the three Ordinances, the New Power Bill 2020 and the steep hike in Diesel and Petrol prices,” according to a statement.“These 3 Bills/Acts will completely stop government procurement of crops, bringing to a grinding halt the price security for peasants as private mandis shall be set up and price and trade regulation of all cereals, all pulses, all oilseeds, onion and potato shall be removed from coverage under essential commodities,” it said. According to the farmers’ organisation, BJP president JP Nadda’s assurance that MSP will continue “is a blatant lie as Shanta Kumar committee appointed by this BJP government declared that only 6% farmers enjoy benefit of MSP, that it should be wound up, that FCI and NAFED procurement should stop and that food grain supply under PDS should stop”.World over, in all countries, barring none, price security for farmers’ produce is always provided for by government, not by companies, which only buy cheap to sell dear and earn huge profits, it said. “Crop once produced has to be sold, otherwise it will perish and lose value.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kisan-sangharsh-coordination-panel-calls-for-nationwide-bandh-on-sept-25-142565

17-09-2020||New Delhi||Sudarshan TV defends programme ‘UPSC Jehad’ in SC||Sudarshan TV on Thursday defended in the Supreme Court its programme on alleged “infiltration of Muslims in civil services”, saying it was not against their entry but has used the term ‘UPSC Jehad’ based on information that ‘Zakat Foundation’ received funds from various “terror-linked organisations”.The top court had restrained the channel on Tuesday from telecasting the episodes of ‘Bindas Bol’ for two days saying that “the intent” of the episodes “prima facie” appeared to “vilify” the Muslim community.In an affidavit, Suresh Chavhanke, Editor-in-Chief of the channel, sought lifting of the stay from airing the remaining six episodes and said that there was “no justification to continue the pre-telecast/prior restraint direction”.The affidavit said: “The Answering Respondent (Chavhanke) has used the words “UPSC Jehad” because it has come to the knowledge...through various sources that Zakat Foundation has received funds from various terror-linked organisations.“It is not that all contributors to the Zakat Foundation are terror-linked. However, some of the contributors are linked to organisations or are organisations that fund extremist groups.“The funds received by the Zakat Foundation, in turn, are used to support aspirants for IAS, IPS or UPSC”.Zakat Foundation provides training and study materials to Muslim students who aspire to join civil services.“When it comes to light through various sources that funds contributed by tainted organisations are being used to facilitate people joining UPSC, there is a serious issue requiring public debate, discussion and scrutiny...“There is no statement or message in the four episodes broadcast that members of a particular community should not join UPSC. UPSC is an open competitive examination and members of every community may participate in the entrance examination and qualify..,” the journalist said in his 91-page affidavit.In the response to the plea filed by lawyer Firoz Iqbal Khan, seeking banning of the programmes, the channel said the thrust of its episodes was that there appeared to be a conspiracy which needed “to be investigated by NIA or CBI” as the “terror linked organisations” were apparently funding the Foundation in India, which in turn has been supporting Muslim UPSC aspirants.“Terrorism is a global menace. There are several international organisations that provide monetary support to extremists. The spread of extremist philosophy is undesirable and it is imperative that cross border funding that could encourage the spread of extremism should be stamped out,” the affidavit said and referred to the offshore organisations which are funding the foundations.Referring to records, including the FCRA papers of the Ministry of Home Affairs, the affidavit said the Zakat Foundation has received donations from various organisations such as ‘Muslim Aid (UK)’ and moreover it has links with Zakir Naik as well.“Zakir Naik’s Islamic Research Foundation has been banned under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, (UAPA). The Cabinet note regarding the ban said that Zakir Naik has been promoting enmity between religious groups and inspiring Muslim youth in India and abroad to commit terrorist acts,” the reply affidavit said.Calling himself an investigative journalist, Chavhanke referred to various documents and said it appeared that Zakat Foundation of India has received funds from “terror tied Zakat Foundation of America (Khalil Demir) who has a direct/indirect link with Benevolence International Foundation (BIF) and Turkish Humanitarian Relief Organization (IHH) both of which have terror links.“Reports also stated that Turkish Humanitarian Relief Organization (IHH) distributed aid to the Salafist group Ahrar al Sham, which fought alongside ISIS and the al-Qaida affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra.” The journalist said the minority community has been taking quota benefits of the OBC and the minority scheme simultaneously and the same being a “political and social issue” can be debated in the media.The top court would hear on Friday the plea which has raised grievance over the programme whose promo had claimed that the channel would show the ‘big expose on conspiracy to infiltrate Muslims in government service’.Meanwhile, the Centre has also filed an affidavit in the matter and said if the apex court decides on the issue of media regulation then such an exercise should be undertaken with the digital media first as it has faster reach and information has the potential to go viral due to applications like WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook.The government has told the apex court that sufficient framework and judicial pronouncements exist for the electronic and the print media. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sudarshan-tv-defends-programme-upsc-jehad-in-sc-142557

At that point, key conspirators were guiding their foot shoulders about violence in the area. The key conspirators were directly in touch with their foot shoulders,” police said.It said that “WhatsApp group were used by conspirators for violence in Seelampur Jafarabad area. There were 25 protest sites. 25 WhatsApp groups were especially created for each. The impression was given that they were anti-CAA protest group but through these sites conspirators were being guided.”Special cell said that Tahir Hussain, Khalid Saifi and Umar Khalid had allegedly planned to carry out massive violence in the capital during US President Donald Trump’s visit in Delhi.In the charge sheet, which discusses the conspiracy behind the Delhi riots, the police have claimed that “on January 8 Tahir had met Umar Khalid and Khalid Saifi at Shaheen Bagh sit-in protest. Meetings subsequently also took place in the PFI office in Jamia Khalid Saifi instigated Tahir.”        “Umar reportedly assured that through his contacts (in PFI) logistical support etc will be provided,” police said.It said the probe is still underway and police will file a supplementary charge sheet in the matter.Investigators have reportedly alleged that the Popular Front of India (PFI) is an extremist and militant Islamic fundamentalist organisation formed as a successor to National Development Front (NDF) in 2006, and often have been involved in anti-national and anti-social activities.The communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

17-09-2020||Mumbai||Bollywood shows solidarity with Urmila Matondkar after Kangana Ranaut’s ‘soft porn star’ comment||Many actors and filmmakers from the industry, including Ram Gopal Varma, Swara Bhasker and Pooja Bhatt on Thursday praised Urmila Matondkar’s vast body of work after Kangana Ranaut controversially slammed the “Satya” star as a “soft porn star”.Matondkar had called out Ranaut’s claims about nepotism in the industry and Bollywood being riddled with a drug problem.In an interview with Times Now on Wednesday night, Ranaut called her a “soft porn star” who is not known for her acting.Ranaut’s comments were met with criticism from the industry, with many hailing Matondkar’s consistent “grace and dignity” throughout her career of over 25 years.Varma, who has worked with Matondkar in many acclaimed films like “Rangeela”, “Satya” and “Bhoot”, said the 46-year-old actor has proved her talent time and again.“Not wanting to get into slinging matches with anyone, I believe that @UrmilaMatondkar has more than proved her versatile talent in enacting such diversely complex roles as in ‘Rangeela’, ‘Satya’, ‘Kaun’, ‘Bhoot’, ‘Ek Haseena Thi’.”       Bhasker tweeted a list of “outstanding performances” of Matondkar, right from her debut as a child actor in “Masoom”, to Sriram Raghavan’s “Ek Hasina Thi” in 2004 and said she has always marvelled the actor.“Dear @UrmilaMatondkar ji, remembering ur outstanding performances in ‘Masoom’,  ‘Chamatkaar’, ‘Rangeela’, ‘Judaai’, ‘Daud’, ‘Satya’, ‘Bhoot’, ‘Kaun’, ‘Jungle’, ‘Pyaar Tuney Kya Kiya’, ‘Tehzeeb’, ‘Pinjar’, ‘Ek Hasina Thi’ among others and have marvelled at your acting chops and brilliant dancing! Love you.”                Anubhav Sinha said Matondkar was one of the most “beautiful, elegant, evocative, expressive” actors ever.“Sending you love @UrmilaMatondkar,” the “Thappad” director tweeted.Ranaut, who has been in the headlines for her provocative statements, claimed that the “liberal brigade” was falsely equating being a porn star to “something derogatory”.The actor said she fails to understand the outrage since the former porn star was “accepted” by the country at large.“Liberal brigade once virtually lynched a renowned writer in to silence for saying people like Sunny Leone should not be our role models, Sunny is accepted by the industry and entire India as an artist, suddenly fake feminists equating being a porn star to something derogatory,” Ranaut said.Others in the fraternity also came out in support of Matondkar, including actors Pooja Bhatt, Sayani Gupta and screenwriter Kanika Dhillon.Calling Matondkar a “legend”, Bhatt said with her performance in “Rangeela”, the actor had “raised the bar” for all her contemporaries.“You left us all, co-actors and an entire generation of movie goers, awestruck! Sensuality and dignity. Two qualities you combined and embodied. Respect,” Bhatt tweeted.Ranaut’s comments about Matondkar come a day after she criticised veteran actor and Rajya Sabha MP Jaya Bachchan for raising her voice in the House against those defaming the Hindi film industry.Writer Kanika Dhillon said both, Bachchan and Matondkar, should be lauded for their graceful conduct.“Amidst all the madness -appreciation tweet for #JayaBachchan Ji and @UrmilaMatondkar for speaking out and shining through with grace and dignity and showing how women in the industry can lead, protest and conduct themselves gracefully without vilifying others all at the same time! #WomenOfCourage,” she added.

It is implicating those who participated in anti CAA-NRC-NRR agitation, and political leaders opposed to ruling BJP dispensation at the Centre.They alleged that the police was shielding BJP leaders, including Union Minister Anurag Thakur and MP Parvesh Verma, and Kapil Sharma who made hate speeches calling for violence before the outbreak of the riots."The Delhi Police under the direction of the Union Home Minister is orchestrating a script that is linking peaceful anti-CAA-NPR-NRC protests to this violence," the leaders alleged.Consequently, many innocent activists, well known intellectuals and political leaders are being targeted, they added.They drew Kovind’s attention to the naming of senior political leader Sitaram Yechury in a supplementary charge-sheet relating to the violence.Expressing outrage, they said  such a "manufacturing of conspiracy" by the Delhi Police "is a diversion from identifying and punishing the perpetrators of this communal violence".The victims of this violence are being arrested while the perpetrators are let scot free, they added.Riots had broken out in north-east Delhi amidst the high passion of anti and pro CAA stir in February. More than 50 persons lost their lives in the violence.The police are also investigating the conspiracy angle relating to the violence.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-leaders-meet-president-seek-probe-into-delhi-riot-cases-142541

The MEA had then too thanked Kabul for its “constant and unwavering support” in securing their release.These Indians were working for Maharashtra-based KEC in an area that has seen pioneering work by India after the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001.KEC owns an electricity substation contract in the area and has over 60 Indians working at different locations across Afghanistan.India had built the power transmission line from Pul-e-Khumri, close to where the kidnapping took place, to Kabul as part of several development projects in the aftermath of the ouster of the Taliban government in 2001.One Indian had returned in March last year and three came back last October in exchange of 11 Taliban prisoners.The countryside of Baghlan province where the kidnapping took place has swung between the Taliban and US-backed forces several times and is now reportedly a major kidnapping centre.However, more worryingly, Pakistan has started throwing spanners in Indian developmental projects by accusing Indian engineers working on development projects as terrorists.Pakistan’s attempt to escalate the issue, however, backfired after the UNSC did not agree with its demand to list some of them as international terrorists.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kidnapped-indian-returns-home-mea-thanks-afghan-government-142537

Significantly, all three aspire for a permanent UNSC seat although South Africa is bound by a common African position.India is also attempting to expand the UNSC through the G-4 route in which two developed countries Japan and Germany have joined hands with India and Brazil from the Global South corner.The IBSA said the failure to reform the UNSC had serious implications for peace and security as also for its legitimacy which rests on whether its composition was equitable and reflective of the aspirations of the UN’s membership.South Africa’s Minister of International Relations Grace Naledi and Brazil Vice-Minister for National Sovereignty Fabio Marzano led their respective delegations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ibsa-seeks-speedier-unsc-reforms-142532

This can be attributed to the detrimental effect that the pandemic has had where the technological advancement was not up to date,” the report said.It further added that “Indian cities have suffered more from the pandemic because they were not prepared”.From 15 indicators that the respondents perceive as the priority areas for their city, all four cities highlighted air pollution as one of the key areas that they felt their city needed to prioritise on.For cities like Bangalore and Mumbai, this was closely followed by road congestion while for Delhi and Hyderabad it was basic amenities, the report said.The 2020 Smart City Index (SCI) was topped by Singapore, followed by Helsinki and Zurich in the second and the third place respectively. Others in the top 10 list include Auckland (4th), Oslo (5th), Copenhagen (6th), Geneva (7th), Taipei City (8th), Amsterdam (9th) and New York at the 10th place.In SCI’s context, ‘smart city’ describes an urban setting that apply technology to enhance the benefits and diminish the shortcomings of urbanization.The second edition of the SCI ranked 109 cities worldwide by capturing perceptions of randomly chosen 120 residents in each city.Hundreds of citizens from 109 cities were surveyed in April and May 2020 and asked questions on the technological provisions of their city across five key areas: health and safety, mobility, activities, opportunities and governance.Reflected in this year’s rankings is that cities have ever differing approaches to technology as managing the pandemic has become increasingly important in local politics, the report said.“We cannot ignore the impact of COVID,” said IMD’s Professor Arturo Bris, who led the work of the ranking as the Director of the World Competitiveness Center at the Swiss management institute which is behind it. Those with better technology manage the pandemic better. Smart cities are not the solution, but technology helps,” he explained.“Smart cities closer to the top of the rankings seem to deal with unexpected challenges of the devastating pandemic with a better outcome,” remarked Professor Heng Chee Chan, Chairperson of the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities at SUTD.

17-09-2020||Washington||5 Chinese nationals charged in mega hacking scheme, Indian govt networks hit: US||The US Justice Department has charged five Chinese citizens with hacking over a 100 companies and institutions in America and abroad, including the Indian government's networks, and stealing valuable software data and business intelligence.Deputy US Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen on Wednesday announced three indictments have been unsealed in the matter that collectively charges five Chinese nationals with computer hacking and charge two Malaysian nationals for helping some of those hackers target victims and sell the fruits of their crime.The Malaysian nationals were arrested on Sunday and the Chinese nationals have been declared fugitive, according to a Justice Department statement.Rosen severely criticised the Chinese government."The Department of Justice has used every tool available to disrupt the illegal computer intrusions and cyberattacks by these Chinese citizens. Regrettably, the Chinese Communist Party has chosen a different path - of making China safe for cyber-criminals so long as they attack computers outside China and steal intellectual property helpful to China," the deputy attorney general said."In about 2019, the conspirators compromised Government of India websites, as well as virtual private networks and database servers supporting the Government of India. The conspirators used VPS PROVIDER servers to connect to an Open VPN network owned by the Government of India," the indictment said.In the attacks, the conspirators installed 'Cobalt Strike' malware on Indian government-protected computers, it added.According to the charges, the computer intrusions affected over 100 companies in the United States and abroad.The victims ranged from software development, computer hardware, telecommunication, social media and video game companies. Non-profit organisations, universities, think-tanks, foreign governments, pro-democracy politicians and activists in Hong Kong were also targeted.Security researchers have tracked the intrusions using labels "APT41,” “Barium,” “Winnti,” “Wicked Panda,” and “Wicked Spider.” These intrusions facilitated the theft of source code, software code signing certificates, customer account data, and valuable business information, the researchers said.These intrusions also facilitated the defendants' other criminal schemes, including ransomware and “crypto-jacking” schemes, the latter refers to the group's unauthorised use of victim computers to mine cryptocurrency.The Chinese hackers also targeted government computers and networks of Vietnam and the United Kingdom. The hackers, however, were not successful in compromising the government computer networks in the United Kingdom.The racketeering conspiracy pertained to the three defendants' conducting the affairs of Chengdu 404 Network Technology (“Chengdu 404”), a Chinese Government company, through a pattern of racketeering activity involving computer intrusion offences affecting over 100 victim companies, organisations, and individuals in the United States and around the world, including in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, the Justice Department said."Today's announcement demonstrates the ramifications faced by the hackers in China but it is also a reminder to those who continue to deploy malicious cyber tactics that we will utilise every tool we have to administer justice,” said FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich.Noting that the scope and sophistication of the crimes are unprecedented, Acting US Attorney for the District of Columbia Michael R Sherwin said some of these criminal actors believed their association with the Peoples Republic of China provided them free licence to hack and steal across the globe."This scheme also contained a new and troubling cyber-criminal component -- the targeting and utilisation of gaming platforms to both defraud video game companies and launder illicit proceeds," Sherwin said.Rosen told reporters that as an additional method of making-money, several of the Chinese defendants compromised the networks of video game companies worldwide -- a billion-dollar industry -- and defrauded them of in-game resources.“Two of the Chinese defendants stand accused, with two Malaysian defendants, of selling those resources in the black market, through their illicit website,” he said.Asserting that the Chinese government has the power to help stop crimes like these, Rosen alleged that the Chinese Government has made a deliberate choice to allow its citizens to commit computer intrusions and attacks around the world because these actors will also help them. --PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/5-chinese-nationals-charged-in-mega-hacking-scheme-indian-govt-networks-hit-us-142487

Please don't mind but a Rajput who belongs to Maharana Prataps clan cannot hang himself by a rope," Yadav said on Wednesday while inaugurating a newly-built road in Saharsa, his assembly constituency."I am pained... Sushant Singh Rajput should not have hanged himself with a rope. He was a Rajput and should have fought instead... Rajputs first kill others before dying, he said.Maharana Pratap was not only the ancestor of Rajputs but also that of the Yadavs, the legislator said.The comments triggered widespread criticism as the actor's death has turned into a major issue in the state ahead of the elections that is likely to be held in October- November."There cannot be a more bizarre and shameful statement than the one made by the RJD MLA on the death of Sushant Singh Rajput, which has moved the entire nation. The MLA should seek an apology from the people of the state and Sushant's fans," JD(U) spokesperson Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said.Condemning the remark, BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said RJD leaders and workers are "habitual offenders" and this is evident from the humiliation meted out to senior leader Raghuvansh Prasad Singh by Lalu Prasads eldest son Tej Pratap Yadav who compared him to "ek lota pani" (a pot of water).Tejashwi must clarify and explain his position whether he supports the likes of MLA Arun Yadav and Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Choudhary on the issue of Sushant Singh Rajput, Kangana Ranaut and Rhea Chakraborty, Anand said.People will give a befitting reply at an "appropriate time", he said, referring to the assembly election.Sushant Singh Rajput's death case is currently being probed by CBI and other central agencies.KK Singh, the actors father, lodged an FIR at the Rajiv Nagar police station in Patna in July, nearly 40 days after his son was found hanging from the ceiling of his Mumbai residence on June 14.

17-09-2020||---||BJP counter’s AAP accusation on COVID-19 management with Gandhi’s ‘charkha’||New Delhi, September 17The Rajya Sabha on Thursday witnessed heated exchanges between the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the BJP over the issue of managing COVID-19 pandemic in the country with the former claiming it “foolish” to ask people to clap and beat utensils, which was countered by later by giving the example of Mahatma Gandhi bringing “charkha” as a symbol of national cohesion.While participating in a debate on COVID-19 in the House, AAP’s Sanjay Singh said: “I want to ask this government, tell me anyone research in the world that shows COVID can be prevented by clamping utensils and by clapping. The entire opposition will not go home but will clap with the Prime Minister and light ‘diyas’ in the Parliament premises.”Noting that the government had brought “such absurd and foolish schemes and expect the entire country to be fooled by you”, Singh further used the occasion to hit at the government to look for opportunity in times of disaster and alleged corruption in the procurement of equipment to fight the disease, including thermometers and oximeters.Countering the accusation, BJP’s Sudhanshu Trivedi hit back saying Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s move was symbolic and sought to unite the country socially just like Mahatma Gandhi chose the symbol of “charkha” for national cohesion during the freedom struggle.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in March asked people to clap, beat steel plates and ring bells to express gratitude towards COVID-19 frontline warriors, who are saving others’ lives while risking their own.Trivedi added: “Burning diyas and beating utensils and clapping were symbolic in the fight against coronavirus. Would the British have run away by the use of the ‘charkha’? The ‘charkha’ was symbolic which Mahatma Gandhi chose in uniting the country against the British. The same way, Prime Minister Modi made ‘diyas’ and beating utensils symbolic in bringing together all Indians in the fight against COVID.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-counters-aap-accusation-on-covid-19-management-with-gandhis-charkha-142474
17-09-2020||Mumbai||Rhea Chakraborty was in 'waiting area' during her morgue visit: SHRC||Spelling huge relief for the Maharashtra government, the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has concluded that in her much-publicised and controversial alleged visit to the Cooper Hospital morgue, Bollywood actress Rhea Chakraborty was only in the permitted 'waiting area', a top official said here on Wednesday."We have accepted the contentions of the Mumbai Police and the BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) after examining their detailed replies and all other supporting documents. The matter is now disposed of," SHRC acting Chairman M.A. Sayeed told IANS.As per the replies submitted to the SHRC by the BMC, there is a 'waiting area' where certain categories of people such as relatives are permitted.The autopsy room is barred for all except the doctors and their attending staff, while the main morgue is absolutely out of bounds for everybody except those specifically authorised to enter it."From all the records made available, the person concerned (Rhea) was only in the designated 'waiting area' and not beyond that point. This is the spot where she may have viewed the body of the late actor (Sushant Singh Rajput)," Sayeed added, throwing the shroud over the controversy.According to official sources, the video may have been shot when Sushant's body was in the process of being handed over to his relatives, including his sister Mitu Singh, in the waiting area of the morgue.The video later went viral as "Rhea's morgue visit" when she reportedly spent 45 minutes and allegedly muttered "I am sorry" on seeing Sushant's body.Last month, a massive row erupted after some TV channels aired the clip showing Rhea—currently in judicial custody—allegedly visiting the morgue at the R.N. Cooper Hospital in Vile Parle, hours after Sushant's death at his Bandra home on June 14.After getting the complaint, the SHRC took suo moto cognizance of the matter and slapped notices to the BMC (which runs the hospital) and the Mumbai Police demanding an explanation in the matter on priority.On August 31, BMC hospital Dean Pinakin Gujjar had submitted a brief letter stating that it had not granted any such permission while the police did not respond.The CCTV footage of the waiting room was automatically erased after a week and it was not preserved as nobody had foreseen such a fracas over the incident, said official sources.Apparently dissatisfied with the BMC reply, the SHRC sought a detailed reply and also sent a reminder to Mumbai Police to comply with its earlier notice.After both, the parties responded and the SHRC scrutinised the replies along with the supporting evidence, it was satisfying and concluded that the norms were not flouted.

17-09-2020||New Delhi||SSR case: CBI team back in Delhi; to meet AIIMS forensic board||Almost a month after the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) went to Mumbai to probe the death of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput, it has returned to Delhi and will hold a meeting next week with the AIIMS forensic team, sources said on Thursday.According to the CBI sources, the team of the SIT returned to Delhi on Wednesday and will now be holding meetings with the AIIMS forensic team on Sunday and later in the coming week also to take its medico-legal opinion in the case.The team had gone to Mumbai along with the forensic team on August 20, a day after the Supreme Court gave its nod to the CBI probe into the death of the late actor.During the CBI’s stay in Mumbai, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) forensic team also visited the flat of Sushant and recreated the crime scene along with Sushant’s sister Mitu, Pithani and personal staff.The CBI last month had roped in the AIIMS Forensic Department to take its assistance in studying the autopsy report prepared by Cooper Hospital, the crime scene recreation and to guide the federal agency if there was any foul play in his death.Sushant was found dead in his Bandra flat on June 14.AIIMS Forensic Department head Dr Sudhir Gupta has constituted a medical team to assist the CBI.AIIMS sources said: “We are in the process of perusal of the case after the due medical board meeting and subsequent meeting with the CBI. The AIIMS Forensic Department medical board’s opinion will be given to the CBI, and hoped it will present a total conclusive report without any confusion or doubts.”The source, however, said the reports could not be shared as the matter was sub judice.He further said next week, the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) findings and the CBI investigation findings have to be understood before a final medical opinion is arrived at.The CBI team during its stay in Mumbai recorded the statement of Sushant’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty, her brother Showik, father Indrajit, his house manager Samuel Miranda, flatmate Siddharth Pithani, former celebrity manager Shruti Modi, talent manager Jaya Saha, personal staff Neeraj Singh, Keshav Bachne, Dipesh Sawant and several others.The CBI team also recorded the statement of Sushant’s sister Mitu Singh in Mumbai, his father KK Singh and elder sister Rani Singh in Delhi.The CBI’s SIT also visited the flat of Sushant Singh Rajput several times and the Cooper Hospital where his autopsy was done.The team also visited the Waterstone resort, where Sushant stayed for several months.However, officials of the CBI remained tight-lipped on the return of the SIT members from Mumbai and the meeting of the team with the AIIMS forensic department.Besides CBI, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) are also probing the death of Sushant.The NCB has arrested Rhea, Showik, Miranda, Sawant and several others in the drug-related case.

He also drew attention to the difference in prolonged standoffs that had taken place earlier. This time, the number of Chinese troops and friction points on the border are very different. “Yet we are committed to peace,” he said.Singh went over much of the ground he had covered in the Lok Sabha earlier this week. But Rajya Sabha’s tradition of allowing members to seek post-statement clarifications, saw members from centrist parties like AAP and BSP besides BJP’s allies simply reposing their faith in the government and praising the valour and fortitude of the armed forces.While Left Party members were inaudible or cut short, it was Antony, Azad and Anand Sharma who put questions on restoring the status quo of mid-April and access for the Army to the blocked patrolling points.During his statement, the Defence Minister also laid emphasis on resolving the complex issue through talks. At the same time, he said while border talks and development of bilateral ties could take place on parallel tracks, disturbance of peace and tranquillity on the LAC would affect the latter.  Singh said that initially both sides were committed to reaching a common understanding on the LAC but China dropped the subject after 2003. As a result, there is an overlap of perception about the LAC at several points, he said.While the armed forces would show restraint wherever required and display valour if the need be, Singh said the Indian Army had been able to inflict casualties on the Chinese PLA. The three key principles being observed by India in the current stand-off are to respect the LAC, no attempt to change the status quo and respect all agreements and understandings.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-seek-restoration-of-all-lac-patrolling-points-rajnath-142466

He insisted and assured that the government was determined to cross the US in testing rate as well very soon.On the issue of the possible availability of a vaccine against the deadly virus, the Minister said: “India, too, has been making efforts like other countries in the world. Under PM’s guidance, an expert group is looking at it and we have advanced planning in place. We are hopeful that by the start of next year, a vaccine will be available in India.”The Minister, however, said the vaccine could not be made magically available to the whole of the population at once and it would take time. “Therefore, till the time, masks and social distancing are the only effective vaccines we have right now to break the contact chain as viruses can’t be alive without a live human body,” he added.Noting that 162 contacts were traced when the first COVID-19 case was reported on January 30 this year, the Minister said: “History will remember PM Modi for his meticulous and consistent monitoring and advising on the COVID-19 situation. He didn’t take even a single decision without consulting experts and state governments.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/targeting-to-bring-down-mortality-rate-to-less-than-1-pc-health-minister-in-rajya-sabha-142459
17-09-2020||Washington||India ranks 116 in World Bank’s human capital index||India has been ranked at the 116th position in the latest edition of the World Bank’s annual Human Capital Index that benchmarks key components of human capital across countries.However, India’s score increased to 0.49 from 0.44 in 2018, as per the Human Capital Index report released by the World Bank on Wednesday.The 2020 Human Capital Index update includes health and education data for 174 countries — covering 98 per cent of the world's population — up to March 2020, providing a pre-pandemic baseline on the health and education of children, with the biggest strides made in low-income countries.The analysis shows that pre-pandemic, most countries had made steady progress in building the human capital of children, with the biggest strides made in low-income countries.Despite this progress, and even before the effects of the pandemic, a child born in a typical country could expect to achieve just 56 per cent of their potential human capital, relative to a benchmark of complete education and full health, the Bank said.“The pandemic puts at risk the decade’s progress in building human capital, including the improvements in health, survival rates, school enrolment, and reduced stunting. The economic impact of the pandemic has been particularly deep for women and for the most disadvantaged families, leaving many vulnerable to food insecurity and poverty,” said World Bank Group President David Malpass.Protecting and investing in people is vital as countries work to lay the foundation for sustainable, inclusive recoveries and future growth.Due to the pandemic’s impact, most children — more than one billion — have been out of school and could lose out, on average, half a year of schooling, adjusted for learning, translating into considerable monetary losses. Data also shows significant disruptions to essential health services for women and children, with many children missing out on crucial vaccinations.Last year, India had raised “serious reservations” over the Human Capital Index, wherein India was ranked 115 out of 157 countries. This year India finds itself at 116th from among 174 countries.When asked about India's objections last year, Roberta Gatti, the bank’s chief economist for human development, told reporters that her team had worked with countries to improve the quality of data in order to make it a better index for everyone.“An index is a conversation-opener, and what we have discussed with our client countries is that all that is in the index matters but not everything that matters can be in the index,” she said, adding: “We have worked very directly with some of our client countries to use the index as a way to improve measurement, and India was exactly one of these cases.”Responding to questions, Mamta Murthi, vice-president, Human Development, World Bank Group, told reporters that the Human Capital Index provided a basis on which the government of India could prioritise and a dimension to support human capital. Given the progress that has been made in recent times, it seems significant for now due to COVID-19.“The Bank is working with the Indian authorities on supporting livelihood for the poor, which is very important,” she said.World Bank President David Malpass said that the coronavirus had deepened inequality globally, in addition to increasing poverty and distress. “We’re working with countries to try to protect people during the crisis and also invest in them so that we can see the recovery and lay a foundation for future inclusive growth,” he said.The impact of COVID-19, on developing countries particularly has been hard, Malpass said adding that there was the collapse of the formal and informal market and also there was a very limited social safety net. The World Bank, he said, estimated a 12 per cent drop in employment.There has been a major decline in remittances and total income is going down by 11 or 12 per cent. All this, he said, was likely to have a disproportionate effect on the poor and on women. India, he said is having “severe impact” of COVID-19.Malpass said that there was two-fold inequality in this crisis. “One is that developing countries are being left further behind. And within developing countries, the poor are being left further behind. Our concern right now with the pandemic is the subtractions or the challenges facing human capital creation in this environment,” he said.He further said: “Countries are increasingly reporting declines in essential health services. Eighty million children are missing out on essential vaccinations. Most children, within more than a billion children, have been out of school due to COVID. And that could lose as much as $10 trillion in lifetime earnings because of the reduced learning, the school closing and the potential for dropping out of school and the disproportionate impact on girls.”Malpass said that the World Bank was trying to work to restart the learning process, including by helping countries secure access to equipment, assisting in reopening and with distance learning.

17-09-2020|| New Delhi||BJP, AAP clash over issue of COVID-19 management during RS debate||The Aam Aadmi Party and the BJP clashed over the issue of COVID-19 management in Rajya Sabha on Thursday, with the AAP terming as "foolish" the prime minister's call to clap and beat utensils in honour of coronavirus warriors.BJP's Sudhanshu Trivedi hit back, saying the PM's move was symbolic and sought to unite the country socially just like Mahatma Gandhi chose the symbol of 'charkha' for national cohesion during the freedom struggle.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in March asked people to clap, beat steel plates and ring bells to express gratitude towards those risking their lives and working tirelessly during the coronavirus outbreak.Singh, while participating in the debate on COVID-19, further used the occasion to accuse the government of looking for an opportunity in times of disaster and alleged corruption in the procurement of equipment to fight the disease including thermometers and oximeters."I want to ask this government, tell me anyone research in the world that shows COVID can be prevented by clamping utensils and by clapping."The entire opposition will not go home but will clap with the prime minister and light 'diyas' in Parliament premises."You bring such absurd and foolish schemes and expect the entire country to be befooled by you," Singh said.Countering him, Trivedi said,"Burning diyas and beating utensils and clapping were symbolic in the fight against coronavirus."Would the British have run away by the use of the 'charkha' (spinning wheel).

The same way, PM Modi made the 'diyas' and beating utensils symbolic in bringing together all Indians in the fight against COVID," Trivedi said.The BJP member, without naming Rahul Gandhi, also too a swipe at the former Congress president for his vision of giving an early warning about COVID-19 and said he was himself not even in the country when the Congress was seeking a ban on international flights.He also countered the opposition charge that the lockdown was not imposed early as the BJP wanted to topple the Madhya Pradesh government of the Congress, saying at that time there were only 29 coronavirus cases in the country and not a single case was reported in Madhya Pradesh at that time.

17-09-2020||New Delhi||HC seeks Centre's stand on Rakul Preet Singh's plea against media linking her to Rhea drug Chakraborty case||The Delhi High Court Thursday sought the Centre's reply on actor Rakul Preet Singh's plea to stop media reports from connecting her with the Rhea Chakraborty drug case and said leaks to the media need to be investigated as "someone's reputation is totally destroyed by this".Justice Navin Chawla issued notice to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Prasar Bharti, the Press Council of India and the News Broadcasters Association seeking their stand on the actor's petition.The court also asked all the four respondents to treat her plea as a representation and take a decision on it expeditiously before the next date of hearing on October 15.It also expressed hope that "media houses would show restraint in their reports and would abide by the cable TV regulations, programme code and various guidelines, statutory and self regulatory, while making any reports with regard to the petitioner".During the hearing, the court observed that "there has to be some kind of restraint (by media)"."There is an ongoing investigation. Someone should investigate how things get leaked to the media before even the concerned officer knows it. Someone's reputation is totally destroyed by this," the court further observed.The central government, represented by Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, said the actor was seeking a blanket ban or injunction which ought not to be granted.The ASG said the actor made no complaint to the government or any other authority and there are no specific allegations against a media house or channel by her.The actor, represented by advocate Aman Hingorani, has claimed in her plea that Chakraborty had already retracted the statement in which she was allegedly named and yet the media reports were connecting her to the case.She has contended that based on unsubstantiated allegations defamatory programs were being run in the media against her which was causing irreparable harm and injury to her.Hingorani, during the hearing via video conference, said if such programs are not stopped the actor might lose all her endorsements and it might also adversely affect her films which are on the floor presently.He also said that there was no time to move the ministry or any other authority as with each passing day the defamatory programs were spreading at fast pace on social media.He further said that his client came to know about her being named in the case from "breaking news" on TV channels which said that she along with actor Sara Ali Khan and designer Simone Khambatta, have been named by Chakraborty as the individuals who take drugs.Chakraborty, according to the news reports, made the statement in the ongoing investigation by the Narcotics Control Bureau in Mumbai, the petition has said."The petitioner categorically states that she does not take drugs at all, and has, to the best of her recollection, has only met Sara Ali Khan twice (once at IIFA Awards and once while working out in a gym) and has not met Simone Khambatta at all," the petition has also said.The actor has also contended in her plea that the TV channels "have deliberately used sensational headlines and photographs and video-footage with a view to enhance their TRPs, without any regard to the irreparable damage they are causing to her reputation, her dignity, her privacy and her commercial interests".The petition had also alleged that the ministry, PCI and NBA "have failed to discharge their statutory functions of ensuring compliance of their own directives, which has resulted in the flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioner".

17-09-2020||New Delhi||Regulate digital media first, sufficient framework exists on print, electronic media: Centre to SC||The Centre has said that if the Supreme Court decides on the issue of media regulation, then such an exercise should be undertaken with the digital media first as it has faster reach and information has the potential to go viral due to applications namely WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook.The government told the Apex Court that sufficient framework and judicial pronouncements existed for the electronic and the print media.“Considering the serious impact and the potential, it is desirable that if this court decides to undertake the exercise, it should first be undertaken with regard to digital media as there already exists sufficient framework and judicial pronouncements with regard to electronic media and print media,” said the counter affidavit, filed by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.“It is submitted that while in a mainstream media (whether electronic or print), the publication or telecast is a one-time act, the digital media has faster reach from a wider range of viewership or readership and has the potential to become viral because of several electronic applications like WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook,” it said.The affidavit was filed in a pending matter in which the top court is hearing a petition which has raised grievance over Sudarshan TV’s ‘Bindas Bol’ programme whose promo had claimed that channel would show the ‘big expose on conspiracy to infiltrate Muslims in government service’.A bench headed by Justice DY Chandrachud had on September 15 restrained the channel from telecasting its episodes of a programme for two days, saying “the intent” of aired episodes “prima facie” appears to “vilify” the community.The bench had suggested that a committee of apolitical experts of distinguished citizens or former judges may be appointed to help in self-regulating the electronic media especially.The Apex Court is scheduled to hear the matter today.In its affidavit, the Centre has said: “Subject matter of the present petition namely balancing between the journalist freedom and responsible journalism is a field already occupied either by the statutory provisions made by the Parliament or by the judgments of this court.”“It is respectfully submitted that in view of the issue having already received the attention of the Parliament, as well as, of this court, the present petition be confined to only one channel namely Sudarshan TV and this court may not undertake the exercise of laying down any further guidelines with or without the appointment of an amicus or a committee of persons as amicus,” the affidavit said.It said that situation in each case shall have to be decided on a case-to-case basis and a broader exercise “which is too general in nature is neither warranted nor permissible”.The affidavit said: “Even if this court considers it appropriate to undertake the said exercise, there is no justification to confine this exercise only to mainstream electronic media. The media includes mainstream electronic media, mainstream print media as well as a parallel media namely digital print media and digital web-based news portal and YouTube channels as well as ‘Over The Top’ platforms (OTTs).”Referring to earlier verdicts delivered by the Apex Court, the affidavit said it laid down the correct legal proposition requiring no general exercise to be undertaken merely based upon one episode or few episodes of a channel.Separately, Sudarshan TV has also filed an affidavit in the apex court and claimed that it had no ill-will against any community or any individual and the programme concerns a matter of grave national interest.The channel claimed that it has used word such as ‘UPSC Jihad’ in its programme as an institute for the Muslim UPSC aspirants had received foreign funds, also from those which are linked to organisations that allegedly funds extremist groups.

Since April, Khanna’s #FeedIndia initiative has distributed 35 million meals, including cooked and dry ration, as well as 500,000 slippers, 3.5 million sanitary pads, two million masks and other essential supplies across hundreds of cities throughout India.Khanna told PTI he felt “humbled” by the honour from an eminent organisation that has played a tremendous role in promoting Asian culture.“I’m humbled to be among such a great line-up of awardees,” he said.From actor Dev Patel to Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, Khanna said, over the years the Asia Society has honoured people who wield tremendous “cultural influence” over millions around the world.Khanna, who had earlier said that he feels the past 30 years have been preparing him for this moment of the humanitarian crisis, added: “This has been the most gratifying (time) in my culinary career.”The virtual event to honour the awardees will be held in October and will also feature a special message by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a performance from Yo-Yo Ma, and a feature to honour frontline health care workers in the US and Asia.“In this time of profound global challenge, our 2020 Game Changers shine a beacon of love and courage across our divided globe,” Asia Society President and CEO Josette Sheeran said, adding: “They have met the moment, and they have inspired the world. We are honoured to bring them to our signature global event.”The Asia Society said while Khanna had been feeding people since he was a child, “but not until 2020 did it become a matter of life or death”.Watching the hardships and struggles of millions of people across India as the pandemic hit, Khanna issued a “heartfelt plea for information on communities in need” from his Manhattan apartment.Khanna had partnered with India’s National Disaster Relief Force for logistical and on-the-ground support and his movement soon received aid from grain companies, tech firms, and offers of industrial kitchen space in Mumbai.The popular Korean boy band is being honoured for raising their voices and inspiring their huge global audience to stand against any form of discrimination, while Asia Society lauded Lee for shining a light on inequality and blazing a trail for Korea on the global stage. The organisation said Yo-Yo Ma is being awarded for “a lifetime of achievement and providing ‘songs of comfort’ to millions when the world needed it the most.”Osaka, who won her second US Open title this month, is being honoured “for using her large global platform to call for racial justice and social change”.As COVID-19 tightened its grip on New York, and the severe shortage of medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) in the US became apparent, the Tsais “swept into action”.“As co-founder of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, sourcing from China was in Joe Tsai’s DNA,” Asia Society said adding that through their eponymous foundation, the Tsais donated millions of masks, goggles, and ventilators to hospitals and nursing homes in New York, then the epicentre of the coronavirus.Past awardees include PepsiCo’s former CEO Indra Nooyi, South Delhi Deputy Police Commissioner Chhaya Sharma, Alibaba founder Jack Ma and Co-Founder and CEO of non-governmental education organization Pratham, Madhav Chavan.

A redoubtable author, an erudite scholar par extraordinaire, an able administrator/adviser and a dancer in her own time, her journey may have started when government patronage towards arts was unheard of.She patronised arts at a personal level and worked with luminaries such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Indira Gandhi. The founding director of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, she was also the chairperson of the Asia Project at the India International Centre.Vatsyayan acquired a master’s degree in English literature from Delhi University and later studied in the US. Mixed influences once made her quip in an interview, “I belonged nowhere and I belonged everywhere.”Author of books such as “The Square” and “Circle of the Indian Arts”, she is hailed as classic by bureaucrat author Pavan K Varma in a tweet.Eminent artist and former Principal of the Government College of Art, Chandigarh, Prem Singh recalls her as a mentor in his art journey and the foremost authority on Indian arts and culture after AK Coomaraswamy.Architect artist SS Bhatti remembers her from her visit to Panjab University. He recalls, “She soon transcended her well-known image as a versatile scholar of far-reaching consequence and engaged in a theatrical and audience-capturing performance.”The Padma Vibhushan recipient and former MP, she has left behind a treasure trove of wisdom and knowledge.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kapila-vatsyayan-enriched-world-of-arts-in-myriad-ways-142172

I must look at a situation from the UN perspective and not my country’s perspectiveAcknowledging the fact that the UNSC’s expansion has been debated for years with no significant progress, UNGA President for the session Volkan Bozkir said the issue was important because the working and working methods of the UNSC must reflect the realities of the 21st century. This is exactly what India, one of the aspirants to a permanent seat on an expanded UNSC, says.“This process is member-states driven. We will build on the meetings in previous sessions,” he said, while bemoaning the US quarantine policy that has inhibited heads of state and governments from attending the session in person and, by their physical presence, guiding their delegations to indulge in off-the-record discussions.Bozkir said his first priority would be to appoint facilitators for the process after holding consultations with member countries.India, which has been seated in the front row and has under its belt successful elections to three ECOSOC bodies, would be taking his statement with circumspection since Bozkir is a Turkish while the question was asked by a Pakistani journalist and both their nations have plans for UNSC expansion very different from what India has been lobbying for: Permanent memberships for itself, Germany, Brazil, Japan and nominees from Africa.Bozkir attacked the US quarantine policy and was unaware if US President Donald Trump would be the lone head of state to address the momentous diamond jubilee session of the UNGA.Pushing strongly for in-person meetings, he said the “silent process didn’t help in making decisions”.Now that the UN has begun physical interactions, “we are going to show that the UN is back”, he said while defending the WHO ahead of a UNGA special session to discuss Covid, tentatively scheduled for the first week of November. Another special session will deal with corruption.Asked about his country’s views shaping his decisions, he agreed that having served for 39 years in the diplomatic services and 10 years as a politician, he would have “some views”.“But I think the chair must be impartial. I must look at a situation from the UN perspective and not my country’s perspective,” he said when asked how he would arbitrate between Turkey and Greece on their contest for the Eastern Mediterranean.On vaccine, Bozkir said, “If it is found, the world must ensure it is distributed fairly instead of only a part of the world benefiting from it while leaving a major portion of the world to a later stage. The UN’s role and GA’s role comes into picture at this point. I will make it a priority to make statements on this point.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/expanding-security-council-is-unga-presidents-priority-142210

He said no nation had lost as many doctors and healthcare workers as India.“To feign that doctors’ death data doesn’t merit the attention of the nation is abominable. If the government doesn’t maintain the statistics of total number of doctors and healthcare workers infected by Covid-19 and the statistics of how many of them sacrificed their life due to the pandemic, it loses the moral authority to administer the Epidemic Act 1897 and the Disaster Management Act,” said Sharma.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/treat-doctors-who-died-of-covid-as-martyrs-indian-medical-association-142211
