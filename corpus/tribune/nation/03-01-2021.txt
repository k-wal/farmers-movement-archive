03-01-2021||Bhopal||Will bring law against destroyers of public, pvt assets: MP CM||The BJP government in Madhya Pradesh will bring a stringent law prescribing “rigorous punishment” for rioters and stone-pelters which will also have a provision to recover compensation from offenders who damage public as well as private assets, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Sunday.His statement comes in the wake of recent incidents of stone pelting on vehicle rallies taken out in western Madhya Pradesh by some right-wing organisations to raise awareness about the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya.Notably, a law has been in force in Uttar Pradesh, also ruled by the BJP, for recovery of damages to public and private properties from rioters and protesters.“Whoever stone-pelters are, they are enemies of the society. Their act can even cause death. It creates an atmosphere of fear and terror...stampede and chaos,” Chouhan told reporters here.Right-wing organisations, including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), have claimed that stones were hurled at their rallies from certain localities in Indore and Ujjain districts.However, Muslims in the Malwa region (western MP) have argued that their places of worship and houses were targeted during these rallies.Recently, a delegation of VHP’s Malwa Prant called on the CM in Indore and demanded strict action against stone-pelters, a leader has said.“(Rule of) Law will prevail in Madhya Pradesh. These kinds of criminals are not simple offenders. They won’t be spared. Right now they are let off with light punishment. Now, we are bringing forth a Bill which is being drawn for rigorous punishment,” the chief minister said.He said besides hurling stones, rioters often damage private properties besides public assets “by force or by torching them”, which is unpardonable.“Democracy allows people to put forth their view in a peaceful manner, but it does not give permission to ignite fire, indulge in vandalism and throw stones.“The BJP government in Madhya Pradesh has decided to take tough action with punishment against the people damaging and destroying public property and recover compensation from them. If needed the offenders’ properties would be attached to recover money for compensation. Such action will also be taken against the rioters who damage private properties,” Chouhan said.The chief minister further said he had given instructions for drafting a stringent Bill.“The work on the Bill has begun. It will be brought out soon,” he added.On Saturday, Chouhan said stern action and a law were needed against those who indulge in stone pelting.“At times, stone pelting poses danger to life,” the CM had told top bureaucrats during an online meeting.Violence was reported during rallies organised by right-wing organisations at Ujjain and in Indore district recently.Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Congress vice president and advocate Sajid Ali told reporters that law should be made to check violence, but it should be implemented impartially.“Every rally, procession and public gatherings should be video-graphed as soon as they proceed so that any person or group that triggers violence is caught on camera and punished,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-bring-law-against-destroyers-of-public-pvt-assets-mp-cm-193162

Bonfires are a special characteristic of the festival.         Another farmers’ leader Onkar Singh said, “Today is the 37th day of our protest. The government should leave its stubbornness. In these conditions, the farmers, including elders, have been sitting on protest, but the government is not concerned about it.”     Braving the cold, thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various borders of the national capital for more than a month against the three farm laws.The farmers’ leaders said they are ready for Monday’s meeting with the government.The next round of talks between the government and protesting farmer unions is scheduled to be held on January 4, Monday. On Friday last, the unions had announced that they would have to take firm steps if the meeting fails to resolve the deadlock.“As the temperature is decreasing, we have tried to arrange the waterproof tents. We are also trying to arrange the blankets and warm water. Arrangements for 1,000 women have been made near the KFC with a tent and the mattresses,” farmers’ leader Harmeet Singh Kadian said.The protesting farmer unions on Saturday had said they will take out a tractor parade towards Delhi on January 26, when the country will celebrate Republic Day if their demands are not met.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be in the national capital on January 26 as the chief guest at the Republic Day parade, which will be held at Rajpath.In a statement, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) said the success of Monday’s talks depends entirely on the repeal of three farm laws. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-burn-copies-of-new-farm-laws-on-lohri-farmer-leaders-193160

03-01-2021||New Delhi||On eve of talks with farmers, Tomar meets Rajnath to discuss govt strategy to end deadlock||A day before the crucial seventh round of talks between the Centre and protesting farmer unions, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar met Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday and discussed the government strategy to resolve the current crisis at the earliest, sources said.Tomar discussed with Singh "all possible options" to find a "middle path" to resolve the crisis, sources added.Singh, who served as agriculture minister in the erstwhile Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet, has emerged as a key troubleshooter and is working mostly behind the scenes on this issue.Protesting farmers who have been camping at Delhi borders for the last 39 days braving bone-chilling cold and now rains have threatened to intensify their protest if their two major demands---repeal of the three new farm laws and legal backing for the minimum support price (MSP)---are not accepted by the government in the January 4 meeting.Rains since Saturday night led to waterlogging at the agitation venues, but the unions asserted that "we will not move from here until our demands are met".After five rounds of inconclusive talks, the government and 40 farmer unions reached some common ground during the sixth round of negotiations on December 30 to resolve protesting farmers' concerns over rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning, but the two sides remained deadlocked over the main contentious issues of the repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP.On January 1, Tomar had told PTI that the government is hopeful of a "positive outcome" at its next meeting with farmers' unions on January 4 but refrained from predicting whether the seventh round of talks will be the last one.Asked whether he expects the January 4 meeting to be the last one, the minister said, "I cannot say for sure now. I am not an astrologer. I am hopeful that whatever decision would be arrived at (in the meeting) will be in the interest of the country and of the farmers". Last week, protesting farmer unions issued an "ultimatum" that they will march into Delhi with a "tractor parade" on the Republic Day if their demands are not met in the next round of talks."The farmers' movement delivered an ultimatum to the Government of India and announced that farmers will march into Delhi on January 26," Sankyukta Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of around 40 protesting unions, had said in a statement.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at various borders of the national capital for more than a month demanding repeal of the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.Enacted in September 2020, the government has presented these laws as major farm reforms and aimed at increasing farmers' income, but protesting farmers have raised concerns that these legislations would weaken the MSP and mandi systems and leave them at the mercy of big corporates.The government has maintained these apprehensions are misplaced and has ruled out repealing the laws.While several opposition parties and people from other walks of life have come out in support of the farmers, some farmer groups have also met Agriculture Minister Tomar over the last few weeks to extend their support for the three laws. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/on-eve-of-talks-with-farmers-tomar-meets-rajnath-to-discuss-govt-strategy-to-end-deadlock-193158

Due to alleged harassment by digital money lending apps 36-year-old G Chandra Mohan, a father of three, committed suicide in Gundlapochampally under Rachakonda police. Rachakonda police said that Chandra Mohan had taken multiple loans from several lending apps to the tune of Rs 60,000 to 70,000 in October and had defaulted. This is the fifth such instance where the lender used data from the borrower's mobile app to access all personal data.According to the police, the borrowers are forced to install the app on the mobiles that have access to photos, contact lists etc. The suicide victim had taken small loans from many companies, some of whom started using the numbers in the contact list and shaming the borrower.  Police said “loan collection agents called people on Chandra Mohan’s contact list and shamed him for defaulting on the loan, branding him as a fraud before his friends and family”. Loan collectors according to the police operate call centers in Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Pune and Delhi to misuse the information available on the defaulter’s phone. In some cases, the loan collectors also used photographs of women that are morphed with pornographic material and circulated to contacts on the defaulter’s phone. After receiving threatening calls from the loan collectors Chandra Mohan filed a formal complaint against the harassment with the police. Apparently angered at this, the loan collectors got desperate and circulated messages and called the contact list of Chander Mohan leading to embarrassment forcing him to take his own life. Telangana police have booked over 50 cases after complaints of harassment by defaulters and so far, 29 persons have been arrested across the state on charges of harassing defaulters. Most of these loan apps police said do not have approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for giving out loans.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shaming-of-loan-defaulter-leads-to-fifth-suicide-in-telangana-193140

The IAF will helm the air defence command and all-long range missiles as well as air defence assets will come under it.The CDS has been part of the top military brass framing strategies to enhance India’s military prowess in view of the eastern Ladakh standoff.

As China is a member of both NDB and ADB, Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Company Limited was permitted to compete and won the tender for the construction of a 5.6-km underground stretch, from New Ashok Nagar to Sahibabad.National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), which awarded the tender to the lowest bid among five competitors, suggested that the ADB’s procurement guidelines for lending do not permit discrimination to companies of its member countries in the bidding process.The Shanghai-based NDB has five members with equal membership of five countries and China is a prominent member. As NDB has also extended a $ 241 million loan for the Mumbai metro project, Chinese companies will be expected to participate in the tenders.The New Ashok Nagar to Sahibabad tender was a closely fought affair. The Chinese company’s quote was a few crore less than that of the Turkish company Gulermak.Despite South Block’s political estrangement with Ankara over the Kashmir lockdown, Gulermak has completed the Lucknow Metro and is executing two major projects for Pune Metro. Turkey is also a member of ADB and its companies will be in the race for contracts for all projects for which the Manila-based bank extends loans.A statement by the NCRTC spokesperson said, “Approvals have to be taken at various levels for bids that are funded by multilateral agencies. This bid was also awarded following the set procedure and guidelines.“Now, all the civil work tenders of the 82-km Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut corridor have been awarded and the construction is going on in full swing to commission the project in time.’’While the Delhi-Meerut RRTS leg has taken off with the award of tenders, the Delhi-Panipat leg is still in the formative stage. The Haryana government has approved its contribution of Rs 4,699 crore for the project. It will facilitate easy access to Panipat Institute of Engineering, IITM Group of Institutions, Ashoka University, Park Hospital and AIIMS.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-company-bags-vital-contract-for-first-rapid-rail-project-193130

03-01-2021||Bhubaneswar||Beating hunger, COVID, destitute medical aspirants of Odisha on way to become doctors||Born in humble families they were reconciling to their fate, but destiny had written a different course for them.Braving all odds, a select group of medical aspirants of Odisha coming from humble background have got entry in medical colleges after clearing tough NEET examination in 2020.Their dream of becoming medicos got wings due to noble initiative of an Odisha-based charitable group whose all the 19 students succeeded in the National Eligibility and Entrance Test (NEET), the results of which were declared in October.The winners are wards of daily labourer, vegetable seller, truck driver, fisherman and idli-vada seller.These meritorious students are products of Zindagi programme run by a non-governmental organisation of academician Ajay Bahadur Singh, who himself had to experience pangs of hunger and scarcity of money in childhood which prevented him from becoming a doctor.Majority of them got admission in government medical colleges of the state.The world has come to know about the success story of Super 30 of mathematician Anand Kumar who helped economically deprived children become engineer by qualifying in JEE exams but, the similar feat of the Odisha group in the field of medical studies is no less romantic.The medical aspirants say they had not even in their dream thought of this day but thanks to the noble heart Ajay Bahadur Singh who not only kindled hopes in them but helped them monetarily as well to keep them going.The exciting tales of Khirodini Sahoo, Roshan Paik, Satyajit Sahoo and Debashish Biswal hailing from remote places of Odisha for whose families life starts and ends with the challenge of meeting two ends.Khirodini Sahoo hailing from Angul district is the daughter of farm labourer Kanhu Charan Sahoo.She used to extend helping hands to parents in the field to keep the home fires burning. But, providence helped her continue with her studies and today her wish of wearing a doctor’s apron is within reach.“My this life is dedicated to Ajay sir,” she said paying gratitude to the founder of the organisation.Roshan Paik whose both parents are also agri labourers is another success story.Debashsi Biswal of Kendrapara is the ward of a small grocery shop owner for whom arranging two square meals is the topmost priority.Satyajit Sahoo, son of a vegetable vendor in a remote village of Cuttack district is another fortunate lot.“We got birth in humble families and were destined to live a life of penury. It’s only because of the Zindagi foundation that we managed to keep our dreams alive and are on way to become doctors,” an elated Sahoo and Biswal said.Under the programme run by Zindagi foundation, talented underprivileged students are selected from across Odisha and provided free coaching and food to help them crack NEET and become a doctor.“The year 2020 was a tough challenge for all of us, but firm in our determination we did not let the students feel helpless,” Singh told PTI.“I fell ill during the lockdown, and came to Bhubaneswar in an ambulance and told everything to Ajay Sir.He kept me at his home and provided everything required,” Khirodini, who has secured 2,594 All India rank in NEET, conducted by National Testing Agency (NTA), said.Satyajit Sahoo has achieved 619 marks.Another success story is of Subhendu Parida, who used to vend “Idli Vada” alongside his parents. He qualified in NEET exam by achieving 609 marks.Singh started Zindagi Foundation in the year 2017 in Bhubaneswar.“I do all this without taking any donation from any individual or an organisation though many have offered. I manage everything from my own resources, because I see my childhood in them,” Singh said.The man behind the success stories of these children had to leave his medical studies and sell tea and sharbat (squash) in the temple town of Deogarh in Jharkhand to sustain his family undergoing financial hardship and pursue studies.Under the project, the talented students of the poor financial background chosen through a state-wide screening test, are provided free food, lodging and teaching to help them become a doctor.Twelve out of a batch of 14 who had cracked NEET in 2018 got admission in government medical colleges of Odisha.They were hosted by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik then to commemorate their achievements.Impressed by the noble initiative, the Super 30 founder mathematician Anand Kumar has made several trips to the Zindagi foundation to inspire the aspiring medicos.The fame of the group has crossed international boundary with a US-based foundation coming forward last year to finance the MBBS studies of a poor fatherless girl, who was coached in ‘Zindagi’ programme.The scholarship was awarded by California’s ‘Saloni Heart Foundation’ to Krishna Mohanty, who had the programme last year. It covered expenses for Mohanty’s studies, food and hostel accommodation at state-run MKCG college in Berhampur.

By impressing BJP, I have only gotten 25-30 legal cases against me.Dear @UrmilaMatondkar ji maine jo khud ki mehnat se ghar banaye woh bhi Congress tod rahi hai, sach mein BJP ko khush karke mere haath sirf 25-30 cases he lage hain, kash main bhi aapki tarah samajhdar hoti toh Congress ko khush karti, kitni bevakoof hoon main, nahin? pic.twitter.com/AScsUSLTAA  Ha ha ha https://t.co/WNk7FWhnRN  "I wish I was as smart as you and would've kept Congress happy. How foolish of me, no?" the 33-year-old actor tweeted.Tagging Ranaut, Matondkar shared a video on Twitter and asked her to fix up a meeting where she would be present with all documents as fair proof."It has proof how I bought the flat in 2011 with my own hard-earned money after working for nearly 25-30 years. The document has papers of the sale of the flat in the first of week of March."It also has papers of how I bought the office with that money, which I had earned through my hard work. The flat that I had bought was way before I entered politics," she said in the video.Matondkar, 46, also took a dig at the Y-plus category security given to Ranaut "against the money of crores of tax paying citizens".In September 2020, Ranaut was given Y-plus category security by the Ministry of Home Affairs amid controversy over her comment that she feared Mumbai Police.Matondkar also asked the actor to present a list of people from the industry, whom she had claimed were involved in drugs."You had promised them (the government) that you have the names of several people you wish to give to the Narcotics Control Bureau to fight the drug menace. I request you to please bring that list. I'll be waiting for your answer," she added.In September, Ranaut had called Matondkar a "soft porn star", after the latter criticised her claims about nepotism in the industry and Bollywood being riddled with a drug problem. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kangana-ranaut-attacks-urmila%C2%A0matondkar-for-buying-office-after-joining-sena-latter-says-its-hard-earned-money-193103
03-01-2021||New Delhi||First time such arrogant govt in power, must withdraw farm laws unconditionally: Sonia||In a scathing attack on the Centre over the farmers' protests, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Sunday said that for the first time since independence such an "arrogant" government has come to power that cannot see the sufferings of 'annadatas', and demanded that the new farm laws be immediately withdrawn unconditionally. In a statement in Hindi, she said governments and their leaders who ignore public sentiments in a democracy cannot govern for long and it is now quite clear that the protesting farmers will not bow in the face of the Centre's policy of "tire and pushover"."There is still time, the Modi government should leave the arrogance of power and immediately withdraw the three black laws unconditionally to end the agitation of the farmers who are dying in the cold and rain. This is Rajdharma and a true tribute to the farmers who have lost their lives," Gandhi said.The Modi government should remember that democracy means protecting the interests of the people and the farmers-workers, she said."Along with the people of the country, I am also disturbed seeing the condition of the 'annadatas' who have been agitating for 39 days at the borders of Delhi in the bitter cold and rain in support of their demands," Gandhi said.In the wake of the government's apathy, so far, more than 50 farmers have lost their lives with some even taking the step of committing suicide due to the government's neglect, she said."But neither the heartless Modi government relented nor the Prime Minister or any other minister uttered a word of consolation till today. I pay my respects to all the deceased farmer brothers and pray to the Lord to give their families the strength to bear this sorrow," the Congress president said."Since independence, this is the first such arrogant government that has come to power in the history of the country that, leave alone people, cannot even see the sufferings and struggles of 'annadatas'," she said.It seems that ensuring profits for a handful of industrialists has become the main agenda of this government, Gandhi alleged.The Congress has been seeking the repeal of the three new farm laws, alleging that they will ruin farming and the farmers. The Congress is also supporting the farmers' agitation against the legislations.After the sixth round of formal negotiations on Wednesday, the government and farm unions reached some common ground to resolve protesting farmers' concerns over rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning, but the two sides remained deadlocked over the main contentious issues of the repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP).Braving the cold, thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various borders of the national capital for more than a month against these laws.The government has presented these laws as major agriculture sector reforms aimed at helping farmers and increasing their income, but the protesting unions fear that the new legislations will leave them at the mercy of big corporates by weakening the MSP and mandi systems. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/first-time-such-arrogant-govt-in-power-must-withdraw-farm-laws-unconditionally-sonia-193102

Subsequently, a complaint of abduction was lodged at the Fareedpur police station. The woman stayed with Abrar in Delhi's Tughlaqabad for around 15 days and then returned home," Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of Bareilly Rohit Singh Sajwan told PTI.The case against the three Muslim men was registered on January 1."According to the complainant, on December 1 last year, when the girl was returning home in Fareedpur, Abrar, along with his cousins Maisur and Irshad, tried to forcibly convert her religion for 'nikaah'. But the police have found that the accused were not at the spot on that day. According to the evidence collected by the police, the allegations levelled against the three men by the woman and her maternal uncle were wrong and the matter will be dismissed in accordance with provisions of law," the SSP said.He, however, added that the charge against Abrar of issuing threats to the woman at her in-laws' place is being looked into."On December 11, the maternal uncle of the woman got her married in the Aonla area of the district. Abrar went to the woman's in-laws' place and told her to come to Fareedpur soon or else, she will face difficulties. This is being examined and if the allegation is found to be true, action will be initiated against Abrar," the SSP said.The woman's parents are no more. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/forcible-religious-conversion-of-woman-up-police-says-3-muslim-men-wrongly-framed-in-case-193101

03-01-2021||New Delhi||BCI to move SC seeking 3-year practice at bar as condition to be judicial officer||The Bar Council of India has said it will file an application before the Supreme Court seeking to make minimum 3-year practice at the bar necessary to become a judicial officer.The BCI, the country's apex lawyers' body, said judicial officers not having practical experience as advocates are mostly found to be incapable and inept in handling matters.Presently, fresh law graduates are being allowed to sit for Judicial Service Examination throughout the territory of India without having any practical experience at the Bar.  It said that BCI, along with all the State Bar Councils, are strongly in favour of a three-year minimum experience as an advocate to be prescribed for being considered eligible to sit for a Judicial Service Exam.“Judicial Officers not having practical experience at the Bar are mostly found to be incapable and inept in handling matters. Most of such officers are found impolite and impractical in their behaviour with members of the Bar and litigants. “They have lack of understanding of the aspirations and expectations of advocates and litigants in the matter of proper and decent behaviour,” BCI Secretary, Srimanto Sen, said in a press release issued on January 2. The council said that the inexperience at the Bar was one of the primary and major reasons for delays in the disposal of cases in the subordinate Judiciary.  “Trained and experienced judicial officers can comprehend and dispose of matters at a much faster pace, thereby leading to efficient administration of justice,” it said.The requirement of 3 year experience at the Bar had been done away with by the Supreme Court by passing an order in March 2002.The BCI said it will file an application before the apex court to seek the modification of that order.The statement came in the wake of a petition moved before the Supreme Court.The Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission had invited applications by a December 2020 notification for appointment of Civil Judges (Junior Division) in the AP State Judicial Services for advocates having a minimum eligibility requirement of three years as practising advocate.    A plea has already been filed before the Supreme Court against the Andhra Pradesh notification in which the petitioner has challenged it on the grounds that the requirement of three year experience at the Bar is illegal and unwarranted.On the plea, the top court, on December 30, has sought responses from the Andhra Pradesh government and the Registrar (recruitment) of the Andhra Pradesh High Court on a plea challenging the stipulated condition of three years practice as an advocate to be eligible for appearing in the exam for appointment as civil judge in the state.The BCI said it will be filing another application to seek impleadment as a party in the said matter and shall plead in favour of the urgency and requirement to have a minimum three-year experience at the Bar as a requirement to be eligible to sit in the Judicial Service Exam. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bci-to-move-sc-seeking-3-year-practice-at-bar-as-condition-to-be-judicial-officer-193093

And we the people of the greatest civilization of earth are ok with it," Grover wrote.Das took to Twitter and wrote that it is futile to stop humour and to try and "control" it."You can't stop jokes and laughter. Not because comedians are performing it, but because people need to laugh. Harder you try, the more you're going to be laughed at, now, and by history."Anyone who has ever tried to control humour, now has a category of jokes devoted to them," Das tweeted.He also posted screenshot of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 2017 tweet, when he talked about the importance of humour."I think we need more satire and humour. Humour brings happiness in our lives. Humour is the best healer," the prime minister had said in the tweet.Das captioned the image: "I'm just going to leave this here." According to Gaur, he and his associates had gone to watch the show and when they heard the "indecent" comments, they forced the organisers to stop the programme.As per the complaint, indecent remarks were passed against Hindu gods and goddesses and the Union home minister during the show, in-charge of Tukoganj police station Kamlesh Sharma said.Comedian Rohan Joshi shared Faruqui's video where he is trying to reason with those offended with his jokes."Turns out now you can just assault people while they're doing their job and the cops will take 'them' to the police station," Joshi captioned the video.Comedian Kaneez Surka and Abish Mathew also shared the clip of Faruqui on Instagram."Watch this, that's all and then share it," Surka wrote.While Mathew added, "Seven minutes of @munawar.faruqui trying to reason but still...'

But the biggest challenge for women this year is not only to adapt but to thrive in this unprecedented situation," she told PTI.The number of complaints received in 2020 have been the highest in six years. In 2014, a total of 33,906 complaints were received, according to the NCW data.The NCW was flooded with complaints of domestic violence in March as the lockdown, imposed in view of the coronavirus outbreak, forced women to remain confined to their homes with their abusers.The number of complaints of domestic violence went on increasing through the months and in July, a record number of 660 such complaints were received.Sharma underlined how domestic violence remained a serious concern for the commission through the year."Victims of domestic violence are distanced from their regular support systems making it difficult for them to call out for help. The series of COVID-19 lockdowns in India reduced the opportunities of reporting of domestic violence cases," she said.The NCW chairperson said the lockdown incapacitated women by preventing them from moving to safer places in cases of violence and abuse, reduced contact with the natal family which is usually the first point of contact for the victim."The machinery under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act had not been identified as an essential service during the lockdown. Hence, protection officers and NGOs were not able to visit households of victims and police officers being at the frontline to tackle COVID-19 were overstretched to help victims effectively," she said.After the right to live with dignity and domestic violence, the third highest number of complaints have been of harassment of married women or dowry harassment at 3.784 followed by that of molestation at 1,679.According to the data, 1,276 complaints of police apathy towards women and 704 complaints of cyber crime were received by the commission.As many as 1,234 complaints of rape and attempt to rape were received while 376 complaints of sexual harassment were received by the commission in 2020, the data showed.Sharma encouraged women to reach out to the NCW whenever they want.In 2021, she said the commission will continue to work with commitment to ensure justice and empowerment to even the last woman standing at the periphery and will continue with its endeavours.Women rights activist Yogita Bhayana, who heads the People Against Rape in India (PARI), the high rate might also be because of high awareness among women to talk about such incidents and report them."There has been an increase because there is also an increase in awareness because women are getting more proactive reporting it and talking about it. Earlier they used to suppress their grievances and the government is also spreading awareness and women get motivated by other women reporting it," she said."Because of social media the reporting of domestic violence has increased. Women have become more vocal, and they have less tolerance which is very good," Bhayana added.Another women rights activist Shamina Shafiq said the government needs to talk strongly about domestic violence."Unfortunately a man feels it is his right to beat a woman, and he enjoys the fact that I am the one in control of the life of another person. There should be writing on the wall that spousal violence is wrong," she said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/national-commission-for-women-received-23-722-complaints-in-2020-highest-in-six-years-193087
03-01-2021||New Delhi||Red-letter day for Indian science: ICMR and Bharat Biotech on COVAXIN approval||Chairman and Managing Director of Bharat Biotech Dr Krishna Ella on Sunday said the approval of COVAXIN for emergency use is a giant leap for innovation and novel product development in India.Chief of ICMR, collaborators in COVAXIN Balram Bhargava called January 3 a "red-letter day" for Indian science and a great moment for low and middle-income nations as India readies to supply the first indigenous COVID vaccine at home and abroad.Commenting on concerns over efficacy data for COVAXIN which is yet to undergo phase 3 trials Bhargava said: “safety has been established in interim phase 3 analysis and nearly 22,000 participants have been given the vaccine in phase 3.”On lack of efficacy data for COVAXIN, Bhargava said: “trials are ongoing.”Bharat Biotech called the day a proud moment for the nation and a great milestone in India’s scientific capability, a kickstart to the innovation ecosystem in India.“While this vaccine addresses an unmet medical need during this pandemic, our goal is to provide global access to populations that need it the most. COVAXIN has generated excellent safety data with robust immune responses to multiple viral proteins that persist,” Ella said.The development of COVAXIN is a public-private partnership between ICMR, NIV Pune and Bharat Biotech.COVAXIN, the government said, showed safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in phase 2 data and safety in phase 3 data and would be specifically used for emergencies arising from UK mutant strain.Being tested, highly purified, inactivated 2-dose SARS-CoV2 vaccine, manufactured in a Vero cell manufacturing platform with an excellent safety track record of more than 300 million doses, COVAXIN platform safety is known from the past as against other COVID vaccine platforms that are newer.The Phase III human clinical trials of COVAXIN began mid-November, targeted to be done in “26,000” volunteers across India.This is India’s first and only Phase III efficacy study for a COVID-19 vaccine, and the largest phase III efficacy trial ever conducted for any vaccine in India.COVAXIN has been evaluated in approximately 1000 subjects in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials, with promising safety and immunogenicity results, with acceptance in international peer-reviewed scientific journals.This indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech's BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) bio-containment facility, one of its kind in the world.The evaluation of COVAXIN has resulted in several unique product characteristics including long term persistence of immune responses to multiple viral proteins, as opposed to only the spike protein, and has demonstrated broad-spectrum neutralizing capability with heterologous SARS-CoV2 strains, thus potentially reducing or eliminating escape mutants, the company said.It has also shown to generate memory T cell responses, for its multiple epitopes, indicating longevity and rapid antibody response to future infections.Its most critical characteristic is the demonstrated safety profile, which is significantly lower than several other vaccines with published data.The product development and clinical trial data thus far have generated 5 publications, which have been submitted to international peer-reviewed journals, 4 of which have been accepted and will be published soon.The publication of phase II trial data is undergoing the peer review process.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/red-letter-day-for-indian-science-icmr-and-bharat-biotech-on-covaxin-approval-193084

03-01-2021||Peshawar||45 more arrested, 8 cops suspended over attack on Hindu temple in Pakistan||Eight police officials in Pakistan were suspended on Sunday for dereliction of duty after a Hindu temple was vandalised and set on fire by a mob led by members of a radical Islamist party in the country’s restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.So far, 100 people have been arrested for their alleged involvement in the incident, the police said, adding that 45 were arrested on Sunday.Over 350 people have been named in the FIR after the temple in Karak district’s Terri village was vandalised and set on fire on Wednesday by a mob protesting against its expansion work.Superintendent of Police (Investigation) Zahir Shah said 100 people, including seven leading figures, have been arrested in the case while efforts were on to arrest all the 350 nominated accused in the FIR.The leading figures include Maulana Amanullah, Maulana Imdadullah, Maulana Matiullah, Maulana Muhammad Hakeem and Maulana Anwar Zaman.The arrested accused were produced before an anti-terrorist court which sent them to three days of police custody.District Police Officer of Karak Irfanullah Marwat suspended eight police officials on Saturday for dereliction of duty.The temple, which also has a Samadhi of a Hindu religious leader, was attacked by the mob after members of the Hindu community received permission from the local authorities to renovate its decades-old building.The mob, led by some local clerics and supporters of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam party (Fazal ur Rehman group), demolished the newly-constructed work alongside the old structure.The attack on the temple drew strong condemnation from human rights activists and the minority Hindu community leaders.India has also lodged a protest with Pakistan over the vandalisation of the temple and sought a strict action against those responsible for the incident.The protest was conveyed to Pakistan through diplomatic channels, sources in New Delhi said on Friday.Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan has assured that the government would reconstruct the damaged temple and the Samadhi at the shortest possible time.According to a notification issued by the Chief Minister’s Secretariat late on Saturday night, the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government has constituted a four-member committee to assess the damage to the temple and develop its reconstruction plan in consultation with the Hindu community.The committee has been asked to complete the work in 10 days.Pakistan’s Supreme Court has also ordered the local authorities to appear before it on January 5.The court issued directions to the one-man Commission on Minorities Rights, the chief secretary and the inspector general of police of the province to visit the site and submit a report on January 4.Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.The majority of Pakistan’s Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, tradition and language with the Muslim residents.  They often complain of harassment by the extremists.

However, they had to step down in October as they were not members of the state legislature because the coronavirus pandemic delayed the bypolls.There is a mandatory provision that a non-MLA, who got inducted in the cabinet, should get elected to the State Assembly within six months.The second expansion of Chouhan's cabinet took place on July 2 last year with the induction of 28 ministers, including a dozen loyalists of Jyotiraditya Scindia.The first expansion was held on April 21 last year wherein five ministers, including Silawat and Rajput, were inducted.Silawat and Rajput were among the Congress MLAs who had resigned and joined the BJP with Scindia in March last year.In the Assembly bypolls held on November 3, the BJP had won 19 of the 28 seats, while the opposition Congress had bagged nine.Silawat and Rajput won from Sanver and Surkhi respectively in the by-poll.

03-01-2021||New Delhi||Cong leaders raise concern over grant of permission for restricted use of COVID-19 vaccine||Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma on Sunday raised concerns over India's drugs regulator granting permission for the restricted use of Bharat Biotech's COVID-19 vaccine and asked the government to explain why mandatory protocols and verification of data has been dispensed with.  India's drugs regulator DCGI on Sunday approved Oxford's COVID-19 vaccine Covishield and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin for restricted emergency use.  Sharma, who heads the Parliamentary panel on Home Affairs which dealt with the issue at length, said the issue of granting authorisation to the vaccine use needs to be taken carefully as no country has dispensed with the mandatory phase 3 trials and verification of data.As per submissions made before the expert panel, phase 3 trials have not been completed and therefore, the data on safety and efficacy has not been reviewed, which is a mandatory requirement, he said.  "The Health Ministry needs to give cogent reasons for dispensing with the mandatory protocols and requirements in this case since it involves the health and safety of those frontline workers who will be vaccinated under the restricted category," he told PTI.  "The DCGI statement is puzzling and the government must must reveal the final data of global efficacy trials and the final trials in UK which has been shared officially by UK's MHRA following a government to government agreement signed between the two countries which should be put in public domain to avoid any confusiuon on the proven efficacy of the vaccine," Sharma also said.He said the news of the imminent arrival and rollout of the nation-wide vaccination drive is "truly uplifting and reassuring" for a country paralysed by the pandemic.It is also a tribute to our scientists, researchers and institutions, who have established India as the largest vaccine manufacturer of the world, he said.  An expert panel of India's central drug authority had on Saturday recommended granting permission for the restricted use of Bharat Biotech-developed indigenous COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin in emergency situations.  The recommendation came a day after the panel cleared the Serum Institute of India's emergency use authorisation application for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine Covishield.  This paves the way for the roll-out of at least two vaccines in India in the coming days, while two more are in advance stages of development.  Sharma said there are some concerns expressed by the news of recommendation for restricted use emergency authorisation in case of one vaccine which is still undergoing phase 3 trials and that has raised bonafide concerns as that would involve the health safety issues.  Another senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh also raised concerns and asked Health Minister Harsh Vardhan to clarify why internationally-accepted protocols on phase 3 trials are being modified.  "Bharat Biotech is a first-rate enterprise, but it is puzzling that internationally-accepted protocols relating to phase 3 trials are being modified for Covaxin. Health Minister Harsh Vardhan should clarify," he said on Twitter.The issue was earlier dealt in-depth by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs.  The panel has recommended to the government that any vaccine against COVID-19 should be granted emergency use authorisation only after proper consideration and conducting its trials on sufficient sample size.  In its report submitted on December 21 to Rajya Sabha chairman and Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, the Parliamentary Standing Committee noted that the CDSCO has given no emergency use authorisation in the past and suggested that all necessary and mandatory requirements must be duly fulfilled and all trial phases completed.

03-01-2021||New Delhi||Farmers are 'satyagrahis', will take rights from govt: Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday compared the ongoing farmers’ protests against the three new Central agriculture-related laws with the Champaran agitation during the British rule, and said every farmer-labourer part of the current movement is a ‘satyagrahi’ and they will take their rights back.देश एक बार फिर चंपारन जैसी त्रासदी झेलने जा रहा है। तब अंग्रेज कम्पनी बहादुर था, अब मोदी-मित्र कम्पनी बहादुर हैं।लेकिन आंदोलन का हर एक किसान-मज़दूर सत्याग्रही है जो अपना अधिकार लेकर ही रहेगा।  “The country is going to face a Champaran-like tragedy. British were ‘company Bahadur’ back then and now Modi-friends are ‘company Bahadur’,” Gandhi alleged in a tweet in Hindi.“But, every farmer-labourer of the movement is a ‘satyagrahi’ who will take back their rights,” the former Congress chief said.The Champaran Satyagraha of 1917 was led by Mahatma Gandhi and is considered a historic event in India’s independence movement.It was a farmer’s uprising that took place in Champaran district of Bihar during the British colonial period when the farmers protested having to grow indigo with barely any payment for it.The Congress has been seeking the repeal of the three new farm laws, alleging that they will ruin farming and the farmers. The Congress is also supporting the farmers’ agitation against the legislations.After the sixth round of formal negotiations on Wednesday, the government and farm unions reached some common ground to resolve protesting farmers’ concerns over rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning, but the two sides remained deadlocked over the main contentious issues of the repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP).Braving the cold, thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, are protesting at various borders of the national capital for more than a month against these laws.The government has presented these laws as major agriculture sector reforms aimed at helping farmers and increasing their income, but the protesting unions fear that the new legislations will leave them at the mercy of big corporates by weakening the MSP and mandi systems.

The elections will be held in April-May next year.“In the interregnum, efforts are being made to bring together all smaller Left-groups for stronger consolidation against the ruling TMC and the BJP by bringing together all smaller Left groups,” the leader said.There are, in all, about 16 Left parties with variegated ideologies in the state.

There is so much cold after the rains but the government is not able to see our misery,” he said.Gurwinder Singh, who is camping at Singhu Border, said there was waterlogging at some places as civic facilities are not up to the mark but asserted that the weather would not dampen the spirit of farmers who have been protesting for over a month.“Despite facing several problems, we will not move from here until our demands are met,” he said.According to a MeT Department official, heavy rainfall was reported in areas across Delhi and minimum temperatures have increased due to clouding and easterly winds.“Safdarjung observatory recorded a minimum temperature of 9.9 degrees Celsius, an increase of 6.7 degrees with 25 mm rain. Palam observatory recorded a minimum temperature of 11.4 degrees Celsius with 18 mm rain. Rain with hail storm is expected until January 6,” the official said.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab and Haryana, have been camping at three Delhi border points — Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur — for more than a month, demanding repeal of three farm laws and a legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP) and other two issues.Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan) leader Sukhdev Singh, whose Union is leading the protest at Tikri border, said arrangements made by farmers to brave the cold weather were not helping much because of rains and subsequent waterlogging.Veerpal Singh, a protesting farmer, said their blankets, clothes and wood were soaked.“Our clothes are soaked due to waterlogging caused by rains. Besides, we are facing difficulties to cook food as rainwater has also soaked firewood. We do have an LPG cylinder but not everyone here has it,” he said.Dharmveer Yadav, who is camping at Ghazipur border protest site, said farmers would not move an inch from their agitation venues.“We are ready to face any problem, be it heavy or storm, but we will not leave this place in any condition until our demands are met,” Yadav said.Rainwater also entered camps at Burari ground and the protesters were seen draining the water out and rearranging their belongings to prevent from soaking in water.

03-01-2021||Aditi Tandon||Known for tenacity, he was called ‘demolition man’ of Congress||Born to a humble Dalit family in Jalandhar’s Mustafapur in 1934, Buta Singh rose to prominence in the Congress hierarchy and went on to serve as India’s Home Minister and the Governor of Bihar.Known for his tenacity — a trait he exhibited early in life by pursuing higher education in times of deep caste prejudices — Buta Singh rose to win late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s trust and, as Home Minister in the latter’s cabinet, toppled state governments of varied hues.The penchant for executing his leader’s orders won Buta Singh the sobriquet of “demolition man”, while he served as Home Minister between 1985 and 1989.A graduate from Jalandhar’s Khalsa College, Buta Singh took to Bolshevik literature in student days, but cut political teeth in the Akali Dal winning his first Lok Sabha election from Ropar reserved segment on the Akali ticket in 1962.The Akali Dal split saw him side with Master Tara Singh, but the association was shortlived as he moved on to the Congress, a party to which he remained most committed through a long political career, in which he briefly flirted with the BJP.An eight-term Lok Sabha MP (four terms from the Jalore SC segment in Rajasthan where he migrated when Punjab was hit by militancy), Buta Singh served as a minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet in 1998, the time when he was chargesheeted in the JMM bribery case. The development saw AIADMK chief J Jayalalitha distancing from the NDA government on the issue of corruption.Singh returned to his parent party Congress and was made the Bihar Governor in 2004 only to see an unceremonious step down after the Supreme Court castigated his “whimsical dissolution” of the state assembly in 2005.After the apex court declared the dissolution of the Bihar Assembly null and void, Buta Singh resigned as Governor — his last political posting. He was later appointed chairperson of the National Commission for the Scheduled Castes in 2007.Although Singh was instrumental in rebuilding the Akal Takht in the aftermath of the Operation Bluestar besides helping restore other gurdwaras desecrated in the communal fires of the 1984 Sikh carnage, he faced excommunication from the Sikh Panth over Operation Bluestar.Buta Singh cleaned shoes and washed utensils at the Golden Temple as a mark of atonement before he could return to the Sikh religious order. Another eventful chapter in Buta Singh’s life was his active supervision as Home Minister of the 1989 “shilanyas” at the disputed Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site.It was in the aftermath of Congress’ poll loss in the Lok Sabha elections the same year that Buta Singh defected to the BJP only to return to the Grand Old Party later.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/known-for-tenacity-he-was-called-demolition-man-of-congress-192744

03-01-2021||---||After Covishield, nod to indigenous Covaxin||New Delhi, January 2India is on the cusp of twin Covid-19 vaccine rollouts with the expert committee of the drug regulatory authority on Saturday recommending emergency use approval for the first indigenous candidate Covaxin.The positive recommendation for Bharat Biotech-ICMR’s Covaxin came a day after experts suggested approval to the Oxford University-AstraZeneca-Serum Institute’s Covishield.Drug Controller General of India VG Somani is likely to announce tomorrow official emergency use approvals for both the vaccines, besides explaining the conditions under which these would be permitted. There are now two vaccines on India’s pandemic management horizon with the government successfully conducting vaccine dry run at 259 sites in 116 districts pan India today. Around 1.14 lakh vaccinators have been trained and over 75 lakh beneficiaries (of first phase priority inoculation) registered on Co-WIN. Sources said once approved by the DCGI, the vaccine rollout could start as early as next week.Covaxin is yet to conclude phase-3 trials with recruitment of participants underway, but the subject experts have recommended its restricted use on the basis of interim analysis of the available data. The manufacturers have been told to continue presenting additional safety data.The two-dose Covishield has demonstrated 90 per cent efficacy in phase-3 trials when the vaccine is administered as a halved first dose and a standard second dose after a month.The data from phase-2 Covaxin trials recently showed the vaccine was well tolerated across age groups, produced cell mediated immune response and did not show any serious adverse event. Bharat Biotech and ICMR have published results for phase-1 and phase-2 trials with the late-stage phase-3 trials progressing well, though full data was awaited.The phase-2 trial of Covaxin was a double-blind, randomised, multi-centre clinical trial involving 380 healthy children and adults who received two vaccine formulations—3 µg and 6 µg. Two intramuscular vaccine doses were administered four weeks apart. Its developers hypothesise that the vaccine can generate antibodies that may persist for six to 12 months.Health Minister Harsh Vardhan today said Covid vaccine would be administered free to two priority groups—one crore health workers and two crore frontline workers. The pricing modalities for 27 crore priority group involving people aged 50 and above would be worked out, he said.India first to culture UK strainIndia on Saturday became the 1st country to have successfully cultured the mutant UK strain with ICMR’s National Institute of Virology (Pune) announcing positive results. “The UK variant of the virus with all its signature changes is now successfully isolated and cultured at NIV from clinical specimens collected from UK returnees,” the ICMR said.Bharat Biotech allays concernsAmid concerns over DCGI approvals for Bharat Biotech’s vaccine “Covaxin”, which is yet to finish phase 3 trials, the company on Saturday announced successful recruitment of 23,000 volunteers for late stage trials and continued progress towards achieving the goal of 26,000 participants across multiple sites in India.

He stated that "all matters are listed/eliminated/deleted as per guidelines, practice and procedure which are available in public domain through website www.sci.gov.in under the link "Practice & Procedure" and also in accordance with the circulars and general and specific directions of the court."In the recent past, the top court had given urgent hearing to pleas of journalists Arnab Goswami and Vinod Dua and activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan and granted them protection from coercive action by the police.In May last year, the court had granted protection from coercive action to Bhushan in connection with an FIR lodged against him at Rajkot for allegedly hurting religious sentiments of Hindus.In June 2020, the Supreme Court had assembled on Sunday and granted Dua protection from arrest in connection with an FIR registered in Shimla at the instance of Ajay Shyam, leader of the Himachal BJP, who had filed a criminal complaint against the senior journalist, accusing him of instigating violence against the government by allegedly spreading fake news.Earlier, Dushyant Dave, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, had questioned the urgent listing of Goswami's petition challenging a Bombay High Court order denying him interim bail in an abetment to suicide case by the Supreme Court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/931-bail-pleas-141-conviction-appeals-pending-in-sc-192759
03-01-2021||---||Tractor ‘parade’ on R-Day if demands not met, say unions||New Delhi, January 2Toughening their stance ahead of the January 4 talks with the government, the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha today said it would organise a tractor march to Delhi on January 26, when the country celebrates Republic Day, if their demands were not met.Addressing a press conference, the union leaders said time had come for a “decisive” action as their key demands —repealing the three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP for crops — had not been addressed by the government.Time for decisive actionEither repeal the laws or use force to evict us. We have chosen January 26 for tractor parade as Republic Day represents the supremacy of the people. —Ashok Dhawale, Farm leaderThe Morcha, an umbrella body representing around 40 farm unions, took the decision for the Republic Day march following a meeting of its seven-member coordination committee at Singhu near Delhi border.Farmer leader Darshan Pal Singh said their proposed march would be called “kisan parade” and it would be held after the Republic Day parade. For it, he said, a mobilisation campaign would be launched across the country from January 6 to 20.‘Protest our right’The court has also said peaceful protest is one’s right. We are not here for confrontation. —BS Rajewal, Farmers’ leaderAsked about the route and timing, Pal said the unions would announce it later. He said their plan for the proposed tractor march on the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) highway on January 6 would remain unchanged. It, he said, would be a “rehearsal” parade of their January 26 tractor march.Ashok Dhawale, another farm leader, said, “We intend to be peaceful. We had long ago told the government that it has only two options—either repeal the laws or use force to evict us. The time has come for decisive action and we have chosen January 26 as the Republic Day represents the supremacy of the people.”Union leaders said though they were hopeful for the January 4 meeting, they could not trust the government going by their past experience.Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav said it was a “plain lie” that the government had accepted 50 per cent of the farmers’ demands. “We have got nothing on paper yet,” he said.Union leader BS Rajewal pointed out that the court had also said “peaceful protest” was one’s right. “We are not here for confrontation,” he said.After the sixth round of formal negotiations on Wednesday, the government and farm unions reached some common ground to resolve protesting farmers’ concerns over rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning, but the two sides remained deadlocked over the main contentious issues of the repeal of the laws and a legal guarantee for MSPFarmer leader Gurnam Singh Charuni said, "In our last meeting, we posed a question to the government that will you buy 23 crops on MSP? They said 'no'. Then why are you misinforming the people of the country?"Meanwhile, a 75-year-old farmer, Sardar Kashmir Singh, protesting at Ghazipur on the UP-Delhi border allegedly died by suicide on Saturday.Indirapuram DSP Anshu Jain said a purported suicide note written in Gurumukhi was found on him. In the note, it was written that the government must repeal the farm laws as these were against the interests of farmers.In the note, Singh expressed anguish that though some people from Punjab died during the agitation, no one from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand had sacrificed his life for the cause. He also requested the Sikh community to help his family marry off his two granddaughters and to address the domestic problems being faced by his married daughter.His body was handed over to his grandchildren who too were part of the protest in Ghazipur, the police said.Farmer ends life at ghazipurGhaziabad: A 75-year-old farmer protesting at Ghazipur on the UP-Delhi border allegedly died by suicide on Saturday.
