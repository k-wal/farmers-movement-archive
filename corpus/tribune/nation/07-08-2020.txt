It also shows another policeman pushing a turbaned man, who comes to save Singh.State Congress chief Kamal Nath also tweeted on the matter, "In MP's Barwani, police beat up a Sikh man, Prem Singh Granthi, who runs a small shop close to police chowki and also removed his turban. Police also beat him up mercilessly pulling him by hair." Chouhan said in a tweet that assistant sub-inspector Sitaram Yadav and head constable Mohan Jamre have been suspended with immediate effect.Chouhan said, "Such barbarism and erratic behaviour won't be tolerated at any cost. The guilty will be punished for the misdeeds." Chouhan has also ordered a probe into the matter.The incident threatened to turn into an inter-state dispute with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal taking to Twitter to condemn the incident."Too shocking for words! The barbaric and humiliating attack on Giani Prem Singh Granthi & other Sikhs in Madhya Pradesh is utterly inhuman and unacceptable. I urge CM@ChouhanShivraj to set an example of punitive action against those who treat the sword of the nation with such contempt," Badal tweeted.Barwani district Superintendent of Police Nimish Agrawal said a probe by a sub-divisional police officer has been ordered into the incident, which took place on Thursday.Prem Singh said he runs a small shop close to the police 'chowki' and deals in old locks and keys. But Agrawal claimed Prem Singh was inebriated and created ruckus when he was asked to show his driving licence during a checking drive. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/madhya-pradesh-cm-suspends-two-cops-for-assaulting-sikh-man-123460

Apart from the higher case mortality, these districts account for 17 pc of India’s active cases, high daily new cases, low tests per million, and high confirmation percentage.Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan spoke to principal health secretaries of the four states asking them to follow central advisories to contain the pandemic.These rising cases in these 16 districts are a matter of concern, said Bhushan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-19-centre-engages-16-districts-with-17-of-overall-active-case-load-123456
07-08-2020||New Delhi||India’s COVID-19 management marked by rising recovery rate, falling fatality rate: Centre||India’s COVID-19 management is marked by “two significant achievements” of continuously rising recovery rate among coronavirus patients and a case fatality rate that had remained much below the global average, the Union Health Ministry said on Friday.While the recovery rate among coronavirus patients had risen to a record high of 67.98 per cent, the fatality rate had gone down to 2.05 per cent, it said.“These two in tandem have enabled a higher and rising difference of more than 7.7 lakh between the number of recovered patients and active cases in India,” the Ministry said.With 49,769 patients recuperating from the disease in 24 hours, the number of recoveries has jumped to 13,78,105 on Friday.Also read: India reports record 62,538 coronavirus cases; tally crosses 20 lakh“The recovery rate has increased from 51.08 per cent on June 15 to 67.98 per cent on August 7, while active cases, which comprised 46.06 per cent of the total COVID-19 caseload on June 15 now account for 29.96 per cent,” it said.“Ramped up hospital infrastructure and emphasis on efficient treatment of hospitalised patients through the standard of care incorporated in the Clinical Treatment Protocol issued by the Centre, have effectively ensured improvement in the recovery rate,” the Ministry added.It said the average daily recovered cases (seven-day moving average) had increased from around 26,000 cases to 44,000 cases in the past two weeks.“Sustained efforts by the Centre, states and Union Territories through focused and coordinated containment, widespread testing combined with supervised isolation and effective treatment have ensured the decline in the percentage of active cases and rise of the percentage of recoveries,” the Health Ministry said, adding: “In a testament to the consistent and coordinated efforts of the Centre and the state and UT governments, India continues its track record of testing more than 6 lakh COVID-19 samples each day for the fourth successive day.”Expanded diagnostic lab network and facilitation for easy testing across the country have given a boost, and with 6,39,042 tests conducted on Thursday, India has done 2,27,88,393 tests so far.With India’s cumulative testing rising from 1.2 crore on July 14 to 2.2 crore as on date, the COVID-19 positivity rate has seen an increase from 7.5 to 8.87 per cent during the same period, the Union health ministry said on Friday.The seven-day moving average in daily tests conducted has significantly improved from around 2.69 lakh on July 14 to around 5.66 lakh on August 6.“Although a higher number of tests will push the positivity rate initially, but as Delhi experience has amply shown, it will eventually lower when combined with other measures such as prompt isolation, tracking and timely clinical management,” the Ministry underlined.Registering a record 62,538 cases in 24 hours, India’s COVID-19 tally galloped past 20 lakh on Friday while the death toll climbed to 41,585 with 886 people succumbing to the infection in 24 hours, the Ministry’s data updated at 8 am showed.

07-08-2020||New Delhi||Markaz issue: Attempt for gag order on media will destroy freedom of citizens to know, govt tells SC||The Centre on Friday told the Supreme Court that a Muslim body’s attempt to obtain a blanket “gag order” on the entire media to prevent them from reporting the Markaz Nizamuddin issue would effectively destroy the freedom of the citizenry to know and the right of journalists to ensure an informed society.The government said that in the absence of any specific information about any objectionable news published or aired by a specific news channel or agency, the Constitution and the applicable statutes did not give it any authority to unilaterally pass any censure order under the Cable Television Networks Rules.The Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind filed a plea in the Apex Court seeking directions to the Centre to stop the dissemination of “fake news” related to a religious gathering at Markaz Nizamuddin and take strict action against those responsible for it.The Jamiat has alleged that the unfortunate incident of Tablighi Jamaat was being used to “demonise” and blame the entire Muslim community and sought to restrain the media from publishing and airing such reports.The Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Markaz Nizamuddin in central Delhi in March was accused of accelerating the spread of the novel coronavirus, with its attendees carrying the infection to different parts of the country.A bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian took the Centre’s affidavit on record and asked the petitioner to file their rejoinder by August 26, the next date of hearing.In its affidavit filed in reply to the plea of the Jamiat Ulemma e-Hind, the Centre said: “...Attempts to seek a blanket ‘gag order’ against the entire media in respect of Markaz Nizamuddin issue will effectively destroy the freedom of the citizen to know about the affairs of respective sections of the society in the nation and the right of the journalist to ensure an informed society.”It said that dissemination of facts by the media, prima facie, did not amount to attack religion or religious communities and the same also does not amount to visuals or words contemptuous of religious groups or words and opinions which promote communal attitudes.The Centre said the relief sought in the petition was nothing but a relief akin to a “blanket gag order” on the entire media in respect of reporting of the Nizamuddin Markaz incident.“The prayers of such sweeping nature ought not to be entertained by this court, in as much as, the same will inevitably result in muzzling, stifling and choking of free speech as guaranteed to the media house/journalist under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution of India,” the Centre said.It said passing of any blanket order in the nature of a “gag order”, as prayed in the writ petition, without identifying the specific objectionable news reports published by a named and identified media house and without affording an opportunity to hear such media house, channel or agency would ex-facie result in stifling of the right guaranteed to the journalists and media house under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, to air their views through television as well as print media.“Such an order would inevitably also impinge upon freedom of the citizen to know about the affairs of the society and the right of the journalist to ensure an informed society,” the Centre said, adding that the petition, which falls to name/identify a definite objectionable report published or carried out by named and identified media house, was liable to be dismissed.It said reporting of incidents, which had transpired in the society during the lockdown and airing views on the same, was protected speech under the Constitution of India.The government said: “Action such as registration of FIRs in specifically identified cases where instances of false reporting offending the religious sentiments of the public, has come to light; issuance of blocking orders, wherever, the union of India has come across inciting posts and issuance of advisories to the social media platform to prevent the circulation of false news related to coronavirus has been taken.”“Any order passed by the answering respondent, on the basis of pleading made in the present petition and the other connected petition would be completely contrary to the right of free speech guaranteed to journalist and media houses and would amount to arbitrary censure of the journalistic freedom,” it added.The affidavit said insofar as the Markaz issue was concerned, the government had neither come across nor had been intimated with any specific media report which had violated the provision of Cable Television Network Rules, 1994.“The news reports based on facts which are prima facie not per se false or fake cannot be censured under Article 19 (2) of the Constitution. Dissemination of such facts by the media houses, even though they may appear to be offensive or distasteful to certain individuals or a section of society, is nevertheless, protected under Article 19 (1) (a),” it said.“The censure of such nature would not only impinge but would also abrogate the right to know of the remaining section of the society about true and correct facts related to the Markaz event during COVID era and the right of a journalist to keep the society informed,” it said.The government said that the appropriate efficacious remedy for the petitioner was to approach to the secretary of the Press Council of India.

Sathe was a former Wing Commander of the Indian Air Force (IAF) and had served at the force's flight testing establishment."Unfortunately the pilots have passed away and we are in touch with their families in grief," said an Air India Express statement past midnight.The Civil Aviation Ministry said the Boeing 737 aircraft on a flight from Dubai to Kozhikode overshot the runway at Kozhikode airport at 7.41 pm on Friday. "No fire was reported at the time of landing," it said.There were 184 passengers including 10 infants, 2 pilots and 4 cabin crew onboard the aircraft, the ministry added.It was a repatriation flight operated by the Centre under the 'Vande Bharat' mission to bring home Indian nationals hit by international travel restrictions due to the spread of Covid-19.Also read: Pilot of ill-fated Air India Express plane was ‘Sword of Honour’ winnerKozhikode flight crash: Four cabin crew members safe, says airlinesKozhikode plane crash: AI Express says 3 relief flights arrangedKozhikode flight crash: Deceased passenger tests positive for COVID-19Slippery runway, strong tailwind likely caused Kozhikode crash: ExpertsDGCA had issued notice to Kozhikode airport in July 2019 over critical safety lapsesMalappuram District Collector K Gopalakrishan told reporters at the airport that 18 people on board the aircraft were killed in the accident. The identity of the victims was not immediately known.He also said some of the injured were in critical condition.Riyas, one of the passengers, who was rescued, said the flight went around the airport twice before attempting to land."I was in the back seat. There was a big noise and I don't know what happened after that," he told a TV channel.Fathima, another passenger, said the flight landed with heavy force and moved forward.A statement by civil aviation regulator DGCA said the airplane after landing at Runway 10 continued moving to the end of the runway amid heavy rain and "fell down in the valley and broke into two pieces".The Air India Express is a wholly owned subsidiary of Air India and it has only B737 aircraft in its fleet.TV footage from the accident site showed the aircraft split into two pieces and the debris lay scattered on the ground.The mishap brought back memories of the crash of Air India Express flight IX 812 on May 22, 2010, at Mangaluru International Airport.The flight from Dubai had overshot the runway and plunged down the cliff into a wooded valley, killing 158 people.The probe into the 2010 crash had found that the Captain misjudged the height while landing, resulting in the flight overshooting the runway located on a plateau.Help centres have being set up in Kozhikode, Sharjah and Dubai.#KozhikodeAirCrashPhone Numbers of Hospitals in Kozhikode where passengers are admitted#PIBKochi @TheKeralaPolice @DDNewsMalayalam @ndma @airindiain pic.twitter.com/FZI3vM8KjP  President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi were among several leaders who expressed shock at the accident.Modi also spoke to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan."Pained by the plane accident in Kozhikode. My thoughts are with those who lost their loved ones. May the injured recover at the earliest," the Prime Minister tweeted.Authorities are at the spot providing all assistance to the affected, Modi said.Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said he is deeply "anguished and distressed" at the accident and that relief teams from Air India and Airports Authority of India (AAI) are being immediately dispatched from Delhi and Mumbai."All efforts are being made to help passengers. A formal enquiry will be conducted by AAIB (Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau)," the minister said on Twitter."The Air India Express flight number AXB-1344 on its way from Dubai to Kozhikode with 190 persons on board, overshot the runway in rainy conditions & went down 35 ft. into a slope before breaking up into two pieces," he tweeted.In another tweet at 12.01 am, he said the rescue operations have been completed."Two investigation teams of professionals from @airindiain @AAI_Official & AAIB will leave for Kozhikode at 02.00 hrs & 05.00 hrs. Everyone has now been rescued from the aircraft. Rescue operations are now complete. Injured being treated at various city hospitals," he said.Screams of pain, blood soaked clothes, terrified children and the blare of ambulance sirens captured the distressing scene that unfolded after the ill fated plane fell into the valley with a deafening sound.Amid heavy rain, rescue personnel, including the local civil police, rushed to pull out the injured people from the aircraft while the passengers were stunned to even comprehend what had happened in a matter of moments that led to chaotic moments.Children, some as young as four or five years clung on to the rescue personnel while things strewn around, from shoes to baggage, bore tell tale signs of the agonising moments endured by passengers.The scene was similar in hospitals where the injured were rushed as screams rent the air with health workers trying to provide succor.People living nearby pitched in on time to lend a helping hand to the shocked passengers.A local man said he rushed to the airport after hearing a "terrible thud" when the airplane fell."Small kids were trapped under the seats and it was such a distressing sight," he said."When we reached there some were deplaned."Many of them were seriously injured."Legs were broken....My hands and shirt were soaked in the blood of the injured persons", he said.Another man in the rescue operations, who could not be immediately identified, told a TV channel that the "injured pilot of the aircraft was taken out from the cockpit after breaking it." By the time ambulances started reaching the spot, the locals had already started shifting injured passengers in cars to various hospitals in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts, he said.Collector Gopalakrishnan said 110 people were admitted to seven hospitals in Kozhikode and 11 among them are dead."Remaining are under treatment and their condition are at different stages. Among the 80 people admitted in Malappuram hospitals we have received information of six deaths there."Some of the patients are critical," he said.The official also said two passengers, who got trapped at the tail portion of the aircraft, were rescued with great difficulty.Chief Minister Vijayan asked all government agencies to engage in rescue operations using all government facilities.He has deputed state minister A C Moideen to coordinate the rescue operations.An Inspector General-rank officer was also deputed to oversee the operations.Fire and Rescue teams of two districts-- Kozhikode and Malappuram-- were also pressed into service.The condition of a mother and child injured in the accident was very serious, Health minister K K Shailaja said.

07-08-2020||Srinagar||Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh may see temperature rise of 7 degrees by 2100||Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh may witness a temperature increase of up to 6.9 degrees Celsius by the end of the century due to climate change, according to a study which warns that the glaciers in this Himalayan region could shrink by 85 per cent if the projections come true.The study, published in the journal Climatic Change on July 29, predicted the impact of future climate change in the Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh Himalaya, by the end of the twenty-first century using an ensemble of 11 models under three greenhouse gas emission scenarios.It also highlights the changes in the distribution of the prevalent climate zones in the region.“The study has been carried over the entire region of Jammu and Kashmir, including Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit-Baltistan, Aksai Chin and other regions across the Line of Control (LoC),” noted Professor Shakil Ahmad Romshoo, Dean of Research at the University of Kashmir.“The average annual temperature is projected to increase by 4.5 degrees Celsius, 3.98 degrees Celsius, and 6.93 degrees Celsius by the end of the twenty first century under three different scenarios, respectively,” Romshoo, lead author of the research, told PTI.The temperature increase of 6.9 degrees Celsius for the Jammu and Kashmir Himalayas is way more than the projected average rise in the global and national temperatures by the end of the century.Romshoo added that if the current emission rates of  greenhouse gases are sustained, the global average temperature is likely to rise by nearly 5 degrees Celsius by the end of the twenty-first century under the worst case scenario.Similarly, the average temperature over India is projected to rise by approximately 4.4 degrees Celsius under such a scenario, he said.Romshoo noted that there will be significant impacts on almost every sector of the economy in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh due to this climate change driven temperature increase.“The glaciers, the most important resource of the region, are going to shrink by around 85 per cent by the end of the century if the projections come true,” the professor at the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Kashmir, noted.He explained that this would lead to significant depletion of the streamflows in the Indus basin, the waters of which are shared between several countries in South Asia.Similarly, the impacts on agriculture, horticulture and even tourism shall significantly threaten the livelihood of the dependent population in the region, the environmentalist warned.The researchers, including Jasia Bashir and Irfan Rashid from the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Kashmir, noted that the drivers of climate change are primarily the increasing emission rates of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.Greenhouse gas emission is directly related to fossil fuel use, industrialisation, deforestation, air pollution, and other environmental unfriendly activities across the globe, they explained.“Though, the mountainous regions like Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh are the least industrialised, unfortunately, they are bearing the brunt of the climate change as the phenomena has global dimensions and footprint,” Romshoo noted.The projected climate change under the three emission scenarios also indicates significant changes in the distribution of prevalent climate zones.The projected climate change under different scenarios revealed that the subtropical and temperate climatic zones would expand while the cold desert climate zone is projected to shrink significantly under all the three scenarios, the researchers noted.“The cold desert climate zone in the Ladakh region would shrink by 22 per cent and correspondingly the subtropical and temperate zones would expand due to the projected climate change,” the researchers noted in their study.“The projected changes in the climate and climate zones by the end of the twenty-first century would have significant impacts on various sectors in the region which might lead to the redistribution and changes in the composition of vegetation, enhancement of snow depletion and glacier recession,” said Romshoo.He noted that the situation would also lead to an increase in the frequency of climate extremes, changes in streamflows, in the faunal and floral biodiversity, plant invasions, changes in agriculture and horticulture productivity.This is in addition to the loss of hydropower generation, ecosystem services, and impacts on other key economic sectors in the region, according to the researchers.“The vital information generated in this research would inform policymaking for framing robust strategies for adaptation and mitigation of the impacts of climate change on various socioeconomic and ecological sectors in the region,” Romshoo added.

07-08-2020||New Delhi||Core objective of NEP will be translated into action through National Curriculum Framework: CBSE||The core objective of the new National Education Policy (NEP), which has given freedom for amalgamation of different concepts, would be translated into action through the National Curriculum Framework, CBSE director said on Friday.The CBSE director, Biswajit Saha, made the comments during an e-conclave on the new NEP organised by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.“The core objective of the policy will be translated into action through the National Curriculum Framework (NCF), which needs a more participatory approach. The policy has given freedom for amalgamation of different concepts and multidisciplinary approach. The NCF will give a roadmap for implementation of reforms laid down in the policy,” he said.Saha said the training required for competency-based education and learning outcomes could be achieved with progressive participation of stakeholders.“There could be a debate about the training required for competency-based education and learning outcomes but once we have decided we want to do it, it can be achieved with progressive participation of stakeholders. It is a forward-looking policy,” the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) director said.He said the policy was in the direction for energising the young population and reframe the national curriculum.“The policy talks about how early intervention will increase participation in vocational education in school and higher education. The policy is in the direction for energising the young population and reframe the national curriculum giving transformation and implementable action plan in school and higher education,” Saha said.“The core objective of imparting education is getting transformative in the coming times and intended to increase industry participation. The policy is giving a wider spectrum of opportunities to the student, allowing them to think for different avenues so that they can experience and decide the new focus areas,” he added.Aarti Srivastava, Department of Higher and Professional Education, National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration (NIEPA), said higher education was the engine for growth and propels all other sectors.“The education policy needs to meet future demands by rejuvenating and liberating the approach. There is a paradigm shift in the structure of education and setting up a higher education committee in India is in the pipeline. This will be substituting the other councils of higher education,” she said.“Research is an important part of a student's life and we are catering the same through the education system that will help to enhance critical thinking in the students,” Srivastava added.Jagdish Chand Chaudhary, CMD, Aakash Educational Services Limited, said there was a need for inculcating education at home for making India brighter and empowering rural areas and villages.“The heroes in our education system are the teachers and we need to train them so that they can establish the new education policy,” he said.The NEP approved by the Union Cabinet replaces the 34-year-old National Policy on Education framed in 1986 and is aimed at paving the way for transformational reforms in school and higher education systems to make India a global knowledge superpower.The choice between three or four-year undergraduate courses, multiple entry and exit options in degree courses, adding 3.5 crore seats in higher education institutions, which will now have a single regulator, discontinuation of MPhil programmes and fixation of fees are among the higher education reforms outlined in the new NEP.DK Aggarwal, President, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the new education policy focuses on universalisation of education from pre-school to secondary level and introducing new subjects to step up in the global world.“There is a reduction of curriculum and to propagate learning interactively based on practical learning. The focus is on the practice of concepts and making education more flexible, practical, learning and diversified,” he said.

Secondly, the high court is the proper court. Thirdly, we will have the advantage of high court order also,” the CJI said.The Bench allowed the petitioners to withdraw the PIL with liberty to move the high court.It was an agreement between a political party in India with the only political party in China, Jethmalani said, adding the issue related to national security.“We find that there is something which appears to be, what might be called, unheard of and absurd in law. You are saying that China has entered into an agreement with a political party and not the government.

Unfortunately, not many countries are willing to accept him,” Mahathir was quoted as saying by the WION news channel.When asked whether he would extradite Naik if he becomes the Prime Minister of Malaysia again, Mahathir said, “Well, we would like to send him to some country where we feel he will be safe”.He once again refused to send Naik to India, saying “at this moment we feel that he would not be safe from the Indian public”.Naik has been banned from any public activities in the multi-ethnic country after his controversial remarks against Malaysian Hindus and Chinese last year.   When Mahathir was the prime minister he had said that his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi did not request the extradition of Naik during a bilateral meeting in Russia in September 2019, a claim contested by India which has sought the extradition of the fugitive preacher.

Talk of holding a meeting of the Quad is significant amid tensions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and increased Chinese and US military presence in the South China Sea. Later in the day, Jaishankar and Pompeo were again at a video conference, this time with Foreign Ministers of Australia, Brazil and Israel on measures to combat Covid.Australia is an important member of the “Quad’’, Israel has close military ties with India and the present Brazil administration forms the cornerstone of US foreign policy in Latin America but is currently reeling under the impact of the pandemic.The Quad meetings were upgraded from official to ministerial levels in an indication of the seriousness behind the vision to provide an alternate mode of behavior in the South China Sea.Jaishankar’s post about discussing the possibility of a Quad meeting comes two days after Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi made reconciliatory statements about China-US ties. In an interview, he said China was ready for “candid, effective consultation’’ with the US and make “cool-headed and sensible response’’ to the impulsive moves and anxiety of the US side.Pompeo and Jaishankar also agreed to continue close cooperation on a full range of regional and international issues and looked forward to Quadrilateral consultations and the US-India 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue later this year, said a US State Department readout.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-tension-on-lac-india-us-talk-of-quad-meeting-123442

But the government launched the Vande Bharat Mission in May to evacuate stranded Indian abroad.According to data available with the MoCA, at least 10 lakh people have so far been repatriated from across the world.On July 16, the MoCA announced setting up bilateral “air bubbles” with countries to partially resume international flights to various destinations. Under the scheme, deals were struck with the US, the UK, Germany, France and the UAE.An air bubble is a travel corridor between two countries under which scheduled commercial flights can be operated in a regulated environment. This arrangement has been made due to several travel restrictions across the world.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mha-allows-oic-cardholders-of-countries-having-air-bubble-pact-to-enter-india-123437

It is not a matter of Madhya Pradesh or Punjab, it is a matter of farmers of the entire country and their livelihood,” he said.Referring to the historical connection of Basmati rice of Madhya Pradesh, he had recently urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to grant a GI status to the state’s Basmati rice “to encourage farmers and Basmati rice based industries”.In his letter to the PM, Amarinder Singh said this would affect the interests of Punjab and other states whose Basmati rice already has a GI tag.However, according to Chouhan, “Basmati is being produced in 13 districts of Madhya Pradesh since the year 1908. It has been registered in history. Basmati rice of Madhya Pradesh is considered very tasty and is famous both in the country and abroad for its flavours and fragrance.”“The IIRR, Hyderabad, and other specialist institutions have confirmed reports in connection with the traditional cultivation of Basmati in Madhya Pradesh,” Chouhan mentioned.A GI tag is an indication used on products that have a specific geographical origin and possess qualities or a reputation that are due to the origin.The tag conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness and plays a major role in trade, improving its prospects. Geographical indications are typically used for agricultural products, foodstuffs, wine and spirit drinks, handicrafts and industrial products.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/war-over-gi-tag-for-mp-basmati-shivraj-singh-chouhan-complains-to-sonia-about-punjab-cm-123434
07-08-2020||New Delhi||PM SVANidhi: Centre launches ‘Letter of Recommendation’ module for street vendors||Street vendors, who don’t have identity cards or certificate of vending, will now be able to avail benefits under the PM SVANidhi scheme as the Centre on Friday launched the ‘Letter of Recommendation’ module through which they can get loans of up to Rs 10,000.According to a statement, Union Housing and Urban Affairs (HUA) Secretary Durga Shanker Mishra launched the facility and said an eligible vendor could request for a Letter of Recommendation (LoR) with the urban local body.Under the Pradhan Mantri Street Vendor’s Atmanirbhar Nidhi (PM SVANidhi) scheme, vendors can avail a working capital loan of up to Rs 10,000 which is repayable in monthly instalments in the tenure of one year.Mishra said after getting the LoR, a vendor could apply for a loan under the scheme.According to the Ministry, the LoR module is designed to give access to the street vendors, who do not have identity cards and certificates of vending and are not in the surveyed list for availing benefits under the scheme.The PM SVANidhi was launched by the HUA Ministry on June 1 for providing affordable working capital loan to street vendors to resume their livelihoods that have been adversely affected due to the pandemic-induced lockdown.According to the statement, to apply for the LoR from the urban local body through an online module on the PM SVANidhi portal, a vendor needs to possess any one of these documents — proof of availing one-time assistance provided by certain states during the period of lockdown, membership details with the vendors’ associations, or any other documents to prove that he is a vendor.“Also, a vendor can also request ULB (urban local body) through a simple application on white paper to conduct a local enquiry to ascertain the genuineness of the claim as a vendor. ULBs will have to dispose of the request for issue of LoR within a period of 15 days,” HUA said in the statement.It stated that the vendors possessing the LoR will be issued a certificate of vending or identity card within a period of 30 days, adding that this provision would help in extending the reach of the scheme to the maximum number of beneficiaries.It also stated that since the commencement of online submission of loan applications on the PM SVANidhi portal on July 2, more than 4.45 lakh applications had been received and over 82,000 had been sanctioned in various states and Union Territories.This scheme targets to benefit over 50 lakh street vendors who had been vending on or before March 24 this year in urban areas, including those from surrounding peri-urban/ rural areas.

The story can be read here: Netizen arrested due to online rumor-mongering on military vehicle Zhou was arrested by local police on August 4 and “confessed to his crime of rumour-mongering, showed remorse, and wrote a sincere apology letter”.It is not clear what linkage Zhou sought to establish between the deaths in a remote place and alleged faults in Dongfeng vehicles as the report provided no further details.The report was commented on social media by strategic analyst Brahma Chellaney. The punishment of writing an apology letter if unaccompanied by a jail term would suggest that Zhou may only have been venting his ire against the company.China still hides its losses from the June 15 clashes with India. But now PLA's official website, China Military Online, reports the arrest of one citizen for blaming corruption in procurement of vehicles for the death of Chinese soldiers in those clashes. https://t.co/BBNysVJp02||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinese-national-mentions-pla-galwan-deaths-arrested-as-rumour-monger-123416

07-08-2020||Satya Prakash||Italian Marines’ Case: SC wants to hear victims’ families before closing case||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, August 7The Supreme Court on Friday said it would like to hear the relatives of the two Indians killed by the Italian marines, off the coast in Kerala in 2012, before closing the case.“First, let Italy pay them compensation, only then we will allow withdrawal of prosecution. Bring the cheques and the victims’ kin here,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta.A day after an international tribunal ruled that India didn’t have jurisdiction to try the two Italian marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen in Kerala, the Centre, on July 3, had moved the Supreme Court seeking disposal of the case pending before it.In an application filed in the top court, the Centre had said it had accepted the award of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).“...the Republic of India has taken a decision to accept and abide by the Award passed by the said Tribunal, which would have the bearing on the continuance of present proceedings before this Hon’ble Court,” the Centre had submitted.On Friday, Mehta said Italy had assured India that it would prosecute the marines.As the Bench asked about the adequacy of compensation to be paid to the families of the victims, Mehta said the Centre would ensure that maximum compensation was paid to them.But the Bench made it clear that it would not pass orders for closure of the case against the two Italian marines without hearing the victims’ families.It asked the Centre to file an application within a week to make the victims’ families parties to its plea seeking closure of the case against Italian marines.“We cannot think of any relief for Marines till their prosecution is not withdrawn in Kerala court,” the Bench said.“We are willing to file a petition for withdrawing prosecution of the two marines,” Mehta said even as the CJI said victims’ families would have to be heard.In its application, the Centre said it would abide by the award in killings of two fishermen by Italian Marines Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, who were on board the Italian-flagged commercial oil tanker, MV Enrica Lexie, when they allegedly fired at two Indian fishermen off the Kerala coast on February 15, 2012.“India, being a Party to the UNCLOS, in accordance with the provisions of the UNCLOS and the Rules of Procedure agreed by the Parties, the Award is final and without appeal and shall be complied with by the parties to the dispute (Article 11, Annex VII, UNCLOS),” it said.The Hague-based tribunal on July 2 ruled that the two marines should be tried in Italy and asked the Indian authorities to close the criminal case against them.The tribunal, however, agreed with India’s contention that the Italian marines broke the freedom of navigation aspect of the UNCLOS and, therefore, the killed fishermen’s kin were entitled to compensation.Italy had offered Rs 1 crore compensation in 2012 to the family of each of the killed fishermen. Now, India and Italy would have to work out the blood-money. They can move PCA in case of any disagreement.New Delhi had alleged that the two Italian marines aboard the Italian commercial oil tanker killed the Indian fishermen.The Supreme Court, in 2014, had stayed the criminal proceedings against the two Italian marines before a special court at Kollam in Kerala. In 2015, it halted all proceedings before all courts in India in view of an ITLOS order calling upon India and Italy to suspend all criminal proceedings against the two marines.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/italian-marines-case-sc-wants-to-hear-victims-families-before-closing-case-123390

Big boulders are also scattered around the site.Addressing a press conference in Thiruvananthapuram, the Chief Minister said 15 people died in the mishap.Teams of National Disaster Response Force personnel were on their way to Pettimudi for joining the rescue operations and the government has also sought an Indian Air Force helicopter to assist in the mission, he said.Crime Branch IG Gopesh Agarwal has been appointed as special officer for coordinating the rescue and rehabilitation operations in Pettimudi, Vijayan said.Condoling the death of workers in the tragedy, the Chief Minister announced initial solatium of Rs 5 lakh each for the kinof the dead. Treatment expenses for the injured will be borne by the government, he said.In view of the Pettimudi incident, the district collectors have been directed to ensure safety and security of the workers staying in dwelling units in the tea estates.The Prime Minister’s Office said in a tweet that an ex- gratia of Rs 2 lakh each from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) would be given to the next of kin of those killed in the landslide.Rs 50,000 each would be given to those injured.“Pained by the loss of lives due to a landslide in Rajamalai, Idukki. In this hour of grief, my thoughts are with the bereaved families,” Modi tweeted.Praying for the early recovery of the injured, he said NDRF and the administration were working on the ground, providing assistance to the affected.Home Minister Shah in a tweet said an NDRF team has reached Iddukki to assist in the rescue and relief operations.Rahul Gandhi, who represents Wayanad in Lok Sabha, in a message said “This is a terrible tragedy.  I urge all our Congress party workers and leaders to lend a helping hand at this time and do whatever they can to mitigate the suffering of our brothers and sisters who are in need of help.”    The death toll in rain-related incidents since June 1 this year has risen to 51. One person died in a house collapse in Palakkad on Friday, officials said.Idukki District Collector H Dinesh told PTI that “Most of the people (affected in the landslide) are plantation workers and from neighbouring Tamil Nadu”.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has sounded a red alert for Idukki on Friday, indicating extremely heavy rains of over 20 cms.In the last 24 hours ended at 8.30 am, Peermade in the district recorded the maximum of 26.1 cm, it said. Several other districts also received rains in excess of 10 cms.The tragedy came to light after a forest watchman informed authorities about the landslide. The communication lines have been down in the area since the past three days.Police and Fire force personnel and local people took up the rescue operations amid the rains.Munnar MLA S Rajendran told the media earlier in the day that it was difficult to reach the spot as a bridge which provided access to the area was washed away in the rain.The state health department has dispatched 15 ambulances and a special medical team to provide medical assistance to the victims of the landslide.Defence sources said a helicopter was ready at the Southern Air Command in Thiruvananthapuram, but was waiting for the weather to clear.Besides in Idukki, the IMD also forecast extreme heavy rains in Wayanad and Kottayam districts in the next two days, raising fears of more landslides in the Western Ghats region.The torrential rains also caused flooding in rivers originating from the Western Ghats, a report from Kochi said.Authorities in Ernakulam, Thrissur, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts have sounded alerts with excess water being released from dams built across the rivers.The rains in hilly areas have caused a sudden rise in the water level in rivers Periyar and Muvattupuzha flowing through Ernakulam district, which was among the badly hit during the 2018 deluge that claimed over 400 lives and left lakhs of people homeless in the state.Taking precautionary measures to deal with flood situation, the Ernakulam district administration has opened camps in Aluva and Muvattupuzha and several families were shifted there after flood waters entered residential areas in Muvattupuzha, Kothamangalam, Kochi and Parvur taluks.In view of incidents of landslides, Ernakulam District Collector S Suhas issued an order banning all mining activities in the district.Rise in water levels in the rivers flowing through Thrissur, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts have also been reported due to continuing rains.

07-08-2020||Lucknow||Won't attend mosque inauguration, says Adityanath; SP asks him to apologise||The Samajwadi Party on Friday sought an apology from Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over his remark that he would not attend the inauguration of the mosque to be built in Ayodhya, replacing the demolished Babri Masjid.After the bhoomi pujan for a Ram temple in Ayodhya, Adityanath had said on television that “as a yogi and as a Hindu” he couldn't go for the inauguration of a mosque.Reacting to the remark, the opposition SP said he should seek an apology from the people of the state. When contacted, a UP Congress spokesperson, however, refused to comment on the chief minister's remarks over the mosque."If you ask me as a chief minister, I have no problem with any belief, religion or community. If you ask me as a yogi, I will definitely not go because as a Hindu I have the right to express my 'upasana vidhi' (way of worship) and act accordingly," Adityanath had said."I am neither 'vaadi or “prativadi' (petitioner nor respondent). That is why neither will I be invited, nor will I go. I know, I won't be getting any such invitation,” he said.The day they invite me, secularism of many will be in danger. That's why I want that their secularism should not be in danger and I continue to silently work to ensure that everyone benefits from government scheme without any discrimination," he said.He claimed that the Congress never wanted a solution to the dispute. “They wanted the dispute to continue for their political benefit."             "Attending roza-iftar with a skull cap is not secularism. People also know that this is drama. People know the reality," the CM said.SP spokesperson Pawan Pandey criticised Adityanath over his remarks, charging that he has violated the oath he took while assuming charge as the chief minister.“He is the CM of the entire state, and not only of the Hindu community. Whatever the population of Hindus and Muslims in the state, he is the CM of all. This language of the CM lacks dignity,” he said.“He should seek an apology from the people for this," Pandey said.UP Congress media cell convenor Lalan Kumar said, "We don't have any comments on his mosque statement."           But he credited the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi for opening the locks on the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid.Referring to the ruling BJP, the Congress spokesperson said, “They play politics of fake Hindutva. The Congress has always talked about whatever is in the interest of people.“Lord Ram is everyone's, but the BJP wants to show that Ram is theirs alone,” he added.Yogi Adityanath had attended the groundbreaking ceremony Wednesday for a Ram temple in Ayodhya, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the main guest.Last November, the Supreme Court had settled the Ayodhya land dispute, allowing the construction of the temple at Ram Janmabhoomi by a trust.The apex court had also ordered the allocation of a five-acre plot of land elsewhere in Ayodhya for the construction of a mosque, in place of the Babri Masjid which was demolished by ‘kar sevaks' in 1992. A trust has been formed by the Sunni Waqf Board for building this mosque.

07-08-2020||New Delhi||As Covid cases rise, experts say India 'lacks structural mechanism' to assess biothreats||Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, security experts have said that the various Indian agencies lacked a structural mechanism to gather and share information relating to biothreats, despite the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) arguing in its favour in a report published in 2008.Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a senior official in the security establishment said, “Twelve years have passed since the NDMA had recommended in its 156-page report. Indian agencies have so far failed put in place structural mechanisms to assess biological threats to the country.”The guidelines for the management of biological disasters formulated in July 2008 by the NDMA had strongly recommended the need for assessment of “threat perceptions and intelligence inputs” on biothreats. This included those which could be perpetrated by enemy countries or terrorist organisations, sources said.Many working within security agencies have felt that such “surveillance mechanisms” could have helped in early detection and mitigation of Covid-19 pandemic. It would have also helped in checking the entry of foreign Tablighis, who were later allegedly accused of being the initial spreaders of the contagion.Timely intervention, through advanced intelligence, could have saved the miseries on the health and economy fronts that have crippled the country due to the continuing spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, they argued.“With experience in hand after dealing with the spread of COVID-19, India now needs to maintain a necessary level of epidemiological intelligence to pick up early warning signals of emerging and re-emerging diseases in the magnitude of a pandemic,” another official said.He went on to add that this would also require advance knowledge of the activities of India’s adversaries in "developing a potential BW (bio-warfare) and its potential use during the war and by terrorist outfits”.The NDMA, in its report, had clearly spelt out the role of various agencies in gathering inputs on biological disasters, as it said, “A coordinated action plan of the intelligence agencies, MHA, MoH&FW and MoD (Ministry of Defence) will be developed and put in place to gather intelligence and develop appropriate deterrence and defence strategies.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-covid-cases-rise-experts-say-india-lacks-structural-mechanism-to-assess-biothreats-123374

The importer, a private firm, did not have the required permission to import the substance. The seized chemicals are valued at around Rs 1.80 crore, they added.Ammonium nitrate, widely used in fertilizers and explosives, is reported to have been the cause of massive explosions in the Lebanese capital. The explosion was caused by 2,750 tonnes of the chemical stored at a port in the Beirut city.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-orders-security-audit-of-large-warehouses-ports-after-beirut-explosion-123372

You might be activist but why do this? What kind of nonsense is this.. It is obscenity clearly. And you are spreading it. It will leave the society in a very bad taste," Justice Mishra said.Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan  --representing the activist -- argued that she had been charged with child pornography and not obscenity. "The children are fully clothed," he said."What kind of case you have brought before us? I am a little baffled," said Justice Mishra.Noting that the act in question prima face fell within the ambit of child pornography, the top court dismissed her petition.She had raised two issues -- if female nudity per se constituted obscenity; and if children painting on their mother's body could be termed as "sexual gratification" and "child abuse". The activist had moved the Supreme Court challenging the July 24 order of the Kerala High Court rejecting her anticipatory bail plea in a case registered against her under the POCSO Act and Information Technology Act for her controversial video involving her minor children aged 8 and 14 painting her semi-nude body.The High Court held there was prima facie case made out against her.She had uploaded a video titled "Body art and politics" on YouTube showing her children painting on her semi-nude body. She submitted the video had not been taken down by the platform itself as there was no nudity in it and hence the prosecution claim of child pornography was unfounded.But the Kerala High Court didn't buy her arguments.If an imagery of this nature could be published on the internet for the purpose of sex education was a question that needed to be decided ultimately, the HC said.However, it held that prima facie it was problematic and covered by the explanation to Section 13 of POCSO Act that dealt with acts involving a child for facilitation and distribution of pornographic material.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-rejects-activist-rehanas-anticipatory-bail-plea-123367
07-08-2020||---||Rhea 'over-dosed' Sushant Rajput with drugs, spread word that he was ‘mentally ill’: Bihar govt to SC||New Delhi, August 7 The Bihar Government on Friday alleged before the Supreme Court Rhea Chakraborty gave drug overdose to actor Sushant Singh Rajput who was found dead in his Bandra home on June 14 under suspicious circumstances.In an affidavit filed in response to Chakraborty’s plea for transfer of an FIR lodged against her in Patna to Mumbai in connection with Rajput’s unnatural death, the Bihar Government sought dismissal of her plea, terming it premature, mis-conceived and not maintainable.Chakraborty, said to be the deceased actor’s girlfriend, is now being probed as an accused in the case by the CBI after an FIR lodged against her in Patna got transferred to the central agency.“She over-dosed him with drugs and then spread the word that he was mentally ill”, the affidavit said, citing Sushant’s father’s complaint that has since been transferred to CBI.Sushant’s father had given a written complaint to the SHO, Rajeev Nagar Police Station, Patna, stating that in the year 2019 Rhea Chakraborty came in contact with his son with the sole intention to grab crores of rupees—which was hard earned money of the deceased actor, the affidavit states.“It is further stated that the petitioner and her relative namely Indrajeet Chakraborty, Sandhya Chakraborty, Shovik Chakraborty used to completely interfere in the life of the deceased actor.“The petitioner (Rhea) and her relative desperately attempting to give impression to the deceased actor that he is suffering from mental illness for which he required treatment. The petitioner also took the deceased to her house where she started giving him overdose of medicines,” said the affidavit, citing Sushant’s father KK Singh.The Bihar Government recommended a CBI probe given the sensitivity of the matter, inter-state ramification and presence of most of the accused in Mumbai, said the affidavit filed by Patna Senior Superintendent of Police Upendra Sharma.Chakraborty came in contact with Sushant only to grab his wealth, it said, adding that Rhea took all his belongings into her possession and made every attempt to keep him away from his family.“The petitioner also took his bank account details and started using the bank account according to her wishes. The deceased actor wanted to leave the film industry and do organic farming in Coorg, however, the petitioner started blackmailing the deceased actor by saying that she will give his medical report to the media and prove him ‘mad’ after which he will not get any kind of work,” the affidavit stated.“The deceased actor had informed his sister that the petitioner (Rhea) will falsely implicate him, if the deceased did not pay heed to her,” the affidavit stated.The affidavit was filed on a day when a Bench headed by CJI SA Bobde dismissed a PIL by a law student seeking a CBI probe into the actor’s death after being told that it has already been taken over by the CBI. The Centre has filed an impleadment application.The top court had on Wednesday said the truth behind the “unfortunate” death of a “gifted and talented artist” should come out.It had asked Rajput’s father, Bihar and Maharashtra governments to respond in three days to her petition.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rhea-over-dosed-sushant-rajput-with-drugs-spread-word-that-he-was-mentally-ill-bihar-govt-to-sc-123363
07-08-2020||New Delhi||National Education Policy-2020 will make students future-ready, take India to greater heights: Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday urged education leaders of India to lay the road map for the implementation of the National Education Policy 2020 saying the policy will make students future-ready and take the country to new heights in the 21st century.The target of NEP 2020 is to keep students future-ready and to lay the foundations for new India, the PM said while addressing a conclave on NEP’s higher education reforms organised by the Education Ministry.The Prime Minister said NEP aimed to make India powerful, take it to greater heights, empower students and afford them opportunities to grow.Terming the ongoing ideological debate on the policy as “healthy”, the PM said the good part was “no one had accused NEP of bias.“He said it was natural for some people to ask how such a radical reform would translate on the ground.“All eyes are on the implementation of NEP now and a new era in dialogue between stakeholders is set to begin. All of you should lay a roadmap for implementation of NEP, convert the policy into action and set timelines. I assure you complete political backing and will,” the PM told the heads of higher education institutions.He said it had become imperative for the Indian education system to transform itself given the changing world order and new global education standards.“So far the Indian education system had not seen any major reform. Students remained trapped in the rat race to become doctors or engineers or lawyers. Their interest, ability and demand had not been mapped. It was important to free the system of this rat race and inculcate creative and innovative thinking in students. NEP does that successfully by taking a holistic view rather than think in silos,” said the PM in the presence of space scientist K Kasturirangan, who led the NEP drafting process that took four years of consultations.The PM also commented on the mother tongue issue saying there can be no debate on the fact that children learned better in their mother tongue and should preferably be taught till class 5 in mother language as recommended by the NEP.Emphasising dignity of labour the PM also said Indian students must learn to respect all forms of labour for which the NEP takes the necessary steps.“We have to think how a culturally rich India came to discriminate between people. Our students must respect the sacrifice farmers and labourers make towards nation-building. Dignity of labour has been stressed in NEP,” he said adding that the document equally emphasises the dignity of teachers who will create and shape good global citizens.The PM said NEP seeks to create global citizens who are rooted in Indian culture and values.Listing reforms including a reduction in school syllabus, academic credit bank and multiple entry and exit in colleges, the PM said the students will now have the freedom to choose a course and leave it to pursue another if they want.“We are entering an era where a person won’t be stuck to one job for years. He would need to reskill and upskill himself. NEP addresses this and rids higher education of regimented streams by encouraging flexibility to learn,” Modi said assuring autonomy to colleges that advance NEP goals.The PM also said the new NEP will shift the focus of students from “what to think” to “how to think “ citing the two questions that confronted the government when preparing the policy — does the existing education system inspire students towards curiosity- and creativity-driven life; does the existing system empower youth and society.“Everyone knew the answers to these questions. NEP 2020 engaged these questions seriously and addressed them successfully,” said the PM telling the education ministry to show resolve to implement the policy which he said was not a mere circular but a harbinger of the dreams of millions of Indian students.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/national-education-policy-2020-will-make-students-future-ready-take-india-to-greater-heights-modi-123362

07-08-2020||New Delhi||HC upholds DU decision to conduct online OBE for final year courses with directions||The Delhi High Court on Friday gave its nod to the Delhi University for conducting online Open Book Examination (OBE) for final year undergraduate courses from August 10 with a slew of directions.Justice Prathiba M Singh said the questions papers will be sent to the students’ email ID and be uploaded on the varsity’s portal and they will be given an extra hour to upload the answer sheets.The varsity is directed to send an auto generated email informing the students that their answer sheets have been received, the high court, which was pronouncing the judgement through video conferencing, said.“I wish the students and Delhi University all the best for the exams,” Justice Singh said.The court passed the verdict on a plea challenging the varsity’s decision to hold online OBE, as per the UGC guidelines, for final year undergraduate courses which will be in long form exams.The DU is scheduled to hold final year undergraduate online OBE from August 10-31 and the students who will be left out of online exams will be given an opportunity to appear in physical examinations, to be held sometime in September.The high court, while delivering the judgement, also directed that details of nodal officer and central email ID be published on the DU website and asked the Common Service Centres (CSC), which have been set up to provide services to students who do not have infrastructure to give OBE, to notify all its centres by the end of the day.“There shall be a grievance officer to address the issues raised by students, including problems in downloading question paper and uploading answer sheets. In case of non-redressal, the complaint to be forwarded to the Grievance Committee,” it said.The court reconstituted the Grievance Committee under the aegis of retired Justice Prathiba Rani and said that the panel will function till OBE continues and the students’ complaints need to be addressed within five days.The court said OBE results ought to be announced in a short period and the answer sheets be simultaneously sent for evaluation.It asked the DU and the committee to file their respective reports after the exams are over.The university had earlier informed the court that the idea behind holding online OBE was to prevent students from assembling in one hall where it would be difficult to maintain social distancing in the times of COVID-19 pandemic.The DU’s counsel had submitted that a student does not need very high technology to sit for online OBE as having an email will be sufficient and that connectivity issues will be far more in other modes.He had contended that the University Grants Commission guidelines, which mandates conducting exams for final year students, have foreclosed what is being sought by petitioners and they have to be subjected to examination.The UGC had submitted that for final year, majority of assessment cannot be internal based and so far as final year examinations are concerned, it has to be timed and can be online, offline or blended mode but they cannot be presentation based.

07-08-2020||Washington||Covid: US lifts global health travel advisory; urges citizens not to visit India, China||The US has lifted the highest level of its global health travel advisory for Americans due to the coronavirus pandemic and restored the previous country-specific system without changing the status of over 50 countries, including that of India and China.The US state department issued the Level 4: Do Not Travel advisory -- the highest level of travel advisory -- on March 19, urging American citizens not to travel overseas due to the coronavirus pandemic.India remains on Level 4 of the travel advisory along with more than 50 countries, including China. This means that the US urges its citizens not to travel to India due to the increasing coronavirus cases.The state department, in its latest travel advisory on India issued on Thursday, said: “Do not travel to India due to COVID-19. Exercise increased caution in India due to crime and terrorism”.The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a Level 3 (avoid non-essential travel) Travel Health Notice for India due to COVID-19, it said.Travellers to India may experience border closures, airport closures, travel prohibitions, stay at home orders, business closures and other emergency conditions within India due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it said.Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs Carl Risch told reporters during a conference call that the State Department, in close coordination with the CDC, has lifted the Global Level 4 Health Advisory and has returned to the previous system of country-specific levels of travel advice, with levels from 1 to 4 depending on country-specific conditions.The CDC has similarly removed its Level 3 Global COVID-19 Pandemic Notice. This important change reflects the reality that health and safety conditions are improving in some countries while potentially deteriorating in others, he said.By returning to the country-specific travel advisory system, the US is able to give Americans detailed and actionable information to make informed travel decisions, he said.“The COVID-19 pandemic poses significant risks for travellers and our destination-specific advisories take into account the latest data and public health and safety analysis on COVID-related risks,” Risch said.Among other countries which have been put on Level 4 of travel, advisory include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Mexico, Egypt, and Brazil.Although the guidance from the state department has been lifted, American travellers continue to face travel restrictions in countries worldwide due to the rising cases of the deadly disease in the United States.According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 19 million people and killed more than 713,000 across the world.The US is the worst affected country with over 4.8 million cases and more than 1,60,000 deaths.The European Union has blocked the entry of US tourists, and the UK requires travellers from the US to quarantine for 14 days.

The plea will be heard next week.The ED is learnt to have confronted Chakraborty, Showik and Modi with certain bank statements which purportedly show transfer of small amount of sums into the accounts of Showik from Rajput’s and Chakraborty’s accounts.Meanwhile, the ED had summoned Rajput’s friend and roommate Siddharth Pithani to appear on Saturday in connection with this money laundering case that stems from a complaint filed by the actor’s father with the Bihar Police in connection with his death, they said.Pithani is stated to be out of Mumbai at present and he has said in various news channel interviews that he was present in the Bandra flat on June 14 when the 34-year-old actor hanged himself.The IT professional, stated to be living with Rajput for about a year, had earlier recorded his statement with the Mumbai Police as part of their accidental death report (ADR) probe in the case.The agency has already questioned Rajput’s CA Sandeep Shridhar and his house manager and staffer Samuel Miranda twice in the case.Rajput’s father had, in his complaint, alleged that Miranda was hired by Chakraborty after she allegedly fired the staff hired by his son.Rajput’s 74-year-old father K K Singh, who resides in Patna, had on July 25 filed a complaint with the Patna police against Chakraborty, her parents (mother Sandhya Chakraborty and father Indrajit Chakraborty), brother Showik, Miranda and Modi and unknown persons accusing them of cheating and abetting his son’s suicide.The CBI had re-booked this FIR as a fresh case on Thursday and named as accused the same persons.The CBI has collected the case diary and related documents from the Bihar police in connection with the alleged suicide of actor Sushant Singh Rajput, officials said on Friday.According to the procedure, the documents were handed over to investigating officer ASP Anil Kumar Yadav, they said.The Mumbai police has been carrying out a separate probe in Rajput’s death and has questioned a number of prominent film producers and directors till now.The father had also alleged financial irregularities in bank accounts of his son.In the complaint, Singh alleged that Rs 15 crore was siphoned off from Rajput’s bank account in one year to accounts of persons not known or connected to the late film star.Under the ED’s scanner are at least two companies linked to Rajput and some financial deals involving Chakraborty, her father and Showik who are stated to be directors in these companies.Rajput starred in films like ‘Shuddh Desi Romance’, ‘Raabta’, ‘Kedarnath’, ‘Chhichhore’ and ‘Sonchiriya’. His most prominent role was in cricketer Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s biopic ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story’.

07-08-2020||New Delhi||Glenmark announces 400 mg 'FabiFlu' for Covid-19 treatment||Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, a research-led global pharmaceutical company, on Thursday announced that it is set to introduce a 400 mg version of oral antiviral - FabiFlu -- for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 in India.It was the first Indian company to commercially launch an antiviral drug - Favipiravir with brand name FabiFlu - for the treatment Covid-19 patients. The company received marketing and manufacturing approval from the Drug Controller General of India and launched the product in the Indian market on June 20.According to the company, the higher strength will improve patient compliance and experience, by effectively reducing the number of tablets that patients require per day.Earlier, the 200 mg dosage of FabiFlu required patients to take 18 tablets on Day 1, followed by 8 tablets each day thereafter for a maximum of 14 days.A higher pill burden has been associated with lower adherence to therapy, the latter affecting viral suppression and overall treatment outcomes. Reducing the pill burden has also been a demand from doctors and patients to enable adherence, the company said."With the new 400 mg version, patients will now have a more relaxed dosage regimen, with 9 tablets required on Day 1, and thereafter 2 tablets twice a day from Day 2 till end of the course," Glenmark Pharmaceuticals added.Explaining the significance of this development, Monika Tandon, Vice President and Head, Clinical Development of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited said, "The 200 mg dosage of FabiFlu was developed in line with global formulations of the drug Favipiravir, which had similar strength. The 400 mg version is a result of Glenmark's own R&D efforts to improve treatment experience for patients in India." She added, "Being the first company to launch Favipiravir in India, we continue to innovate and seek new treatment options for Covid-19 patients. Introducing this higher strength of FabiFlu is in line with these efforts to ensure a smoother experience for patients, by reducing their daily pill burden." Glenmark has also commenced a Post Marketing Surveillance (PMS) study on FabiFlu to closely monitor the efficacy and safety of the drug in a large pool of patients prescribed with the oral antiviral Favipiravir, as part of an open label, multicentre, single arm study.It is also conducting another Phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of two antiviral drugs Favipiravir and Umifenovir as a combination therapy in moderate hospitalized adult Covid-19 patients in India.The combination study which is called the FAITH trial is looking to enrol 158 hospitalized patients of moderate Covid-19 in India. Early treatment with combination therapy will be evaluated for safety and efficacy as it is emerging as an effective approach in shortening duration of virus shedding, facilitating early clinical cure and discharge of patients.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/glenmark-announces-400-mg-fabiflu-for-covid-19-treatment-123336

The issue revolving around replacing personal laws based on scriptures and customs of religious communities with a common set of rules for citizens has been raging for decades.No wonder therefore speculations are rife if it may be the next issue the BJP-led NDA government has on mind for August, next year, before the PM’s speaks from the ramparts of the Red Fort.

Answering questions, the spokesperson laid emphasis on the agreement between the two Special Representatives, Ajit Doval and Wang Yi, on the border issueFor the second day in a row, India repulsed China’s attempt to initiate a discussion on Jammu and Kashmir at the UN Security Council. “This was not the first time and as on previous occasions, this attempt too met with little support from the international community.

Only accounts classified as standard, but not in default for over 30 days as on March 1, 2020, will be eligibleIn a measure that will affect the flow of credit at the grass-roots level, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said priority sector lending guidelines in the social sector had been revised after five years. There will be incentives for banks to lend to low credit-flow districts, small and marginal farmers and the weaker sections.Higher loans against gold ornamentsBanks can give loans up to 90% of gold jewellery value for non-agri purposesAt present, banks sanction loans up to 75% of the value of such itemsEnhanced loan to value ratio will be applicable up to March 31, 2021Earlier, the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided in favour of unchanged interest rates after headline inflation breached the upper limit of six per cent in June and could rise further due to floods in eastern India, ongoing lockdown-related disruptions, high taxes on petroleum products, and rise in gold prices on safe haven demand.The RBI saw agriculture as the sole bright spot; its prospects strengthened on the back of good progress of the southwest monsoon. At the same time there was a clear appreciation of the dangers ahead: “The outlook is heavily contingent on the heightened risks associated with a second wave of infections and the discovery of a vaccine.”The RBI decided on six steps that would fine-tune policy instruments in several areas. These include enhancing liquidity support for Nabard and National Housing Bank (NHB) by Rs 5,000 crore each; easing financial stress by setting up an expert committee headed by noted banker KV Kamath to restructure corporate and personal loans under stress due to the lockdown and extending the date for restructuring of MSME loans; putting in place safeguards for receiving bank credit; hiking the limit for advances against gold ornaments and jewellery from 75 per cent to 90 per cent till March 31 for higher credit flow; deepening digital payment systems by facilitating retail payments in offline mode; and increasing customer safety in cheque payments. — TNS/PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rbi-okays-one-time-restructuring-of-loans-123001

On March 31, the Bengaluru police claimed to have busted a fake N95 mask-making racket and seized 12,000 units. Similarly, a fake mask manufacturing unit was unearthed in Noida in March.There have been several instances across the country when the law-enforcement agencies raided fake mask and sanitiser-making units.There is a huge demand for N95 masks across the country. However, the presence of counterfeit products and lack of awareness among people is affecting our sales. — Ashwani Garg, partner, Paayas corporation, LudhianaThe Covid pandemic has resulted in a huge demand for N95 masks across the country. However, the prevalence of counterfeit products is defeating the purpose of original manufacturers, especially those certified by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).“There is a huge demand for N95 masks. However, the presence of counterfeit products and lack of awareness among people is affecting our sales,” said Ashwani Garg, partner of Ludhiana-based Paayas Corporation. His company was the first in the region to receive BIS certification for N95 masks.“We have an installed capacity of 80,000 masks per day but at the moment we are operating on less than 15% capacity in the absence of orders,” he said. A Maharashtra-based firm also said it was yet to utilise its optimum capacity.The BIS-certified mask manufacturers have demanded that the government must act against the manufacturers of fake masks.Gurugram-based Rosmerta Technologies also received BIS certification last month. A senior official of the company said they were focusing on government orders. It is mandatory for the manufacturers to get BIS certification before supplying to the government departments.Across the country, there are 12 BIS-certified N95 mask manufacturers. Six are in Maharashtra and one each in Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana and Dadra and Nagar Haveli.In June, the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority advised all manufacturers and importers of N95 masks to obtain the requisite certification from the BIS.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/certified-n95-makers-at-the-receiving-end-122993
