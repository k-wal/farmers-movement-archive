07-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Granting bail to man, judge gives a 'lyrical' order||“Take your freedom from the cage you are in; Till the trial is over, the state is reined in,” a judge said here on Friday in his lyrical order, summarising in verses the reasons for granting bail to a man in a case related to communal violence in northeast Delhi in February.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat granted bail to Babu on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 10,000 with a surety of like amount in the case related to alleged gun-shot injury received by one Rahul."The State proclaims; to have the cake and eat it too;      "The Court comes calling; before the cake is eaten, bake it too,” the judge said in the uniquely written order.The court said injured Rahul allegedly gave a fake address in his medico-legal record and was untraceable even before the police could record his statement.“Babu has a sordid past; Proof is scant, which may not last."His omnipotence can't be assumed;"Peril to vanished Rahul, is legally fumed,” the judge wrote in his poetic style.The court further noted that Babu, who had bad antecedents, was arrested on April 8, 2020, for the offence of February 25, on the basis of purported identification by Constable Satish who, it was claimed, had been posted at Maujpur red light.“As such, apart from the identification by Constable Satish as the applicant (Babu) being involved in rioting at near Maujpur red light towards Jaffrabad on February 25, 2020, there is nothing much that has been brought on record,” it said.Babu's counsel had also sought bail on the grounds of parity as co-accused Imran was already enlarged on bail in the case.The judge said, “The present application has merits. Let me also put it in a different way,” and wrote the order in verses.“Babu pleading for his bail;"State opposing tooth and nail."Summers bygone, winters have arrived;"But crime you did, and Rahul cried."I am not the one, I am not the one;"Too grave the charge, don't pretend."Whom did I attack, where is he;"Oh! That we know, in the trial we will see."You say I have said & I deny from the first blush."      The judge continued: "Rahul may be gone yet Satish said."Didn't we say; don't rush;"Let me go, let me go, even Imran is on bail."Even then, even then; it wouldn't be a smooth sail."Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop;"I have heard, heard a lot."Mind is clear, with claims tall;"It's my time to take a call."Babu has a sordid past;"Proof is scant, which may not last."His omnipotence can't be assumed;"Peril to vanished Rahul, is legally fumed."Take your freedom from the cage you are in;    "Till the trial is over, the state is reigned in."      "The State proclaims; to have the cake and eat it too;      The Court comes calling; before the cake is eaten,        bake it too,” the judge wrote.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

07-11-2020||New Delhi||13 pc increase in COVID infections in Delhi due to air pollution: IMA||Delhi has reported more than 6,000 COVID-19 cases daily in the past few days and 13 per cent of this increase has been estimated to be due to air pollution, the Indian Medical Association said on Saturday.Stating that N-95 masks and air purifiers may not provide full time protection, the doctors’ body stressed on the implementation of long-term measures to bring down pollution levels.Air pollution damages the inner lining of the lungs and hence increases the severity of COVID-19 infection.“Increased air pollution leads to increased inflammatory response. In the last few days, Delhi has reported more than 6000 COVID-19 cases per day. 13 per cent of the increase has been estimated to be due to pollution,” the IMA said.In the last 10 days, the national capital and its neighbouring areas have seen a sharp spike in air pollution levels. The Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi on Saturday remained above 350 while safe limit is 0-50. The WHO’s ambient air pollution data shows that the levels of PM 10 and PM 2.5 in Delhi are way above the normal levels, the IMA stated.Poor air quality may result in the aggravation of asthma, COPD, high BP and even cardiovascular diseases. Merely walking could result in health complications due to the high concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 in Delhi’s air.“N-95 masks and air purifiers may not provide full time protection. An AQI of above 300 makes it difficult not only for people with respiratory problems, but healthy people as well. Hence, it is advisable that people do not go out early in the morning when pollution levels are the highest. Elderly and children are more likely to develop infections and allergies due to smog,” the doctors’ body said.  The major sources of air pollution in Delhi are vehicular pollution, construction activities, carriage of construction material, dust on roads, burning of agricultural or crop residue, industrial and powerhouse emissions, burning of municipal wastes, thermal energy power plants and mining in Aravalli hill areas, it said.It listed measures such as use of public transport, buying energy efficient vehicles, planting a garden wherever possible, making use of solar energy, using recyclable products which can be adopted by the people to help reduce pollution.There is also a graded response action plan in Delhi and NCR which includes measures such as prohibition on entry of trucks into Delhi, ban on construction activities, introduction of odd and even scheme, closure of brick kilns, ban on diesel generator sets, garbage burning in land fill etc. Banning of crackers and stubble burning in hinterland are helpful public health measures.“Implementation of long term measures is important,” the IMA added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/13-pc-increase-in-covid-infections-in-delhi-due-to-air-pollution-ima-167527
07-11-2020||---||SC stays HC order asking SpiceJet to pay around Rs 243 cr to Kalanithi Maran, firm||New Delhi, November 7The Supreme Court has stayed a Delhi High Court order asking cash-strapped airlines SpiceJet to deposit around Rs 243 crore as interest in connection with a share transfer dispute with its former promoter and media baron Kalanithi Maran and his firm KAL Airways.A bench comprising Chief Justice SA Bobde and justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian also issued notices to Kalanithi Maran and his firm on an appeal of SpiceJet Ltd and its promoter filed against the September 2 order of the Delhi High Court.“Issue notice returnable within four weeks. There shall be a stay of operation of the impugned order until further orders,” said the bench in its order after hearing both parties via video conferencing on Friday.SpiceJet and its promoter Ajay Singh were asked to deposit around Rs 243 crore as interest payable on Rs 579 crore, which the high court had in 2017 asked the airline to deposit under the 2018 arbitration award in the share transfer dispute.The high court had granted six weeks to SpiceJet Ltd to make the payment and the deadline for paying the money, as per the September 2 order, expired on October 14.After this, Maran and his firm had moved the high court for attachment of the entire shareholding of Singh in Spicejet and taking over the management for non-payment of Rs 243 crore.The top court took note of the appeal of the Spicejet and passed an interim order staying the high court order.Maran and KAL had moved the high court over a share transfer dispute with SpiceJet, demanding that 18 crore warrants redeemable as equity shares be transferred to them.The high court on July 29, 2016 had asked both parties to settle the share transfer dispute under arbitration.It had directed SpiceJet and Singh to deposit Rs 579 crore in the high court’s registry.SpiceJet was permitted to furnish a bank guarantee for Rs 329 crore and make a cash deposit of the remaining sum of  Rs 250 crore by the high court.The apex court, in July 2017, had dismissed SpiceJet’s appeal against the HC order.On July 20, 2018, the arbitral tribunal had rejected Maran’s claim of damages of Rs 1,323 crore for not issuing warrants to him and KAL Airways but had awarded him a refund of Rs 579 crore plus interest.Maran, the owner of Sun TV Network, then moved the high court against the arbitration award.The matter pertained to a dispute arising out of non-issuance of warrants in favour of Maran after the transfer of ownership to Singh, the controlling shareholder of SpiceJet.The dispute started after Singh took back control of the airline in February 2015 amidst a financial crisis.Maran and his KAL Airways had transferred their entire 350.4 million equity shares in SpiceJet, amounting to a 58.46 percent stake in the airline, to its co-founder Singh in February 2015 for just Rs 2.Spicejet was debt-ridden and was even forced to shut operations for a day in December 2014 due to a cash crunch. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-stays-hc-order-asking-spicejet-to-pay-around-rs-243-cr-to-kalanithi-maran-firm-167521
07-11-2020||New Delhi||Exit polls give Congress-RJD’s Mahagathbandhan slight edge in Bihar||Exit polls for the Bihar assembly elections on Saturday appeared to have mirrored the crowd surge in favour of Mahagathbandha’s CM-designate Tejashwi Yadav, who had sought to galvanise the youth in particular with a promise of 10 lakh government jobs.They, however, failed to project a decisive trend, except for India Today-Axis polls, in favour of either of the two prominent alliances, the NDA and Mahagathbandhan, which in a way suggested that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s development pitch during the campaign also found a good traction with the voters in the state. But in the past the exit polls, specifically in the context Bihar elections, have largely been found to be off the mark. The Times Now-CVoter has given 116 to the NDA and a slight lead to the Mahagathbandhan with 120, as Chirag Paswan’s LJP will win one seat. The Republic TV-Jan Ki Baat has given 118 to 138 seats to the RJD-led alliance and 91-117 seats to the ruling NDA, as LJP to get five to eight seats. The TV9 Bharatvarsh gave 110-120 seats to NDA, 115-125 to Mahagathbandhan and 3-5 to LJP.According to India Today Axis polls NDA to get 69-91, while Mahagathbandhan 139-161, LJP 3-5 and other 3-5.The last of the three-phase elections in the state concluded today with a voting percentage of nearly 58 percent and the combined turnout for the total 243 assembly to be a little over 56 percent, which 2 percent higher than the 2015 assembly election.According to one of the exit poll surveys it was revealed that the opposition alliance appeared quite popular among the young voters as it has a 12 percent edge over NDA among the voters in age group of 18-35. But the trend reversed in case of older voters. This is indicative of the fact that the new voters appeared to have no memory linkage to the so-called “Jungle Raj” of RJD’s 15 year of rule between 19190-2005, which the NDA campaigners trumpeted to the hilt.The exit polls also indicate a tectonic shift from the national elections, which took place just last year, when the NDA won 39 of Bihar’s 40 Lok Sabha seats, decimating the opposition and sending Tejashwi Yadav--- who took charge of the RJD while his father Lalu Prasad was serving a jail sentence in Ranchi.But in this campaign, Tejashwi Yadav emerged as the crowd-puller, drawing huge cheers at every rally with his promise of signing off on 10 lakh government jobs at his very first cabinet meeting. The polls also indicate that the BJP may get an upper hand over Nitish Kumar, who was repeatedly assured by an array of BJP leaders that he remained the coalition’s top face in Bihar.Here are the exit polls:India Today Axis-My Axis PollNDA-69-91Mahagathbandhan-139-161LJP-3-5Others- 3-5Today's Chanakya-CNN News18NDA-55  Mahagathbandhan-180Others-8 Times Now-CVoter pollsBJP-JDU (NDA)-116Congress-RJD (Mahagathbandhan)- 120LJP-1Others-6ABP NewsNDA-104-128Mahagathbandhan-108-131LJP-1-3Republic TV Jan Ki BaatMahagathbandhan-118-138NDA-91-117LJP-5-8Others-3-6TV 9 BharatvarshNDA-110-120Mahagathbandhan-118-138LJP-5-8Others-3-6News X-DvresearchNDA-115Mahagathbandhan-120LJP-4Others-4Dainik BhaskarNDA-120-127Mahagathbandhan-71-81LJP-12-23Others-19-27Poll of Exit PollsNDA-99Mahagathbandhan-128LJP-6Others-10||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/exit-polls-give-congress-rjds-mahagathbandhan-slight-edge-in-bihar-167517

The Andaman Nicobar Command is an example of joint command on our side.”He was speaking at a web-seminar “Joint warfare by Indian armed forces” organised by the Amity University late on Friday. The Amity Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies led by its Director General, Lt Gen (Dr) SK Gadeock (retd) had organised the discussion.Lt Gen KM Seth (retd), a former Governor Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Tripura, said the proposed creation of theatre commands would require change in collective mindset of the forces.Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha (retd), former Chief of the IAF, narrated how difficult it was to operate in Ladakh. He spoke the employment of air power for conflict along the LAC in conflict like intelligence gathering and deploying the Army.Dr W Selavmurthy, former Chief Controller, Research & Development DRDO and now the Chancellor of Amity University Chhattisgarh, said the concept of conducting this strategic seminar was of Dr Ashok K. Chauhan, founder President of Amity Education Group.Webinar comprised of two-panel discussions, with the first one focused on examining the critical issues pertinent to Joint Army and Air Force Operations in an evolving scenario related to Ladakh in the Northern Region and the second one related to integrated Tri-services Joint Operations in western front in the Rann of Kutch and the Arabian Sea.Joint operations doctrine and developing a strategic response matrix to India’s national security challenges, was discussed.Former Navy Chief Admiral RK Dhowan (Retd) spoke on the ‘Synergy of Force Multipliers in Joint Warfare’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-behind-other-countries-in-joint-ops-former-army-chief-167515
07-11-2020|| Nagapattinam (TN)||As Kamala Harris inches closer to victory, Tamil Nadu's twin villages prepare for early Deepavali||With Democratic candidate for the Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris confident of her victory, the people of two villages in Tamil Nadu, which are native to her maternal grandparents, are also equally conviced that she would emerge victorious and eager to celebrate her win, an early Deepavali.The mood is upbeat at Thulasenthirapuram and Painganadu, tucked away in a corner of Tiruvarur district, a part of the fertile Cauvery delta region, and people are waiting only for a formal declaration that Kamala has won alongside Joe Biden to start celebrations.The villagers have now kept firecrackers ready to hail a win for Kamala Harris, also a US Senator.Women are also planning to draw a mega rangoli in front of the village temple."We have collected Rangoli powders in different colours and are planning to draw the image of Kamala Harris.It is a matter of pride for the entire womenfolk," said Meenakshi, a housewife at Thulasenthirapuram.The people feel proud that their villages happen to be the native place of the grandparents of Kamala Harris.The road leading to Thulasenthirapuram and Painganadu villages from nearby Mannargudi town is filled with wall posters and digital banners wishing a resounding win for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.Though it may sound strange, US presidential election results are an animated topic of disucssion presently in this hinterland of Tamil Nadu in public places like tea stalls.Some people are also glued to the television looking for updates on US elections.Earlier, on November 2, when the US went to the polls, the people performed special prayers in the local temple praying for a win for Kamala.Thulasenthirapuram and Painganadu are agrarian villages and are located very close to each other near Mannargudi which is about 50 km from here.Kamala's grandfather P V Gopalan moved out of Thulasenthirapuram village as a young man and took up a job in the British government service.Her grandmother Rajam belonged to the nearby Painganadu village.Though Kamala's ancestors left the village many decades ago, family members had kept their connections with the temple at Thulasenthirapuram intact.Gopalan and other family members have made donations for temple renovation during various periods.As recently as 2014, a donation was made says the temple trustee Ramani."It all started about a year back when Kamala Harris herself disclosed about her grandfather in social media.We realised that someone connected with our village was becoming prominent in the US.Everyone here started talking about her," said Ramanathan, a retired school teacher in the village."We don't know much about her ancestors.Yet, it feels good she is creating history in the US," he added.In all likelihood, Thulasenthirapuram and Painganadu villages appear to be headed for prolonged celebrations.Confident of their victory in the US presidential election, Democratic candidate Joe Biden and his running mate Senator Kamala Harris have begun working on the task ahead by focusing on two critical areas of public health and economy, both battered by the raging COVID-19 pandemic.

07-11-2020||New Delhi||Our doors are always open for discussion with farmers: Central ministers||Top central ministers have said they are always open for any talks with Punjab farmers on the three “pro-farmers and pro-agriculture” laws enacted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Centre. “The government’s doors are always open to farmers for any discussion on the three Central Acts,” Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal said in an informal interaction.The proviso appears to be that the discussion should be about farmers and not guided by politics. The three Acts that have resulted in a prolonged stand-off between Punjab farmers and the state government led by Congress’ Amarinder Singh and the BJP-led NDA at the Centre.On October 15, farmers’ organisations had walked out of a meeting with Agriculture Secretary Sanjay Agarwal claiming they were called for an interaction where not even one minister was present.  Agriculture Ministry officials however said the meeting was scheduled to be held at the “level of the Secretary about which farmers were well aware”.  “Various issues related to farmers welfare were discussed for about two hours. At the end of this meeting two memorandums on behalf of the farmers’ unions were given to the Secretary. The Government of India is always committed to protect the interest of farmers and is always open for discussions,” they said. Apparently, the Centre does not appear to be much worried by farmers organisations's efforts to expand the ambit of protests to other states with a ‘Dilli chalo’ call later this month. Citing the “outcome” of the all-India ‘chakka jam’ (road blockade) on November 5,  ministry officials say the agitation is limited to Punjab because of “political reasons and that farmers across the country are well aware of the positive changes the three laws are bringing in their lives and the agriculture sector”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/our-doors-are-always-open-for-discussion-with-farmers-central-ministers-167509

However, Bharatpur District Collector Nathmal Didel and police officials met him.Meanwhile, members of the Gurjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti continued their blockade of the Delhi-Mumbai rail route in Bayana's Pilupura and the Hindaun-Bayana road for the seventh consecutive day.Bainsla held a meeting with other Gurjar leaders in Bawanpada of Sikandara following which he threatened to intensify the agitation. The agitation will intensify from November 9 and the roads will be blocked across the state if the demands are not met immediately, said Bainsla.The Gurjar leader said the government should give in writing if they agree to their demands on not.Gurjar leader Vijay Bainsla said, "We have been patient with the government but it has assured nothing. Clearing the backlog of vacancies was a part of the Congress manifesto but nothing has been done."  Meanwhile, Deewan Shergarh, a member of a body representing 80 Gurjar villages of Bharatpur's Bayana block, said Bainsla should call off the stir.Traders in Bayana are a worried lot due to the agitation.Local trade union president Janki Prasad said their business had been affected as people were avoiding coming to the market due to the stir.The Gurjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti is demanding that the Rajasthan Government should get the Gurjar reservation included in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution, fill the backlog of vacancies and give the benefit of five per cent reservation to the Most Backward Classes (MBCs) in the pending recruitment process.On Thursday, a delegation comprising leaders from 80 Gurjar villages of Bayana, had sought the lifting of the blockade.They told reporters that the government had accepted their demands but still around 200-300 people are sitting on the railway track.On October 31, a delegation of the Gurjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti, held discussions with a Cabinet sub-committee in Jaipur, in which a consensus had emerged on 14 points.

He is in judicial custody in the matter.The court, in its order passed on November 6, said that Shukla did not name Gulfam and Aatir when his statement was recorded on March 9 and later identified them on April 1.While granting bail, the court directed them not to tamper with evidence or leave the jurisdiction of Delhi without its prior permission.It, however, dismissed the bail plea of one Salman in the case, saying during the investigation a public eyewitness stated in his statement recorded under section 161 (examination by police) Code of Criminal Procedure that he had seen Salman allegedly shouting the slogan “Allah Ho Akbar” and instigating the crowd against a community.It said that the witness had specifically stated he had seen Salman involved in stone-pelting at Mauzpur Chowk on February 24.During the hearing, advocate Abdul Gaffar, appearing for Aatir and Gulfam, told the court they were falsely implicated in the case and have not been covered by any CCTV footage nor was any recovery made from them. Special Public Prosecutor Jinendra Jain, appearing for the police, opposed the bail pleas and said Gulfam and Aatir were allegedly part of an unlawful assembly which had pelted stones and fired upon the passersby.The public prosecutor further said Shukla had stated in his statement that accused Aatir, Gulfam and Osama were part of the group of people chanting the religious slogan and a person from the mob fired upon him.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

07-11-2020||Agra||Action soon to protect cave paintings near Fatehpur Sikri||Union culture minister Prahlad Singh Patel has assured to initiate measures to protect the precious pre-historic heritage of cave paintings in the Fatehpur Sikri area.A delegation of conservationists from Agra met the minister on Saturday and raised the issue of these paintings. The delegation presented a memorandum demanding restoration of the caves, conservation of the paintings, and promotion of the whole area as a tourist spot.Environmentalist Devashish Bhattacharya, who was also a part of the delegation, told IANS that the Minister evinced keen interest and promised to visit the area soon to discuss conservation efforts.In its memorandum, the delegation said a large number of rock paintings of the pre-historic era were under threat due to negligence in the Aravali hills bordering Fatehpur Sikri, the deserted capital of Mughal emperor Akbar.Conservationists in Agra have demanded that the Archaeological Survey of India should take over the whole area and take steps for their conservation, as these were valuable heritage assets.The area around Fatehpur Sikri was once a thriving and prosperous urban cluster, inhabited by Kshatriyas and Jains who built numerous structures that are now in a shambles.Conservationists have in fact been voicing their concern and repeatedly asking for large-scale excavations in the area which they claim is full of ruined ancient structures.A group has now launched a campaign to draw attention to the negligence towards these pre-historic cave paintings in the hills around half a dozen villages. They say several sites of the Mesolithic period containing rock shelters of the pre-historic era are exposed to the vagaries of nature.The villages where these paintings are still visible include Jajauli, Bandrauli, Patsal, Madanpura, Rasulpur, and Churyari.Researchers and conservationists say these rock shelters (rock art) date back to more than 3000 years and can in fact be up to 5000 years old.As they lay as unprotected relics of the past in the Aravali ranges, infamous for illegal stone mining, the threat of major destruction and losses looms large.Devashish Bhattacharya said: "These six identified villages in the Fatehpur Sikri area are most backward since there is hardly any infrastructural growth, as funds and focus had been on the world heritage site Fatehpur Sikri, barely four centuries old. The fort of Fatehpur Sikri is itself built upon an ancient Jain temple and needs further excavation."

And look at the figures last week, we have crossed two lakh passengers per day. In normal times, it is about three-and-a-half lakh to four lakh passengers a day,” Kharola said.“So we have crossed more than half of the normal operations and at a very fast rate we are approaching the normal,” he added.The top MOCA official was speaking at the 36th foundation day of government-run Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Uran Akademi (IGRUA), a premier aircraft pilot training institute at Fursatganj in Amethi. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-domestic-air-passenger-traffic-reaches-over-half-of-pre-covid-levels-moca-secy-167493

They have worked without compromising on quality”, the chairman, wearing a n-95 mask said.#EOS01 successfully separated from fourth stage of #PSLVC49 and injected into orbit#ISRO pic.twitter.com/2u5jBPGNQD  The Chairman also complemented the directors of ISRO’s various centres for taking care of the employees, their health and for defining real Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to ensure work progressed.With just one week to go for Deepavali festival, the chairman in a lighter vein said before the festival itself, ISRO has made a successful rocket launch.“Definitely, you can enjoy more on this one. Let me wish all the best for all the employees, as well as their families.Jai Hind,” he said as he signed off.ISRO said it used the PSLV-DL variant, equipped with two strap-on motors, for the launch.#ISRO #EOS01All nine customer satellites successfully separated and injected into their intended orbit#PSLVC49 pic.twitter.com/rrtL3sVAI3  This is the second time it was deployed after the PSLV-C44 mission which had successfully launched imaging satellite Microsat R on January 24, 2019.The customer satellites were launched under an arrangement with ISROs commercial arm NewSpace India Ltd.The R2 satellite from Lithuania is for ‘technology demonstration’ while four from Luxembourg Kleos (KSM- 1A/1B/1C/1D) would be used for maritime applications.The other four satellites from the United States—Lemur (Lemur-1,2,3,4) -- are meant for multi-mission remote sensing purposes, the ISRO said.According to the space agency, Saturday’s launch is the 76th vehicle mission from Sriharikota and the 38th from the first launch pad. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-launches-earth-observation-satellite-9-other-spacecraft-in-first-mission-of-2020-167476

The government before taking any action against farmers, should make them aware and give them necessary assistance. This is the demand of the BSP.”       The tweet by Mayawati comes a day after Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed officials to ensure that farmers are not harassed or misbehaved with them when action is taken against stubble burning.The chief minister also said new experiments to use crop residue should be encouraged and projects to prepare bio fuel/power from stubble should be reviewed.“The farmers should be made aware of the impacts of stubble burning on the environment and pollution caused by it and asked the Agriculture Department to run awareness programmes for this. It should be ensured that farmers should not be misbehaved with or harassed while taking action against stubble burning,” an official statement quoted the chief minister as saying.“Effective use of stubble can help farmers in increasing their income,” Adityanath said, according to the statement issued here.On November 4, Uttar Pradesh Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu demanded immediate release of all the farmers who have been allegedly arrested over stubble burning.Lallu claimed that the state government was lodging cases and harassing farmers in the name of checking the menace of stubble burning.He claimed that 16 farmers had been sent to jail in Saharanpur alone over the past week, while “hundreds” of others were forced to flee to evade arrest, adding that it was “deplorable”.Lallu asked the government to stop the “atrocities” on farmers and instead take steps for resolving their problems, warning that the party would be forced to come onto the streets to protest against the alleged harassment of farmers.

Since June, the government is gradually easing restrictions under 'Unlock'."During the lockdown, I was initially helping my parents in their work. It was during this time, I also came across vendors who were selling herbs and spices. I decided to explore my passion of making people cook at home with products which have high nutrition value and other health benefits," Malhotra said."I came up with my start-up 'Bag of Herbs', which offers ingredients that are rich in nutrients, healthy and boost immunity, while at the same time are pleasing to the palate," he said.Those interested, can also learn about healthy recipes on the start-up's website and about the health benefits of products, the lawyer said, adding that its social media pages also accepts suggestions from customers.Malhotra is expanding his business through e-commerce sites like Grofers, Flipkart and Amazon and has plans to make the start-up a full-time enterprise.Corporate lawyers Mahima Ahluwalia Sinha and Yashita Dalmia started home kitchens in Gurgaon and the National Capital.Sinha, who has been in the legal profession for the last 12 years, has started a home kitchen called 'Assi Tussi Bhalo Achi' that offers a fusion of Bengali and Punjabi cuisine.The lawyer said that she has neither left the legal profession nor has plans to leave it.Sinha said that during the lockdown she and her mother-in-law Sagarica Lala came up with the idea of setting up a home kitchen that would offer a mix of Punjabi and Bengali cuisine. Offering something different was the prime objective behind the venture, she said."I am trying my best to manage both, my legal profession and the home kitchen. I am exploring my love and passion for food and cooking. I have WhatsApp groups and a Facebook page through which I take orders. We are gradually increasing the menu and its on a daily basis," Sinha said.She added that the lockdown was a boon for her as earlier she always had a packed schedule and never got time to explore her passion.In Delhi, Dalmia, who works with an aviation catering company and has been practising law for the last eight years, said as there was less work due to the pandemic, she had the time to look for something new and decided nurture her cooking skills.During the course of the lockdown, she started 'Yashita's Kitchen' at Civil Lines here."It's a plus point that I could explore my passion along with my professional life. I am taking orders through social media and it's spreading through word of mouth. In the future, I am planning to expand it by opening a small cafe or a cloud kitchen with additional staff," Dalmia said.She said that she does not intend to leave the legal profession.Similarly, Sinha said, "Before the lockdown I never got time to do anything else. I used to watch cooking videos but never had the time to try recipes. My mother-in-law has always been a great cook and friends and colleagues used to praise our food, so in the last seven months we decided to set up our 'home kitchen' and we are curating Bengali and Punjabi flavour."Courts are gradually resuming activities amid stringent checks and protocols in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, even though most cases are being heard online.

As a result, any confessional statement made to them cannot be taken into account in order to convict an accused under the NDPS Act," Showik said in his plea.As per section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act, no confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence, it said."In view of the apex court's judgment, there has been an obvious change in circumstance which would warrant a fresh consideration for bail," the plea, filed through his advocate Satish Maneshinde, said.In the application, Showik reiterated that he has been "falsely implicated" in the case.The accused has been booked under section 27(A) mechanically and without application of mind, it said.The plea said that the remand applications produced thus far are completely silent as to any allegation of harbouring of offenders as mentioned under Section 27A of the NDPS Act.It claimed the case of the NCB was silent on the amount of financing, quantum of drugs and type of drugs allegedly procured and financed by Showik.The probe agency's case, in layman terms, is that Showik used to co-ordinate the delivery of drugs for the late Sushant Singh Rajput. In essence, his alleged role, if any, is the purchase of a small quantity of drugs for the late actor.Hence, the allegations against him are is bailable in nature, the plea said.It alleged that the probe agency spun a false narrative that portrays Showik as being someone who finances and procures drugs.The matter is likely to be heard next week, Maneshinde said.The agency has alleged said that actress Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik used to facilitate drug deliveries and payment through credit cards, cash and other payment gateways.The NCB is probing multiple drug angles linked to Singh's death.It began its investigation after the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which was probing money laundering charges linked to Rajput's death case, shared some social media chats retrieved from Rhea Chakrabortys mobile phone, hinting at the alleged use of banned drugs.Rhea, who was also arrested by the NCB in September, was released on bail last month.Rajput was found hanging at his residence in suburban Bandra on June 14, 2020.

07-11-2020||New Delhi||IMD to start issuing predictions for major malaria outbreak from next monsoon: Official||The India Meteorological Department (IMD) will start issuing forecast for malaria outbreaks from next monsoon, Ministry of Earth Sciences secretary M Rajeevan said on Saturday.Delivering a lecture on 'recent advances in weather and climate predictions', organised by the Indian Academy of Sciences, Rajeevan said India also plans to ramp up its high performance computing (HPC) facility from the existing capacity of 10 petaflops to 40 petaflops, a step that will significantly help in improving weather predictions.Currently, India is only next to the US, the UK and Japan in HPC.A report released by the Ministry of Earth Sciences this week said nearly Rs 990 crore spent on the National Monsoon Mission and HPC had yielded dividend 50 times the investment made.On the prediction of any vector-borne disease outbreak, the IMD studied the phenomenon of occurrence in malaria and its relationship with rainfall and temperature, Rajeevan later told PTI."The IMD first studied the malaria data it got from Nagpur. This can be applied to other places as well. This can give predictions on large scale malaria outbreaks," Rajeevan said.He said the same technique can be applied to other monsoon-related diseases such as dengue and cholera.“The IMD will make the malaria forecast service operational by the next monsoon,” he said.Malaria is rampant in parts of Africa and sub-tropical countries.According to the World Malaria Report 2019, 19 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and India carried almost 85 per cent of the global malaria burden.According to the National Health Portal, the majority of malaria cases are reported from eastern and central part of the country and from states which have forest, hilly and tribal areas.These states include Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and some northeastern states like Tripura, Meghalaya and Mizoram.In India, malaria cases have consistently declined from 2.08 million in 2001 to about 4 lakh in 2018. Of the countries hardest hit by malaria, only India showed progress in reducing its disease burden, the NHP said.In his lecture, Rajeevan said 90 per cent of the meteorology-related data comes from satellites. The rest of it comes from conventional sources like Doppler radars, buoys in the sea, ship and aircraft observation and other observations.

07-11-2020||Mumbai||BJP didn't support Amit Shah like 'mahatma' Arnab: Sena||Terming it as a 'conspiracy' to defame Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Shiv Sena on Saturday slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party "which never took to the streets to support Amit Shah and other leaders who faced the law in the aftermath of the Godhra incidents, like it has done for 'mahatma' Arnab Goswami"."In Gujarat, many leaders including Shah, had to face action of the then government after the Godhra incident (2002) and other cases Shah could have said he was a victim of vendetta, but the BJP did not agitate, took to the streets or attempt to challenge the  laws," the Sena said.While Shah emerged unscathed from all the court cases, Modi -- who was the Chief Minister of Gujarat then -- maintained restrain and later he was rewarded for it, the Sena said in hard-hitting edits in the party newspaper 'Saamana' and 'Dopahar Ka Saamana'.Referring to the recent arrest of Republic TV Managing Director and Chief Editor (Goswami) by the state police in the May 2018 suicide case of a mother-son, the Sena flayed the ongoing agitation by Maharashtra BJP in the mediaperson's support."The state BJP has lost its balance while Goswami's bail hearing continues They say that until 'mahatma' Goswami is released from jail they will continue their black badge protests. Luckily, they have not resorted to mass jail-bharo or relay hunger strikes," the Sena said.Now, the BJP has even started comparing Goswami's arrest with the Emergency era (1975-1977) by plastering posters of the late PM Indira Gandhi and Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in New Delhi, it pointed out."It's actually a matter of pride to be compared with Indira Gandhi. She was a 'man' who taught a lesson to Pakistan by creating Bangladesh. After the Emergency, she was rejected, but subsequently, the same people brought her back as the PM. Later, she gave her life for the country. Show us one PM after her who made such unparalleled, supreme sacrifice for the nation's integrity," the Sena said sharply.Likening the state BJP leaders with the US President Donald Trump, the edits said the state BJP's behaviour indicates it does not accept the rule of law or the law itself, and the party wants to drag the nation into 'anarchy'."As Trump stares at defeat, he sits in the White House and talks the language of a ruffian ('dadagiri ki baatein'), spreads falsehoods, wants poll counting stopped, then moves the courts to stop declaration of the (Presidential elections) results... The BJP is behaving in a 'ditto' fashion," the Sena said.The edits asked the central BJP to clarify whether the rude language used by Goswami to address leaders ("Ai, Tu") who occupy top Constitutional posts like President, PM, Governor, etc, is acceptable to them, as it signals a 'Trump culture' in the country and could result in complete lawlessness, with implications on the nation's unity and integrity.On Goswami's arrest in the case of abetment to suicide of architect Anvay Naik and his elderly mother Kumud Naik, the Sena argued that it is a form of 'culpable homicide' and whoever maybe the person, he must face the law.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-didnt-support-amit-shah-like-mahatma-arnab-sena-167454

07-11-2020||Mumbai||Elgar case: Stan Swamy files plea seeking straw, sipper in jail||Eighty-two-year-old Father Stan Swamy, arrested in the Elgar Parishad-alleged Maoist links case, has filed an application before a special court here, seeking that he be allowed to use a straw and sipper in Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai, where he is currently lodged.Swamy was arrested from his home in Ranchi last month in connection with the violence in Bhima Koregaon near Pune in January 2018.The accused, through his lawyer Kritika Agarwal, moved the plea before the special NIA court on Friday seeking straw and sipper in jail citing health issues.The special court judge DE Kothalikar has asked the national probe agency to file its reply on the matter on November 26.NIA officials have said investigations established that Swamy was actively involved in the activities of the CPI (Maoist). The NIA has also alleged that he was in contact with “conspirators” — Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Hany Babu, Shoma Sen, Mahesh Raut, Varavara Rao, Sudha Bharadwaj, Gautam Navlakha and Anand Teltumbde — to further the group’s activities.It also alleged that Swamy had received funds through an associate for furthering the agenda.Besides, he is convenor of the Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee (PPSC), a frontal organisation of the CPI (Maoist), the NIA officials have claimed.They said that literature, propaganda material of the CPI (Maoist) and documents related to communications for furthering the group’s programmes were seized from his possession.Last month, the NIA had filed a charge-sheet in the matter against eight people, including Swamy.As many as 16 people have been arrested in connection with the case so far under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the anti-terror law UAPA.The probe into the Elgar Parishad case was taken over by the NIA on January 24 this year.The Pune police have claimed that speeches delivered at the Elgar Parishad conclave, held on December 31, 2017, at Shaniwarwada in Pune city, led to the violence at Koregaon Bhima the next day. The police have claimed the conclave was organised by people having Maoist links. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/elgar-case-stan-swamy-files-plea-seeking-straw-sipper-in-jail-167446

07-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality ‘severe’, likely to remain so on Diwali||The national capital’s air quality was recorded in the “severe” category on Saturday morning as farmers in Punjab and nearby regions continued to set their fields on fire to clear crop residue.The Central Government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the city’s air quality was likely to remain “severe” on Diwali as well.Experts said while meteorological conditions were “moderately” favourable for dispersion of pollutants, a “very high” number of farm fires in Punjab was the primary reason for “severe” air quality.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR, Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) was 443 this morning.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.PM10 levels in Delhi-NCR stood at 486 microgram per cubic meter (µg/m3) at 9 am, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.PM10 is particulate matter with a diameter of 10 micrometres and inhaled into the lungs. These particles include dust, pollen and mold spores. PM10 levels below 100 µg/m3 are considered safe in India.The levels of PM2.5 — finer particles which can even enter the bloodstream — were 292 µg/m3 at 9 am. PM2.5 levels up to 60 µg/m3 are considered safe.Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the number of farm fires in Punjab remains very high (around 4,000) which is likely to impact the air quality in Delhi-NCR and other parts of northwest India.It said the AQI was likely to remain in the “upper end of ‘very poor’ category on November 13 and ‘severe’ category on November 14 (Diwali)”.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the maximum wind speed was 14 kilometres per hour on Friday and the minimum temperature 11.8 degrees Celsius.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.VK Soni, head of IMD’s environment monitoring research centre, said: “A very large number of farm fires over Punjab is the primary reason for the severe air quality in the region.”SAFAR said the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution was estimated at 21 per cent on Friday. It was 42 per cent on Thursday, the maximum so far this season.Last year, the contribution of stubble burning to Delhi’s pollution had peaked to 44 per cent on November 1, according to SAFAR data.

This is evident by the reaction of a section of the Sikh community here which also met MEA’s Pakistan Desk incharge JP Singh to register their protest.The MEA said such actions expose the Pakistani leadership’s tall claims of preserving and protecting the rights and welfare of the religious minority communities. But the Pakistan Foreign Office maintained that the PSGPC remained responsible for carrying out rituals at the gurdwara as per the Sikh code of conduct. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-summons-pak-envoy-on-kartarpur-issue-167330

At a virtual meeting of SCO National Security Advisers, the Pakistani representative pointedly hung a map incorrectly depicting its boundaries from India’s point of view. This led to a symbolic walkout by NSA Ajit Doval.India also did not participate in a SCO military drill that had Chinese soldiers as it took place in the middle of an aggressive confrontation on the Line of Actual Control with China.During its membership of the last three years, MEA spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said India had intensively engaged with the SCO and used it as a platform to reach out to central Asian states. Barring Turkmenistan, other Central Asian states—Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan—are members of SCO along with China, Pakistan, Russia and India.At the last SCO summit in Bishkek, PM Modi had laid out India’s vision for SCO by coining the acronym “HEALTH”, which stood for cooperation in health, economics, alternative energy, literature and culture, against terrorism and for humanity, said the MEA spokesperson at a weekly media here on Friday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/at-virtual-meet-pm-to-share-screen-time-with-xi-imran-167331

New ration cards are regularly issued to genuine and rightfully eligible beneficiaries or households against the deleted ration cards, it said in a statement.“As part of technology-driven PDS reforms across the country to modernise the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) and bring transparency in its operations through digitisation of ration cards/beneficiaries databases, Aadhaar seeding, detection of ineligible/bogus ration cards, de-duplication of digitised data, migration/deaths of beneficiaries and during the run-up to the implementation of the NFSA, a total of about 4.39 crore ineligible/bogus ration cards have been weeded out in the country during the period 2013 to 2020, so far, by the state/UT governments,” it said.“Further, the respective quota of the NFSA coverage thus released, is being regularly utilised for the ‘rightful targeting’ of beneficiaries under the NFSA that is inclusion/addition of other genuine and rightfully eligible beneficiaries/households by issuing new ration cards to them while remaining within the respective ceiling limits of coverage defined for each state/UT under the Act,” it also added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/4-39-crore-bogus-ration-cards-weeded-out-govt-167333

The researchers, including Xiao Wu from Harvard University, found that chronic exposure to PM2.5 pollutants — tiny particles in the air that are two-and-a-half microns or less in width — is linked to greater county-level Covid-19 mortality rates.Dispelling some of the panic, experts here said the biological reasons for high rates of Covid-19 infection and deaths in places with high PM2.5 levels are yet to be understood.“It is not proven currently that PM2.5 levels directly increase chances of infection or death,” Piyush Goel, a pulmonologist, said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/exposure-to-pollution-may-up-covid-death-risk-study-167334

What we need are the resources and commitments to put these tools and knowledge into action. If we do that, children’s lives will be saved,” he said.In recent years, there has been a global resurgence of measles with ongoing outbreaks in all parts of the world. Vaccination coverage gaps have been further exacerbated in 2020 by Covid.In 2019, measles climbed to the highest number of new infections in more than two decades.At the same time, polio virus transmission is expected to increase in Pakistan and Afghanistan and in many under-immunised areas of Africa.Failure to eradicate polio now would lead to global resurgence of the disease, resulting in as many as 200,000 new cases annually, within 10 years, the organisations warned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/665-mn-needed-to-avert-measles-polio-outbreak-who-167335

According to reports, BJP Tamil Nadu unit president L Murugan and some party workers were arrested near Lord Murugan Temple at Tiruttani while taking out the yatra “aimed at exposing those acting against the Tamil culture”.Rivals/detractors said it was meant to “flare communal tension”. The AIADMK government had not given permission for the yatra citing Covid-19.With such efforts, the saffron party, which has not been able to make inroads into the southern state (its vote share dropping from 5.56 per cent in 2014 to 3,66 in 2019) is aiming to consolidate Hindu votes.Meanwhile in Assam, the ruling BJP said it would campaign the next elections on two key issues — development and protection of the “civilisation of Assam” from the “civilisation of infiltrators from Bangladesh”.In Kerala, threats of defection of senior leaders and resignation have rocked the BJP’s state unit, where observers said “such open dissent was never witnessed before”. Several senior leaders like Sobha Surendran are unhappy with state president K Surendran and Union Minister V Muraleedharan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-bihar-its-mission-bengal-assam-for-bjp-167326
