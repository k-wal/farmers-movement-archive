17-10-2020||Kolkata||Rally in Kolkata against Father Stan Swamy’s arrest by NIA||A rally was taken out in the downtown Park Street area of Kolkata on Saturday as part of the nationwide protests by rights groups and minority organisations against the arrest of elderly tribal rights activist Father Stan Swamy by the NIA.Around 100 people took part in the rally, organised by the Mother Teresa International Award Committee, demanding the immediate release of the 82-year-old Jesuit priest, who was arrested from his Ranchi residence and taken to Mumbai by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in connection with the Bhima-Koregaon case.The rally was the first public protest in West Bengal against the arrest of Father Stan Swamy.It started from Bishop’s House on Park Street and culminated at St Teresa’s statue at the Archbishop’s House, a little more than a km away.The participants, including students and rights activists, carried placards denouncing the “undemocratic arrest of the elderly man in the most inhuman manner”.The vice-chancellor of St Xavier’s University, Father J Felix Raj, addressing the rally, said, “From here, we again make our demand to the Government of India that Father Swamy be released forthwith by the NIA”.Swamy, he said, has been working for the uplift of the poor tribals in Jharkhand for decades. “He should be released immediately due to his advanced age. In a country like India, which has the tradition of showing respect to the elderly, the treatment to Father Swamy is very unfortunate,” he said.“In a secular country like India, the arrest of such a personality is a blot on our democratic tradition,” Father Raj said.Protests against the arrest will continue, he added.Father Stan Swamy was arrested by the central agency from his Ranchi home for his alleged involvement in inciting a mob to violence at Bhima-Koregaon near Pune on January 1, 2018. He has been sent to judicial custody till October 23. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rally-in-kolkata-against-father-stan-swamys-arrest-by-nia-157194

17-10-2020||Guwahati||Assam to close down government madrassas, Sanskrit tols||All government-run madrassas and Sanskrit tols (schools) will be closed down by the Assam government and the notification to this effect will be issued in November, state Education Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Saturday.The State Madrassa Education Board, Assam will be dissolved and all the government-run madrassas will be converted into high schools, he said.New admissions will be held for the existing students as regular ones, he said.“The final-year students will be allowed to pass out but those taking admission in these schools in January next year will have to study as regular students,” he said.The Sanskrit tols will be handed over to Kumar Bhaskarvarma Sanskrit University and these will be converted into centres of learning and research where Indian culture, civilisation and nationalism will be studied, Sarma said.The step has been taken by the government to ensure that students get a regular education under the Secondary Education Board of Assam (SEBA), he said.The examinations conducted by the madrassas and the Sanskrit tols are different and their students do not appear for the matriculation examination conducted by the SEBA.“They are, however, given equivalency with those appearing in the board examinations, which is unfair on the regular students,” Sarma said.The equal weightage for students passing out from madrassas, Sanskrit tols and the regular schools was introduced by the then Congress government in the state in the 1990s and has continued since then.Sarma said the examination system of madrassas is very different with an emphasis on religious studies and not on general subjects required for further higher professional education, he said.Asked if the step was taken with an eye on the Assam Assembly elections due next year, Sarma, who is a senior BJP leader of the northeastern state, said, “How can this be an election issue when we are only closing the government madrassas and not the private ones.”He claimed that most of the students enrolled in the government madrasas want to become doctors and engineers and are not aware of the fact that these are not regular schools.Sarma cited a survey conducted by a Gauhati University professor who found that the parents of most of the students of the madrassas are not aware of the fact that their children are not taught the regular subjects but are imparted lessons mostly in theology.“Is this not a violation of the human rights of these children who aspire to be in professions which are only possible when they acquire knowledge in certain subjects through the regular education system,” he said.Besides, most Islamic scholars are not in favour of madrassas being under the government, he claimed.He also said the madrassas were set up in the pre-Independence era and are a legacy of the Muslim League.He clarified that the high madrassa examinations conducted by the board were different from that held by the government madrassas.“In the high madrassa examinations, students appear for regular subjects and have only a paper in Arabic. There is no paper on theology,” he added.There are 610 government madrassas in Assam, for which the state government spends Rs 260 crore annually, Sarma said. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/assam-to-close-down-government-madrassas-sanskrit-tols-157188
17-10-2020||New Delhi||Peace and tranquillity along LAC ‘deeply disturbed’, impacting India-China ties: S Jaishankar||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday said peace and tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) is "deeply disturbed" and this is obviously impacting the overall relationship between India and China.Jaishankar made these comments against the backdrop of the over five-month-long border standoff between India and China in eastern Ladakh where each side has deployed over 50,000 troops.The Sino-India boundary question is a very "complicated" and difficult issue, he said at a webinar on his book ‘The India Way’, giving a historical perspective to development of the relationship between the two neighbouring countries in the last three decades.The External Affairs Minister said the relationship between India and China, which was "very difficult", was normalised since late 1980s through a plethora of initiatives like trade, travel, tourism, and societal activities on the premise of peace and tranquillity along the border."It is not our position that we should solve the boundary question. We understand that it is a very complicated and difficult issue. There have been many negotiations at different levels...That is a very high bar for a relationship," said Jaishankar."I am talking about a much more basic bar which is that there must be peace and tranquillity along the LAC in the border areas and that has been the case since the late 1980s," he added."Now, if peace and tranquillity is deeply disturbed, then obviously there will be an impact on the relationship and that is what we are seeing," he said referring to the border situation in eastern Ladakh.Jaishankar said both China and India were rising and assuming "bigger" role in the world, but the "big question" was how the two countries find an "equilibrium"."That is the basic case I addressed in my book," the Minister said, adding he completed the manuscript of the book in April, before the border row erupted in eastern Ladakh.

17-10-2020||Raipur||Amit Jogi’s nomination for bypoll rejected on caste issue||The nomination papers of Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (J) chief Amit Jogi for bypoll to the reserved Marwahi Assembly seat was rejected by the returning officer on Saturday, stating that his caste certificate was invalid.The decision was based on the order of a High Level Certification Scrutiny Committee headed by D D Singh, secretary, Chhattisgarh Tribal Welfare Department.The committee on October 15 dismissed Amit Jogi’s claim of being a tribal and canceled his caste certificate.The returning officer also rejected the nomination of Amit Jogi’s wife Richa Jogi for the same bypoll on the same ground.Marwahi assembly seat, former chief minister late Ajit Jogi’s bastion, will thus not have a contestant from the Jogi family this time.The seat, which falls in the newly-formed Gaurela- Pendra-Marwahi (GPM) district, fell vacant following  JCC (J) chief and Amit’s father Ajit Jogi’s death on May 29.“A total of 19 candidates had filed nominations for the Marwahi bypoll scheduled for November 3. Of them, nomination papers of six candidates, including Amit Jogi and Richa Jogi, were rejected after scrutiny,” an election official said.The candidates can withdraw their names from the contest till October 19, he added.“Marwahi seat is reserved for ST category and both Amit Jogi and Richa Jogi do not have valid caste certificates as of today, therefore their nominations were rejected,” he said.The High Level Certification Scrutiny Committee on October 15 canceled Amit Jogi’s caste certificate which claimed that he was member of the Kanwar community.The ST caste certificate issued to Richa Jogi was suspended on Thursday by a district-level verification committee of Mungeli, the official said.A senior government official said that Amit Jogi’s tribal caste certificate was canceled on the ground that his father Ajit Jogi’s certificate as belonging to a tribal community was canceled in August last year.Amit Jogi alleged that the action was taken at the behest of Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel.“The high level caste scrutiny committee suddenly canceled my certificate. Except me, everyone was aware of it.I sought time to read it but was not allowed,” Jogi said.“The move to prevent me from contesting elections has proved that the government has finally admitted that it is not just difficult to beat Jogi, it is impossible. It has been done at the behest of the Chief Minister,” he alleged.“We will fight a legal battle and win our honour and rights,” he added.After becoming the first Chief Minister of the state in 2000, Ajit Jogi contested a by-election from Marwahi in 2001 and won. He emerged victorious in the 2003 and 2008 Assembly elections as well.In 2013, Amit Jogi successfully contested from Marwahi. In 2016, Ajit Jogi quit the Congress and floated Janta Congress Chhattisgarh (J). He won from Marwahi again as JCC (J) candidate in 2018 polls. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amit-jogis-nomination-for-bypoll-rejected-on-caste-issue-157183

Most importantly, particularly for a judge, one must be steadfast in holding on to their principles and fearless in their decisions,” he said.In his letter to CJI Bobde, Reddy had alleged that “Justice Ramana has been influencing the sittings of the High Court, including the roster of a few Hon’ble judges and instances of a few matters important to Telugu Desam have been allotted to a few judges.” The contents of the letter were made public at a press conference addressed by the Principal Adviser to the AP Chief Minister last week.Justice Ramana – who is likely to be the next Chief Justice of India after Justice SA Bobde demits office in April 2021 – said, “The greatest strength of the judiciary is the faith of people in it. Faith, confidence and acceptability cannot be commanded, they have to be earned.”Last month, Justice Ramana had expressed serious concern over judges becoming soft targets of criticism and subject of juicy gossip on social media.“Judges are self-restrained from speaking out in their own defence... Today, judges have become soft targets of criticism and especially with social media advent, judges have become subject to juicy gossip,” Justice Ramana had said at the launch of a book authored by Justice R Banumathi (retd).Quoting Justice Lakshmanan, Justice Ramana on Saturday said, “We, the members of the judicial hierarchy have inherited the legacy of dedicated collective endeavour by the bench and the bar in establishing an unbroken tradition of high efficiency, perfect integrity and fearless independence.”He said Justice Lakshmanan epitomised all the required qualities of being one of the best judges this country has seen.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/judge-needs-to-withstand-pressures-stand-up-against-obstacles-justice-nv-ramana-157180
17-10-2020||New Delhi||Pan-India COVID-19 genome studies suggest no major mutation in virus: PMO||As the work continues to develop an effective vaccine for COVID-19, the government on Saturday said two pan-India studies on the genome of the virus in India suggest it is genetically stable and has shown no major mutation.There had been concerns in some quarters that any major mutation detected in the novel coronavirus could hinder the development of an effective vaccine.  However, some recent global studies have said the vaccines currently being developed for COVID-19 should not be affected by recent mutations.Mutation typically refers to the property of a virus to undergo changes when it multiplies and the virus may develop some new strains after it replicates. In cases, the new strains tend to be less effective and therefore die out soon, while more powerful strains may lead to faster spread of the virus.After a review meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the COVID-19 pandemic situation, and vaccine delivery, distribution and administration preparedness, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement that three vaccines are in advanced stages of development in India, out of which two are in Phase II and one is in Phase-III.The PMO further said, “Two pan-India studies on the Genome of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus) in India conducted by ICMR and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) suggest that the virus is genetically stable and there is no major mutation in the virus.”Last month, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had said no significant or drastic mutations have been found in strains of SARS-CoV-2 in India till now.He had also said the ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) was conducting large-scale sequencing of nationally representative strains collected over a few months and detailed results on mutations of the virus will be available in early October.Replying to a query on mutations of SARS-COV2, ICMR Director-General Dr Balram Bhargava had said at a press briefing earlier this week that minor changes called “drifts” may happen from time to time, but major genetic mutations of viruses or “shifts” may happen in about a decade or two.In this context, the effectiveness of a vaccine will not be determined by minor “drifts”, he had said.A study by a group of researchers last month found that the coronavirus genomes in India have 5.39 per cent mutation similarity with 72 nations.Mutations in an organism’s genetic material are natural ‘errors’ in the cell replication process that may give the virus new ‘powers’ of survival, infectivity, and virulence. It can affect the ability of vaccines and drugs to bind the virus or to create a specific immune response against it.The study also revealed that the US, the UK and India are the top three nations with a geometric mean of 3.27 per cent, 3.59 per cent, and 5.39 per cent, respectively, of mutation similarity score with other 72 countries.Indrajit Saha, an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of National Institute of Technical Teachers’ Training and Research, Kolkata, and his team have also developed a web-based COVID-Predictor to predict the sequence of viruses online on the basis of machine learning.The PMO statement said a National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) in consultation with state governments and all relevant stakeholders have prepared a detailed blueprint of vaccine storage, distribution, and administration.The Expert Group, in consultation with states, is working actively on prioritisation and distribution of vaccines.At the meeting, the prime minister directed that keeping in view the geographical span and diversity of the country, the access to the vaccine should be ensured speedily.Modi stressed that every step in the logistics, delivery, and administration should be put in place rigorously and it must include advanced planning of cold storage chains, distribution network, monitoring mechanism, advance assessment, and preparation of ancillary equipment required, such as vials, syringes, etc. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pan-india-covid-19-genome-studies-suggest-no-major-mutation-in-virus-pmo-157174

As the system is very likely to move away from the Indian coast no adverse weather associated with this system is likely over the west coast of India,” it added.The IMD has, however, cautioned fishermen from venturing into the central and north Arabian Sea.It said light to moderate rainfall at a few places is very likely over coastal districts of Saurashtra and Kutch during next 24 hours.Sea conditions will be rough to very rough over eastcentral and adjoining northeast Arabian Sea on October 17 and over central and northwest Arabian Sea on October 18.The cyclonic circulation had hit the Andhra Pradesh coast earlier this week as a deep depression bringing heavy rains over Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Goa and leaving a trail of destruction.

The trial court where order of stay of civil or criminal proceedings is produced, may fix a date not beyond six months of the order of stay so that on expiry of period of stay, proceedings can commence unless order of extension of stay is produced.”The latest order came in a case from Pune wherein an Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate had in December last year asked a complainant to approach the Bombay High Court for resumption of trial that had been stayed by the high court.“We must remind the Magistrates all over the country that in our pyramidical structure under the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court is at the Apex, and the High Courts, though not subordinate administratively, are certainly subordinate judicially. This kind of orders fly in the face of…our judgment,” the top court said, adding the courts below across India must follow its order in “letter and spirit”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stay-orders-by-hcs-lower-courts-expire-in-6-months-unless-extended-sc-157172

The Republic has denied the allegations.According to the city police, brands take advertising calls based on TRPs and over Rs 32,000 crore of ad inventory is sold every year, which makes it think that it is a multi-crore scam. The arrested include former employees of an agency engaged by the BARC."BARC is providing the necessary assistance to the ongoing investigation by law enforcement agency and this should be seen in the light of larger stability of the panel and in the interests of self-regulation, rather than in isolated cases of particular channels which leads to a distortion of facts," read the BARC statement.It added that the body is driven by the single goal of generating ratings that its subscribers rely on which are deeply rooted in science, report with the greatest sense of responsibility and truly reflect what the country watches.

He has also sustained injuries on his nose, shoulder, back and ankle, the magazine alleged, adding he has filed a complaint with the Delhi Commissioner of Police.Police, however, refuted the allegation, terming it as “false”. It said the allegation is being made only to escalate the situation.It claimed the journalist was among the protesters who were detained for violating coronavirus-related restrictions and was subsequently released.The police action is bonafide and is as per law, it said.Police also said that it issued a notice to the journalist for his statement and questioning in connection with the matter.According to police, a matter of suicide by a girl working as a domestic help in the house of a 74-year-old widow was reported on October 4 at Model Town police station.Her body was found hanging with a bedsheet. The door was bolted from inside and was broken by the Fire Services staff in the presence of local police, police said. Inquest proceedings were conducted and the post-mortem was done on October 8 by a board of doctors from Safdarjung Hospital and the findings are that the death had occurred due to asphyxia as a result of antemortem hanging by ligature material and is suicidal in nature, police said.The body was cremated by the family members at the cremation ground in Wazirpur on October 8. No foul play has come to notice so far in the investigation, it said.“On Friday, some protesters staged a demonstration outside Model Town police station to put undue pressure on police and tried to give the incident a different narrative. Despite explaining the facts of the case and repeated warnings to disperse, a few people remained adamant.“They flouted the DDMA guidelines issued in the wake of the epidemic,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (northwest) Vijayanta Arya said. The demonstrators were detained for violation of the DDMA order. A case has also been registered for the violations under relevant sections of IPC, Epidemic Act and DDMA Act, she said.One Ahan Penkar, who was also seen protesting among the crowd, was also detained and subsequently released, police claimed.He later claimed to be a press person and had alleged misbehaviour by the police, the DCP said.

17-10-2020||Vibha Sharma||Bihar polls: BJP’s internal surveys indicate tough match||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 17It has been reiterated many times by top BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda, that “NDA will win the upcoming Bihar elections with two-thirds majority and form the next government, the Chief Minister of which will be Nitish Kumar irrespective of the number of seats his party, the JD-U, wins”.However, despite being publicly ticked off and assertions of ‘gathbandhan ka dharma’ with Nitish Kumar, LJP president Chirag Paswan is carrying on with his “anti-Nitish Kumar and pro-BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi” strategy leading to speculations about “the real game” in Bihar.Sources say internal surveys of the BJP have indicated a tough match in Bihar. Meanwhile, political observers claim the BJP is also apprehensive about the possibility of a ‘post-poll anti-climax’ featuring Nitish Kumar. This is believed to be one of the main reasons why the leadership are ticking-off Chirag publicly, working hard to put at rest speculations about his party, the LJP, being its ‘Plan B’ etc. Chirag has been strategically criticising Nitish Kumar, praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and supporting the idea of a BJP Chief Minister, thereby earning the title of BJP’s ‘Plan B’ to “wipe out Nitish Kumar and the JD-U in Bihar”.  Notably top BJP leaders, suspended now, are contesting on the ticket of the LJP. While they may have been suspended by the BJP for contesting against NDA candidates, the observers say “there are no prizes for guessing which side they will go in case of a hung Assembly”. While NDA rivals are using Chirag’s utterances against the incumbent CM to their advantage, the BJP camp is also worried about upsetting the EBC vote bank of Nitish Kumar. Sources say party’s internal surveys suggest that Nitish Kumar’s stock is at an all-time low. While the surveys indicate a tight contest in several Assembly segments, the BJP is apprehensive about a scenario where Nitish Kumar manages to get enough seats to cross over to the RJD-led ‘mahagathbandhan’ and help it form the government. This is the main reason for a very public admonishment for Chirag. BJP general secretary Bhupinder Yadav yesterday asked Chirag that while he praised the functioning of the Bihar government till as recently as February 2020, what then led to a change in stance in past few months. The same question may also be in the mind of supporters of Nitish Kumar in Bihar.  Extremely backward class (EBC) constitutes about 26% population in Bihar.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-polls-bjps-internal-surveys-indicate-tough-match-157169

17-10-2020||---||India watching protests against Pak army, PM Imran Khan||New Delhi, October 17India is watching with interest an “early start” to joint protests by nine opposition political parties in Pakistan which are against Prime Minister Imran Khan as well as, for the first time, Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.Of particular interest was former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif’s video address from London on Friday in which he targeted not just Gen Bajwa but also ISI Director General Lt Gen Faiz Hameed as well as the judiciary.Street unrest in Pakistan usually begins at the fag-end of the term as opposition parties try to whip up anti-incumbency sentiments. Protests in Pakistan that begin mid-term, as was the case during the early tenures of Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, usually have the imprint of the Pakistan army. Sharif has so far indirectly accused the army but this is the first time he has named the army chief and the ISI DG for short-circuiting the last general election and ensuring the installation of Imran Khan as PM.Sources say the unrest against Khan and the naming of the two Pakistan senior army generals comes at least two years before the next general elections are due in 2023. The country’s economic indicators have already deteriorated. There is double digit inflation and its marquee project, the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is not just making slow progress but its chief, an army official, has been accused of feathering his nest.At the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM)’s Gujranwala rally where scions of both PPP and PML (Nawaz), Bilawal Bhutto and Mariyam Nawaz, shared the stage, Sharif came over a video link to accuse Gen Bajwa and Gen Faiz for stealing the popular vote to install Imran Khan as PM.While Sharif may have spoken against the army, sources pointed out that his party had joined hands with Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in the National Assembly in approving an extension to Gen Bajwa as Pakistan army chief. “Is Sharif leaving the space for bargaining, especially after the current regime had allowed him to leave the country, aware that he won’t to return?” wondered the sources.The Pakistan Supreme Court had removed Sharif from office on corruption charges and after a spell in jail. He had left for London last November for medical treatment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-watching-protests-against-pak-army-pm-imran-khan-157160

17-10-2020||New Delhi||PM  Modi cautions against complacency in COVID-19 fight||Calling for full preparedness to ensure speedy access to COVID-19 vaccines for every citizen, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday suggested developing a vaccine delivery system on the lines of conduct of polls and disaster management while involving all levels of government and citizen groups.Chairing a meeting to review the COVID-19 pandemic situation and the preparedness of vaccine delivery, distribution, and administration, the prime minister also noted a steady decline in the daily cases and the growth rate. At the same time, he also cautioned against any complacency at the decline and called for keeping up the efforts to contain the pandemic.He insisted on continued social distancing and COVID-appropriate behaviour such as wearing the mask, regularly washing hands and sanitation, especially in the wake of upcoming festival season.The meeting was attended by Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, Principal Secretary to PM, Member (Health) NITI Aayog, Principal Scientific Adviser, senior scientists, officers of PMO, and officials from various other departments.In a statement, the PMO said three vaccines are in advanced stages of development in India, out of which two are in Phase II and one is in Phase-III.It further said Indian Scientists and research teams are collaborating and strengthening the research capacities in neighbouring countries such as Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Mauritius, Nepal and Sri Lanka.There are further requests from Bangladesh, Myanmar, Qatar and Bhutan for clinical trials in their countries. To help the global community, the prime minister further directed that we should not limit our efforts to our immediate neighbourhood but also reach out to the entire world in providing vaccines, medicines and IT platforms for vaccine delivery system.National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) in consultation with state governments and all relevant stakeholders have prepared and presented a detailed blueprint of vaccine storage, distribution, and administration.The Expert Group, in consultation with states, is working actively on prioritisation and distribution of the vaccine.Modi further directed that keeping in view the geographical span and diversity of the country, the access to the vaccine should be ensured speedily.He stressed that every step in the logistics, delivery, and administration should be put in place rigorously.“It must include advanced planning of cold storage chains, distribution network, monitoring mechanism, advance assessment, and preparation of ancillary equipment required, such as vails, syringes, etc,” the statement said.“The prime minister further directed that we should make use of experience of successful conduct of elections and disaster management in the country. The Prime Minister said that in a similar manner vaccine delivery and administration systems should be put in place.“This should involve the participation of states/UTs/district-level functionaries, civil society organisations, volunteers, citizens, and experts from all necessary domains. The entire process should have a strong IT backbone and the system should be designed in such a manner so as to have a lasting value to our healthcare system,” the PMO statement said.It further said two pan-India studies on the Genome of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus) in India conducted by ICMR and Department of BioTechnology (DBT) suggest that the virus is genetically stable and there is no major mutation in the virus.India’s COVID-19 caseload has gone past 74 lakh, while the number of people who have recuperated from the disease has crossed 65 lakh pushing the recovery rate to 87.78 per cent, according to data updated by the Union Health Ministry on Saturday.The coronavirus death toll climbed to 1,12,998 with the virus claiming 837 lives in a day, while the infection tally mounted to 74,32,680 with 62,212 new cases being reported, the data updated at 8 am showed.The active cases of coronavirus infection dropped below eight lakh for the first time in one-and-half months, the ministry said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-cautions-against-complacency-in-covid-19-fight-157142
17-10-2020||Balrampur||UP CM Adityanath launches ‘Mission Shakti’; vows ‘zero tolerance’ to crimes against women||Facing flak over a string of rape incidents in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday launched ‘Mission Shakti’ campaign focusing on ensuring the safety and dignity of women and girls, with a stern warning that perpetrators of crimes against females will be dealt with an iron hand.The chief minister said the campaign, whose start coincided with the commencement of the Navrati festival dedicated to Goddess Durga, is a tribute to the woman who died after being allegedly raped by two men in Balrampur and asserted that his government has “zero tolerance” towards crime against women and girls.The 22-year-old Dalit woman died after being allegedly raped by two men, who were later arrested, in the district. The incident came close on the heels of the gangrape-murder of another Dalit woman in Hathras that had drawn intense outrage after alleged apathy of the administration.“Those who cast an evil eye on the dignity and self-respect of women will find no place in the state. Perpetrators of such crimes are a blot on the society and the government will deal with them with an iron hand,” Adityanath asserted.The campaign will continue for the next six months till Basant Navratri, the chief minister said.“The first phase of ‘Mission Shakti’ will focus on spreading awareness towards ensuring the safety and dignity of women and girl-child.“In the second phase, ‘Operation Shakti’ will target eve-teasers and put them on the path of punishment or reform. If such elements do not mend their ways, they will have to face social-boycott and their pictures will be displayed publicly,” Adityanath said.The chief minister said that this year Ram Lila and Durga Puja pandals will also spread the message of ‘Mission Shakti’, which will have the involvement of 24 departments.Various events are lined up during the campaign for which 100 role models among women will be identified in each district to help spread the message of women safety, self-respect and self-reliance.Adityanath described women as a symbol of ‘Shakti’ and said gender equality and protection of the girl child should start from home itself.“Women are venerable in our eternal tradition and Navratri signifies this. In these changing times, the new generation should become the carrier of our eternal tradition, which always professes the cause of women as the prime duty of mankind. ‘Mission Shakti’ is a reminder of our duty towards women and girls,” he said.Terming female foeticide as a curse, the chief minister said, “Protection of the girl child and giving respect to women should start from home.”Adityanath also expressed his strong views against child marriage, saying such practices should be publicly condemned. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/up-cm-adityanath-launches-mission-shakti-vows-zero-tolerance-to-crimes-against-women-157139

17-10-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai airport now starts COVID-19 express test facility for departing passengers, visitors||The city airport on Saturday said it has extended the availability of its express coronavirus infection test facility also to departing passengers and non-passengers.The RT-PCR test facility is functional from October 15, the airport said in a release.Initially launched for arriving international transit passengers in line with the Civil Aviation Ministry's directives, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) has now further extended the availability of the test facility for passengers departing from the airport as well, the airport operator said in a release.The testing facility, located on the curbside of Level 4 at Terminal 2 for departing passengers, is also available for non-passengers visiting the airport to drop off or receive their loved ones, it added.The initiative addresses passenger concerns regarding the different COVID-19 regulations across domestic and international destinations, it said adding, departing passengers can undergo the test at CSMIA before travelling to their onward destination and produce their negative test report to skip institutional quarantine at their destination.The Mumbai airport had first launched the RT-PCR test facility last month for arriving international passengers transiting to a domestic destination from Mumbai as a measure to skip institutional quarantine upon arrival.This was later extended to all passengers arriving at the airport as directed by the MoCA.Since the commemoration of the test facility on September 6, the airport has witnessed a total of over 3,340 passengers opting for the test, with an average 100 test per day being conducted, said the release.Till date 38 passengers tested positive, of the total tests conducted at the airport facility so far and they were transferred by the state authorities to designated COVID-19 institutions, according to the airport operator.Departing passengers can make an online booking through the test feature available on the CSMI airport website or register themselves at the helpdesk set up at departures to enrol for the RT-PCR test before entering the terminal and receive a digital copy mailed directly or can also collect the physical copy of the test report within eight hours, it stated.Passengers departing from the airport are encouraged to arrive at the terminal 8-12 hours before their scheduled departure, it added.  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-airport-now-starts-covid-19-express-test-facility-for-departing-passengers-visitors-157125
17-10-2020||Patna||Grand Alliance promises jobs to youths, end farm laws in Bihar if voted to power||The RJD-led Grand Alliance (GA) on Saturday released its joint manifesto for the upcoming Bihar assembly elections, promising to offer jobs to 10 lakh youngsters and repealing the new farm laws recently enacted by the central government if they are voted to power.Releasing the manifesto titled "Badlav Ka Sankalp" (commitment to change) in the presence of All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala and other Mahagathbandhan laders, Tejashwi Yadav said their government, if elected, would first approve the process for appointments on about 10 lakh jobs in the government."Contractual teachers would be entitled for same pay for same work, for which they have been agitating for long," said Yadav, who is the opposition chief ministerial candidate.Assuring the people that the coalition will stand by its commitments, Yadav said that they were not leaders who conveniently forget their promises and that the state has still not been accorded a special status—a demand echoed for years by political parties in Bihar."(Donald) Trump will not come to accord special status to Bihar, which was once promised by the Prime Minister," said Yadav, in an apparent reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ties with the US President.Kumar has raised the issue of granting special status to the land-locked Bihar several times, both during the Congress-led UPA and the BJP-helmed NDA- which could bring investment into the state by providing concessions in taxes to prospective industries.Surjewala said that the first assembly sitting of the GA government would see annulment of the three controversial farm acts that, he alleged, defeat the objectives of green revolution in the state.Nitish Kumar government was the first in the country to do away with the APMC (Agriculture Produce Market Committee) Act in 2006."If we form the government, under the leadership of Tejashwi Yadav, we will pass a Bill in the first Vidhan Sabha session to scrap the three anti-farm laws."Can PM Modi and Nitish tell us that if all mandis are destroyed then how will the farmers get MSP," Surjewala asked.The centre last month enacted three farm reforms to liberalise agricultural markets and end local monopolies of regulated markets known as agricultural produce marketing committees.Identifying unemployment as a big issue, Tejashwi Yadav reiterated "we will approve 10 lakh jobs in the state government in the very first cabinet of the alliance government if voted to power."Focusing on crimes against women and children in the state, the GA leaders said many perpetrators of gang rape against minors at Muzaffarpur shelter home were still at large.Waiver of fee for competitive examination for jobs and helpline for migrant workers were also been promised in the manifesto.Countering charges of "inexperience", Yadav said that the vision for development did not necessarily come with age.Kumar without naming Yadav has been speaking about "inexperience" of the young leadership of the opponents who he said don't know how to work or get the work done from others."As the deputy CM, we have laid the foundation of development with great vision. I was a minister of road construction department, proposed development of dedicated expressway to connect the Bihta airport. Many state highways were converted as the national highways (NHs), said Lalu Prasd's younger son who was the deputy CM before JD(U) left mahagathbandhan.Yadav further alleged that more than 60 scams have taken place under chief minister Nitish Kumars government in Bihar and that the Janata Dal (United)-BJP combine had stabbed the states people on their backs.Congress in-charge of Bihar Shaktisinh Gohil, state party chief Madan Mohan Jha, chairman of BPCC campaign committee Akhilesh Prasad Singh, national RJD spokesperson Manoj Jha and CPI(ML) leader Shashi Yadav were also present during the release of manifesto.Surjewala accused Bihar chief minister of "cheating the people of Bihar" by walking out of the grand alliance in whose favour they had voted in 2015, and said the election is meant to give a new direction to the state which is suffering from "misrule."Taking a swipe at the BJP, the Congress leader said, the saffron party is part of three alliances in the current Bihar polls- one with the JD(U), another with LJP and third one with AIMIM (of Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi)."

Today, I have seen our country, its politics and its discourse. I am no longer convinced it is,” he said.“I am sorry to say but words and ideas may outlast power and authority. Power and authority in the short term can crush the words,” the Congress leader said.“We have seen that a large number of people are under detention for words they have expressed. Currently, people like Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj and Anand Teltumbde are under detention for their words. No one is accused of throwing a stone, hitting someone or possessing a gun or anything like that. It’s only about the words. So, how will the pen stand up to the sword if the pen is wielded to the authority of the government of the day,” he added.Rao, Gonsalves, Bharadwaj, Teltumbde and some other activists have been arrested for their alleged Maoist links and for their alleged involvement in inciting a mob to violence in Koregaon Bhima near Pune on January 1, 2018.Violence had erupted in Koregaon Bhima allegedly after provocative speeches were made during the Elgar Parishad conclave held a day earlier at Shaniwarwada in Pune city.

Lucknow is among eight cities in the country selected for the 'Safe City Project'.The central government has approved the project for Lucknow at a total cost of Rs 194 crore with an aim to strengthen security of women in public places.Patel said, "Crime against women is increasing, and in this scenario, the responsibility of society increases. If the schemes meant for women are not properly implemented, they will lose their importance. Till such time that women are dependent on others socially or monetarily, they will be exploited. The women have to become empowered."She also said, "There are people with criminal and perverted mindset, who derive pleasure by committing crime. Girls are harassed while going to schools. It is because of these people that women do not feel safe in the family. Police must identify these people, and act before they could commit crime."The UP Governor also said that the responsibility of the universities and educational institutes is not confined only to admission, teaching, examination and results."Discussions should also be held as to whether the daughters are safe or not, and whether they have information about their rights," she said.Throwing light on the 'Safe City Project', Additional Director General of Police (Women and Child Security) Neera Rawat said, "The cost of the projects is shared between the Centre and the state in 60:40 ratio. These vehicles have first-aid kit, flashlights and other facilities. The women personnel will combat crimes against women, which will make them feel secured."

17-10-2020||New Delhi||India ranks 94 in Hunger Index, below Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh||India ranked 94 among 107 nations in the Global Hunger Index 2020 and was in the 'serious' hunger category with experts blaming poor implementation processes, lack of effective monitoring, siloed approach in tackling malnutrition and poor performance by large states behind the low ranking.Last year, India's rank was 102 out of 117 countries.Neighbouring Bangladesh, Myanmar and Pakistan too were in the 'serious' category but ranked higher than India in this year's hunger index. While Bangladesh ranked 75, Myanmar and Pakistan were in the 78th and 88th position respectively.Nepal in 73rd and Sri Lanka in 64th position were in 'moderate' hunger category, the report showed.Seventeen nations, including China, Belarus, Ukraine, Turkey, Cuba and Kuwait, shared the top rank with GHI scores of less than five, the website of the Global Hunger Index, that tracks hunger and malnutrition, said on Friday.According to the report released on Friday, 14 per cent of India's population was undernourished.It also showed the country recorded a 37.4 per cent stunting rate among children under five and a wasting rate of 17.3 per cent. The under-five mortality rate stood at 3.7 per cent.Wasting is children who have low weight for their height, reflecting acute undernutrition. Stunting is children under the age of five who have low height for their age, reflecting chronic undernutrition.Data from 1991 through 2014 for Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan showed that stunting was concentrated among children from households facing multiple forms of deprivation, including poor dietary diversity, low levels of maternal education, and household poverty.During this period, India experienced a decline in under-five mortality, driven largely by a decrease in deaths from birth asphyxia or trauma, neonatal infections, pneumonia, and diarrhoea, the report stated."However, child mortality, caused by prematurity and low birth weight, increased particularly in poorer states and rural areas. Prevention of prematurity and low birthweight is identified as a key factor with the potential to reduce under-five mortality in India, through actions such as better antenatal care, education, and nutrition as well as reductions in anaemia and oral tobacco use," it said.Experts think that poor implementation processes, lack of effective monitoring and siloed approaches to tackling malnutrition often result in poor nutrition indices.Purnima Menon, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, New Delhi, said the performance of large states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh need to be improved to see an overall change of India's ranking."The national average is affected a lot by the states like UP and Bihar... the states which actually have a combination of high levels of malnutrition, and they contribute a lot to the population of the country."Every fifth child born in India is in Uttar Pradesh. So if you have a high level of malnutrition in a state that has a high population, it contributes a lot to India's average. Obviously, then, India's average will be slow to move," she told PTI.Menon said big states with large population and a high burden of malnutrition are those which are actually affecting India's average.Also read: Rahul Gandhi attacks Modi govt for 'filling pockets of its special friends'"So, if we want a change in India then we would also need a change in Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar," she said.Shweta Khandelwal, the head of Nutrition Research and Additional Professor at Public Health Foundation of India, said the country has one of the most impressive portfolios of programmes and policies in nutrition in the books."However, the ground realities are quite dismal." "Research shows that our top-down approach, poor implementation processes, lack of effective monitoring and siloed approaches in tackling malnutrition (missing convergence) often result in poor nutrition indices. We must integrate actions to make public health and nutrition a priority across each sector," she told PTI.Khandelwal suggested five measures to prevent exacerbation of hunger because of the pandemic."Safeguard and promote access to nutritious, safe and affordable diets; invest in improving maternal and child nutrition through pregnancy, infancy, and early childhood; re-activate and scale-up services for the early detection and treatment of child wasting; maintain the provision of nutritious and safe school meals for vulnerable children and expand social protection to safeguard access to nutritious diets and essential service," she said.She said it is important to aim at curbing multiple forms of malnutrition holistically in a concerted manner rather than single short-sighted fixes."Hunger and undernutrition cannot and should not be fixed by mere calorie provision. All stakeholders steered by robust leadership must pay attention to making balanced healthy diets which are climate-friendly, affordable and accessible to all," she added.GHI score is calculated on four indicators—undernourishment; child wasting, the share of children under the age of five who are wasted—who have low weight for their height reflecting acute undernutrition); child stunting, children under the age of five who have low height for their age reflecting chronic undernutrition; and child mortality—the mortality rate of children under the age of five.

Pictures clicked from today’s celebrations as I am also fasting, meanwhile another FIR filed against me, Pappu sena in Maharashtra seems to be obsessing over me, don’t miss me so much I will be there soon," her tweet read.However, Bandra metropolitan magistrate Jaydeo Y Ghule passed the order on Friday.Casting director Sahil Ashrafali Sayyed had lodged the complaint in the court, seeking its direction for registration of an FIR under IPC sections 153A (promoting enmity), 295A (malicious acts intended to outrage the religious feelings), 124A (sedition) against the actor and her sister, his lawyer Ravish Zamindar said.The complainant has alleged that the actor has been defaming Bollywood for the last two months by calling it a "hub of nepotism", "favouritism", etc, through her tweets and television interviews.In the complaint, he said that Ranaut has tweeted "very objectionable" comments, which has not only hurt his religious sentiments, but also the feelings of many artistes.Sayyed alleged that Ranaut has been trying to divide artistes on communal lines."Her sister, too, has made objectionable comments on social media to spread communal tension between two religious groups," the complaint said.Upon perusal of the documents on record and the lawyer's submission, the court found that "cognisable offence" has been committed by the accused.It then directed the police station concerned to initiate necessary action and investigation against the actor and her sister under relevant provisions of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC)."Total allegations are based upon the comments made on electronic media- Twitter and interviews- and a thorough investigation by an expert is necessary," the court said.Who all are fasting on Navratris?

17-10-2020||Patna/New Delhi||‘I’m Modi’s Hanuman, will tear open my chest and show if needed’: Chirag Paswan||LJP chief Chirag Paswan asserted on Friday he is Narendra Modi's "Hanuman" and that the prime minister lives in his heart.Paswan's statement came on a day when he was excoriated by Union Minister Prakash Javadekar, who called the LJP leader a "vote Katua" (splitter of votes) and accused him of trying to create a confusion by harping on his equations with senior leaders of the saffron party."The prime minister lives in my heart....I am like his Hanuman. If they (his critics) want, they can prise open my heart and see that. I don't need to use the prime minister's photograph," Paswan said.Paswan, who led his party out of the NDA in Bihar and is contesting alone, was recently warned by senior BJP leaders, including former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, of legal action if his party were to use the prime minister's photograph for election campaign."The chief minister (Nitish Kumar) needs his (Modi's) photograph more, he needs to share the dais with the prime minister as he had consistently opposed him on the issue of Article 370, instant triple talaq, CAA and NRC."One thing I make clear today that I was, I am and will be with the BJP in future too. It's my resolve to form a BJP-LJP government in Bihar after November 10, the day the election results are announced," he said, with his father and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan's photograph forming the background.Paswan faced stinging criticism from Javadekar who said,"We want to make it clear that we have no relations (with LJP), and we do not like this politics of spreading confusion."Other senior BJP leaders, including party general secretary Bhupender Yadav, too hit out at Paswan.Yadav accused Paswan of practising "politics of lies", saying he had been praising the Bihar government in February this year."Chirag should not either live in illusion or nurse any illusion or spread illusion," Yadav tweeted.Javadekar said BJP's alliance in Bihar is with JD(U), Jitan Ram Manjhi's HAM(S) and Vikassheel Insaan Party, asserting the NDA combine will win three-fourth majority in the state.The LJP is nothing more than "vote katua" and it will not be able to make much impact, he said.

Each day only 250 people will be allowed inside the temple.The usual rush of devotees was missing this time.Though the temple opened on Friday evening for the monthly puja, entry of devotees was allowed only from Saturday, the first day of ‘Thulam’ (malayalam month).Only those between 10-60 years, having a medical certificate stating that they were fit to trek the holy hill, are being allowed to offer prayers.Due to the pandemic, the pilgrims will not be allowed to stay at Sannidhanam, Nilackkal or Pamba.

17-10-2020||Bhopal||MP Assembly bypolls: Bhind cops stamp bullets with QR code to curb gun violence||Ahead of the Assembly bypolls in   Madhya Pradesh, police in Bhind district have launched an initiative, under which bullets are being stamped with quick response (QR) codes to easily trace the shooter and to keep the use of guns in check, an official said.Out of the 28 state Assembly seats where bypolls would be held on November 3, Bhind district has two constituencies among the 16 in the Gwalior-Chambal region.The winding ravines of Chambal were once a den of trigger-happy dacoits like Malkhan Singh and Paan Singh Tomar, who unleashed a reign of terror in the region. Slain “Bandit Queen” Phoolan Devi had found refuge in these ravines before she became a Member of Parliament (MP).Even now, people in the region rejoice in flaunting guns to demonstrate their power.Talking to PTI, district superintendent of police Manoj Kumar Singh said, “Bhind has witnessed around 150 murders in the last five years with most of them being committed using illegal weapons.”During the last Assembly elections, the district had witnessed violence and rigging attempts which were thwarted, police sources said.“Therefore, ahead of the by-elections, police have asked more than 22,000 firearms licensees in the district to come forth and get the casings of bullets printed with QR codes,” he said.“The initiative has started this week and stamping a QR code costs just one paisa for a round. It contains details of the gun licensee, whom police can trace almost instantly,” he added.Replying to a query, Singh said the bullet coding exercise is being done not only in view of the upcoming bypolls when the arms are surrendered with the police, but to keep the “gun culture” in check for good.“In the run-up to the election or during it, if someone fires a bullet stamped with QR code even from a country-made weapon, we can reach the shooter as the empty bullet case will provide all the details,” he said.When asked whether this exercise would create any impact in Bhind, where hardened criminals acquire country weapons and bullets from different places, Singh said that his aim was to reduce gun culture prevailing in the region.“Even if I am able to save one life, I will be happy,” the police officer said, adding that he had been working on quick response coding for the past two years.Singh said there was a trend to register false cases in Bhind.“If someone sustains a bullet injury, in his complaint he names innocent people, with whom he wants to settle old scores. But through QR coding, we can easily get to know the weapon from which the bullet was fired as well as its owner,” he said.“Coding won’t leave a room for an injured person to implicate innocent people who do not have any connection with attack on him,” he added.

17-10-2020||---||India could figure in next US Presidential debate||New Delhi, October 17The next and final US Presidential debate on October 22 could feature India and the wider neighbourhood, sources here tracking the trajectory of the Presidential elections have said.The two candidates — US President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden — have not dwelt much on the American foreign policy, especially in the Asia Pacific, that seems to be the focus of the current administration. The scant focus on foreign policy so far is also because one out of three scheduled debates was cancelled after Trump refused to participate in an on-line format.The moderator, Christine Welker, has chosen six topics for in-depth discussions with the two candidates. While three are domestic issues, the other three — climate change, leadership and national security — have international ramifications and will be of interest to the Indian foreign and security policy-makers. The three domestic issues are COVID-19, race and American families.The topics in the first Presidential debate were mostly inward-looking. These included the records of the candidates, the Supreme Court, COVID-19, race and violence and the integrity of the election. Only the sixth topic, the economy, had direct foreign policy ramifications.On the human rights side, a free pass is expected from Trump. Biden, though, could give anxious moments to Indian policy-makers if he dwells on Kashmir and proposes that India and Pakistan should take to each other to resolve it, which was the mainstream democratic position, said the sources.They, however, expect a greater likelihood of Biden focusing more on the unrest and repression in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. The future direction that the Quad would take will also be a matter of interest as also future policies towards Russia and Israel and Palestine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-could-figure-in-next-us-presidential-debate-157084

She said when she went there, the accused offered her a spiked soft drink and forced her to have physical relations with him," he added."The woman alleged that when she became pregnant, Mahaakshay asked her to abort the baby and gave her pills," he said."The woman said she used to ask Mahaakshay about their marriage. But in January 2018, he told her that he cannot marry her, which led to an altercation between them. She said when she called him, his mother Yogita Bali threatened her," the official said.The complainant later went to Delhi with her brother to stay with their family friend. There, she lodged a complaint against Mahaakshay and his mother Yogita Bali at Begumpur police station in June 2018, he added.The police had registered an offence under section 376 (rape), 313 (causing miscarriage without woman's consent) and others, and the probe was transferred to the crime branch there.A Delhi court later granted anticipatory bail to Mahaakshay and his mother in the case.In March 2020, the Delhi High Court had asked the woman to file her complaint in the court, where the offence had taken place. Following that, she filed a complaint at Oshiwara police station in July this year, the official said."Accordingly, an offence under IPC sections 376 (rape), 376 (2) (n) (repeated rape), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), 417 (cheating), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) has been registered against the accused," he said, adding that a probe is on.Mahaakshay has featured in a few films like "Haunted 3D" and "Loot".

The case fatality rate as on date stands at 1.52 per cent. These have in tandem resulted in consistent slide in the active cases," the ministry highlighted.It said that 78 per cent of the new recovered cases are observed to be concentrated in 10  states and UTs -- Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Odisha.Seventy-nine per cent of the 62,212 new cases of COVID-19 recorded in a span of 24 hours are from 10 States and UTs -- Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha, the ministry said.Maharashtra is still reporting a very high number of new cases with more than 11,000 infections, followed by Karnataka and Kerala with more than 7,000 cases each, it stated.A total of 837 case fatalities have been reported in a span of 24 hours.

17-10-2020||New Delhi||DDLJ at 25: Still glossy, still romantic but out of sync with times||Packaging soft-focus romance within a rigid frame of patriarchy, the “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge” love story unfolded in grassy Swiss meadows and Punjab's mustard fields 25 years ago and went on to become a cult classic that combined desi sensibilities with NRI sensitivities.The film, one of India's most successful, put Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol right up there as among Bollywood's most popular onscreen pairs down the decades. It has withstood the test of time, with many viewers going back to rewatch it, and its love story is still fresh but also anachronistic and out of sync with contemporary realities, say some.The Raj-Simran romance drama – not about lovers who dare all but more about conformists who love each other desperately and will get married only with their parents' concurrence – released on October 20, 1995.And India woke up to romance ‘DDLJ' style, where the boy and girl, both London bred but ‘Indian' at heart, barely hold hands, quite unlike the bolder, franker portrayal of relationships in Hindi cinema today.The film centres around Raj, the carefree, rich boy who falls in love with Simran, the dutiful daughter getting ready to marry a man she has never met, in Europe.They live out the teen dream of holidaying in the continent but Simran returns home to London and then to a village in Punjab where her father has arranged a match for her. Lovelorn Raj follows her there but resolves not to marry her till her strict father approves."DDLJ" is all about large-hearted non-resident Indian desis and their Indianness, shot in breathtaking locations with a soundtrack by Jatin-Lalit and Anand Bakshi to suit every mood and dialogues that went on to become even more popular in the digital age.Twenty-five years later, audiences still watch the film at Mumbai's Maratha Mandir – or did till March when COVID-19 struck – but the views are as diverse as the first half of the film in London and Alpine locales from the second in a rambunctious family in a Punjab village.According to senior film critic Saibal Chatterjee, the movie inaugurated "the era of the designer film made for NRIs"."DDLJ" marked the directorial debut of Aditya Chopra, son of veteran filmmaker Yash Chopra, known as the 'King of Romance' in Hindi cinema. The 1995 film, also starring the late Amrish Puri, Farida Jalal and Anupam Kher, released at a time when India had opened up to liberalisation.Chatterjee said the film looked fresh then but packaged old ways of living in a new sheen."It was about an NRI couple who live by their own rules, but at heart are completely Indian," he told PTI.According to Chatterjee, “DDLJ” comes only after the 1975 hit "Sholay" for the influence it exercised on Hindi cinema."It is one of Hindi cinema's biggest commercial hits. So much has changed with the arrival of streamers, but Maratha Mandir theatre was still running it until COVID-19 happened."An entire generation of viewers has grown up in the last two decades but for some, the relevance of the film is based on that one vivid memory of when they first watched the film.Prema Maharishi, 84, remembers going to see the film in a Mathura hall and remembers the dialogues verbatim. Her particular favourite is the stern father letting go off Simran's hand in the climax with these words, “Ja Simran Ja. Jee le apni zindagi. (Go Simran, go live your life).”And the young woman, having finally got her father's permission, runs towards the train picking up pace as it pulls out of the platform to hold Raj's extended hand."One thing that seemed off to me even then was why Shah Rukh didn't pull the chain to stop the train. What would have happened had the train left the station without Kajol? Kajol had to run too much," the Mathura-based former school principal said about the much-debated climax sequence.The film is a perfect blend of fairy tale fantasy and real life, according to government officer Rohit Sagar "I was a young cadet in the National Defence Academy when it released. My earliest memory of watching it in a Pune theatre on a Sunday out pass. I instantly fell in love with the movie," he said.Kolkata-based Sagar said he related to "DDLJ" as a 20-year-old in 1995 and as a 45-year-old today."The new generation might find it a bit old-fashioned. However, a few ideas relate even to current times - to respect the one you love, to go all out to win your love without stooping low, to strike a balance between fun and commitment."The film has projected both Western and Indian cultures in a positive way, Sagar noted."Even a Westernised man can display chivalry, respect for women and parents. Despite the mischief typical of the age, when the time comes, he is ready to shoulder responsibility with equal zest," he said.Saipriya, a 17-year-old in Bengaluru, has little patience for the film and also finds the title problematic as she believes it objectifies women."Even at the end of the film Simran's father says 'Ja Simran. Jee le apni zindagi'. A woman doesn't need anyone else's permission to live her own life! This means she will be controlled by her father before marriage and by her husband after marriage. It's patriarchal and regressive," the young woman said.Referring to a scene when Simran wakes up after a drunken evening in Raj's bed, Saipriya said the hero tries to trick her into believing they had sex."When she starts crying, he says 'Main ek Hindustani hoon aur main jaanta hoon ki ek Hindustani ladki ki izzat kya hoti hai'. Is keeping your hymen intact till marriage the greatest virtue of an Indian woman? Sex, marriage and the honour of the woman are unrelated. Also Raj clearly slut-shamed other women who have premarital sex."Jaipur-based Zubin Mehta echoes Saipriya's sentiment about the movie's patriarchal gaze but argues that "DDLJ" is still an entertaining watch."It wasn't made to be a perfect romantic movie," the 30-year-old lawyer said.Mehta added that the film put 1990s Hindi cinema on the world map in an era where the information technology sector was still in its initial stage in the country."DDLJ' was a stepping stone for Bollywood internationally. It was also then that we Indians peered into the lifestyle of 'gora log', which was fascinating. Their style of living, clothing and culture," he said.What happened to Raj and Simran after the train left the station is unknown, but an ambiguous ending is what makes 'ever after' happy, Chatterjee noted."There is romance and hope in not knowing it. The woman has been set free and maybe she will have a brighter future. That's what Hindi cinema is about, it's about hope, not reality."

He did not require any BiPAP support. All the major organs are functioning fine.He is putting up a strong fight," Dr Kar added.The veteran actor was administered "higher doses" of steroids to enhance the recovery from COVID-19 encephalopathy.The critically acclaimed actor, who has the rare distinction of having worked with maestros like Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Tapan Sinha and Tarun Mazumdar, was admitted to the private hospital here on October 6 after he tested positive for COVID-19.He had to be shifted to the ITU after his condition deteriorated.Chatterjee tested negative for COVID-19 on Wednesday following which he was shifted to a non-COVID ITU for treatment.

In the meantime, China, Russia, India all these countries they're spewing stuff into the air,” he alleged during the rally. He said the US has achieved energy independence while protecting its pristine environment.Trump in June, 2017 announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris deal, saying the accord would have cost America trillions of dollars, killed jobs, and hindered the oil, gas, coal and manufacturing industries.He has continuously argued that countries like China and India are benefiting the most from the Paris agreement and the agreement itself was unfair to the US, as it badly hit its businesses and jobs.During Thursday's rally too, Trump said to the cheering crowd that it were a few nations that were contributing to global pollution. “I keep telling my people you know, I love clean air but Russia and China, you look at a map you have all these spots and India and many others are spewing it in. What do you suggest?” he asked his thousands of supporters who had gathered at a city airport here to listen to his election speech.Trump also mocked at those who call for replacing plastic with paper. “Well, we don't think you should sell straws anymore. Oh great ok. You ever hear that, the straw, right? I say ok the straw is good, what about the plastic plate? What about the carton? What about the glass that's out of plastic? Well we'll get to that later. These people are crazy,” he said. In his speech, Trump also talked about jobs for the Americans and mentioned that he recently fired the head of a semi-private company for replacing American workers with foreign workers.“The chairman of Tennessee Valley Authority was fired because he replaced American workforce with foreign workers. I told the board chairman, chairman, you're fired. Out. You're fired, chairman,” he said. “And what happened is as soon as I said that they hired all the employees back from Tennessee and five other states, six other states. They're all back and they were great. They were great. So we do our little things, right? We did that one and it was great,” he said.Trump alleged that the immigration plan of his Democratic opponent Joe Biden is the most extreme in the history of the country. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/donald-trump-blames-china-russia-india-for-rising-air-pollution-156995

These kind of conditions are imposed which are against the principle of law. Repeatedly, such observations are being made,” senior advocate Sanjay Parikh submitted on behalf of the petitioner women lawyers.Maintaining that the appeal had been filed under extraordinary circumstances, Parikh urged the top court to stay the bail condition imposed on the accused by the MP High Court.At one stage, the Bench sought to know from Parikh if he was making the submission only for Madhya Pradesh or for the entire country.As Parikh said he wanted the direction for all courts across India not to impose extraneous conditions for bail, the Bench issued the notice to the AG’s office and posted it for hearing on November 2.The High Court had on July 30 granted bail to a molestation accused and imposed a condition that he along with his wife shall visit the house of the complainant and request her to tie a ‘Rakhi’ to him with the promise to protect her to the best of his ability for all times to come.Alleging that such an order amounted to trivialisation of sexual offences by courts, the petitioners said the bail condition further victimized the complainant and trivialized the trauma that she suffered.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-seeks-ags-help-on-plea-against-trivialisation-of-sexual-offences-156981
