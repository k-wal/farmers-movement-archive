26-04-2020||New Delhi||No move to reduce retirement age of Central govt staff: Personnel ministry||There is no move to bring down the retirement age of central government employees, Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh said on Sunday, refuting reports in a section of media that there was a proposal to retire the employees early.Central government staff retire at the age of 60.Strongly refuting the reports that the government has moved a proposal for reducing the retirement age of government employees to 50 years, the minister said, “There is no such move to reduce the retirement age nor (there) has been such a proposal discussed or contemplated at any level in the government.”Singh said there are certain motivated elements which have been planting such disinformation time and again in a section of media over the last few days and attributing it to the government sources or the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT).He said each time a prompt rebuttal is sought to be made in order to clear the confusion in the minds of stakeholders.Singh said, it was unfortunate that at a time the country is going through the coronavirus crisis, there are certain elements and vested interests which try to underplay all the good works done by the government by planting such media stories, according to a communique.On the contrary, right from the beginning of the emergence of the coronavirus challenge, the government and the DoPT have taken prompt decisions to safeguard the interests of the employees, the minister said.For example, he said, even before the lockdown was officially announced, the DoPT had issued an advisory for the offices to work with “absolutely necessary or minimum staff”.Even though essential services were exempted from this guideline, the DoPT had issued directions to exempt the “Divyang employees even from the essential services”, the statement said, quoting the minister.Considering the constraints of the lockdown, he recalled that the DoPT had postponed the last date for filling of the Annual Performance Appraisal Report (APAR) by the government officials.At the same time, Singh referred to the UPSC’s decision to reschedule the dates of civil services civil exam interview/personality test and also announced that the civil services preliminary test will be done after May 3, the statement said.Similarly, the SSC has also postponed its process of recruitment, it said.Singh said that last week there was fake news that the government had decided to impose a 30 per cent reduction in the pension and discontinue pensions for those who are above the age of 80.“However, contrary to this, the truth is that on the 31st of March there was not a single pensioner whose pension did not deposit in his account. Not only this, services of the postal department were sought to deliver the pension amount at the residence of the pensioners, whenever required,” the minister was quoted as having said in the statement.The Ministry of Personnel has had video conference consultations for senior citizens across 20 cities where pulmonary advice was given by experts like Randeep Guleria, Director (AIIMS), he said.Similarly, yoga sessions on webinar are also being organised, Singh added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-move-to-reduce-retirement-age-of-central-govt-staff-personnel-ministry-76632

But because of such people we should not treat anyone with ‘krodh’ or ‘khunas’ (anger or vindictiveness).“All 130 crore are our countrymen. It is not correct to blame the entire community because of something some people may have done because of ‘bhay’ and ‘krodh’ (fear and anger). We do not help with difference in human beings.  We must help with a feeling of togetherness and affinity. We are not doing any favour to anyone, we are working for our own people,” the RSS chief said in Nagpur.Bhagwat also appreciated the readiness shown by the BJP-led government in dealing with the crisis.Recalling Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s message to ‘sarpanches’ across the country regarding self-reliance, he said: “The situation has given us an opportunity to draw lessons. We must try to use things made here (in India), we must make do with whatever we make here, and if something is required from outside it would be at our own conditions. There should be no dependence on ‘videshi’,” asking people to follow ‘swadeshi acharan’ and businesses to adopt good practices and produce quality things.“India is doing well because of the readiness shown by the government to deal with the issue,” he said also appreciating the medicines given to other countries in the time of COVID-19 crisis.Bhagwat also urged everyone to make changes in lifestyle and work on curbing air pollution and save water.“Everyone will have to make sacrifices. Use this opportunity to make a new India,” he said, advocating new model of development and nature-friendly sustainable economy.  For the cadres his message was clear, that they should continue to help people till the time the situation is not completely under control and over.“Our regular work has been replaced with ‘seva’.  We need to be careful about our health and follow rules. We must provide help to right people and ensure that no one is left out. This is a new disease. We don’t know how long it will continue. We will try to make it end soon. But till it is there we must provide help with patience and without feeling disappointed. There is a very small distance between success and failure,” he said.“The disease will go but the system which has been damaged will take time to repair. We will have to follow rules of physical distance. It has to be found how institutions like schools will function. We will have to keep engaging people to tell them about discipline and help improve our immunity.“The problem (COVID-19) has taught us much, we must deal with it with ‘soch’ (thoughtfulness) ‘samaj’ (understanding) and ‘sajagta’ (awareness), without ‘bhay’ (fear) and ‘krodh’ (anger), he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhagwat-pitches-on-swadeshi-condemns-killing-of-sadhus-in-palghar-76624
26-04-2020||New Delhi||Covid situation improving; hotspots turning into non-hotspots: Vardhan||Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Sunday said the coronavirus situation in the country is improving as many hotspot districts (HSD) are moving towards being non-hotspot districts (NHSD). The minister visited All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Trauma Centre to take stock of the preparedness to overcome COVID-19, a statement from the ministry said.On April 15, the health ministry declared 170 districts as COVID-19 hotspots and 207 districts as non-hotspots.Hotspots are those districts which are reporting more number of cases or where the rate of growth of COVID-19 cases is high, the ministry said, adding that a detailed direction has been issued to states stating consolidated efforts are required to utilise this period of lockdown to curb the spread of the deadly virus.The districts that have not reported any cases yet have also been directed to work on cluster containment plans, the ministry said.Since then there have been no updates on the number of hotspots from the health ministry.On Sunday, during his visit, the health minister spoke to some COVID-19 positive patients through video calling and enquired about their health. Robots handled the technology at the patients’ end, it said.Vardhan also sought their feedback about the facilities available at AIIMS so that necessary improvements can be made, the statement said.Through a graded, pre-emptive and proactive approach, the government of India is taking several steps along with the states/union territories for prevention, containment and management of COVID-19. These are being regularly reviewed and monitored at the highest level, the ministry said.After a detailed review, Vardhan appreciated AIIMS for ensuring 24X7 monitoring of COVID-19 confirmed and suspected patients using digital platforms, video and voice call technologies. He also urged people to observe the lockdown in letter and spirit and to treat it as an effective intervention to cut down the spread of COVID-19. “The situation is improving in India as hotspot districts (HSD) are moving towards being non-hotspot districts (NHSD),” the minister said.Meanwhile, the cabinet secretary had a detailed video conferencing with chief secretaries and director generals of police (DGP) of states and union territories to review the preparedness for COVID-19 response.Vardhan asserted that states with high viral load should focus on effective implementation of the lockdown measures and containment strategy. They also need to focus on medical infrastructure like adequate availability of isolation beds, ICU beds and ventilators, he said.As of now, 5,913 people have been cured of coronavirus with a recovery rate of 21.90 per cent in the country, the ministry said. A total of 26,917 people have been confirmed positive for COVID-19, it said, adding that 826 deaths have been reported in India. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covid-situation-improving-hotspots-turning-into-non-hotspots-vardhan-76622

26-04-2020||Mumbai||Coronavirus: Next 3-4 months are crucial, says Uddhav Thackeray||The Maharashtra government is in no hurry to relax the lockdown in the state, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Friday.Addressing the people of the state live via social media Thackeray said the spread of the Covid-19 virus has been slowed down in Maharashtra because of the lockdown.“We have succeeded in slowing down the spread of the epidemic because of the lockdown. Unlike in other countries where the number of cases is multiplying every day, the situation is under control in Maharashtra. The next 3-4 months are very important,” Thackeray said.The chief minister indicated that relaxation of lockdown would be calibrated carefully to prevent the situation from getting out of hand. “I will decide what relaxations can be made after May 3. We could start by asking doctors to open their clinics. We could start the dialysis centres. But one thing is clear. We have to avoid crowds. We will take a call on this by April 30,” Thackeray said.He pointed out that 80 per cent of those who tested positive for theCovid-19 virus were asymptomatic. Thackeray urged people with symptoms to come forward and get tested. “Please do not hide and try to self-medicate. If you show any symptoms please get yourself tested,” Thackeray added.The Shiv Sena chief also hit out at former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis without naming him.“This is not the time for politics. If we start doing politics we don’t need any other enemy. Elections will come and go and power will also not remain forever. But a life lost today won’t come back. But some people are indulging in low-level politics,” Thackeray said.Fadnavis had earlier on Sunday accused the Thackeray government of mismanaging the Covid-19 crisis and was hiding the true number of people who died during the pandemic.Fadnavis said 485 people were buried in March and April this year in the town of Malegaon as against 251 in the same period of last year.Thackeray thanked Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari for urging politicians of the state to co-operate with the state government in tackling the pandemic.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/coronavirus-next-3-4-months-are-crucial-says-uddhav-thackeray-76619
26-04-2020||Ahmedabad||Wuhan’s L-strain may be behind Gujarat’s high death rate: Experts||The high COVID-19 mortality rate in Gujarat could be due to the dominance of the L-type strain of coronavirus, found to have been more prevalent in Wuhan in China, where the outbreak started, experts said.The dominance of the more virulent L-type coronavirus strain as compared to the S-type one could be behind the high mortality rate in the state, which has reported 133 deaths so far. However, no research has been conducted to confirm this, they said.A scientist at the state-run Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) said that the novel coronavirus used for genome sequencing recently conducted by it was found to contain the L-type strain.“Analysis done by scientists abroad has shown that the L-type strain has been dominant where more mortality is reported among coronavirus patients. This strain was found to be more prevalent in Wuhan,” director of GBRC, C G Joshi, said.“The coronavirus sample we collected from a patient for genome sequence contained the L-type strain. This strain has a much higher virulence as compared to the S-strain,” he said.“Variation in coronavirus is in terms of number and percentage of mutations. As per the analysis, the L-type strain is dominant where more mortality is reported.Scientists have earlier found that this strain has caused more deaths,” he said.The GBRC recently succeeded in decoding the entire genome sequence of the novel coronavirus, and identified its three new mutations.Joshi added that the patient from whom the virus sample was collected for sequencing has fully recovered.So far, no study has been conducted here to establish which strain of coronavirus is predominant in patients here.Atul Patel, a specialist in infectious diseases, attributed the presence of the L-type strain more than the S- type one in Gujarat is behind high mortality rate.Patel has said that a little higher presence of the L-type strain, or the original Wuhan strain, could be behind higher death rate in the state.The state government has also attributed the high mortality among coronavirus patients in the state to co-morbidities and high risk factors.Heart and lung diseases, diabetes, and hypertension, are among common diseases that have been found among COVID-19 patients who passed away in Gujarat.The risk factors include patients in the age group of above over 60 years and under five years of age, and pregnant women, and they account for 90 per cent of patients who passed away, Principal Secretary (Health), Jayanti Ravi had recently said.

26-04-2020||New Delhi||PM Modi to interact with CMs on Monday to discuss way out of lockdown, COVID fight||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with chief ministers via video conference on Monday morning on the way ahead in the fight against the novel coronavirus, amid indications that the discussions could also focus on a graded exit from the ongoing lockdown.This will be the third video conference of the prime minister with the chief ministers after the spread of the COVID-19 in the country.Sources in the government indicated that besides discussing the way forward in dealing with the pandemic, the discussion could also focus on a “graded” exit from the lockdown which is in place till May 3.The Centre and the state governments have been giving gradual relaxation in various fields and sectors to boost economic activities as also to provide relief to people. But some states are willing to extend the lockdown beyond May 3 to ensure that coronavirus cases remain under control.In his monthly ‘Mann ki Baat’ radio address on Sunday, the prime minister said the country is in the middle of a ‘yudh’ (war) and asserted that people have to continue being careful and take precautions.His note of caution comes against the backdrop of the Union government and states relaxing lockdown norms to revive economic activities.“I urge you not to get overconfident. You should in your over-enthusiasm not think that if the coronavirus has not yet reached your city, village, street or office, it is not going to reach now. Never make such a mistake. The experience of the world tells us a lot in this regard,” he said.Modi referred to a popular Hindi idiom ‘Sawdhani hati, durghatna ghati’ (accident happens when caution is lowered) to make his point.The Centre has now allowed neighbourhood and standalone shops, including those located in residential complexes, in urban areas to open during the lockdown. But those in the markets continue to remain shut till May 3.In rural areas, all shops, except those in shopping malls, are allowed to open.In a late night order on Friday, the Home Ministry also said malls continue to remain shut but markets in rural areas can open.However, opening of shops located in COVID-19 hotspot and containment zones, sale of non-essential items by e-commerce platforms and sale of liquor continue to be prohibited.In the last interaction on April 11, several chief ministers had recommended extension of the 21-day lockdown by two weeks, which was slated to end on April 14 earlier.On April 14, the prime minister had announced that the lockdown is being extended till May 3.Before the lockdown was announced on March 24, the prime minister had interacted with the chief ministers on March 20 to discuss ways and means to check the spread of the novel coronavirus. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-to-interact-with-cms-on-monday-to-discuss-way-out-of-lockdown-covid-fight-76613

26-04-2020||Mumbai||Slum dwellings pose challenge as Mumbai fights coronavirus outbreak||As coronavirus situation spirals, slum dwellings in Mumbai, where more than half of the city’s 12 million population live in crammed space and unhygienic conditions, seem to be posing a daunting challenge in efforts to curb infections.Known as the ‘City of Dreams’, Mumbai is home to the largest number of billionaires as well as Asia’s largest slum Dharavi—one of the coronavirus hotspots. While area-wise it measures just about 2.4 square kilometres (sq kms), Dharavi alone has more than one million people.Tata Group Chairman Emeritus Ratan Tata’s remarks, earlier this week, that developers and architects are treating slums as “residue” of the city and that was one of the reasons for the rapid spread of the pandemic highlighted the current situation.These so-called planners and builders should be ashamed of themselves for forcing a large majority of the people to live in sub-human conditions, he had said.The megacity has reported 4,870 coronavirus cases and 191 deaths.The octogenarian industrialist, also a long time resident of Mumbai, had lambasted realtors for neglecting the poor and creating vertical slums for big gains from high value housing that come up in the areas where slums stood once.Lack of proper planning, flouting of norms, land cartelisation and rising property prices, are among the factors, have contributed to the present situation of large number of people living in slums, experts opined.The Maharashtra government and local authorities are taking measures to contain the spread of coronavirus infections and are appealing the citizens to stay home.However, with rooms measuring barely 100-200 sq ft housing 8-10 people in slums, and scores of families sharing common toilets and water taps, the possibility of coronavirus cases going up is always high, they added.“Blame it on policy paralysis and unending aspirations of both politicians as well as developers’ community for the city not becoming slum-free. And today, these slums have turned into a haven for coronavirus,” MMRDA (Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority) former chief town planner V K Pathak told PTI.Further, he said housing policies that were developed by the competent authorities did not solve the issues of ‘public housing’ but were construed as policies for real estate development.“Nearly 65-70 per cent of Mumbai’s population stays in slums. Policies like the Urban Land Ceiling Act, free housing for slum dwellers and extension of cut off dates for regularising slums led to land cartelisation and increasing property rates,” Pathak said.Over the years, Mumbai has witnessed a large influx of migrants in search of jobs. They settled in clusters by building small hutments as they could not afford to buy homes and those areas later became illegal slums.“Affordable housing and slum elimination are two surprisingly conflicting issues. We’re trying to remove slums from seemingly unsuitable living conditions by relocating them to other locations which are 20-30 miles away and where there are no jobs for these uprooted people,” Ratan Tata said earlier this week.In 1995, as part of his pre-election promises, late Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray floated the idea of ‘free housing’ for slum dwellers.When the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance came to power the same year, their government launched the slum rehabilitation scheme.Under the scheme, slums were proposed to be replaced with ‘pukka’ houses on the same plot of land, construction of which was to be cross-funded by a ‘free sale component’. The latter was aimed at attracting investments from home buyers from slightly affluent financial background.However, the scheme could not address the problems in its entirety and slums kept proliferating across the city.Real estate developers’ body Naredco’s National President Niranjan Hiranandani also acknowledged that proper urban planning has “not” been done.“One acknowledges that the situation has been one where proper urban planning has not been done. The need to ensure fiscal viability of real estate projects creates a situation where over the years, we have seen real estate development happen in ways that weren’t examples of ‘sustainable living’ or in sync with the environment.According to him, a mix of acute scarcity of open spaces, restrictions on vertical growth and difficulties relating to slum rehabilitation policy confounds Mumbai’s planned development.An expert in real estate regulations, who did not wish to be identified, said faulty Floor Space Index (FSI) norms have also led to haphazard development in the city and skewed property prices.FSI is a development tool that defines the extent to which construction is permitted on a plot. For long, the permissible FSI for residential development in the island city has been 1.33 and it is 1 in the suburbs.In 2019, then state government led by BJP’s Devendra Fadnavis increased the FSI for slum rehabilitation projects across the city to 4 from the earlier 3.The index is based on a ratio between the area of a covered floor or the built up area to the area of that plot on which a building stands.The new development plan 2034 for Mumbai has proposed to increase the FSI to 2.7.“While the developers used this as a tool to build costly aspirational homes, local authorities used it as a means to generate revenues. In between, the interest of the public was ignored,” the expert quoted above said.Over the past several years, Maharashtra government has been planning to redevelop the most congested areas in the city like Dharavi and Kamathipura.The ambitious Dharavi redevelopment plan, which was conceptualised more than a decade ago in 2004, has not found takers yet as developers have found the proposal “financially unviable”.“Haphazard and in some instances, unplanned development just enhances the difficulty quotient. The slum proliferation challenge begins with open spaces reserved by authorities for future development or kept vacant as no development zones.“Given the constant pressure from new migrants looking for homes, it opens up the pathway to proliferation of slums. This is a problem not unique only to Mumbai, but certainly more acute as compared to other cities,” Hiranandani said.

26-04-2020||Bengaluru||'Twitter India blocking me with very prejudiced intentions': Anantkumar Hegde||Former Union minister and controversial BJP MP Anantkumar Hegde on Sunday fired a salvo against Twitter India for its alleged 'anti-India stand' and blocking him 'with very prejudiced intentions'.The MP from Uttara Kannada has also written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi against the 'Digital colonisation' by a corporate entity.Hegde, in a Facebook post on Sunday, said he took offence against a Khalistan supporter and the 'hidden agenda of the Tablighi Jamat movement within India'.He said he had written to the Prime Minister and Home Minister Amit Shah on April 20 against Gurupatwant Singh Pannun advocating independence of Punjab by advocating the formation of Khalistan."As a consequence of the two bold steps taken by me, on April 24, 2020 my official Twitter account got blocked by Twitter India Inc.," the MP alleged in the post.The MP shared the message he received from Twitter where he was asked to delete the tweets that violate its rules.Twitter also said that if he felt that it has made a mistake, he can appeal the violation.Hegde said he would not delete the tweet "because it was to expose the wrong being done under the umbrella of religion.Undoubtedly I am not against any religion, but being an Indian, I will never allow any person or organisation to spread hatred or to provoke people to indulge in any anti-social or anti-national activity."I stand affirm on my statement and will defend it strongly," Hegde stated.The MP wrote to Modi on Saturday against Twitter India about "selective targeting" of several national handles and pro-Indian handles by suspending or locking rampantly in the past few months.He alleged that the Twitter account of decorated veterans had been suspended without notice.He also charged some twitter handles with targetting the Prime Minister and Home Minister for their own pecuniary interests.Hegde demanded that selective targeting by Twitter be investigated.Hegde has a history of making controversial remarks.Earlier this month, the state Congress had accused him of giving a call that Tablighi people should be shot down in the backdrop of a religious meet of the organisation in Delhi turning into a coronavirus hotspot.In February this year, he had reportedly claimed that the entire freedom movement was staged with the consent and support of the British, and the independence movement led by Mahatma Gandhi was a "drama", drawing the BJP leadership's ire.He had earlier opposed the state celebrations of Tipu Jayanti during Congress rule in Karnataka since it was started in 2015 and had called the festival a "shameful event glorifying a brutal killer."In 2017, as a union minister, he had kicked up a row saying that the Constitution would be changed but later apologised in the Lok Sabha after facing flak.

26-04-2020||New Delhi||Aggressive testing key to fight battle against COVID-19: Manmohan Singh||Former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday said that without aggressive testing facilities, India cannot conquer challenges posed by COVID-19.Testing and trackingng are the key to fighting the menace, he said in a video released by the Congress."There are problems with regard to the inadequacy of testing facilities and without more aggressive facilities of testing, we are not going to conquer this menace," Manmohan Singh said.Congress shared the thoughts of various leaders in the video to resolve the current crisis relating to the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown. The leaders are members of a consultative group headed by Singh and formulate the party's views on various matters.They also stressed on the issue of humanism, protection and financial security to drive the approach to dealing with migrant labourers.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the party should have a broad framework for protection of migrants."We must insist that migrants are protected. But, we must also acknowledge that state governments are actually going to be responsible for driving this thing. Different state governments might choose different methodologies to solve this problem," he said.Gandhi said: "Our migrant strategy should include protection. The idea that you can tell the migrant that it is his problem, that has to be central. Movement of the migrant should depend on the two states and they should have a conversation.""Testing and Tracing are the key to fight COVID19. Humanism, protection and financial security must drive our approach to dealing with migrant labourers. This is the only way ahead," the Congress said while sharing the video.Former finance minister P Chidambaram suggested that one must leave it to the state from where the migrant originally came in to find ways to take back the migrants from other states."But, the bulk will have to remain where they are. They have to be immediately given cash and grain," he noted.Congress general secretary K C Venugopal said: "The government is failing in this battle and we have to put pressure on the government for the people of the country."Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the government's financial action plan 1 has not really worked and "government needs to step up".Another Congress leader Jairam Ramesh sought to scale up testing facilities and noted that the country had the capacity to triple the amount of testing. For reaching a threshold level of covering one per cent of the population, "we have to do something like 10 million tests", he said.Party spokesperson Manish Tewari said it is incumbent upon the Congress to collectively apply our minds and suggest a smart plan to how do we transition out of this lockdown due to all the issues arising out of it, especially the economic issue.Congress also said that it believes in dialogue and discussion as the path to finding solutions.

26-04-2020||Islamabad/Dhaka||SAARC nations unveil emergency stimulus packages to tackle COVID-19 economic fallout||The SAARC countries have rolled out a raft of stimulus packages to boost investments, buffer private businesses and bolster growth in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that has upended life and disrupted economic activity in a region inhabited by over 1.8 billion people.The World Bank recently warned that South Asia faces its worst economic performance in 40 years due to the deadly coronavirus pandemic which has been wreaking havoc worldwide.It advised the governments to “ramp up action to curb the health emergency, protect their people, especially the poorest and most vulnerable, and set the stage now for fast economic recovery”.India, a USD 2.9 trillion economy — the biggest in the 8-member SAARC grouping, responded by unveiling a Rs 1.7 lakh crore (USD 22.6 billion) economic stimulus plan, providing direct cash transfer to poor senior citizens and women and free foodgrain and cooking gas to give relief to millions hit by the lockdown.The central bank cut the key interest rate by 75 basis points to make loans cheaper and provided Rs 1 lakh crore of liquidity to the market. Also, a moratorium on repayment of loans for three months has been provided.The government has suspended the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code for 6 to 12 months to give breathing space to companies trying to secure the necessary financing, renegotiating loans, and attempting to secure other reliefs from banks.In Pakistan, when Prime Minister Imran Khan announced the lockdown last month, there was little resistance initially from the private sector. But, as it prolonged, unrest slowly started brewing among small businesses and shopkeepers who feared that they may not sustain the prolonged closure.To pacify their concerns, the government announced a Rs 1.2 lakh crore rescue package to help businesses and vulnerable people. Separately, the government has decided to allocate Rs 7,500 crore for small and medium enterprises.“We have given Rs 20,000 crore in tax refund to various businessmen so that they have money with them,” Khan said.Pakistan’s central bank has reduced the interest rate from 13.25 to 9 per cent since late March in response to the demand from the private sector. It has also agreed to give concessional loans at 4-5 per cent to businesses.Bangladesh has announced a USD 11.6 billion stimulus package to support the economy, with a primary focus on supporting the manufacturing and service sectors, agriculture and social safety nets.“This support package is equivalent to 3.5 per cent of our GDP,” Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said on Friday.The Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association has said that orders worth about USD 3.2 billion were cancelled or suspended, affecting over 2.3 million workers. The textile sector, a major forex earner, directly employs more than 4.5 million people, mostly women.Sri Lanka’s economy, hit by the COVID-19, is struggling to overcome the crisis.On March 31, the central bank announced a USD 250 million refinancing facility for banks, enabling them to expand their lending capacity by Rs 40,000 crores to businesses, offer loan repayment moratoriums and provide working capital at 4 per cent interest.Sri Lanka is also planning to enter into an agreement with the Reserve Bank of India for a currency swap worth USD 400 million to boost the foreign reserves and ensure financial stability.Nepal’s business sector is expected to suffer a loss of around USD 1.25 billion due to the halting of economic activities during the lockdown, says Umesh Lal Shrestha, Vice President Associate, Federation of Nepalese Chamber of Commerce and Industries.Nepal’s tourism sector is the worst hit by the pandemic. The Hotel Association of Nepal has projected that the hotel business income will decline by 90 per cent in 2020 and has asked the government to adopt special measures to protect the industry.The government has cancelled the ‘Visit Nepal Year 2020’ that aimed to attract two million tourists, in view of the global pandemic. It has announced a relief package which includes a 25 per cent discount on electricity.The Maldives government has announced an emergency 2.5 billion Maldivian rufiyaa (USD 161.8 million) stimulus package to shore up the local economy against the coronavirus pandemic, a local media report said.The stimulus plan includes MVR 1.55 billion (USD 100 million) in emergency loans for businesses to meet short-term working capital needs.The Bank of Maldives has announced a USD 2 million short-term financing facility for the tourism industry, which contributes to the bulk of the island nation’s state revenue and foreign reserves.Bhutan’s economy is having its worst year in the recent history with the GDP growth projected to decline by anywhere between 1-2 per cent depending on how long the pandemic lasts, Kuensel newspaper quoted economic affairs minister Loknath Sharma as saying.The government wants to continue construction of hydropower projects to minimise the impact from COVID-19 and revive the land-locked country’s economy. Electricity constitutes about 13 per cent of Bhutan’s GDP, the report said.Afghanistan is a heavily aid-reliant and import-dependent economy. The coronavirus outbreak has further dented an already troubled economy.The Afghan government has allocated about USD 25 million to deal with the crisis. The World Bank has approved a USD 100.4 million grant to support the war-torn country’s weak economy.

After undertaking a five-day long journey, we reached Ganjam on Saturday evening,” one of the fishermen said.Asked what prompted them to leave Chennai amid the shutdown, another fisherman said, “You know that the number of coronavirus cases has been on the rise in Tamil Nadu. That apart, we would go hungry on some days. Under those circumstances, we were compelled to take the risk.” Cooped up in the boat, the 38 fishermen reached Patisonapur coast near Chikiti in Ganjam.All of them were given food at the local marine police station and then placed under institutional quarantine for 14 days, Chikiti Tehsildar Haraprasad Bhoi said.District Collector Vijay Amrut Kulange said the swab samples of all the 38 have been collected and sent for COVID-19 test.Last week, another batch of 27 fishermen had set sail for Odisha from Chennai, but they were detained by security personnel near Ichhapuram in Andhra Pradesh.Officials in the neighbouring state have quarantined all 27 of them.

26-04-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown may be extended in COVID-19-hit urban areas of Maharashtra||The Maharashtra government may extend the lockdown in the coronavirus-hit urban areas of the state after May 3, an official said on Sunday.The state government is closely monitoring the situation in areas outside the cities of Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Amravati, a senior state official said.“It is the cities where most of the COVID-19 cases are concentrated. If the state has to relax its current stringent lockdown measures, it would be in rural and least affected areas of the state. However, we are looking at the scenario as rural and urban areas are connected,” he said.Despite minimum COVID-19 cases in rural areas of Pune district, the industries there have not resumed because most of their workforce live in cities, he said.We need to work out some plans for every city or district-wise to get things moving. The administration needs more time to come up with solutions, hence it is highly unlikely to lift the lockdown restrictions May 3 onwards in all parts of the state, the official said.State Health Minister Rajesh Tope had on Saturday said the number of COVID-19 cases in the state is not coming down.“The state is yet to reach a stage where the number of coronavirus cases would stabilise. Till then, we cannot take the risk of allowing people to gather at public places in large numbers, Tope said.The minister, however, said the state government would take a collective decision on what to do once the nationwide lockdown ends on May 3.

26-04-2020||New Delhi||Mann ki Baat: PM Modi hails fight against coronavirus as 'public-driven'||Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the 64th edition of his monthly radio programme "Mann Ki Baat" on Sunday hailed India's fight against coronavirus as "public-driven", and urged people not to let down the vigil against the pandemic.Lauding state governments for fighting coronavirus in a spirit of cooperation along with the Centre, Modi said all sections of society and institutions have stepped in with humanitarianism to help maintain social- distancing and render help to people affected by the lockdown."The police personnel have endeared themselves to the public through their outreach to people in distress and distribution of food," Modi said, adding that earlier the police evoked a negative image among people.He also appreciated the role of community leaders in the campaign against the disease.He commiserated that the outbreak of the disease continued during the holy month of Ramzaan compelling caution and social-distancing."This is the time for more intense prayers and spiritualism so that the disease makes itself scarce by the time of upcoming Eid so that the festival is celebrated with gaiety and fervour," Modi said.He said crisis throws up challenges and draws society's attention to even quotidian and routine aspects of life which escape notice during normal times. In this regard, he referred to the bad habit of spitting in public."Although it is common knowledge that the habit is unhygienic, it persisted," Modi said, adding it must now be shunned.He cautioned people not be over-confident in dropping their guard against the disease. He appealed to abide by the dictum "Do gaaj ki doori, bahoot hein jarrori" ( physical distancing of two yards is very important) in social manners and interactions.He said usage of face mask will emerge as a new symbol of civilised society.He also urged people to follow the guidelines of Union Aayush Ministry on food intakes and purificatory rituals which would help boost their bio-immune system.He batted on the virtue of revisiting India's ancient Ayurvedic discipline of medicine and healthcare system. He urged the youth to rediscover and reestablish the prophylactic efficacy of the system through modern and scientific research and theories."We attach credibility to our work only if it is appreciated from offshore quarters," Modi said, attributing this psychological trait of the people to "hundreds of years of their subjugation and slavery"."Due to this people have lost confidence in their selves and abilities," Modi said.He said the world is looking up to India for a remedy against the pandemic. He hoped that just like Yoga, the Ayurvedic system of medicine will be accepted globally in coming times.He said India's supply of medicines to other countries even at a time of the health crisis stemmed from its core civilisational and cultural values of rendering help to others.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mann-ki-baat-pm-modi-hails-fight-against-coronavirus-as-public-driven-76570
26-04-2020||Allahabad||Have onions: Desperate to return home in lockdown, man turns into vegetable trader||How do you travel from Mumbai to Allahabad when there is a lockdown?Buy 25 tonnes of onions, load them onto a truck and hit the road.Desperate to reach his ancestral village on the outskirts of Allahabad, Prem Murti Pandey, who works at Mumbai airport, says he did just that.He spent the first phase of the lockdown in Mumbai, but then it seemed that the restrictions could go on for a while."Actually Azad Nagar in Andheri East, where I live is a very congested area and there is a bigger risk there of coronavirus spreading,” he told PTI.Buses and trains don't run and flights are grounded during this lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus.“I realised that the government had left one way open,” Pandey said, referring to the relaxation on the movement of essential commodities like fruit and vegetable.His plan also involved watermelons—1,300 kilos of them.On April 17, Pandey hired a mini-truck for Pimpalgaon near Nashik, about 200 km away.There, he bought the watermelons for Rs 10,000 and sent the vehicle back to Mumbai with the consignment.He had already struck a deal with a buyer in Mumbai.Next, he studied the Pimpalgaon market for a good deal in onions.Pandey said he bought 25,520 kilos of onions at Rs 9.10 per kg, shelling out Rs 2.32 lakh.He then hired a truck for Rs 77,500 and set off on April 20 with the onions on a 1,200-km journey to Allahabad.He reached there on April 23 and headed straight to the Mundera wholesale market on the outskirts of the city. Unfortunately, he couldn't find anyone who would pay cash for the load.So Pandey took the truck to his village, Kotwa Mubarkpur, a couple of kilometres away. The onions were unloaded there.TP Nagar police post-in-charge Arvind Kumar Singh said Pandey came to Dhoomanganj police station on Friday and a medical team examined him. For now, he has been asked to quarantine himself at home.As for the onions, Pandey still hopes to get a good deal.Right now, the mandi is full of onions from Sagar in Madhya Pradesh. Once the Sagar supply is over, onions from Nashik will find buyers, he said.

We have discussed this with the NIV and will be sending samples for them to compare by extraction of virus genome, Dean of Government Mahatma Gandhi Memorial (MGM) Medical College Jyoti Bindal told PTI.“There are also other factors also for the high fatality rate, like patients turning up at the hospitals late,” she said. “In Indore belt, the testing is confined to coronavirus detection only, and not its type, another doctor said.Jitendra Bhargava, director of the state government-run School of Excellence in Pulmonary Medicine, also shared Bindals concern, saying the high mortality rate in Indore needs to be investigated through viral culture and RNA extraction.It is also true that the mortality rate is high in patients who had comorbidities (presence of additional conditions along with the primary condition) like cardiac and renal problems or diabetes and hypertension besides other immunity-compromisingconditions, he said.“The novel coronavirus is posing a big challenge due to multiple strains. This will make the development of a universal vaccine much more difficult,” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indore-strain-may-be-deadlier-will-send-samples-to-niv-docs-76559

The truck driver moved around socialising and in the process, about 15 people got afflicted," Imtiaz added.Failure to maintain physical distance was the sole cause for the transmission of the coronavirus in these cases, he said in a recorded video message.Vijayawada is one of the major hotspots of coronavirus in the state where over 100 cases have been registered so far.In the last 24 hours alone 25 fresh cases were reported in the city, which is part of the state capital Amaravati.The Collector appealed to people to strictly maintain physical distance to avoid the infection.

After much hardship and discrimination, he eventually became a pilot and went missing while on patrol over the skies above the Western Front in June 1918.His family had to wait nearly three years before they finally knew for certain that he had died, and his grave was located.“For everyone who died in the First World War there was inevitably a partner, parent or child back home who had questions. The heart-breaking letters in CWGC's archive give us an insight into what it was like for those families trying to come to terms with their loss,” said Andrew Fetherston, chief archivist for CWGC.“For everyone who died in the First World War there was inevitably a partner, parent or child back home who had questions. The heart-breaking letters in CWGC's archive give us an insight into what it was like for those families trying to come to terms with their loss,” said Andrew Fetherston, chief archivist for CWGC.“They are stories that show desperate searches for closure, former enemies uniting and, on many occasions, the sad realisation that a missing loved one would always remain so. We are pleased to be able to make this invaluable piece of World War history accessible to a new generation and help deepen our understanding of how the First World War impacted those who were left behind,” he said.Welinkar was one of the 1.3 million Indians who answered the call to fight for the British Empire. Nearly 74,000 never saw their homeland again and are remembered today in cemeteries and memorials throughout the world, including France, Belgium, the Middle East and Africa.Studied at CambridgeWelinkar was a well-educated man studying at Cambridge University. He trained to become an aviator in Middlesex and wished to join the Royal Flying Corps, later known as the Royal Air Force.Upon attempting to enlist, Welinkar encountered the same prejudices as his other fellow Indian airmen and was encouraged to become an air mechanic instead.He was eventually given a commission in the Royal Flying Corps as an Officer. In 1918, he was posted to France and patrolled the skies above the Western Front.In June 1918, Lieutenant Welinkar embarked on what would be his final patrol; he did not return and was reported missing. His fate remained unknown for many months afterwards.The newly-released e-files chronicle the remarkable discovery of Welinkar and his final resting place long after the war had ended. Colonel Barton, who knew Welinkar, acted on behalf of his mother and helped find her missing son. They spoke to former enemies and honed their search to the grave of an unidentified man, buried by the Germans as “Oberleutnant S.C. Wumkar” in a grave in Rouvroy, Belgium.The body was later moved and reinterred in Hangard Communal Cemetery Extension but it wasn't until the vital clue, found in the original German burial records in February 1921, that it was confirmed beyond doubt this grave was of Welinkar's.In May 1921, Colonel Barton, on behalf of Welinkar's mother, requested that a Commission headstone be placed on the grave with the following personal inscription: “To the Honoured Memory of One of the Empire's Bravest Sons”.This records — known as Enquiry Files — are part of a collection of nearly 3,000 files which have never been made available to the public before. Nearly half have been digitised so far, alongside a previously unreleased collection of more than 16,000 photographs held in negatives in the Commission's archive.The files, internally referred to simply as E-Files, contain correspondence between the CWGC and the next of kin of the war dead. They often contain letters, typed memos between Commission staff and on occasion photos, maps and diagrams.CWGC only holds an enquiry file for a small proportion of the 1.7 million people it commemorates from the Commonwealth. Today it is only possible to release those surviving records from the First World War because correspondence with families of Second World War casualties often involves people still alive today and cannot be made public for many years, due to the UK's data protection rules.To date, more than 1,300 of the surviving 3,000 First World War enquiry files have been digitised.The CWGC commemorates the 1.7 million Commonwealth servicemen and women who died during the two World Wars. It also holds and updates an extensive and accessible records archive, while operating over 23,000 locations in more than 150 countries and territories. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-world-war-i-fighter-pilots-moving-story-emerges-in-rare-uk-archive-76553

It has argued that the situation is conducive for such a step because the rise in Covid cases is slow and most cases have turned out to be easily curable. As there are backward and forward linkages to industries that are proposed to be opened up, the supply of raw materials and workforce will continue to remain key impediments, noted PHD Chamber of Commerce President DK Agarwal, unless there is complete opening up in green zones. Industry surveys have pointed out that the multiplicity of authorities and varying instructions have made permits for enterprises, passes for workers and the supply chain movement a mixed experience. Therefore, while the industry supports a continuing ban on all social gatherings and mandatory social distancing, it is crucial for a complete opening up in all green zones and with a 25 per cent workforce in orange zones. According to Agarwal, the manufacturing sector will take three months to recover if there is generous hand-holding by the government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/industry-let-all-units-in-green-zones-run-76314

26-04-2020||Vibha Sharma||Air quality improves worldwide amid lockdown||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, April 25With a recent Covid air quality report showing pollution levels falling to dramatic levels in 10 major cities across the world, including Delhi and Mumbai, during the lockdown, experts are advocating urgent need to maintain the levels even after it is over. They have pitched for achieving the target of 10 per cent blending of biofuel ethanol for vehicular fuel faster.India has a target to achieve 10 per cent blending of ethanol in vehicle fuel by 2021. At present, it is around 4.5 per cent.A sound and clear policy regime in terms of pricing, procurement, and blending can help achieve this target, says UNICA, Brazilian industry association of ethanol producers. “Given the vast experience in the production of sugarcane, India has the potential to become the leader in ethanol production in Asia,” it said.Supporting the thought, Abinash Verma, director general of the Indian Sugar Mills’ Association (ISMA), said, “Ethanol is green fuel, which, when blended with petrol, gives a cleaner environment by reducing carbon emission, increases life of engine, gives better mileage to consumers and reduces net oil import bill, thereby saving foreign exchange and helping sugar mills in the timely payment of cane price to farmers.”“During the lockdown, there were some problems in the supply of ethanol due to lower consumption of petrol, but oil marketing companies (OMC) have re-allocated the quantities to other locations, where supplies are being made smoothly. The cooperation between the OMCs and sugar companies has ensured successful reallocation to newer depots and supplies are happening more or less as per the contracts,” he said.During the supply year 2019-20, the total requirement of ethanol placed by OMCs was 511 crore litres, against which letters of intent were issued for 185.7 crore litres and contracts executed for 159 crore litres. Supplied quantity till April 20, 2020, is 60.2 crore litres and blending achieved is 4.5 per cent, explains the ISMA.A recent report published by Swiss company IQAir, looking at 10 key global cities that normally suffer from high levels of pollution Los Angeles, New York City, London, Madrid, New Delhi, Mumbai, Sao Paulo, Wuhan, Seoul and Rome — found a significant fall in nearly all locations. The report compared measurements from ground-based monitoring stations regarding PM2.5, the small inhalable particles emitted by various sources, including vehicles.Both Delhi and Mumbai experienced their best March air quality on record in 2020 (49.8 µg/m³ and 34.5 µg/m³ PM2.5, respectively). While April 2020 is also on track to be the best April on record, the current trends should continue, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-quality-improves-worldwide-amid-lockdown-76310

With the infected hesitant to seek help, the disease may go underground, as had happened with HIV/AIDS. “What is needed is an intensive campaign like Swachh Bharat... Digital communications on Covid will have to be accompanied by voices of faith leaders and role models whom the community trusts,” reads a ministry note. It speaks of engaging organisations working against stigma in the fields of HIV, TB and leprosy.Health Secretary Preeti Sudan today shared the ministry’s new strategy with top development partners and stressed that messaging should “target the heart”. “Instead of asking people to stay home to stop transmission, we should re-frame the message and ask people to stay indoors to protect themselves and their loved ones,” the new communication package says.Many stakeholders felt the term “social distancing” was also to blame and should be replaced with “physical distancing.”NEW STRATEGY||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-mulls-campaign-to-counter-covid-stigma-76321
