12-11-2021||Kolkata/New Delhi||Cops say three killed during BSF op in Bengal, differs with paramilitary force on fatality count||Three persons, including two Bangladeshi nationals, were killed along the Indo-Bangla border in Cooch Behar district of West Bengal on Friday during an operation by the BSF to thwart an alleged cattle smuggling bid, the police said.The BSF, however, asserted that two Bangladeshis were shot dead at Sitai in Coochbehar district in the early hours of Friday after they attacked a patrol party that stopped them from smuggling cattle, and there was “no clarity on the death of a third person”.The force also said that one of its personnel suffered injuries during the operation and had to be taken to a nearby hospital.The incident has triggered a political slugfest, with the ruling TMC accusing the BSF of letting loose a reign of terror following the enhancement of its jurisdiction from 15 to 50 km by the Centre.The ruling party said that it would move a resolution in the Assembly next week against this decision of the central government.“Three persons were killed during the incident. Two are suspected Bangladeshi nationals, and the third one is an Indian, a resident of the area. As per preliminary investigation, all three died in the course of the same incident,” Sumit Kumar, the Cooch Behar superintendent of police, told PTI.He also said that the Indian national killed during the operation has been identified as Prakash Barman, and his body was found 700 metres away from the border.BSF Additional Director General YB Khurania, however, claimed that only two Bangladeshis were killed during the incident.“As per our reports and preliminary investigation, only two persons, who are Bangladeshis, were killed. We have heard that one more body has been found, but it has no bullet injury. The body was found around 1 km away from the border. There is no clarity on the circumstances under which he died,” Khurania stated.According to the BSF, around 2 am, miscreants from both India and Bangladesh were trying to smuggle cattle by establishing improvised bamboo cantilevers on barbed wires.“Some 60 miscreants assembled on both sides of the border around 2 am. They tried to smuggle cattle by throwing improvised bamboo cantilevers on barbed wires. When a BSF patrol party tried to stop them, it was attacked with stones, iron rods and sticks,” Khurania explained.The Border Security Force (BSF) troops had also asked the miscreants to leave, but they did not pay heed, he said.The border guarding personnel then used non-lethal ammunition to stop their activities, but that too did not deter them, the ADG recounted.“Two BSF constables got surrounded and were badly hurt (by the miscreants). It was then that they opened fire in self-defence. They fired a few rounds in the air. Later it was found that two persons on that side of the border died in the firing,” Khurania said.Hitting out at the BSF, local TMC MLA Udayan Guha claimed that the force continues to “torture” people.“The Centre should control the BSF, otherwise terrible things are waiting to happen. The BSF is not supposed to kill anyone under any circumstance. This killing of an Indian proves the kind of atrocity they perpetrate in the bordering areas. This is why we opposed the enhancement of BSF’s jurisdiction,” the senior TMC leader contended.Echoing him, state parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee described the jurisdiction extension as a “direct attack on the country’s federal structure”.“Under Rule 185 of the Rules of Procedures of Conduct of Business of the House, we will bring in a resolution next week in the Assembly to discuss how enhancing the area of jurisdiction of the BSF is a direct attack on India’s federal structure,” Chatterjee said.The opposition BJP wondered what else the BSF personnel could have done upon being attacked by “lethal weapons”.“The BSF did the right thing by trying to foil attempts of cattle smuggling. The TMC has a habit of politicising every issue and maligning our security forces,” BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar said.The ruling camp in Bengal, which has been opposing the Centre’s decision to enhance the BSF’s area of jurisdiction, has decided to bring in a resolution next week to oppose the decision.The BJP said it would oppose the move.West Bengal would be the second state after Punjab to bring in such a resolution.The Punjab Assembly had on Thursday adopted a resolution against the Centre’s decision, calling it an “insult” to the state police and seeking its withdrawal. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cops-say-three-killed-during-bsf-op-in-bengal-differs-with-paramilitary-force-on-fatality-count-337265

Type 1 diabetes, previously known as juvenile diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin. For nine million people worldwide living with type 1 diabetes, having access to insulin turns the disease into a manageable condition.The most common form of diabetes, type 2, is usually found in adults. It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn’t make enough of it.WHO said for more than 60 million people living with type 2 diabetes, insulin is essential to reduce the risk of kidney failure, blindness and amputation. However, one in two people who need the medicine do not get it.While diabetes is increasing in low and middle-income countries, their consumption of insulin has not kept up with the growing disease burden, WHO said.  It said even though three in four people who have type 2 diabetes live outside of North America and Europe, they account for less than 40 per cent of revenue from insulin sales.“The scientists who discovered insulin 100 years ago refused to profit from their discovery and sold the patent for just one dollar,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the UN agency in his message today.He said that gesture of solidarity has been overtaken by a multi-billion-dollar business that has created vast access gaps.Diabetes is characterised by elevated levels of blood sugar which over time, can cause serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves.Insulin is the “bedrock” of diabetes treatment, and WHO is working with countries and manufacturers to expand access to everyone who needs it.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1-in-2-type-2-diabetics-dont-have-access-to-insulin-who-337264

The officials responded that they will look into the matter, sources said.The MPs also asked them on what basis the number of international flights to be allowed to one specific country is decided as the demand for international travel is on the rise, they said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliamentary-panel-members-suggest-resuming-international-flights-337260

12-11-2021||New Delhi||COP26 new draft makes few compromises, reaffirms Paris goal||As countries raced to finalise a deal after two weeks of climate talks at Glasgow that officially end on Friday, a new draft released by the COP 26 Presidency this morning made certain changes to strike a compromise following a lack of consensus on the document released on Wednesday. Climate activists, however, criticised “watered down commitments to end the use of coal and other fossil fuels”, saying “we don’t believe their pledges and promises”.Officials insisted that language around fossil fuels may be “softened” but the inclusion of a commitment in a final deal will be seen as a “landmark moment”.The final text can be expected later on Friday (UK time) or on Saturday. The Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) officially concluded but past records suggest that negotiations may spill over on Saturday.A deal must be agreed at the key summit for limiting visible effects of global warming across the world On Friday, Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav again reiterated India’s stance. “Negotiations to fight climate change at COP26 have been happening in an atmosphere of cooperation and mutual respect for each other’s ideas, strengths and constraints,” he said.“Each side has put its point across the table emphatically because clear speaking is critical to positive and meaningful outcomes,” he said, reiterating that “wealthy nations that reaped the benefits of early industrialisation by burning fossil fuels and growing their economies for centuries must accommodate the concerns and needs of the economies that need to make the switch to clean and green energy”.The world must start acting together on four issues—temperature, mitigation, finance and responsibility to fight climate change, he said.The new draft reaffirms the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.However, instead of “urging” countries to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions (as necessitated to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022), the new draft uses the word “requests” them to do so, according to reports. There are other changes also. The new draft has removed the part on the need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2100. It states that it “recognises that limiting global warming to 1.5 °C requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions”.Like-Minded Developing Countries, including India and China, had objected to a timeline for revisiting targets. The part about accelerating “phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels” too has been reworded.Yadav said it “time the world unites to honour the commitments made under the Paris Agreement, which set a goal to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels”.He said that India, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has made it clear that it is ready to go the extra mile in combating climate change but “no nation, no matter how big or small, can save the planet alone. In a spirit of cooperation, India has asked the world to do its bit, leading by example in meeting all its environmental obligations globally and nationally”.Prime Minister Modi, who has already committed to India reaching net zero by 2070 and higher NDCs, has demanded one trillion dollars in finance from developed countries, reminding them of their historical responsibilities.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cop26-new-draft-makes-few-compromises-reaffirms-paris-goal-337257
12-11-2021||New Delhi||HCs can’t rely on yet to be filed ‘draft charge sheet’ for quashing FIRs: SC||In a significant verdict, the Supreme Court on Friday held that the High Court cannot rely on a “draft charge-sheet”, which is yet to be filed by the police before a magisterial court, to quash criminal proceedings, saying it is “trite law” that high courts must exercise its inherent powers “sparingly and with circumspection”.The verdict came on a criminal appeal filed against a decision of the Gujarat High Court which on January 8, 2019, had quashed an FIR against several persons, accused of extorting money from the purchasers of a plot at Rajkot.The high court, which had permitted the police to continue with the prosecution of two accused out of a total of nine, had directed the police to file the draft charge sheet before the filing of the same in the magisterial court and after perusal, quashed the FIRs against some of the accused.A bench comprising Justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna held in its verdict that the Gujarat High Court “transgressed the limitations” while exercising its inherent power under section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in quashing the FIR.“We have come to the conclusion that the High Court transgressed the limitations on the exercise of its jurisdiction under Section 482 of the CrPC in quashing the FIR and all consequential proceedings. There has been a clear abuse of the process before the High Court. We accordingly set aside the impugned judgment and order of the High Court dated 8  January 2019 and allow the Criminal Appeals,” the judgement said.Referring to various verdicts, Justice Chandrachud, writing the judgement for the bench, said, “it is trite law that the High Court must exercise its inherent powers under Section 482 (power of high courts to quash criminal cases) sparingly and with circumspection.”  The bench distinguished between two legal positions and said that high courts must take into consideration the material collected during the investigation by the police after the charge sheet is filed before the magisterial court while deciding petitions seeking quashing of FIRs under section 482 of CrPC.“However, the High Court cannot place reliance on a ‘draft charge-sheet which is yet to be placed before the Magistrate to quash the criminal proceedings under Section 482,” the bench said in its 27-page verdict.The verdict, while referring judgements, said the High Court can neither direct an investigating agency to submit the investigation report before it nor can it quash a criminal proceeding under Section 482 relying on such a report when the report has not been submitted to the Magistrate.Referring to the factual position of the case, the top court said the Gujarat High Court bench, in its interim order of May 2, 2016, had allowed the investigation to continue against the accused but directed that the final report cannot be submitted to the Magistrate without its permission.“The direction was not supported by any reasoning whatsoever. Even at the interim stage, the High Court must demonstrate an application of mind and furnish reasons for issuing any interlocutory direction, which is capable of being tested before this Court in an appropriate case.“The interim direction amounted to an unnecessary interference in the investigative process envisaged under the CrPC. The High Court transgressed the scope of the powers conferred upon it by restricting the police from submitting the charge-sheet before the Magistrate and by further perusing the contents of the ‘draft charge-sheet in the proceedings before it,” it said.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hcs-cant-rely-on-yet-to-be-filed-draft-charge-sheet-for-quashing-firs-sc-337253

However, the police had claimed that Manish suffered a head injury after he fell during questioning. He died at the BRD Medical College.Acting on a petition filed by the businessman’s wife Meenakshi Gupta, a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud transferred the probe into the Uttar Pradesh Police to the CBI  and shifted the trial of the case to a CBI special court in the national capital.Six policemen have been charged with murder in the case. The victim’s widow Meenakshi Gupta demanded that the probe be handed over to the CBI and the case be shifted to Delhi to ensure a fair trial without any interference by powerful police personnel. The Supreme Court had on October 29 issued notices to the Centre and the UP Government on her plea.The petitioner’s counsel had pointed out that a press release issued by the office of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had announced that the state government would recommend a CBI probe but nothing has happened.“Till now CBI has not registered the case nor is there any investigation going on by the SIT constituted by the state government. Not even crime scene recreation has been done till now,” petitioner’s counsel had submitted.The petitioner said Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had on September 30 assured her that the case would be handed over to the CBI when she met him along with her family members.An SIT of UP Police had been constituted to investigate the case till it was handed over to the CBI but the central agency was yet to take over the probe, she had pointed out.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kanpur-businessmans-death-supreme-court-transfers-probe-to-cbi-337250

Not too long now, not too long now. We've recognised, of course, the many Indian manufactured vaccines that will be facilitating the return of Indian students and Indian travellers to Australia,’’ said Morrison while speaking at the unveiling of a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Melbourne's Rowville suburb on Friday.Canberra has already approved Covaxin and Covishield for travellers entering Australia.Morrison also pointed out that the government had expanded the definition of immediate family which will benefit those who’ve been separated from their parents for some period of time.Education is a major foreign exchange earner for Australia and it is estimated that out of the over six lakh foreign students enrolled in universities there, one-fifth or well over one lakh students are from India. Besides, about four lakh tourists from India visit Australia every year.Morrison also praised the Indian diaspora for its commitment towards family and expressed admiration for PM Narendra Modi.``We first (PM Modi and Morrison) met here in Melbourne many years ago at the MCG when he came to Australia and I was fortunate enough, I was the Minister for Immigration at the time and I was seated next to him,’’ he recalled.  ``I wasn't expecting because, you know, he's a rock star, but thankful to security that night, he and I had quite a nice and friendly chat, and we've remained friends ever since,’’ he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indian-students-will-soon-be-allowed-to-enter-australia-pm-scott-morrison-337240

12-11-2021||Mumbai||Court extends ex-Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh’s ED custody till Nov 15||A special court here on Friday extended the Enforcement Directorate custody of former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh till November 15 in an alleged money laundering case.Opposing the ED’s demand of extension of custody, Deshmukh’s lawyer questioned why it had not yet arrested dismissed police officer Sachin Waze who is also an accused in the case, and why IPS officer Param Bir Singh was never summoned for probe.The ED had arrested the NCP leader on November 1 under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.A holiday court on November 6 had sent Deshmukh (71) in judicial custody after rejecting the ED’s plea seeking an extension of remand.A day later, the Bombay High Court set aside the order and sent Deshmukh in ED custody till November 12.On Friday, he was produced before special PMLA court judge H S Sathbhai, who extended the custody till November 15.Special public prosecutor Shriram Shirsat told the court that Deshmukh was “evasive and giving vague answers”, so further custody was needed.Sachin Waze had played a key role in collecting bribes from bar owners in Mumbai at Deshmukh’s behest, and the ED was in the process of seeking permission from the concerned court to record Waze’s statement in this case, the prosecutor said.Further custody of Deshmukh was needed to confront him with new evidence which may emerge from Waze’s statement, the ED said.Waze, then assistant police inspector, was arrested in March 2021 following the discovery of an SUV with explosives near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence, and the subsequent death of businessman Mansukh Hiran.Opposing the extension of remand, Deshmukh’s lawyer Vikram Chaudhri said as per the ED, Waze was among main accused, but it never arrested him.“According to them Waze played a key role....They filed a charge sheet without arresting him, he is an accused only on paper,” the lawyer said.He also asked why the ED has not summoned former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who had alleged that Deshmukh, as home minister, had asked Waze to collect Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai.“Why hasn’t his statement been recorded,” Deshmukh’s lawyer asked.The probe agency was  acting with malice, advocate Chaudhary alleged.He also argued that before the high court, both the parties had agreed that the ED should get Deshmukh’s custody for only four days.But the prosecution said that the central agency needed further remand in light of new facts that emerged from interrogation regarding transfers and postings of police officials during Deshmukh’s tenure.The agency has also summoned, on Saturday, a private person who used to handle certain prestigious projects in  Deshmukh’s constituency, and the NCP leader will be confronted with new evidence that might come to light from his questioning, it said.Meanwhile, NCP MP Supriya Sule met Deshmukh during his appearance before the PMLA court on Friday. Sule left after meeting him.The ED filed a money laundering case against Deshmukh after the CBI registered a corruption case based on Param Bir Singh’s accusations.The ED’s case is that Deshmukh, through Waze, collected Rs 4.70 crore from various bars and restaurants in Mumbai, and the money was later transferred to Deshmukh’s educational or charitable trusts through a few Delhi-based firms.His two aides—Kundan Shinde and Sanjeev Palande—were also arrested in the case and are in judicial custody now.

12-11-2021||New Delhi||Amid Rajasthan Cabinet reshuffle buzz, Pilot says party will make a decision ‘very soon’||Amid speculation over Cabinet reshuffle and political appointments in Rajasthan, former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot met Congress chief Sonia Gandhi here on Friday and expressed confidence that a decision on it will be taken “very soon” keeping in mind factors such as credibility, performance, regional balance and caste combination.His nearly hour-long meeting came a day after Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot met Gandhi here and the two leaders are learnt to have discussed the political situation as well as the impending Cabinet reshuffle in the state.Speaking with reporters after meeting Gandhi at her 10 Janpath residence, Pilot said, “Whatever the Congress party wants me to do, I am more than happy to do. In the last 20 years, whatever job has been assigned, I have done it diligently and now also whatever the party decides, what role I should have...I am happy to do it.”     “Extensive discussions took place about Rajasthan, about the government, party organisation, and I put forward my points about the political situation in the state. I am happy that the Congress president is constantly taking interest in Rajasthan and is taking feedback about the work of the government and on the organisation,” Pilot said.He said the committee that Sonia Gandhi had formed to look into the issues raised by him about a year ago has also competed its work, and general secretary organisation K C Venugopal along with AICC general secretary in-charge Ajay Maken have been submitting reports from time to time.“The party high command is also talking about taking action on the points we had put forward last year and I think very soon decisions will be taken on it,” he said.Pilot for long has been demanding that Cabinet expansion should happen and appointments to boards and corporations in the state be made soon. He has been asserting that Congress workers and leaders working closely with him for the party should be given their dues.On being asked that over a year has passed and decision on Cabinet expansion and political appointments has not been taken, he said the decisions were delayed and cited the coronavirus pandemic as a reason.“I think whatever changes that need to be made in the government and organisation, the AICC and the Chief Minister will decide at an appropriate time. But I believe that now less than two years time is left in the next election and we want to fight the next election with full force because there has always been a custom that for five years there is a Congress government in Rajasthan,  and then for five years there is a BJP government,” he said.“This time we want to prepare the organisation very strongly. The workers should get respect, everyone’s participation is important, there should be balance in power, and we should move forward taking all sections of the society along,” he said.Pilot asserted that the tradition of alternating governments of the Congress and the BJP has to be broken.“The Lok Sabha elections will be held in 2024, so it is necessary to repeat the government in Rajasthan. I think that if the government and the organisation work strongly, then surely we will be able to do it,” he said.Pilot also dismissed talk of a divide within the Rajasthan Congress, saying there is no “tera-mera” or groupism which the media has been talking about as “we all belong to the Congress”.“We won on the symbol of the party and this is not the time for ‘tera-mera’, we are moving together in Rajasthan. As I said there are some posts vacant in the government and balance has to be maintained, they have to be filled to set the balance in the government,” he said.The party will take a decision very soon keeping in mind experience, credibility, performance, regional balance and caste combination, he asserted.“I have full confidence, I had a good discussion with Sonia ji.

A complaint from Muslim petitioners objected to negative stereotyping of the community in films.Speaking to The Tribune today, NCM chairperson Iqbal Singh Lalpura said there is currently no provision for the appointment of minority community members to the censor board.“We are proposing that such specific appointments of minority community leaders with the knowledge of the history and philosophy of their respective communities be made to the CBFC to pay adequate attention to sensitivities. We have called I&B Ministry officials for a meeting in December in this respect,” Lalpura said.The NCM discussed the matter on November 10 and called for a detailed report from the CBFC and I&B Ministry about the procedure followed while certifying films and the structure of censor board membership. The Commission has separately written to the Information and Broadcasting Secretary for a response before proceeding further in the matter.Currently, a five-member panel headed by the censor board’s regional director (CBFC has nine regions in India) along with four members drawn from the community certify films. Members are not appointed on the basis of their minority community origins—something the NCM feels is necessary.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/portrayal-of-sikhs-other-minorities-in-films-ncm-seeks-government-response-337224

But it will extend. You will be responsible for border management of this country; 15,000 km of the border, most of it has got peculiar problems of its own," he added."We have got different types of security-related issues which are manned by the police and the central police organisations which are manning these borders," Doval said.According to him, the strength of the police force in the country is 21 lakh and so far 35,480 personnel have sacrificed their lives.The security advisor said India which would usher in a new era as it paces towards 100th year of independence will be known for its many achievements and accomplishments and will be one of the leading nations across the globe.Quintessence of democracy does not lie in the ballot box, but it lies in the laws which are made by the people who are elected by or elected through the electoral process, Doval said.

One of their key proposals was a “Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty” to end the era of coal, gas and oil.The focus of the UNFCCC summit, which addressed carbon market rules, remained climate finance and technology, emission reduction targets, strategies for carbon neutrality and adaptation plans.A draft document of the agreement among countries, including India, underlined that promised climate finance by developed countries is “insufficient to respond to the worsening climate change impacts in developing countries”, urging developed countries to “urgently scale up”, according to reports.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has already committed to India reaching net zero by 2070 and higher NDCs, has demanded one trillion dollars in finance from developed countries, reminding them of their responsibilities.Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav has also specified that COP 26 must aim for “higher global ambition on climate finance and adaptation, along with recognition of parties’ differing responsibilities and developmental challenges faced by developing countries, compounded by the Covid pandemic”.“In a context where developing countries, including BASIC countries, have massively stepped up their climate actions since 2009, it is unacceptable that there is still no matching ambition from developed countries on the enabling means of implementation on climate finance support.” India’s Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change said, speaking on behalf of the BASIC group of countries, comprising Brazil, South Africa, India and China in the beginning of the conference.Developing nations like India, which want implementation of principles of Equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) and recognition of the very different national circumstances of parties, are demanding “time, policy space and support to transition towards a low emissions future for them”.The draft document which “recognises that limiting global warming to 1.5°C by 2100 requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030, relative to the 2010 level, and to net zero around mid-century”, has called upon countries to “accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels”.PM Modi has committed to generating 50 per cent of all electricity consumed by India from renewable energy sources, reducing emissions intensity by close to 45 per cent and reducing 1 billion tonne carbon emissions by 2030. Officials say fossil fuels will continue to be an important part of the energy package of a developing nation like India.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cop26-ends-today-all-eyes-on-final-text-337184

Several strategists, including former US NSA John Bolton, have argued against a condition-less US waiver for India’s S-400 purchases. Things would be clearer nearer to Putin’s visit as India is scheduled to hold a two-plus-two meeting of its Defence and Foreign Ministers with their US counterparts towards the end of this month.Having extended a first-ever $1 billion credit line to Russia, a developed country, talks between Putin and PM Modi are expected to cover Indian economic forays in the Arctic and the Siberian Far East, a vast untapped area with deposits of untapped petroleum, gold, coal and diamonds. With Kishida, talks are likely to touch defence, though in the area of purchases, the Japanese view is that their equipment is expensive for India.

His happiness knew no bounds when he was able to see his old house, although virtually.Shimla connectAll thanks to India Pakistan Heritage Club whose Facebook page is helping people on both sides take a walk down memory lane. The club, founded by one Imram William, is bringing people of the two nations close. Locals are sharing even minute details of houses, schools and graves, which people in Pakistan are so keen to see.“This is an example of how love and affection can cut through barriers of politics, religion and prejudice,” an elated Qureshi says, as he describes the deep connect that the people on the two sides share. Mahrukh of Islamabad says, “My 96-year-old grandmother, wholives in Karachi, loved to see the house where she lived before the Partition. Itwas surreal.” He had sought details of two houses — Rahat Manzil and Ishrat Manzil in Lower Kaithu, which his family owned in Shimla.Mohit Bagga, who helps locate such properties and sends videos to families in Pakistan, says, “It feels great to connect with people who lived with our parents or grandparents here and give them the joy of seeing their ancestral houses.”He has also authored a book, “Unseen Shimla”, containing 400 rare pictures and stories of the city during 1860-1945.Qureshi shared his 1946 childhood pictures and even the class II certificate from St Edward’s School, dated 1941.

Ghulam Nabi Azad, member of G-23, calls it factually wrong and exaggeration. It would therefore be fair to assume that Khursheed is echoing Gandhis,” BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya said as Khurshid’s remarks continued to stir a controversy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ghulam-nabi-azad-on-khurshids-hindutva-isis-comparison-factually-wrong-exaggeration-336840
12-11-2021||New Delhi||Kangana says India attained freedom in 2014 and 1947 was ‘bheek’, triggers outrage||Actor Kangana Ranaut kicked off a firestorm on Thursday for declaring that India attained freedom in 2014, when the Modi-led government came to power, and describing the country’s Independence in 1947 as “bheek”, or alms.The “Manikarnika” actor, known for her provocative and often inflammatory statements, was once again the centre of debate – and ire.While the Aam Aadmi Party submitted an application to the Mumbai Police demanding a case against her for “seditious and inflammatory” comments, politicians across the spectrum, including BJP MP Varun Gandhi, were among the host of social media users and others who reacted with outrage at Ranaut’s comments on Wednesday evening.AAP leader Preeti Sharma Menon said the application requested action under Sections 504, 505 and 124A. “...Hope to see some action. @CPMumbai @DGPMaharashtra,” the party’s national executive member tweeted.Section 504 of the IPC deals with “Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace”, 505 is related to statements to create “public mischief” and 124A deals with sedition.BJP’s Pilibhit MP Varun Gandhi shared a video of Ranaut’s remarks on his Twitter handle to make his point. In a 24-second clip distributed widely, Ranaut says India’s Independence in 1947 was not freedom but “bheek” (alms). “...Of course, azaadi nahi thi vo bheekh thi. Aur jo azaadi mili hai vo 2014 me mili hai (Of course, what we got [in 1947] was not Independence but alms. Independence is what we got in 1947),” she says in the clip from the event organised by a news channel. Some people in the audience can be heard clapping.“It is an anti-national act and must be called out as such. To not do so would be a betrayal of all those who shed blood so that today we may stand tall and free as a nation,” Gandhi said.People can never forget the infinite sacrifices of our freedom movement and the millions of lives lost and families destroyed, he added. Belittling it all in this “shameless manner” cannot be condoned simply as a careless or callous statement, he said.“Sometimes an insult to the sacrifice and penance of Mahatma Gandhi, sometimes showing respect to his killer and now this disdain for the sacrifice of millions of freedom fighters from Shaheed Mangal Pandey to Rani Laxmibai, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and others... “Should I call this kind of thinking madness or treason?”  the Lok Sabha MP added in Hindi on Twitter.The ever combative Ranaut, whose Twitter account has been suspended, hit back on Instagram.“Even though I clearly mentioned 1857 revolution first freedom fight which was curbed... which lead to more atrocities and cruelties from the British and almost a century later freedom was given to us in Gandhi’s begging bowl... Ja aur roo ab,” she said in her Insta stories.Ranaut, who was awarded a Padma Shri earlier this week, also targeted the Congress in her remarks at the show.“If we get freedom as a ‘bheek’, is it even freedom? What the British left behind in the name of Congress... They were the extension of the British...,” she said.Reacting to Ranaut’s remarks, Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said her statement has shown what happens when people who are not deserving of Padma awards are given these honours.“I demand that Kangana Ranaut should make a public apology to all Indians because of her statement, our freedom movement and our freedom fighters’ sacrifice were insulted,” Vallabh said.“The government of India should take back the prestigious Padma award from such a lady who is insulting Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Bhagat Singh, Subhash Chandra Bose, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. If the government is giving her Padma award, it means the government is promoting these kinds of people,” Vallabh said.What Kangana Ranaut has said is “direct treason”, he added.Several other Congress leaders also spoke out.Gaurav Pandhi, the Congress’ digital communications and social media coordinator, said the RSS could never accept the fact that their British masters were forced to leave in 1947.“...Their slavery knew no bounds. No wonder they didn’t hoist the tricolour for half a century. The return of slavery in 2014 was their ‘independence’. Kangana Ranaut is just one of them.”             Salman Soz pointed out in his Twitter post that some people clapped when Ranaut said India’s real independence was in 2014 because 1947 was a charity case. He also recalled the millions who “resisted the British, those who were killed or jailed, those who loved India”.Shiv Sena leader Priyanka Chaturvedi compared Ranaut’s remarks to another BJP member who recently claimed that India has been given freedom as lease for 99 years.Chaturvedi said, “New Ruchi Pathak on the block. From 99 years lease to bheek main mili azaadi. All the blood, sweat and balidan (sacrifice) of our freedom fighters including Jhansi ki Rani dismissed to please the master. The WhatsApp history fans.”    Ranaut may not be on Twitter but her name was trending with many, including historian S Irfan Habib, weighing in with their views.“Shamelessness is abysmal,” Habib wrote.Actor Swara Bhasker, who also shared the video clip on her Twitter page, wondered about those who were heard clapping at Ranaut’s comments.“Who are the idiots who are clapping is what I want to know,” wrote Bhasker, who has worked with Ranaut in the “Tanu Weds Manu” film series and has been a critic of the actor.Others, too, were furious.“Will we now start celebrating a new Independence Day?” asked filmmaker Onir.Without naming the actor badminton player Jwala Gutta wrote, “What do you call a person who only spews venom when she/he opens their mouth!!! Just curious!!”          Lawyer Aman Wadud said it was a well thought out statement from the actor.“Ground being prepared to attack the Constitution. Well-thought-out statement, don’t make the mistake to read this in isolation.”              Stand-up comic Kunal Kamra, a vocal critic of the government, put out this one-line post on Twitter, “Kangana is right India did get independence from common sense & rational thinking in 2014.”  Ranaut has often been in news for her headline grabbling and controversial statements—be it her long-standing fight with filmmaker Karan Johar on nepotism, locking horns with Diljit Dosanjh on the farmers’ protest, her Twitter comments criticising the ruling Shiv Sena government or comparing Mumbai to Pakistan occupied Kashmir.She was given Y-plus category security by the central government after she said she felt unsafe in Mumbai following the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput and also spoke of drug use in a section of the film industry.The actor’s account on Twitter was permanently suspended with the company saying it was done “for repeated violation of Twitter rules”.          The move came after the actor’s vitriolic comments on the post-poll violence in West Bengal. She now posts her videos and messages on Instagram. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kangana-says-india-attained-freedom-in-2014-and-1947-was-bheek-triggers-outrage-336839

The Chinese had undertaken construction in the past several years in the border areas, including in areas it has illegally occupied over decades. India has neither accepted the occupation of territory by China nor accepted its unjustified claims,” MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said when asked about the reports of a Chinese village in a disputed area in Arunachal Pradesh.In response, India has also stepped up border infrastructure including the construction of roads, bridges, etc., which has provided much-needed connectivity to the local population along the border, said Bagchi.“The Government remains committed to the objective of the improvement of livelihood of its citizens, including in Arunachal Pradesh,” said Bagchi while pointing out that the Foreign Office had reacted similarly when the reports about this particular ‘village’ had first appeared in January this year.The Government keeps a constant watch on all developments that have consequences to national security and “takes all the necessary measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity”, Bagchi said.BJP MP from Arunachal Pradesh Tapir Gao had last year stated in Lok Sabha that the “China had entered more than 60-70 km inside the upper Subansiri district if you follow the path along the river. They are constructing a road along the river known locally as the Lensi as it flows in the direction of the Subansiri river”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-not-to-accept-chinese-village-along-lac-says-mea-336820

Ansari, via social media earlier in the day.Also read: Nawab Malik: Fadnavis gave government jobs to criminalsThe Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) arrested Sameer Khan on January 13 in connection with an alleged drug case. He was released on bail on September 27.Fadnavis said this month that "now Malik's son-in-law was found with drugs in his possession", adding that if narcotics are found in the house of a person, "then what will their party be".Challenging Fadnavis' charges, the legal notice says that the chargesheet filed by the NCB does not support even a single allegation levelled by the BJP leader."The panchnama dated 14-01-2021 clearly says that the house was searched and no contraband suspicious substance was found or under his possession. But from which source you obtained such false, frivolous and baseless report is better known to you," said the legal notice.Both Malik and his daughter said that they will wait for Fadnavis' response to the notice and thereafter take the appropriate further legal steps."Fadnavis must tender an unconditional apology and withdraw all his false remarks in this matter, failing which we shall proceed with defamation proceedings as advised by our legal team," Malik said.Earlier, the Nationalist Congress Party Minister had said that NCB Zonal Director Sameer Wankhede had nabbed Sameer Khan in a false case to pre-empt Malik's plans to expose the drug enforcement officer's (Wankhede) fake caste documents which came in his possession over 11 months ago.
