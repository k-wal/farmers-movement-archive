Having a new type of vaccine available will enable people to discuss with their child’s physician the best approach for them to lower their child’s risk of contracting COVID-19, he further said.“The inactivated virus platform has been used for decades in vaccines for the paediatric population and, if authorized, we hope to offer another vaccine option to protect children as young as two years,” he added.A Phase 2/3, open-label, multi-center study was conducted in India from May 2021 to July 2021 to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the whole-virion inactivated Vaccine in healthy volunteers in the 2-18 age group.Covaxin was evaluated in three age groups: 2-6 years, 6-12 years and 12-18 years. All participants received two doses of the vaccine 28 days apart, it said.Covaxin was recently awarded Emergency Use Listing by the World Health Organization.

Officials said the government has been giving rice and wheat to bulk consumers under the OMSS policy to improve availability in the domestic market and check prices.Meanwhile, stating that edible oil prices are showing a declining trend across the country, Pandey said the government has cut the basic duty on crude palm oil, crude soyabean oil, and crude sunflower oil from 2.5 per cent to nil to reign in continuous rise in the cooking oil prices since past one year.  The agri-cess has been brought down from 20 per cent to 7.5 per cent for crude palm oil and 5% for crude soyabean oil and crude sunflower oil. To control prices of edible oils the government has rationalised import duties on palm oil, sunflower oil, and soyabean oil, futures trading in mustard oil on NCDEX has been suspended and stock limits have been imposed, he said.Major edible oils players, including Adani Willmar and Ruchi industries, have cut wholesale prices by Rs 4 -7 per litre prices to give relief to consumers during festival season.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-plans-to-extend-free-ration-plan-beyond-november-30-centre-334333
05-11-2021||New Delhi||BJP national executive meets on Sunday as party gears up for 5 state polls||The recent bypoll results, which were a setback for the BJP in some states, have added new dimension to the party’s national executive meeting on Sunday as its top brass is likely to cast a fresh look at its affairs in places like West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan while deliberating its strategy for the upcoming assembly polls.All “important” issues will be up for deliberations, a BJP leader said of the meeting, adding the party is also likely to laud the central government for its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the vaccination drive, and hail Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his development initiatives and successful foreign visits.The robust revival in economic activities with the record GST collection last month following a slump due to the pandemic is also likely to come up for deliberation at the meeting.However, it is the bypoll results in three Lok Sabha and 29 assembly seats spread across 13 states and a union territory that may weigh on the minds of the party leadership as it meets for the first time in a physical meeting following the pandemic’s outbreak last year.Known for laying great store by every popular verdict, however materially insignificant it may be in the broader context, the BJP leadership may review the party’s affairs in West Bengal, where its fortunes have been sliding since the high of the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, and Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan, two states where the Congress has put up an impressive performance.The BJP is in power in Himachal and as such the Congress’s complete sweep of the bypolls in a Lok Sabha and three assembly seats there has caused concerns in the party.The party has, however, registered a strong show in Assam, where it won all five seats with its ally, and Madhya Pradesh, where it won the lone Lok Sabha and two of the three assembly seats at stake.A party leader said price rise may have been a factor and added that the Modi government has done the course correction by slashing the petrol and diesel prices followed by the BJP-ruled states giving further relief to people by slashing the Value Added Tax on the fuel prices.That the opposition-ruled states have not done so may come handy for the BJP leaders in attacking the rivals when they meet.Modi is likely to deliver the valedictory address at the national executive meeting in which he is expected to shape the party’s stand on a variety of key issues and set the tone for its preparedness as it gears up for the assembly polls early next year in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur.BJP president JP Nadda will deliver the inaugural address. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-national-executive-meets-on-sunday-as-party-gears-up-for-5-state-polls-334326

NSA Ajit Doval will chair the meeting.Two earlier meetings in this format have been held in Iran in September 2018 and December 2019. The third meeting in India could not be held earlier due to the pandemic.There has been an overwhelming response to India’s invitation. Central Asian countries as well as Russia and Iran have confirmed participation, said sources.This is the first time that all Central Asian countries, not just Afghanistan’s immediate land neighbours, are participating in this format. The enthusiastic response is a manifestation of the importance attached to India’s role in regional efforts to promote peace and security in Afghanistan, claimed the sources while terming Pakistan’s abstention as unfortunate.Invitations have been extended to China, too, and formal responses are awaited. The sources said they have learnt of Pakistan’s unwillingness to attend. “Pakistan’s decision is unfortunate, but not surprising. It reflects its mindset of viewing Afghanistan as its protectorate. Pakistan has not attended the previous meetings of this format. Its media comments against India are an unsuccessful attempt to deflect attention from its pernicious role in Afghanistan,” said the sources.The high-level participation in next week’s meeting hosted by India reflects the widespread and growing concern of regional countries about the situation in Afghanistan and their desire to consult and coordinate with each other. India has an important role to play in this process, they asserted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-host-regional-national-security-adviser-level-meet-on-afghanistan-334293

I think it is enough. Maybe for high court judges, it should be increased to 65, certainly not beyond that. We too would like to rest,” the SC judge said.He added, “I think it’s time also that we recognize that younger people also have a role. With youth, comes fresh ideas. They bring to the table a freshness of inquiry, a fullness of information about contemporary events, which we, old folks, are not only insulated but resistant to.” —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/weather-outside-not-good-at-all-says-sc-judge-rues-spike-in-air-pollution-334285
05-11-2021||New Delhi||Petrol price further cut by Rs 8, diesel by Rs 9 in BJP-ruled states||Petrol price has been further reduced by as much as Rs 8.7 per litre and diesel by Rs 9.52 in BJP ruled states and UTs — from Ladakh to Puducherry — as they matched the central government’s announcement of a cut in excise duty with slashing of local sales tax (VAT) rates.Buckling under pressure, the Union government had on Wednesday cut excise duty on petrol by Rs 5 per litre and that on diesel by Rs 10 a litre to give reprieve to consumers battered by record-high retail fuel prices.This announcement was matched by 22 states and Union Territories cutting VAT rates in different proportions.This has led to BJP and its partner ruled states witnessing steeper reductions in petrol and diesel prices in comparison to Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal and other states that are governed by other political parties, according to a price chart of different locations prepared by state-owned oil firms.The additional reduction, on top of the excise duty cut, is the lowest in Uttarakhand because of lower duty cuts and the highest in UT of Ladakh. On petrol, the price reduction over-and-above excise reduction ranges from Rs 1.97 per litre in the case of Uttarakhand to Rs 8.70 in the case of UT of Ladakh.For diesel, the additional reduction warranted by VAT cuts, ranging from Rs 17.5 a litre in Uttarakhand to Rs 9.52 in the case of Ladakh.The states and UTs that extended additional VAT benefits are Karnataka, Puducherry, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura, Assam, Sikkim, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Goa, Gujarat, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu, Chandigarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Ladakh.Karnataka saw Rs 8.62 a litre cut in petrol price due to VAT reduction and Rs 9.40 in diesel rates, while Madhya Pradesh gave its citizens an additional Rs 6.89 price relief on petrol and Rs 6.96 on diesel. Uttar Pradesh lowered VAT on petrol by Rs 6.96 and diesel by Rs 2.04 a litre.States that have so far not lowered VAT include Congress and its allies ruled Rajasthan, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu. AAP-ruled Delhi, TMC-governed West Bengal, Left-ruled Kerala, BJD-governed Odisha, TRS-led Telengana and YSR Congress-ruled Andhra Pradesh.Wednesday’s excise duty cut had translated into a reduction in the price of petrol in the range of Rs 5.7 to Rs 6.35 per litre across the country and diesel rates by Rs 11.16 to Rs 12.88.Since states charge local sales tax or VAT not just on the base price but also on the excise duty levied by the Centre, the total incidence of price reduction was higher than Rs 5 a litre cut in excise duty on petrol and Rs 10 per litre cut in diesel. The reduction was larger in states with higher VAT.In Delhi, the reduction in petrol price was Rs 6.07 per litre, and that on diesel was Rs 11.75, according to the price chart.After duty changes, the costliest petrol is sold in Rajasthan at Rs 111.10 per litre (Jaipur), followed by Mumbai (Rs 109.98) and Andhra Pradesh (Rs 109.05). The fuel is below Rs 100-a-litre-mark in most BJP ruled states baring Karnataka (Rs 100.58), Bihar (Rs 105.90), Madhya Pradesh (Rs 107.23) and Ladakh (Rs 102.99).Similarly, the costliest diesel is now sold in Rajasthan at Rs 95.71 a litre (Jaipur), followed by Andhra Pradesh (Rs 95.18) and Mumbai (Rs 94.14).The cheapest diesel is in Mizoram at Rs 79.55 a litre.Petrol costs Rs 103.97 per litre in Delhi, and diesel is sold for Rs 86.67 per litre.VAT rates differ from state to state, leading to differential rates of fuel.The excise duty cut announced on Wednesday night was the highest-ever reduction in excise duty. It rolls back a part of the Rs 13 and Rs 16 per litre increase in taxes on petrol and diesel effected between March 2020 and May 2020 to avoid passing on to consumers the sharp fall in international oil prices at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.That hike in excise duty had taken central taxes on petrol to their highest level of Rs 32.9 per litre and that on diesel to Rs 31.8 a litre. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/petrol-price-further-cut-by-rs-8-diesel-by-rs-9-in-bjp-ruled-states-334282

05-11-2021||New Delhi||Left leaders stumped by BJP and allies not getting decimated in bypolls||The leaders of Left parties are stumped by the BJP and its allies not getting decimated in the just concluded bypolls which were held under the shadow of the farmers’ agitation against the three Central agriculture laws.Sources say Left leaders of the states where bypolls were held, will meet soon to assess the results.Subsequently, their respective party headquarters will be apprised of the outcome of the meetings to help them prepare joint strategies to checkmate the BJP.The Left parties had huge expectation from the farmers’ agitation in trumping the BJP electorally as a good number of the farmers’ unions are Left-leaning.These parties have been supporting the protest full-on.The bypolls were held for 29 assembly and three Lok Sabha constituencies. The outcome has been a mixed result.A Left leader said that BJP nominee Gobind Kanda gave a run for the money to the winning INLD candidate Abhay Singh Chautala, son of former Chief Minister Om Prakash Chautala, in rural Ellenabad assembly seat In Haryana. The Congress came a distant third.The victory margin of Chautala, who had resigned from the seat expressing solidarity to farmers’ demand for scrapping of the farm laws which necessitated the bypoll, had reduced while retaining the seat.The Congress supported the farmers’ protests upfront, too, but it has not paid dividends to it in Ellenabad.  The result in Ellenabad has caused uneasiness among Left parties because Haryana, along with Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh, was the nerve centre of the farmers’ protest.BKU leader Rakesh Tikait, who has become the face of the farmers’ protest, had declared open support to INLD nominee. He and other farmer leaders had campaigned against the BJP nominee.In West Bengal, although the ruling TMC won all the four assembly constituencies, the BJP did better than combined Left and the Congress.A leader related to West Bengal said there was expectation that the Left would be better off than the BJP especially because of the farmers’ protest, but this was not to be.In Bihar, the JD(U), an ally of the BJP, trumped its opponents, including RJD while winning the two seats where bypolls were held.The silver lining for the Congress, though, is that it handed humiliating defeat to the ruling BJP in Himachal Pradesh. But, on the contrary, the state had hardly stood out for farmers’ protest.The thinking in non-BJP parties is that the BJP and the Narendra Modi government at the Centre are facing the greatest political challenge since 2014 due to the farmers’ protest.Hence, if it has not been overwhelmed by its opponents in bypolls, there was a reason for them to be concerned.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/left-leaders-stumped-by-bjp-and-allies-not-getting-decimated-in-bypolls-334270

Bodies are being handed over to bereaved family members after post mortem examinations."  Those undergoing treatment included a 70-year-old person who lost his eyesight on Friday morning- a common side-effect of consumption of illicit liquor. The DIG said, "Two officials - Manish Sharma, the in-charge of Nautan Police Station, and a village chowkidar- have been placed under suspension for their laxity. One of the alleged sellers has died, while another – Munna Ram – is absconding and a search has been launched to nab him."  However, according to sources in the local administration, two others, who had died after consuming liquor, were cremated by their family members before word spread about the hooch tragedy. In Gopalganj, District Magistrate Nawal Kishore Chaudhary confirmed 17 deaths in the Mohammedpur Police Station area but asserted that only 11 of these could be blamed on consumption of spurious liquor. “Three persons – residents of a village under the Mohammadpur Police Station limits – had been cremated by family members before post mortem. "Family members of another three deceased refused post-mortem claiming that deaths were on account of natural causes”, he said. Superintendent of Police Anand Kumar said Ranjan Kumar, the in-charge of Mohammadpur Police Station, and a chowkidar have been suspended, and three alleged sellers – Chhote Lal Sah, Jitendra Sah and Ram Pravesh Sah – have been arrested. He also claimed that raids conducted at various places in the area has led to recovery of 100 litres of spurious liquor. Meanwhile, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, in Patna, vowed stern action against those found responsible for the tragic deaths but expressed dismay over people continuing to consume a “galat cheez” (wrong thing) during festivals. Replying to questions from reporters outside the assembly, where he went to attend swearing-in of two newly elected MLAs of his JD(U), the chief minister said, “I will conduct an in-depth review of the enforcement of prohibition in the state. But, it appears that we need another extensive campaign to spread awareness about the ill-effects of drinking”. Sale and consumption of alcohol were completely banned in the state in April, 2016. Meanwhile, political sparring is carrying on over the matter. Leader of the opposition Tejashwi Yadav came out with tweets, attacking Kumar over the hooch deaths and accusing those in his government, including a BJP minister, of being involved in sale of illicit liquor. BJP state spokesperson NiKhil Anand hit back, asserting that it was the opposition party which was working hand in glove with the illicit liquor traders but had the temerity to come out with “baseless allegations” against the ruling dispensation. The latest hooch tragedy comes less than a month after close to 10 people died due to consumption spurious liquor in Muzaffarpur district.

India's significant investment in renewables and climate change adaptation policies suggest it is well positioned to take further steps to reach this new target," Rice said responding to a question."We are heartened by India's focus on achieving progress in the current decade given the urgent need for global mitigation action. And as with other countries, it will be important to follow through with specific actions to contain emissions over the current decade," he added.At the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made significant announcements, including the bold pledge of India becoming net zero by 2070.Besides the net zero target, Modi also raised India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of achieving 450 giga watt non-fossil energy capacity to 500 giga watt by 2030."India will increase its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 giga watt by 2030; India will fulfil 50 per cent of its energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2030.

He has a son and a daughter, the relative said.In March this year, the MLA had contracted the coronavirus infection when the budget session of the Chhattisgarh Assembly was under way.The four-time MLA, who belonged to the erstwhile royal family of Khairagarh, was first elected as legislator in 1995 on a Congress ticket from Khairagarh and the second time in 1998, in the then undivided Madhya Pradesh.After the formation of Chhattisgarh in 2000, he was elected for the third time in 2003.In 2007, he was elected to the Lok Sabha from Rajnandgaon parliamentary seat.He quit the Congress in December 2017, claiming that he was forced to do so as he was "neglected" and "sidelined" by senior party colleagues.In February 2018, he joined former chief minister Ajit Jogi's party JCC (J), months ahead of the Assembly election.He contested the Assembly election on the JCC (J) ticket and became MLA for the fourth time from Khairagarh.In last year's Marwahi bypoll, necessitated due to the death of sitting legislator Ajit Jogi, Devvrat Singh supported the ruling Congress's nominee, who won the election.

05-11-2021||Washington||China continues ‘incremental and tactical actions’ to press territorial claims with India, says Pentagon||China has continued "taking incremental and tactical actions" to press its claims at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India and has unsuccessfully sought to prevent New Delhi from deepening its relationship with the United States, the Pentagon has said in a report."The PRC (People's Republic of China) seeks to prevent border tensions from causing India to partner more closely with the United States. PRC officials have warned US officials not to interfere with the PRC's relationship with India," the Department of Defence told the US Congress on Wednesday.The Pentagon regularly reports to the Congress on the Indo-Chinese military standoff in eastern Ladakh. The Department of Defence has categorically said China is indulging in aggressive and coercive behaviour with its neighbours, India in particular.Beginning in May 2020, the Chinese Army launched incursions into customarily Indian-controlled territory across the border and has concentrated troops at several standoff locations along the LAC, the Pentagon said.As of June 2021, China and India continue to maintain large-scale deployments along the LAC and make preparations to sustain these forces while disengagement negotiations have made limited progress.In addition, a substantial reserve force from the Tibet and Xinjiang Military Districts was deployed to the interior of Western China to provide a rapid response.The June 2020 skirmish in Galwan Valley, which led to the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers, marked the first loss of life on the LAC since 1975.In February 2021, China's Central Military Commission (CMC) announced posthumous awards for four PLA soldiers, though the total number of Chinese casualties remained unknown, it said.The Pentagon said despite the ongoing diplomatic and military dialogues to reduce border tensions, China had continued "taking incremental and tactical actions" to press its claims at the LAC.In 2020, China built a large 100-home civilian village inside disputed territory between the Chinese Tibet Autonomous Region and India's Arunachal Pradesh state in the eastern sector of the LAC."These and other infrastructure development efforts along India-China border have been a source of consternation in the Indian government and media," the Pentagon said.In contrast, China has attempted to blame India for provoking the standoff through India's increased infrastructure development near the LAC.Asserting that its deployments to the LAC were in response to Indian provocation, Beijing has refused to withdraw forces till India's forces have withdrawn behind the Chinese version of the LAC and ceased infrastructure improvements in the area, the Pentagon said.As the standoff continues, China has expressed its aim to prevent the standoff from worsening into a wider military conflict, the report said, adding that Beijing has voiced its intent to return bilateral relations with New Delhi to a state of economic and diplomatic cooperation it had perceived to be improving since the 2017 Doklam standoff.China's state-controlled media forcefully asserted China's intent to refuse any territorial concessions demanded by India.Chinese officials, through official statements and state media, had also sought unsuccessfully to prevent India from deepening its relationship with the United States during and subsequent to the standoff, while accusing India of being a mere “instrument” of US policy in the region, it said.
