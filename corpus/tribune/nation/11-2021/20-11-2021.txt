We aim to make India a hub of world cinema, a destination for film festivals and a most favoured place for filmmakers. After all, India is a land of storytellers, rich in resources. Today the world wants to hear the story of India."The film and entertainment industry has a huge employment opportunity as we leapfrog into the digital era of content, filmmaking and not to forget, film archiving for the future generation," he said.The union minister asserted that the media and entertainment sector builds on three unique propositions that India offers -- abundant and competent labour, ever growing consumption expenditure and a diverse culture and linguistic heritage."We have these powered by the extensive footprint of mobile, internet and industrialisation. With this unique combination of connectivity, culture and commerce, India is poised to be at the epicentre of the cinematic ecosystem," he added.Sawant said the coastal state is working towards providing single window clearance for film shooting in Goa."This will allow Goa to become a hub of shooting for filmmakers," he added.He also announced that Goa will soon become the first state to have its entire population fully vaccinated against COVID-19.The CM revealed that the state is discussing with the centre to make a film city in Goa."We are making efforts to establish a film city and a film institute here so that there is a talent pool, whether in film editing, photography, cinematography or direction, available for movies," he said.The ceremony saw veteran actor-politician Hema Malini getting the Indian Personality of the Year award. She was felicitated by Thakur, Sawant and Minister of State Information and Broadcasting Dr L Murugan."So much good work is happening here for our film industry. It is amazing to see young talented filmmakers get involved with IFFI. I believe this should continue," Malini said.Whereas globally renowned filmmakers Martin Scorsese and Istvan Szabo were honoured with the first-ever Satyajit Ray Lifetime Achievement award."I am honoured to receive such an award named after one of the truly great filmmakers of all time and my inspiration, Satyajit Ray," Scorsese said in a pre-recorded video message.The multiple Academy Award-winning filmmaker, best known for his films like "Goodfellas", "Taxi Driver", "Raging Bull", "The Departed" and "Shutter Island", said he has returned to Ray's cinema time and again and every time it has been a "new experience"."Watching 'Pather Panchali' was a revelatory experience for me and it opened a whole new world for me," he added.Szabo, the Hungarian auteur known for making 1981 feature film "Mephisto" that won the best foreign language film Oscar, recalled the "profound" discussion he had with Ray many years ago."I met Mr Ray many years ago in Madras. He invited my wife and me for dinner, which was very excellent. We had a fantastic discussion about his films and about our profession -- filmmaking. It was a profound discussion which I will never forget. And I can never forget his charismatic face and his spirit," the 83-year-old director said.The hosts also welcomed 75 youngsters who were selected for the festival's 75 Creative Minds initiative."For the first time ever, we are recognising and mentoring 75 young creative minds of tomorrow as we mark 75 years of Independence. They have been chosen by the grand jury after a meticulous screening process. They are seated among us and will be attending masterclasses by the cinema icons," Thakur said.Adding some Bollywood glamour to the cinema gala, Ranveer performed on the hit Hindi tracks from the last five decades like "Ye Desh Hai Vir Jawano Ka", "Zindagi Ek Safar", "Pyaar Hume Kis Mod Par Le Aaya" and many others.Shraddha showcased the power of Indian women with her performance on motivational songs like "Kar Har Maidan Fateh" and "Badal pe paon hain".Her performance was followed by an act by star-couple Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia D'Souza, who promoted regional cinema by performing on Marathi songs.Salman's high-octane act on his hit songs from movies "Dabangg", "Sultan", "Bharat" and "Tiger Zinda Hai" brought an end to the opening ceremony.IFFI, which will run till November 28, will feature 148 films from about 73 countries in the International Section. The festival will have about 12 world premieres, about seven international premieres, 26 Asia premieres and about 64 India premieres.An array of world-renowned filmmakers, actors, technicians, critics, academicians and film enthusiasts will come together to celebrate cinema and the art of filmmaking through various film screenings, presentations, masterclasses, panel discussions and seminars.Spanish filmmaker Carlos Saura's "The King of All the World" is the opening film for the 52nd edition, while Asghar Farhadi's "A Hero", which won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, will close the festival.

In the video, the cricketer-turned-politician was heard saying Khan is like a “bada bhai” (elder brother) to him and that he loves him a lot.Earlier in the day, Sidhu offered prayers at the Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara in Pakistan and stressed on the “opening of a new friendship chapter” and trade between the two countries.

20-11-2021||New Delhi||Centre writes to Ladakh, Puducherry over rising weekly Covid cases||Witnessing a rise in weekly Covid cases, testing and positivity rate, the Union Health Ministry has written to Puducherry and Ladakh urging them to take pre-emptive action to gain control over the situation.Earlier, the ministry had asked state governments of Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir to undertake a review and enhance testing in view of rising cases of Covid-19 and weekly positivity rates.In a letter to the principal secretary (Health) of Ladakh this week, Additional Secretary in the Union Health Ministry Arti Ahuja said the Union Territory has reported a 362 per cent increase in weekly new cases from 34 cases in the week ending on October 27 to 157 cases in the week ending on November 17.It is also worrying to note that the Union Territory has exhibited an increase of more than 156 per cent in weekly positivity from 1.5 per cent in the week ending on October 26 to 3.9 per cent in the week ending on November 16.“Further, worrying trends with regards to weekly cases, testing and positivity rate have been observed in various districts. Increase in number of weekly new cases: Leh district has exhibited a significant increase of more than 362 per cent in weekly new cases from 35 in the week ending on October 27 to 139 in the week ending on November 17. This is especially concerning given the geographical expanse of the district,” Ahuja said.Leh has also recorded a 143 per cent increase in weekly positivity rate from 1.98 per cent in the week ending on October 26 to 4.81 per cent in the week ending on November 16.Although there has been an increasing trend of weekly tests conducted in the Union Territory, a decrease has been noted in the proportion of RT-PCR testing. Kargil (26.8 per cent) has recorded less than the government mandate of 70 per cent RT PCR contribution.The officer advised to conduct a greater number of RT-PCR tests to capture a more accurate picture of the Covid public health situation in the Union Territory.“It has been observed that cases surge exponentially where basic public health strategy (Testing. Tracking. Treatment, Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination) is not followed rigorously. The current trends of decrease in RT-PCR testing, increase in new cases and case positivity if left unchecked may lead to a situation where there is severe strain on the health infrastructure and health workforce,” Ahuja said in the letter.In addition to strict compliance with basic health strategy, the Union Territory has been asked to ensure routine submission of RT-PCR positive samples from international travelers as well as from community for genomic analysis at the designated INSACOG network laboratory as per laid down protocols.Additionally, positive samples from suspected vaccine breakthrough infections, super-spreader events and clusters of cases with high mortality and/or morbidity must also be sent for genomic analysis, the letter said.A rapid response team must be constituted according to the INSACOG guidelines for detailed investigation of mutations reported through the INSACOG.“As presently various events such as marriages and festive celebrations are taking place, it is critical to maintain sufficient level of testing across all districts to ensure timely detection of cases,” Ajuha said in the letter.States must emphasise the importance of Covid safe festivities and ensure strict adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour along with prioritising the second dose coverage of eligible beneficiaries, she said.“Regular review of Covid-19 cases and deaths must also be undertaken, and necessary corrective measures be promptly communicated to the field teams. Lastly, it should also be ensured that the dist consistency in data up-dation on the Covid-19 portal,” the letter said.On October 30, Ahuja had also written to West Bengal and Assam expressing concern over the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases.Ahuja in her letter to the Puducherry principal secretary (health) said it has reported 41.7 per cent increase in weekly new cases from 168 cases in the week ending on November 9 to 238 cases in the week ending on November 16.Worrying trends with regards to weekly cases and positivity rate have been observed in various districts of the state, she said.Three districts out of four have reported an increase in weekly new cases.Karaikal district has exhibited an increase of more than 29 per cent in weekly new cases from 49 in the week ending on November 9 to 63 in the week ending on November 16, Pondicherry district has exhibited an increase of more than 30 per cent in weekly new cases from 84 in the week ending on November 9 to 109 cases reported in the week ending on November 16. Yanam shows a continuous increase of new cases from the past four weeks, 85 per cent new cases from 13 in the week ending on November 9 to 24 cases reported in the week ending on November 16.Although there has been an increasing trend in weekly tests conducted, there is a disproportion noted in Antigen and RT-PCR testing.“All four districts Karaikal (27.45 per cent), Mahe (1.59 per cent), Pondicherry (32.57 per cent) and Yanam (0.59 per cent) have less RT-PCR contribution than the government mandate of 70 per cent RT PCR contribution.

Pilgrims who booked tickets online were being allowed for darshan of Lord Venkateswara.In Kadiri town in Anantapuramu district, a building under construction collapsed due to incessant rain and fell on an adjoining one, killing at least five persons, including two children.Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy conducted an aerial survey in Kadapa, Anantapuramu and Chittoor districts to assess the damage.SPS Nellore district is also bearing the brunt as a record flood in Pennar river left many villages marooned on Saturday.Thousands of people have been shifted to relief camps in the district from the flood-hit areas, official sources said.Teams of NDRF and SDRF have been deployed in the districts for rescue and relief operations.In Tamil Nadu, parts of Villupuram and Cuddalore districts suffered inundation after the Thenpennai river was in spate.Around 15,000 people from the two districts have been lodged in relief camps while 18,500 hectares of farm lands were subrmerged in Villupuram due to the overflowing Thenpennai river.“In the last 24 hours, three people have been killed in Krishnagiri and Tiruvannamalai districts,” Minister for Revenue and Disaster Management, KKSSR Ramchandran said, adding 368 heads of cattle had also perished.While 65,000 cusecs of water was being released from Mettur Dam, which caters to the Cauvery delta districts, the quantum at Poondi, one of the reservoirs meeting Chennai’s drinking water needs, was 29,684 cusecs, he said.Fire and Rescue Services personnel evacuated standed people in wtaer-logged areas in Cuddalore, Villupuram and Ranipet districts using boats.Over 1,900 such affected persons in the three districts, besides Kancheepuram, Kallakurichi, Chengalpet and Vellore have been rescued in the past two days, officials said.With the Kosasthalai river in Tiruvallur overflowing and leading to flooding in Manali near Chennai, Chief Minister M K Stalin visited the affected areas and directed officials concerned to expedite relief work.In Kerala, though heavy rains lashed several parts of Pathanamthitta district, posing a threat to Sabarimala pilgrimage last night, devotees were permitted to trek the holy hills again in batches on Saturday.Two shutters of the Pamba dam were raised by the authorities after its water level rose.Temple authorities here said on Saturday that as no major rains were reported, especially in the areas of the hill temple, normalcy returned to Sabarimala today.District Collector Divya S Iyer granted permission to allow the devotees stranded in Nilackal, following last night’s prohibition order, to trek to Sabarimala hills and offer prayers at the shrine in a phased manner ensuring their safety.Authorities urged those living on the river banks, Sabarimala devotees and the general public to take necessary precaution in the wake of the opening of two shutters of the Pamba dam.The Puducherry union territory was pounded by heavy rains after a respite on Friday.Chief Minister N Rangasamy said the government was seeking interim relief from the Centre, but did not elaborate on the quantum of relief.The UT had registered around 16 cm rainfall on Saturday, official sources daid.

20-11-2021||New Delhi||Air pollution: Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan writes open letter to SC judges||Ahead of Wednesday’s hearing on the issue of air pollution in Delhi-NCR, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan has written an open letter to Supreme Court judges demanding a full-fledged hearing on air pollution, saying it’s no longer a Winter’s Tale.“Air Pollution is not a political issue because it carries no religion, caste or colour. It claims all, and yet leaves no trace that could be profitable at the hustings,” Sankaranarayanan wrote while appreciating the top court’s efforts since 1980s towards protection of environment.A three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana had on November 17 refrained from passing any harsh directives and deferred the hearing on the issue to November 24 after the Centre said the condition would improve after Sunday.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had urged the top court to postpone harsher steps in view of the Met Department’s assessment that the situation would improve after November 21.Sankaranarayanan—who along with some other parents had filed a PIL on air pollution issue in the Supreme Court on behalf of children in 2015—said they were accused of being anti-Hindu.“We were accused of being anti-hindu and social media was used to direct obnoxious curses at our children. We were also besieged by concerned well-wishers to back off. After all, this is not our job – we are not trained environmentalists, or medical doctors or scientific experts, or policy makers. So withdraw, they counselled. Unfortunately, we can’t. Because we are all of the above—for our children,” he wrote.He urged the top court “to consider is the fact that these petitions concern the single largest issue that face a quarter of India’s population today. The factors that contribute to air pollution are multifarious, the parties many, and almost all States are affected”.Citing the Global Burden of Disease reports, he wrote: “A child dies every 3 minutes in India because of inhaling toxic pollutants in the air. More than 1 crore children in the last quarter of a century did not live past their fifth year because of Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (LRI) occasioned by air pollution”.Further, quoting a 2020 Lancet Report, he pointed out “that 1.7 million deaths of Indians were due to the poison that was being breathed, which was estimated to be a Rs2,60,000 crore loss to the economy (about 1.5% of the GDP). These numbers dwarf those of COVID, and yet, the energies of all our institutions have been channelled towards the tiny virus”.He said: “A few weeks from the Court’s calendar would be a small price to pay if we can shepherd our children to a better tomorrow. Till then, we can hold our breath”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-pollution-senior-advocate-gopal-sankaranarayanan-writes-open-letter-to-sc-judges-340738
20-11-2021||Mumbai||Antilia bomb scare case: Court grants bail to bookie Naresh Gaur then stays order after NIA objects||A special NIA court here on Saturday granted bail to Naresh Gaur, a cricket bookie, arrested for his alleged role in the Antilia bomb scare and businessman Mansukh Hiran murder case but stayed the order after the prosecution prayed that they wanted to challenge it before a higher court. Gaur was the first accused in the case, in which dismissed Mumbai police officer Sachin Waze is the prime accused, to be granted bail. The court stayed the bail order for 25 days after the prosecution requested that they wanted to challenge it before a higher court. Gaur’s bail plea was allowed by special judge A T Wankhede. The NIA, citing a Bombay High Court order, submitted that the special court has powers to stay its order. The defence strongly opposed the application and submitted that there is no such provision.However, the special judge ruled that this (special NIA) court can exercise the power to stay its order for a few days under relevant provisions of the CrPC.Considering the request of the NIA and that the probe agency wants to assail the order of this court, Gaur’s bail order passed has to be stayed for further 25 days, the court said.Gaur, in his plea filed through advocate Aniket Nikam, had said procuring SIM cards for Sachin Waze was the only role attributed to him. In the plea, he claimed to be “innocent” and alleged that he was “falsely implicated” in the case.He claimed that he has no connection with the crime in question.“Merely based on surmises and conjectures, the applicant has been roped in as an accused in the present crime,” the plea added.Gaur further stated that there is no iota of evidence to show his involvement in the murder of Mansukh Hiran and that he had never met the deceased or contacted him ever.An explosives-laden SUV was found near ‘Antilia’, the south Mumbai residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani, on February 25 this year. Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, who had claimed that he was in the possession of the vehicle, was found dead in a creek in Thane on March 5. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/antilia-bomb-scare-case-court-grants-bail-to-bookie-naresh-gaur-then-stays-order-after-nia-objects-340735

Therefore, her intentional, irresponsible and seditious posts have the ability to excite hatred, contempt and disaffection towards the republic of India,” Youth Congress said in its complaint. The complaint has been filed for registering an FIR against the actress under sections 124A (sedition), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Pandey said.Meanwhile, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa also slammed the actress over her alleged derogatory remarks targeting Sikhs and said the government should take action against her.“She should either be put in mental hospital or in jail. We demand strict action from govt for her hateful content on Instagram,” Sirsa said in a tweet.His second tweet said he'd filed a police complaint against the actress. "Filed a Police Complaint against KanganaRanaut for her disrespectful, contemptuous & insulting post on Instagram for calling whole Sikh Community as Khalistani terrorists & by saying that PM Indira Gandhi had crushed them as mosquitoes," Sirsa said in the tweet.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement on Friday that the Centre will repeal three contentious farm laws, Ranaut posted Instagram stories, saying India is a “Jihadist Nation” and calling for dictatorship in the country, the complaint by the youth wing of the Congress said.--- Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/youth-congress-manjinder-singh-sirsa-file-police-complaints-against-kangana-ranaut-for-social-media-posts-340730
20-11-2021||Pithoragarh||India will give fitting reply if any country tries to occupy its land: Rajnath Singh||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said India wants good relations with its neighbours but warned that it will give a fitting reply to any country that attempts to occupy even an inch of its land.Singh, a senior BJP leader, was in poll-bound Uttarakhand to launch the second leg of the ‘Shaheed Samman Yatra’ from Jhaulkhet Moonakot in Pithoragarh district.“We want good ties with our neighbours. India has never attacked any country. Neither has it ever occupied a foreign territory. Having good ties with neighbours has been India’s culture but some people don’t understand this. I don’t know whether it is their habit or temperament,” he said.Naming Pakistan, Singh said it keeps trying to destabilise India through terrorist activities and a stern message has already been given to it.“We have given a clear message to our neighbour on the western border that if it cross its limits, we will just not retaliate on the borders but can even cross over into its territory and do surgical and airstrikes,” he said.“We have one more neighbour (which does not seem to understand things),” the defence minister said without naming China.Singh said he must make it clear that if there is an attempt by any country in the world to “occupy even an inch of our land, India will give a fitting reply to it”.Noting that everyone was aware of India’s defining victory in 1971, Singh warned India’s neighbours of not living under any delusion.The defence minister said there was an attempt to create misapprehensions in Nepal about a road from Lipulekh Pass to Mansarovar through Dharchula that was inaugurated by him recently.“But it has failed to affect our close cultural ties with Nepal,” he said.Conferring Nepal Army Chief General Prabhu Ram Sharma with the honorary rank of Indian Army Chief recently is a reassertion of India’s close cultural ties with Nepal, Singh said.Launching the second leg of the ‘Shaheed Samman Yatra’, Singh said the state government should ensure that names of matyrs and the names of their villages should be inscribed on the Sainya Dham being built in Dehradun as a memorial tribute to them.Soil from homes of 1,734 martyrs’ families in Uttarakhand are being collected in urns to be brought to Dehradun and used in the construction of the Sainya Dham, a vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

20-11-2021||New Delhi||Joint bank account not mandatory for spouse pension: Centre||A joint bank account is not mandatory for spouse pension, the government said on Saturday.Union Minister of State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions Jitendra Singh said the Narendra Modi government has always sought "ease of living" for all sections of society including retirees and pensioners who are the nation's assets with all their experience and long years of service rendered by them.He said in case the head of office is satisfied that it is not possible for the retiring government servant to open a joint account with his or her spouse for reasons beyond his or her control, this requirement may be relaxed, an official statement said. All banks disbursing central government pension have been advised that in case the spouse (family pensioner) opts for the existing joint bank account for credit of family pension, banks should not insist on opening a new account, it said.A joint bank account with the spouse is however desirable and it is to be opened with their spouse in whose favor an authorisation for family pension exists in the Pension Payment Order (PPO), said the statement issued by the Personnel Ministry. Operation in these accounts would be on "former or survivor" or "either or survivor" basis as desired by the pensioner, Singh said.The reason for the opening of joint bank account is to ensure that family pension may be commenced without any delay and the family pensioner is not subjected to any hardships of opening a new pension bank account, the statement said. This also ensures minimum documentation for the family pensioner while submitting a request for commencement of family pension, it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/joint-bank-account-not-mandatory-for-spouse-pension-centre-340723
20-11-2021||Mumbai||Sameer Wankhede religion row: Law seems to be on his side, says Prakash Ambedkar||Amid a controversy surrounding the religion of Sameer Wankhede, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) leader Prakash Ambedkar on Saturday said the law is on the side of the Mumbai NCB chief, whom Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik had accused of hiding his "true religion- Islam" and securing a Central job by faking his caste certificate. Malik had alleged that Sameer Wankhede, an IRS officer, was born as Muslim but he forged his caste certificate to get a job under a reserved category. Wankhede, the Mumbai zonal director of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), had denied the allegations. “As per my information, the law is on the side of Sameer Wankhede. There is a similar case where the Supreme Court had ruled in the favour of a man from Kerala who wanted to disassociate himself from his parent's religion —Christianity.  "There is a Supreme Court verdict on February 25, 2015, where the case is similar to that of Sameer Wankhede's. The petitioner's parents had accepted Christianity before his birth. But after he became an adult, he filed a petition saying he wanted to be associated with the religion of his grandparents, who are non-Christians,” he said.The Supreme Court had upheld his appeal and ruled that since the petitioner is an adult now, he can associate himself with his grandparents' religion, Ambedkar said. “I think legally Wankhede is clean and the law is on his side,” he said. Speaking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement to repeal the three contentious farm laws, Ambedkar said a case is pending before the Supreme Court wherein petitioners have argued that agriculture is a state subject. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sameer-wankhede-religion-row-law-seems-to-be-on-his-side-says-prakash-ambedkar-340719
20-11-2021||Indore||Country's cleanest city turns waste into fuel, money||The efforts taken by the Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) to keep the city clean not only earn it bragging rights as India’s cleanest city year after year but also some hard cash.Indore was adjudged the cleanest city for the fifth year in a row in the Union government’s annual survey on Saturday. The IMC earns Rs 8 crore annually from the plants which convert waste into useful products such as bio-CNG, an official said.The corporation employs about 8,500 sanitary workers in three shifts from 6 am to 4 am—22 hours a day—to keep the city clean. “A new 550-ton capacity bio-CNG plant is going to be commissioned soon, which will take the civic body’s annual earnings from waste treatment to Rs 10 crore,” said Asad Warsi, the IMC’s advisor for the Swachha Bharat Abhiyan. At present, the private companies which make bio-CNG, compost and other products by processing wet and dry waste pay about Rs 8 crore to the IMC every year, he told PTI.“The city generates 300 million litres per day (MLD) of sewage water. Of this, 110 MLD water is reused to water public gardens, farms and also for construction activities,” Warsi said.The cleanliness model of the city is based on 3 ‘R’s—Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. For the last six years, there are no big garbage containers in the city. About 700 vehicles with compartments to segregate six types of waste including bio-waste such as diapers and sanitary napkins collect garbage from almost every doorstep, officials said.  The IMC disposes of 600 tons each of wet and dry waste every day. In August, Indore was also declared the country’s first ‘Water Plus’ city under the Swachh Survekshan 2021 for cleaning up the Kanh-Saraswati river and 25 small and big drains.This was achieved, primarily, by stopping the release of sewage water into the river and drains from 1,746 public and 5,624 domestic outfalls, officials said.“Indore has got used to being in the first place,” Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said while congratulating the city earlier in the day. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/countrys-cleanest-city-turns-waste-into-fuel-money-340715

20-11-2021||New Delhi||Farm laws repeal: Motorists hope agony of taking detours to avoid blockade at border points will end||Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of repealing the farm laws has kindled hope among commuters, motorists and commercial vehicle operators in Delhi for an end to their agony of taking detours during interstate travel to avoid the farmers’ protest sites.Due to the stir, vehicles bound for Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir have to take an alternate route via the KMP Expressway due to the blockade at the Singhu border point. They are required to pass by Jharoda and Sapla to avoid the Tikri border, according to Shyam Lal Gola, the president of All India Luxury Bus Union.Vehicles have to go via Vaishali—Noida sec 62 and from there through Pari Chowk to reach Ghazipur, he said.Hundreds of farmers have been camping at important stretches of Delhi’s borders in Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur since November 2020, demanding the repeal of the three contentious farm laws.On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the Centre will repeal the three farm laws, marking a climbdown by his government to meet the unrelenting demand of the farmers.“If the border points are opened, hours of delay due to detours and passing through patchy single roads in villages and towns can be avoided. Also, there will be a big saving on fuel,” Gola said.Amit Goel, a businessman, said, “Opening the border points will help thousands of commuters in Ghaziabad, Delhi, Noida.”                Bhagat Ram, a grocery shop owner in south Delhi said to get supplies from neighbouring states vehicles have to pass by villages at the Singhu border and face traffic jams on the way. The poor condition of roads further delays their journey, he said.Pranav Mishra, an IT professional, said, “The Delhi GT Karnal road where the agitation is going on was the best route for travelling and one could reach their specific destination on time especially when it’s a medical emergency.”“But with border closed, we have to take alternative routes and pass by risky roads that could cause damage to cars or cause accidents. So, these roads, which have been occupied for a year, should be immediately opened.”       A senior traffic police official said they will wait for the calls given by farmer groups. “If the farmers clear the protest sites, obviously borders will be opened.” Last month, one side of the Rohtak-Delhi highway at the Tikri border was opened for vehicular traffic after a meeting was held by the Delhi Police with farm leaders, officials said.Also, the barricades and concertina wires that were put up at the anti-farm laws protest site in Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border have been removed, they added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-laws-repeal-motorists-hope-agony-of-taking-detours-to-avoid-blockade-at-border-points-will-end-340705

She remained hospitalised at Dahod and Vadodara for a total of 202 days, during which she was kept on ventilator and oxygen support," her husband Trilok Dharmik, an engineer with the railways, said.He said he had lost hope for her recovery for as many as nine times during this period, but she bounced back every time and was finally discharged."We had gone to Bhopal on April 23 after my father-in-law died of a heart attack. After returning to Dahod on April 25, my wife had shown symptoms of coronavirus and on May 1 she tested positive. When her oxygen level went down and fever increased, she was admitted to the railway hospital in Dahod on the night of May 1 as her condition deteriorated," he added.From May 6, her condition deteriorated further and oxygen support was required for her. She was shifted to a private hospital in Vadodara from May 7 till May 23, he said.After consulting doctors at Dahod, her husband decided to shift her back to Dahod hospital, where she was brought on May 24. At Dahod hospital, she remained on a ventilator for around two months, and on BiPAP for another one month."We had lost hope for her recovery. For at least nine times during this period, it occurred to us that she would not survive. At one point, the doctors even said she will need a lung transplant," he said.However, she continued to recover through medication and oxygen therapy. Slowly, her health started improving and doctors decided to discharge her, said Dharmik."While she still requires some amount of oxygen, her other reports are normal. Her other organs are fine. She has been brought back home after 202 days in the hospital," he said.

"If this decision had been taken earlier, innocent lives would not have been lost," he added, a day after Modi announced the rollback of the three farm laws.In his letter, Gandhi underscored the need to accept the farmers' demand on minimum support price (MSP)."This movement will not end without the resolution of this demand and there will be widespread anger amongst them, which will continue to emerge in one form or the other. Therefore, it is important for the farmers to get the statutory guarantee of MSP for their crops," he wrote.He said the legal binding on MSP would give sizeable economic security cover to farmers."My humble request to you is that the government must immediately accept this demand in the interest of our nation."Gandhi described the Lakhimpur incident in which several farmers were killed as heartbreaking and a "blemish on our democracy".

20-11-2021||Mumbai||Repeal of farm laws defeat of arrogance of power; announcement made with eye on polls: Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Saturday described the Centre's announcement to repeal the three contentious farm laws as the "defeat of arrogance of power", and said it was done as the BJP feared a backlash in the upcoming Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to withdraw the laws is a victory of the farmers' unity, an editorial in party mouthpiece 'Saamana' said, adding that this "wisdom" is a result of the BJP's loss in the recently-held bypolls in 13 states.The prime minister, in an address to the nation on Friday morning, announced the government's decision to repeal the three farm laws, which were at the centre of protests by farmers for the last one year."The Union government suppressed the voice of the opposition and got the three farm bills passed in Parliament. The Centre completely ignored the farmers' protests. Supply of water and electricity was snapped at the protest sites. During their struggle, the farmers were even labelled as Khalistanis, Pakistanis and terrorists," the Sena said.Despite all this, the farmers did not budge from their demand of the withdrawal of the laws. Hundreds of farmers died during the protests. A Union minister’s son “crushed farmers under his vehicle” at Lakhimpur Kheri, but PM Modi did not even condole their deaths, it added."But after realising that the farmers won't end their protest and sensing BJP's defeat in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, the Modi government decided to repeal the laws. This is a victory of the farmers' unity," it said.At least in future, the Centre should shun arrogance before bringing such laws, and take the opposition parties into confidence for the welfare of the country, the Sena said.

The first casualty took place on November 24, 2020, when a number of farmers were covering tractor-trailers with waterproof sheets at Mehal Kalan in Barnala.Kahan Singh, an activist of the BKU (Dakaunda) from Dhaner village, was hit by a car on the roadside where the tractors were parked. He died on the spot. “Kahan Singh was the first martyr of the Delhi morcha,” says Manjit Dhaner, BKU (Dakaunda) leader.More names of the young and the old, men and women kept adding to the list since then. The reason behind the deaths included mishaps involving recklessly driven vehicles, mainly trucks, falling from tractor-trailers, harsh cold, dengue or Covid.“Even the nature was not kind to us. But our struggle finally bore the desired result. The sacrifice of all these people has not gone waste. Our movement will serve as a lesson for the generations to come,” says Rajinder Singh Deep Singhwala of Kirti Kisan Union.As per the SKM, between November 24, 2020, and November 19, 2021, 670 farmers or farm labourers died during the struggle.Union leaders alleged the PM tried to belittle their cause by taunting at the “rich status” of protesting farmers. A study by Dr Baldev Singh Shergill of Punjab University’s campus in Talwandi Sabo and former professor Lakhwinder Singh revealed that majority of the protesters who died during the protest had small landholdings of 2.59 acres.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/670-lives-lost-in-year-long-struggle-at-delhi-borders-340548
20-11-2021||Sanjeev Singh Bariana||Way ahead: Farm unions undecided, weigh options||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 19Even as the PM today announced that the contentious farm laws would be repealed, farmers in Punjab remain undecided on supporting any political party.While most of the 32 farm unions forming the Samyukt Kisan Morcha say they will not be backing any party, there are some who are considering several options.Senior leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said the likelihood of the farmers’ stir coming to an end “gives us reason to consider creating a separate entity for the coming polls.”However, he said the farmers were not budging till the farm laws were repealed and the issues of MSP and compensation to the kin of more than 700 farmers who had died during the agitation were addressed.General secretary of the BKU (Ugrahan) Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said backing a political party was not the way out. “We are prepared for a long struggle till all pending issues are resolved,” he added. The chances that all farmer unions would unite and form a common front for the elections are remote. Some experts believe that the Punjab BJP may be the biggest gainer. Besides former CM Capt Amarinder Singh’s outfit, it may get also the support of other parties, making the poll battle in Punjab a four-cornered affair.Others feel the BJP may not make any gains as the farmers and their families are unlikely to forget the hardships they have endured for a whole year. Also, analysts do not rule out the SAD once again stitching an alliance with the BJP. The AAP may not see any significant gains.Prof Pramod Kumar, Director, Institute for Development and Communication, said till now, the BJP was being blamed for Punjab’s problems. “Now the Congress will have to be answerable too.” Martyr Bhagat Singh’s kin Prof Jagmohan Singh pointed out that the announcement had come after the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in UP. “This indicates the BJP faces an uncertain future in UP.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/way-ahead-farm-unions-undecided-weigh-options-340550
20-11-2021||---||Fear of losing land kept the farmers going||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 19The fear of losing land that came with the three farm laws proved a turning point in making the farmers’ agitation a true people’s movement in Punjab.“The corporates will snatch your land one day, we had been trying to tell people for the past three decades,” recounts Shingara Singh Mann, state committee member of BKU (Ugrahan). The Centre pushed the three bills on June 5 and in the evening, Darshan Pal of Krantikari Kisan Union and Jagmohan Singh of BKU (Dakaunda) organised a virtual meet from Patiala with other constituents of All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee and called for burning effigies of the Modi government — the first action against laws. Mann said they had a choice between dying of Covid and fighting the government for their right. “We chose the latter,” he said, adding that soon the movement spread to around 1,000 villages. It was followed by giving memoranda to SDMs, DCs and the President.On June 30, protests were held in front of the SDM offices across the state and tractor marches were taken out in July and entry of SAD-BJP leaders was banned in villages. After 10,000 people, who were later joined by 35,000 others, sat on a protest at Badal village, the SAD broke its ties with BJP and Harsimrat Kaur Badal quit as the Union Minister. “It infused a new life into the movement,” Mann said. “We invited other organisations for a joint meeting in Moga on September 23 and the 32 farmer organisations’ umbrella platform came into existence,” said Jagmohan Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fear-of-losing-land-kept-the-farmers-going-340552

Apart from the impact on toll collection, there is also a debt taken by the stakeholders which is at “risk.”A total of 52 toll plazas, including both public-funded and BOT (built, operate and transfer), on national highways (NHs) in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR have been directly or indirectly affected due to the agitation.While the impact on fee collection at some toll plazas began from October 2020 onwards, it intensified in December 2020 with no fee collection with the free movement of vehicles at all toll plazas in Haryana, Punjab and Delhi-NCR.“The average toll collection per day at these plazas is estimated at Rs 7 crore,” according to rating agency ICRA. Even the government said it suffered a toll revenue loss of Rs 814.4 crore till March 16 on account of farmers’ protest in three states, including Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan, in Parliament.So, it is estimated that the total revenue loss would be around Rs 2,500 crore in Punjab and Haryana.Apart from the impact on toll collection due to restrictions in vehicular movement, there is also a debt of over Rs 9,300 crore taken by the stakeholders which is at “risk”, ICRA said. With the decision to repeal the laws, the NHAI is gearing up to resume toll operations.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stir-caused-rs-2-500-cr-toll-revenue-loss-340553

It cannot be made ‘purely voluntary’ as was observed by BR Ambedkar 75 years back, in view of the apprehension and fear expressed by the members of the minority community. Allahabad HCThe court directed marriage registrar or officer of petitioners’ districts to immediately register the marriage of the petitioners without insisting or awaiting approval of the competent district authority with regard to conversion of faith.“The UCC is a necessity and mandatorily required today. It cannot be made ‘purely voluntary’ as was observed by BR Ambedkar 75 years back, in view of the apprehension and fear expressed by the members of the minority community,” the court said.Justice Suneet Kumar said it is the need of the hour that the Parliament comes up with a “single family code” to protect interfaith couples from being “hounded as criminals”.“The stage has reached that the Parliament should intervene and examine as to whether the country requires multiplicity of marriage and registration laws or the parties to a marriage should be brought under the umbrella of single-family code,” the court observed.The standing counsel appearing for the Uttar Pradesh Government pointed out that the petitioners’ marriage could not be registered without an inquiry by the district authority as they did not get the mandatory approval from district magistrate before converting to the faith of their partner for the purpose of marriage.The petitioners’ counsel, however, asserted that citizens have the right to choose their partner and faith; and the conversion took place out of free will. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/allahabad-hc-asks-centre-to-consider-uniform-civil-code-340513

Approximately one kg of gold was recovered from each of the 80 imported electroplating machines, stated a news release.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dri-seizes-85-kg-gold-in-op-molten-metal-340515

Delhi Civil JudgeAn 80-year-old man had moved the court, claiming that his son Ajit Singh came to Kashmere Gate in Delhi in the last week of October 1984 to purchase the motor parts but went missing after the anti-Sikh riots erupted in the first week of November.Mian Singh, a resident of Jammu and Kashmir, filed a civil suit seeking a declaration of his missing son as dead and a direction to North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Registrar of Births and Deaths to issue a death certificate.Dismissing the suit, Civil Judge Helly Fur Kaur noted that there is nothing on record to show that Ajit Singh visited Delhi in the last week of October 1984.“Despite being put a query by the Court during final arguments, plaintiff did not bring on record any ID proof of Ajit Singh nor any kind of document which could reasonably satisfy the court about his identity and existence,” the civil judge noted in an order dated November 18.Further, the judge said the documents relied upon by Mian Singh consisted of a partly legible copy of the certificate issued by Prabandhak Committee Gurudwara Guru Nanak Satsang, a copy of a letter to the PM for rehabilitation, writ petitions, correspondence between Delhi Commission of Police, and SDM, J&K.The judge noted that no missing report is available since the police refused to register the same and the one lodged with Delhi Administration got misplaced by Mian Singh. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fathers-plea-seeking-declaration-of-sons-death-in-84-riots-junked-340519
20-11-2021||---||Centre relents, to roll back 3 farm laws||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 19After withstanding the farmers’ opposition to three agricultural reform legislations for almost a year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Gurpurb said the laws would be repealed in the upcoming winter session of Parliament and a panel formed to make the MSP regime more effective. “Apologising to the people with a sincere and pure heart, I want to say that something must have been lacking in our dedication that we could not explain to farmers what was as clear as the light of a diya,” said the PM, describing the three laws as “enactments made with full integrity, clear conscience and with the best interest of farmers at heart.”Edit: Victory for democracyAcknowledging chinks in government’s outreach to farm unions (11 rounds of talks starting December 3, 2020, failed to break the deadlock), the PM said, “Today is Gurpurb. This is not the time to blame anyone. I have come before the country to say that we have decided to withdraw all three agricultural laws. In the Parliament session starting later this month, we will complete the constitutional process to repeal these three agricultural laws.” The rollback announcement comes ahead of elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, early next year and a week ahead of the first anniversary of farmers’ protests on November 26. Apologising, I want to say something must be lacking in our dedication that we could not explain the laws to farmers — Narendra Modi, PMJustifies lawsBefore announcing the climbdown, the PM justified the three legislations as “sacred things, absolutely pure, a matter of farmers’ interest. “...we left no stone unturned in our attempt to understand the farmers’ concerns,” he said.The PM also appealed to agitators to return home from Delhi borders and urged them to go in for a “new beginning and a fresh start”.The Prime Minister’s 18-minute address to the nation was high on symbolism as he invoked both Guru Nanak Dev and Guru Gobind Singh to underline NDA’s commitment to farmers. He spoke of his government’s “highest priority to agriculture, breaking past procurement records, effecting a five-fold budget increase and ensuring over Rs 1.25 lakh crore annual spending on the sector.”The PM, however, lamented that the government had failed to convince all farmers about the benefits of the laws “despite its best efforts” and said the sole objective was to ensure a fair price for farm produce and maximum selling options.Before announcing the climbdown today, the PM justified the three legislations as “sacred things, absolutely pure, a matter of farmers’ interest… we could not explain to some farmers … only a section was objecting but we kept trying to educate and inform them.”Detailing the government’s engagement with farmers, the PM said, “We were ready to amend problematic provisions of the law and even to stay the laws for two years. We left no stone unturned in our attempt to understand the farmers’ concerns.”The PM earlier placed the farm laws in context of past calls for reforms in the sector, saying: “Earlier, too, many governments brainstormed on the issue. This time there was a discussion in Parliament and the laws were brought up. Many farmer organisations supported the laws. I am grateful to them…Whatever I did was for the benefit of farmers.”The announcement, seen as the government’s massive outreach to farmers ahead of elections, also carried PM’s assurance on legal guarantee for MSP — a demand farm union leaders repeated today.The Prime Minister said a committee with representatives of the Centre and state governments, agricultural economists and farmers would soon be formed to suggest ways of making the MSP more effective and transparent. Also, to suggest cropping pattern changes to achieve the goal of zero-budget farming.The PM signed off his speech with Guru Gobind Singh’s revered hymn, “Deh Shiva bar mohe ihai, shubh karman te kabhu na tarun” (Grant me this boon O’ God, may I never refrain from righteous act), assuring farmers, a major political constituency, of NDA’s “continuous support”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-relents-to-roll-back-3-farm-laws-340467
20-11-2021||Aditi Tandon||Govt corrects course ahead of UP, Punjab polls||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 19The government’s decision to repeal farm laws that spawned the longest popular agitation in India’s recent history comes on the eve of crucial elections in five states, including Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, early next year and close on the heels of ruling BJP’s bypoll losses in Haryana, Himachal and Rajasthan.With his stunning public apology on Gurpurb, Prime Minister Narendra Modi not only showed deference to the Sikhs at home and abroad, he also sought to send across the message of “nation first” amid prolonged protests, which the security establishment has routinely flagged as fertile ground for communal tension.Sources described the PM’s decision to repeal the farm laws as an example of his democratic approach. “Though the government is made of numbers, it is run by consensus in a democratic and statesman-like manner,” they said. Home Minister Amit Shah termed PM’s address as one by a remarkable statesman. Underlining its democratic approach, the government today said 11 rounds of discussions with farm union leaders were held even though these failed to break the deadlock.“When a section continued to remain wary of the laws, the PM did not hesitate to announce their repeal. For the PM, it is nation first and farmers foremost,” the sources said.They flagged PM Modi’s “respect for the Sikh community”, as reflected in the opening of Kartarpur corridor before Guru Nanak Dev’s birth anniversary, and also the celebrations of the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh, 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak and the 400th birth anniversary of Guru Teg Bahadur. “Even when Modi was Gujarat CM, he helped restore Lakhpat Gurdrwara Sahib. He recently facilitated in bringing Guru Granth Sahib from war-torn Afghanistan to India,” the sources pointed out. The PM’s address displays his political and electoral pragmatism along with the government’s need to placate Jats of western UP ahead of the 2022 state polls. Victory in UP is critical to BJP’s third term run in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.It’s no secret that the farm agitation, with Tikait in the lead role, has dented BJP’s prospects in the area where it won with majority Jat support in the 2014 and 2019 elections. The emergence of SP-RLD alliance with anti-farm laws sentiment as the main plank needed to be addressed at the earliest, especially after BJP’s embarrassing bypoll losses in HP, Haryana and Rajasthan on November 2.In Punjab too, the party desperately needed a foothold after the SAD parted ways over the farm laws last September. The farmers’ agitation undermined saffron prospects further.

20-11-2021||Satya Prakash||Repeal of farm laws: Constitutional questions stay unanswered||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 19With Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday announcing the decision to repeal the three contentious farm laws, many constitutional questions will remain unanswered, as the petitions challenging their validity have become infructuous.Petitions infructuousPassed by Parliament in September last year, the Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Act, the Farmers Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act were challenged by farmers’ organisations and others in the Supreme Court, which had ordered a stay on their implementation.The first Act allowed sale and purchase of farm produce outside Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandis while the second one provided a regulatory framework for contract farming by allowing farmers to enter into agreements with agri-business firms for supplying produce of pre-determined quality at minimum guaranteed prices. The third law did away with the Centre’s powers to impose stockholding limits on foodstuffs, except under extraordinary conditions such as war, famine and other natural calamities of grave nature.As “agriculture” figured in Entry 14 and “markets and fairs” in Entry 28 of the State List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the petitioners questioned the very right of Parliament to enact laws that related to agriculture and marketing of agricultural produce. However, trade and commerce in foodstuffs, including edible oilseeds and oils, fodder, raw cotton, cotton seed and raw jute figure in Entry 33 of Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule. Laws passed by Parliament on subjects enumerated in Concurrent List can override those enacted by a state Assembly. Further, Entry 42 of Union List authorises Parliament to make laws to regulate “inter-state trade and commerce”. Does the expression “agriculture” in Entry 14 of State List include “agricultural marketing” as well? Do Entry 33 of Concurrent List and Entry 42 of Union List — separately or together — empower Parliament to enact laws of the kind it did in the form of the three farm laws?Had the Central Government not decided to repeal the farm laws, the Supreme Court would have answered these questions and clarified the legal position on the contentious issue, thereby averting future constitutional disputes on such issues having wider ramifications for Centre-state relations. But all such questions remain unanswered as the petitions have become infructuous.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/repeal-of-farm-laws-constitutional-questions-stay-unanswered-340492
20-11-2021||New Delhi||Climbdown result of farmers’ tenacity: Opposition||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday led the Opposition in hailing the government decision to repeal farm laws as the victory of India’s farmers and hoped the government will draw lessons for the future and practice consultative decision making.A united Opposition, including TMC chief Mamata Banerjee, Congress’ Rahul Gandhi, AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal, SP’s Akhilesh Yadav, NCP’s Sharad Pawar, BSP’s Mayawati, RLD’s Jayant Choudhary, NC’s Omar Abdullah and the CPM, described the PM’s climbdown as the result of farmers’ tenacity and their sacrifices with around 700 dying during the 11-month agitation. The leaders also said the PM’s retraction was rooted in the BJP’s fear of loss in upcoming elections, with the Congress asking why ordinances could not be brought to immediately repeal farm laws. The Opposition’s refrain also was – had the government rolled back earlier, 700 farmers would not have died. “After almost 12 months of the Gandhian agitation, today is the victory of the struggle and will of 62 crore farmers and farm labourers. Today is the victory of truth, justice and non-violence,” said Sonia in a statement, with the Congress announcing the observation of ‘Kisan Vijay Divas’ tomorrow.In an open letter, Rahul congratulated farmers for their “struggle and sacrifice”. He said, “Your peaceful Gandhian struggle that forced a dictatorial government to retract is a classic example of the victory of truth over falsehood.”He, however, said the struggle was not over and drew farmers’ attention to the need for securing the MSP regime, scrapping electricity law amendment, rolling back GST on farm equipment; reducing diesel prices and waiving farm loans.TMC’s Mamata Banerjee said, “My heartfelt congratulations to every single farmer who fought relentlessly and were not fazed by the cruelty with which the BJP treated you. This is your victory!”AAP’s Arvind Kejriwal said, “This golden day will be written in the pages of history like August 15 and January 26. The Centre bowed down to farmers. This is not just the victory of farmers, but also the victory of democracy. This victory proves ego will not stand before the will of the people.” — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/climbdown-result-of-farmers-tenacity-opposition-340493

Will follow the SKM instructions on the next course of action,” said Hardyal Singh Ghali, district vice-president AIKS, Moga.Nachhattar Singh, an elderly farmer from Ludhiana, too said he would not budge till the government repealed the farm laws. “We are not taking any chances,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dhol-sweets-songs-at-singhu-340495

A festive atmosphere reigned over the border as farmers distributed sweets and danced to drum beats to express their joy.The much-awaited moment came when the farmers were getting ready to recite the Gurbani to mark the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev. The announcement brought a smile to the faces of farmers, as they raisedslogans of ‘kisan ekta zindabad’ while moving towards the main protest site for the celebrations.On a regular day, their dharna would commence after 11 am, but today a considerable number of enthusiastic farmers reached the site at 10 am, warmly greeting and hugging each other. Farmers’ supporters from nearby villages too reached the border with laddoos, adding colour and zest to the merriment all around. “I was busy preparing the langar when my friend Hardev from my village called up and gave me this good news. I couldn’t believe it… had to switch on the television to confirm it. It’s just half-victory though, we will not go back home till the President gives his assent to the repeal after it is passed by Parliament,” said Lakhwinder Singh of Peer Mohammad village in Ferozepur.Septuagenarian Jagmel Singh said the farmers today had the same enthusiasm that they showed on the first day of their coming to the Delhi border from Punjab nearly a year ago.“One feels like one has won a battle. We have been fighting against a government which was not ready to feel our pain. Finally, our unity bore fruit and we succeeded,” he added.Jaswinder from Sangrur said they were confident that the three farm laws would be repealed one day but they had no idea that the PM would announce it today.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tikri-rejoices-amid-chants-of-kisan-ekta-340499
20-11-2021||New Delhi||Staying put till all issues resolved: Farmers||Even as sweets were being distributed at the Ghazipur protest site after PM Narendra Modi’s announcement on repeal of the farm laws, the farmers had a big message for the government that they were not packing off to their villages anytime soon. Amid all celebratory dance by the sparse crowd, the farmers while welcoming the move said it was a partial victory as a lot of issues, including the touchy subject of legislation on the MSP is yet to be decided upon. The message was a clear sign that the farmers sitting in Ghazipur were behind BKU national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait’s call of continuing with the protest till the time all demands are met.Lakhimpur Kheri’s Gurnail Singh said, “We welcome the PM’s move, but this does not mean we will leave for our homes. We will closely watch the parliamentary session to see whether whatever he said will actually be done.”“But today’s was only a partial victory for us. Abhi puri ladai jeetni baki hai (We are here for the long run). I am from Kheri and we are selling Dhan for Rs 800 when the MSP is pegged around Rs 1,900. MSP has been demanded by us for over two decades,” he added. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/staying-put-till-all-issues-resolved-farmers-340503

Today, the country’s mantra is ‘Make in India, Make for the World’. The country is working to make our armed forces ‘atmanirbhar’ (self-reliant).”           “We are adding the talent of private sector with our defence sector and new start-ups are being given a chance to show their ‘kamaal’ (good work) in this sector,” he said on the final day of ‘Rashtra Raksha Samarpan Parv’.Several initiatives and schemes were launched or dedicated to the nation during the three-day ‘parv’ in Jhansi that also celebrated the 193rd birthday of Rani Laxmi Bai.He said the admission of girl students has started in Sainik Schools from this session and in future brave women like Rani Laxmi Bai will come out of these schools and serve the nation.Stating that the country never tasted defeat due to lack of gallantry and valour (‘shaurya and veerta’), the prime minister said history of the country would have been different had there been enough resources and weapons with Rani Laxmi Bai.“It has been decided that a big portion of the defence budget for purchase of weapons will be spent on ‘Make in India’ equipment and the defence minister has released a list of 200 equipment that cannot be brought (imported) from outside,” he said.The LCH handed over by the prime minister to the Air Force incorporates advanced technologies and stealth features for effective combat roles.The deployment of Indian UAVs by armed forces is also a proof of the growing maturity of the Indian drone industry ecosystem and the advanced EW suite will be used in different naval ships including destroyers and frigates.In Jhansi, Modi inaugurated or laid the foundations of multiple development projects worth over Rs 3,425 crore to expedite growth of the economically backward Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh.The prime minister inaugurated Atal Ekta Park in Jhansi.Named after former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the park has been built at a cost of over Rs 12 crore, and is spread over an area of about 40,000 square metre.The park will house a library as well as a statue of Vajpayee.The statue has been built by renowned sculptor Ram Sutar, the man behind the Statue of Unity, according to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).He also launched the NCC Alumni Association with the objective to provide a formal platform to enable NCC alumni to reconnect with the organisation.The association will further the aims of NCC and assist in nation-building.“It will witness the enrolling the prime minister, a former NCC cadet, as the first member of the association,” officials said.He launched the national programme of simulation training for NCC cadets with the aim to scale up these facilities for all the three wings of NCC.The prime minister also dedicated to the nation augmented reality powered electronic kiosks at the National War Memorial which will enable visitors to pay floral homage to martyrs through click of the button.At an event in Mahoba earlier in the day, the prime minister inaugurated more than Rs 3,240 crore worth of projects aimed at ending water scarcity for farmers in the parched Bundelkhand region.Election to the 403-member Uttar Pradesh Assembly is slated for early next year.

20-11-2021||New Delhi||Farm laws’ repeal: Many constitutional questions remain unanswered||As Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the decision to repeal the three contentious farm laws on Friday, many constitutional questions would remain unanswered, for the petitions challenging their validity become infructuous.Passed by Parliament in September last year, Farmers (Empowerment & Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance & Farm Services Act, the Farmers Produce Trade & Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Act and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act were challenged by farmers’ organisations and others in the Supreme Court, which had ordered a stay on their implementation.The first Act allowed sale and purchase of farm produce outside Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandis while the second one provided a regulatory framework for contract farming by allowing farmers to enter into agreements with agri-business firms for supplying produce of pre-determined quality at minimum guaranteed prices. The third law did away with the Centre’s powers to impose stockholding limits on foodstuffs, except under extraordinary conditions; such as war, famine and other natural calamities of grave nature.As “agriculture” figured in Entry 14 and “markets and fairs” in Entry 28 the State List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the petitioners questioned the very right of Parliament to enact laws that related to agriculture and marketing of agricultural produce.However, trade and commerce in foodstuffs, including edible oilseeds and oils, fodder, raw cotton, cotton seed and raw jute figure in Entry 33 of the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule. Laws passed by Parliament on subjects enumerated in Concurrent List can override those enacted by a State Assembly. Further, Entry 42 of the Union List authorises Parliament to make laws to regulate “inter-state trade and commerce”.Does the expression ‘agriculture’ in Entry 14 of the State List include ‘agricultural marketing’ as well? Do Entry 33 of the Concurrent List and Entry 42 of the Union List—separately or together—empower Parliament to enact laws of the kind it did in the form of the three farm laws?Had the Centre not decided to repeal the farm laws in the ensuing Winter Session of Parliament, the Supreme Court would have answered these questions and clarified the legal position on the contentious issue, thereby averting future constitutional disputes on the issue having wider ramifications for Centre-state relations. But all such questions remain unanswered as the petitions have become infructuous.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farm-laws-repeal-many-constitutional-questions-remain-unanswered-340303
20-11-2021||New Delhi||Govt to form committee to make MSP system effective, promote natural farming: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that a committee will be formed to make Minimum Support Price (MSP) system more effective and transparent as well as suggest ways to promote zero budgeting based-agriculture.The committee will have representatives of the Central Government, state governments, farmers, agricultural scientists, and agricultural economists, Modi said as he also announced the decision to repeal the three farm laws.Apart from repeal of the farm laws, a legal guarantee on MSP has been one of the major demands of the protesting farmer unions.In his address to the nation in the morning, Modi said the government has decided to repeal the three farm laws, which were the trigger for protests by farmers for the last one year.“Today only, we have taken one more important decision related to agriculture sector. We will set up a committee to promote zero budget farming or natural farming, to change crop pattern in the scientific manner as per the changing needs of the country and to make MSP more effective and transparent,” he said.The Prime Minister said that many initiatives have been taken for the farmers to get the right price for their produce in return for their hard work. The country has strengthened its rural market infrastructure.By linking more than 1,000 mandis through e-NAM (electronic-National Agriculture Market), Modi said the government has given a platform for farmers to sell their produce anywhere. Alongside, it has spent crores of rupees on modernising the mandi infrastructure.“We not only increased the MSP but also created a record number of government procurement centres. The procurement of the produce made by our government has broken the records of the last several decades,” he said.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the committee will submit the report, which will be beneficial to the farming community.He highlighted that the government had decided to fix the MSP at least 1.5 times higher than the cost of production.Tomar said the Centre has started procurement of pulses, oilseeds and coarse cereals apart from wheat and paddy at MSP rates.Food Corporation of India, the nodal agency for procurement and distribution of food grains, has procured record wheat and paddy crops at MSPs during the last marketing years of kharif and rabi seasons.Presently, the government decides the MSP based on the recommendation of the expert body the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP).The factors considered by the CACP for fixing MSPs include cost of production, domestic and international prices, demand-supply conditions, inter-crop price parity, terms of trade between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors.MSP is announced for the kharif crops of paddy, jowar, bajara, ragi, maize, arhar, moong, urad, cotton, groundnut, sunflower seed, soyabean and sesamum.The rabi crops for which MSP is announced are wheat, barley, gram, masur, rapeseeds & mustard, safflower and toria.Besides, MSP is announced for copra, de-husked coconut, jute and Fair Remunerative Prices (FRP) for sugarcane.

20-11-2021||Aditi Tandon||PM has accepted his crime, time for people to punish him, says Congress||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 19Moments after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the government decision to repeal the farm laws the opposition upped the ante on the issue with the Congress saying the PM had accepted his crime and it was now time for people to pronounce punishment.The party said people had realised that “the nation’s victory lay in the BJP’s defeat”.The Congress asked why the government couldn’t bring ordinances to repeal farm laws like it did to raise the tenures of probe agency chiefs.While Congress leader Rahul Gandhi termed the development a victory of farmers over injustice and arrogance, party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the retraction of the government was rooted in its electoral slide as visible in recent bypolls.“Anti-farmer BJP powers have finally lost. Today is the day of defeat of Modi’s arrogance and a day of defeat of his few capitalist friends. The PM has publicly accepted his crime and it is now time for the people to pronounce punishment for this crime,” Surjewala said, adding that the deaths of 700 farmers over the last more than 11 months of the agitation “were on the PM and his royal obstinacy to not repeal the laws in time”.“This decision has come because the BJP can see the slipping electoral ground as state elections approach. The power of votes is the biggest in a democracy. This power has made the government retract its steps after royal arrogance of over 11 months,” said Surjewala asking if ordinances could be brought to raise the tenures of two people, why can’t ordinances be brought to immediately repeal farm laws which affect 62 crore farmers.“Why do you have to wait for the Parliament session to repeal farm laws when you can do so through ordinances by calling a cabinet meeting today?” the Congress general secretary asked.Not amused by government decision which the Congress called too little too late, Surjewala asked the PM five questions —“What’s the roadmap to give guaranteed MSP to farmers? What’s the roadmap to double farmers’ incomes? When will the excise duty on diesel be reversed? When will the GST tax on farm equipment be withdrawn and when will farm loans be waived?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-has-accepted-his-crime-time-for-people-to-punish-him-says-congress-340236
20-11-2021||Panipat/New Delhi||Will stay put on Delhi borders till Parliament session ends, say Samyukta Kisan Morcha leaders||The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) welcomed the announcement of repeal of three farm laws on Friday but said its future course of action will be decided after the core committee meetings on Saturday and Sunday.Also read: Centre takes back 3 farm laws, Modi announces in address to the nationBKU (Ugrahan) welcomes govt's decision to repeal farm lawsGovt has to bring bill to repeal three agri laws: Experts0As drumbeats were heard in several places and sweets distributed at the unexpected “victory”, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait added that the government should talk to farmers over the issue of minimum support price (MSP) of crops and other matters."The protest will not be withdrawn immediately, we will wait for the day when the farm laws are repealed in Parliament," Tikait tweeted in Hindi.SKM, the umbrella body of 40 farm unions, said their agitation was not just against the repeal of the “three black laws” but also for a statutory guarantee to remunerative prices for all agricultural produce.“This important demand of farmers is still pending," it said, clarifying that it would wait for the announcement to take effect through due parliamentary procedures.Farmer leader and SKM's core committee member Darshan Pal sai: "We want a legal guarantee on MSP"."We will not leave the protest sites unless these demands are met. To bring a consensus on the future course of the agitation and discuss MSP and other demands of farmers, the farmers' body will meet on Saturday and Sunday. The final decision will be taken at the SKM's core committee meeting on Sunday," Pal told PTI.The farmer leaders dedicated the victory to over 700 farmers who died during the one-year-long movement and the people, press, social organisations, and others that supported the movement.Issues remain, a statement from SKM  said on Friday, hoping these would be resolved soon as well.“SKM hopes that the Government of India, which has experienced a major climbdown in this repeal-related announcement will not allow the announcement to go waste, and will go the full length to fulfill all the legitimate demands of protesting farmers, including statutory legislation to guarantee a remunerative MSP. SKM will also assess all the developments, and in its next meeting, take the necessary further decisions,” the statement.The joint front also announced that a gathering for farmers at the protest sites on November 26 to mark the first anniversary of anti-farm law agitation being intensified.The joint front also flagged investigations into the violence at Lakhimpur Kheri. The press release from the SKM voiced its reservations over the inclusion of IPS officer Padmaja Chauhan in a court-monitored panel investigating the incident. Chauhan is part of a Special Investigating Team that the Uttar Pradesh government set up to investigate the Lakhimpur Kheri violence that left eight people, among them four farmers, dead.The Supreme Court recently appointed Justice Rakesh Kumar Jain, a former judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, to supervise the investigations.“A perusal of various reports that have come to the notice of SKM of her (Chauhan’s) tenure in different districts of UP show that this official’s record has been against the farmers’ struggle and also around muzzling of media,” the press release said. “SKM expresses its sincere hope that the Supreme Court will look into this matter, since the very purpose for the reconstitution of the SIT and to appoint retired Justice RK Jain to oversee the investigations is to bring in impartiality and independence.”Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, BKU (Lakhowal), welcomed the repeal of the laws saying Prime Minister Narender Modi made the announcement on Gurpurb, which is very good. He said their second major demand of legal guarantee on MSP is pending, and the government should talk with them over the MSP and other demands. The morcha would be continued till the government started the repeal procedure. The next course of action would be decided at the SKM meeting, he added.Also read: Centre's repeal announcement brings relief to Punjab farmersVictory for Punjab farmers comes at the cost of 669 livesPM's farm announcement a huge relief for BJP-JJP govt in HaryanaWithdrawal of farm laws impelled by 'fear of elections': ChidambaramYogender Yadav, convener, Jai Kisan Andolan, said it was an historic victory of the farmers but it is a partial step. MSP still has not been decided so far and there is nothing concrete on the MSP. For majority of the farmers in the country, MSP matters most, he added.Welcoming the decision, Major Singh Punnawal, general secretary, Punjab Kisan Sabha, said it is a one-sided announcement. It was not announced how these laws would be repealed. Farmers’ fraternity is happy with the decision but the government should have to announce the legal guarantee for MSP too, he added.Kulwant Singh Sandhu, general secretary, Jamhoori Kisan Sabha, said the announcement on the occasion of Guru Nanak’s birth anniversary is a good initiative. “We will stay put on Delhi borders till the Parliament session ends. More people will gather on the Delhi borders on November 26 to mark one year of the movement. We will also talk about other important demands – legal guarantee for MSP, withdrawal of Electricity Amendment bill and others. Besides, the SKM will take note of all developments and hold its meeting soon and announce further action.”--- With PTI inputs||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/will-stay-put-on-delhi-borders-till-parliament-session-ends-say-samyukta-kisan-morcha-leaders-340219

In the Parliament session starting later this month, we will complete the constitutional process to repeal these laws.”The decision comes ahead of the Assembly elections in five states next year and the recent dismal performance of the BJP in the bypolls.Also read: Centre's repeal announcement brings relief to Punjab farmersVictory for Punjab farmers comes at the cost of 669 livesPM's farm announcement a huge relief for BJP-JJP govt in HaryanaWithdrawal of farm laws impelled by 'fear of elections': ChidambaramRepeal of farm laws won’t end farm agitation, won’t help BJP politically: Supreme Court-appointed panel memberThe PM said when he was given the opportunity to serve the country in 2014, the government accorded the highest priority to agriculture development and farmer welfare.The PM said the government could not convince some farmers of the value of the farm laws and, therefore, the decision to repeal them was taken.“We not only increased the MSP, but also created a record number of government procurement centres. The procurement of the produce made by our government has broken records of the past several decades. The objective of the farm laws was that the farmers of the country, especially small farmers, should be strengthened, they should get the right price for their produce and maximum options to sell the produce,” the PM said seeking to justify the government move to reform the laws, a step that led to massive farmer protests with Delhi borders becoming the centre of the agitation.The PM said, “These laws were brought for the welfare of farmers, in the interest of the agriculture sector, for a bright future of the poor villagers, with full integrity, clear conscience and dedication towards farmers.”The PM said, “Such a sacred thing, a matter of farmers' interest, we could not explain to some farmers despite our efforts.”He added that ageicultural economists, scientists and progressive farmers also tried their best to make the farmers understand the importance of agricultural laws but failed.The PM announced the formation of a committee to promote zero budgeting-based agriculture, to change crop pattern as per the changing needs of the country and to make MSP more effective and transparent.“The committee will have representatives of the central government, state governments, farmers, agricultural scientists and agricultural economists,” he said.He said he had seen the challenges of the farmers closely in his five decades in public life. “That is why when I was given the opportunity to serve the country in 2014, we gave the highest priority to agriculture development and  farmer welfare.”The Prime Minister said four-prong measures of seeds, insurance, market and savings were taken to ameliorate the conditions of farmers.“Along with good quality seeds, the government also connected the farmers with facilities like neem-coated urea, soil health card and micro irrigation. Many initiatives have been taken for the farmers to get the right price for their produce in return for their hard work. The country has strengthened its rural market infrastructure,” said the PM.The Prime Minister said that for years, farmers, agricultural experts and farmer organisations had been making this demand.“Earlier also, many governments had brainstormed on this. This time also, there was a discussion in Parliament, brainstorming took place and these laws were brought in. In every nook and corner of the country, many farmer organisations welcomed and supported them. I express my gratitude to the organisations, farmers and individuals who supported the move,” said the PM.The PM said, “Today is not the day for blaming anyone and is in fact a day to rededicate oneself to working for the welfare of farmers.”The move comes ahead of the elections in seven states next year and a growing sense among government leaders that the farmers’ agitation is harming the party prospects.The withdrawal is reminiscent of a similar pullback of the government from the land acquisition law.The opposition was quick to react to the PM’s announcement with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi congratulating the farmers.“Farmers have forced an arrogant government to bow to their demands. Congratulations for this victory over injustice,” Gandhi said posting an old message where he had said, “Mark my words, the government will have to rescind farm laws.”Also read: Repealing farm laws a defining moment in history, says Parkash Singh BadalCapt Amarinder Singh thanks Modi on farm laws, sets the tone for his possible future alliance with BJPTMC chief Mamata Banerjee tweeted, “My heartfelt congratulations to every single farmer who fought relentlessly and were not fazed by the cruelty with which BJP treated you.
