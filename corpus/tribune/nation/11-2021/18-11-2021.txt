18-11-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||Pak law on Kulbhushan Jadhav has defects: MEA||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 17India was unimpressed by the Pakistani law enacted to bring into effect the judgement of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case.The law simply codifies the shortcomings of the previous ordinance, said MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi.Pakistan continues to deny unimpeded and unhindered consular access to Shri Jadhav and has failed to create an atmosphere in which a fair trial can be conducted, he added.“We have seen reports of Pakistan enacting into law the earlier ordinance that was ostensibly enacted to bring into effect the ICJ judgement. Nothing could have been further from the truth. As stated earlier, the ordinance did not create the machinery for an effective review and reconsideration of Jadhav’s case as mandated by the judgement of the ICJ,” he said in response to media queries on the joint sitting by Pakistan Parliament on Wednesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-law-on-kulbhushan-jadhav-has-defects-mea-339858
18-11-2021||New Delhi||Court must be alive to the contemporary reality of ‘ambush Public Interest Litigation’: SC||The Supreme Court on Thursday said this Court must be alive to the contemporary reality of “ambush Public Interest Litigations” that are filed with a conscious intention to obtain a dismissal and preclude genuine litigants from approaching the Court.The top court said while determining the applicability of the principle of ‘res judicata’ under provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, it must be conscious that grave issues of public interest are not lost in the woods merely because a petition was initially filed and dismissed, without a substantial adjudication on merits.Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 embodies the principles of ‘res judicata’ which bars the court from deciding issues that have been directly or substantially having been the subject matter in an earlier proceeding between the same parties or parties claiming under the same title and have been finally decided.A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and BV Nagarathna said, “there is a trend of poorly pleaded public interest litigations being filed instantly following a disclosure in the media, with a conscious intention to obtain a dismissal from the Court and preclude genuine litigants from approaching the Court in the public interest”.It said, “this Court must be alive to the contemporary reality of ‘ambush Public Interest Litigations’ and interpret the principles of res judicata or constructive res judicata in a manner which does not debar access to justice. The jurisdiction under Article 32 is a fundamental right in and of itself”.The top court remarks came in the verdict while rejecting the Centre’s submission that NGO’s plea challenging the proposed disinvestment of government’s 29.54 residuary shares in Hindustan Zinc Ltd should not be entertained as a similar plea was dismissed by the court in 2012.“In this case, since the three-judge Bench of this Court rejected the petition filed by Maton Mines Mazdoor Sangh (2012) in limine, without a substantive adjudication on the merits of their claim, the present writ petition is not barred by res judicata”, the bench said.

Mahatma Gandhi, who gave us Hindu Dharma. What Gandhiji practised was Hinduism. What Nathuram Godse practised was Hindutva. Why did Hindutva kill Hinduism? Why did Godse kill Mahatma Gandhi? Because he could not understand the tenets of Hindu religion, the philosophy of the world is one family, the Rig Vedic value that knowledge can flow from all sides. All Godse could understand is exclusiveness. Mahatma Gandhi understood Inclusiveness of the Hindu religion. Gandhi ji said accept everything. But Godse killed Gandhi ji because Gandhiji spoke of inter faith harmony,” said Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh.Vallabh also slammed actor Kangana Ranaut for anti-Mahatma Gandhi remarks and called her “ignorant government actor”.Vallabh repeated the demand of withdrawal of all national awards given to Ranaut.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nathuram-godse-followed-hindutva-killed-gandhi-greatest-practicing-hindu-congress-339852
18-11-2021||---||US body asks State Department to review exclusion of India from ‘Red List’||New Delhi, November 18The Chair of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), Nadine Maenza, has asked the US State Department to reconsider its refusal to put India along with Syria and Vietnam in the Red List of countries for threatening religious freedom.The USCIRF was also displeased with the removal of Nigeria from its Countries of Particular Concern (CPC) designation but welcomed the inclusion of Russia in this Red List. Though the USCIRF spoke of putting India, Syria and Vietnam in the Red List, its ire was directed more at not redesignating Nigeria as a CPC and treating it as a country “with no severe religious freedom violations”.The US State Department’s “Religious Freedom Designations” released on Wednesday listed 10 countries as CPC or in the Red List, including Pakistan, China, Iran, Russia, Myanmar and Saudi Arabia. While not acting on many of the USCIRF’s recommendations, Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested that there will be no let up on the issue in direct diplomatic conversations. “We will continue to press all governments to remedy shortcomings in their laws and practices, and to promote accountability for those responsible for abuses,” he said.Maenza said the State Department should make additional designations while welcoming the steps taken on some designations like that of Russia and the placing of Algeria, Comoros, Cuba and Nicaragua on a “Special Watch List” for governments that have engaged in or tolerated “severe violations of religious freedom”.The USCIRF was on the same page as the US State Department on Russia. Its Vice Chair Nury Turkel said, “While the USCIRF is concerned about the lack of designations for countries it had recommended, Russia’s designation for the first time as a CPC for engaging in systematic, ongoing and egregious violations of religious freedom is welcomed.”The USCIRF is a bipartisan federal government entity that monitors, analyses and reports on violations of religious freedom.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-body-asks-state-department-to-review-exclusion-of-india-from-red-list-339848

18-11-2021||New Delhi||Rajnath pays homage to fallen soldiers of battle of Rezang La||Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday inaugurated a revamped war memorial in eastern Ladakh’s Rezang La, the site of an epic battle at an altitude of 18,000 feet where over 100 Indian troops inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese military 59 years ago displaying indomitable grit and bravery.The battle of Rezang La is largely considered as the finest moment for the Indian Army in the India-China war six decades ago.Paying his tributes to the fallen heroes, Singh described the monument as an example of the determination and indomitable courage displayed by the Indian Army that he said is not “only immortal in the pages of history, but also beats in our hearts”.The defence minister said the “battle of Rezang La is considered one of the 10 greatest and most challenging military conflicts in the world.“The historic battle of Rezang La, fought at an altitude of 18,000 feet, is difficult to imagine even today. Major Shaitan Singh and his fellow soldiers fought till ‘last bullet and last breath’ and wrote a new chapter of bravery and sacrifice,” he said.“I am saluting the 114 Indian soldiers who made supreme sacrifices in the 1962 war after reaching Rezang La, located amidst the inaccessible hills of Ladakh,” Singh tweeted.The battle of Rezang La began at around 4 am on November 18, 1962, and lasted till around 10 pm during which the ‘C’ company of 13th battalion of the Kumaon Regiment led by Major Shaitan Singh not only stood their ground but inflicted heavy casualties on the Chinese despite being outnumbered by the adversary.Major Singh was later posthumously conferred with Param Vir Chakra, India’s highest military decoration.Defence Minister Singh also met Brig R B Jatar (retd) who was part of the battle of Rezang La.“I am overwhelmed by the feeling of respect for him and I salute his courage. May God keep them healthy and live long,” Singh said.The revamped war memorial has been thrown open at a time India and China have been locked in a bitter border row in eastern Ladakh for nearly one-and-half years.The Indian Army had occupied a number of mountain peaks in Rezang La region in August last year following China’s aggressive posturing and failed attempt to intimidate Indian troops.The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.The tension escalated following a deadly clash in Galwan Valley on June 15 last year.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in February and in the Gogra area in August.The last round of military talks on October 10 ended in a stalemate following which both sides blamed each other for the impasse.In a strong statement after the 13th round of talks, the Indian Army said the “constructive suggestions” made by it at the negotiations were neither agreeable to the Chinese side nor could Beijing provide any “forward-looking” proposals.Each side currently has around 50,000 to 60,000 troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the sensitive sector.

18-11-2021||New Delhi||Delhi riots: No intention to kill but scare, says man who pointed gun at cop||Shahrukh Pathan, who had allegedly pointed a gun at a Delhi Police head constable during the 2020 Delhi riots, on Thursday told a court here that he did not fire shots at the cop and merely wanted to scare him and not kill, a claim opposed by the prosecution.A photograph of Pathan pointing a gun at Delhi Police Head Constable Deepak Dahiya had gone viral on social media during the communal riots last year.He was arrested on March 3, 2020, and is currently lodged in Tihar Jail.To show that there was no attempt to murder the cop, Senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy, representing Pathan, played a 26-seconds long video of the incident in the court and said the accused fired two shots - one in the air and second to his right, following which he had a heated conversation with Dahiya and turned back.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat then asked the lawyer to replay the video and pointed towards the position of Pathan’s gun just before he shot fire in the air.“Look at the position of his gun. It is not pointed up. It is straight [at Dahiya]. When he is taking the aim, it is straight,” the judge noted.The advocate, however, clarified that neither of the two gunshots was aimed at the head constable.“The State’s case is based on Dahiya. He is the potential victim and is not fired at. The first is in the air and the second is on the right,” she said.Guruswamy added, “If I (accused) wanted to shoot him, I would have but that was not the intention. The accused turned around and ran away. Does any of this demonstrate the intention to kill or shoot him? At best, this is the intention to scare.”Pathan’s counsel said that he did not shoot Dahiya but instead asked him to step back.“We had a conversation as heated as it can be and then we retreated. Where is the intention to kill?” she submitted.She further said, “I had ample opportunity in this 26 seconds to kill Dahiya or to say the least to injure him. I am trying to scare him. Objectionable as it is for a citizen to scare a police officer, Section 307 IPC [attempt to murder] is not made out because I had no intention to kill.”Special Public Prosecutor Anuj Handa, appearing for the police, said that the accused had clearly pointed the gun at the cop.Opposing Guruswamy’s arguments that Pathan had no intention to kill the cop, Handa said, “The gun is pointed slightly downwards directly at the head of the complainant. His hand going upwards is because of the recoil after shots are fired.”“The question I ask myself is this, during the first part of the video, he shoots at the different directions of the mob, who might be belonging to the different community. Suppose any person would have succumbed to the injuries, would the offence not have been made out?” the prosecutor asked.Pathan is facing charges of offences such as rioting with a deadly weapon, an attempt to murder, assault, and obstructing public servants in the discharge of duty under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Arms Act.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi in February 2020, after violence between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiraled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.

18-11-2021||New Delhi||India exported over 65 million doses of Covid vaccines to nearly 100 countries this year: PM||India exported more than 65 million doses of Covid vaccines to nearly 100 countries this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, asserting that the global trust earned by the Indian healthcare sector has led to the country being called the “pharmacy of the world”.Speaking after inaugurating the first global innovation summit of the pharmaceutical sector, Modi said India’s vision is to create an eco-system for innovation that will make the country a leader in drug discovery and innovative medical devices.“Our policy interventions are being made based on wide consultations with all stakeholders,” he said.Noting that India has a large pool of scientists and technologists with a potential to take the industry to greater heights, Modi said this strength needs to be harnessed to “discover and make in India”.“Today, when 1.3 billion people of India have taken it upon themselves to make India ‘aatmanirbhar’, we must think about ramping up domestic manufacturing of key ingredients for vaccines and medicines,” he asserted.This is one frontier that India has to conquer, he said.“I invite you all to ideate in India, innovate in India, make in India and make for the world. Discover your true strength and serve the world,” Modi said in his remarks at the summit.He noted that whether it is lifestyle, or medicines, or medical technology, or vaccines, every aspect of healthcare has received global attention over the last two years.In this context, the Indian pharmaceutical industry has also risen to the challenge, Modi said.The global trust earned by the Indian healthcare sector has led to India being called the “pharmacy of the world” in recent times, he said.“We exported lifesaving medicines and medical equipment to over 150 countries during the initial phase of the pandemic,” Modi said.“We have also exported more than 65 million doses of Covid vaccines to nearly 100 countries this year,” the prime minister said, adding that India will do much more as it ramps up its capacity.He asserted that India’s definition of well-ness is not limited by physical boundaries and it believes in the well-being of the entire humankind.“And, we have shown this spirit to the whole world during the Covid-19 global pandemic,” he said.Employing nearly three million people and with a trade surplus of USD 13 billion, the pharma sector is a key driver of India’s economic growth, Modi said.India’s healthcare sector attracted foreign direct investment (FDI) of over USD 12 billion since 2014 and there is potential for much more, he said.The two-day summit will have 12 sessions and over 40 national and international speakers deliberating on a range of subjects, including regulatory environment, funding for innovation, industry-academia collaboration and innovation infrastructure, according to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).

18-11-2021||New Delhi||Delhi riots: Assembly panel asks Facebook to submit records on users’ reports for 3 months||A Delhi Assembly committee asked Facebook India on Thursday to furnish records of users’ reports (complaints) on the content posted on the platform one month prior and two months after the northeast Delhi riots in February 2020.Hearing a representation by Shivnath Thukral, the public policy director of Facebook India (Meta Platforms), in the Assembly, chairman of the Peace and Harmony Committee Raghav Chadha asked for the records.He also quizzed the Facebook official regarding the organisational structure, the complaints redressal mechanism, community standards and hate speech definitions with respect to the social media giant.Thukral said Facebook is not a law enforcement agency but it has a mechanism to co-operate with such agencies whenever required.“When things happen in the real world, they reflect on our platform as well. We do not want hate on our platform. There are some bad actors that need to be worked on,” he said during the hearing.Thukral said Facebook has 40,000 people working on content management, including 15,000 dealing with content moderation. Any content found against the community standards followed by the platform is taken down immediately, he added.Summonses were issued by the committee to Facebook India to put forward its views on the critical role of social media platforms in curbing the spread of false, provocative and malicious messages that can incite violence and disharmony.The panel has so far heard seven witnesses while examining the role of social media platforms in connection with the northeast Delhi riots that claimed over 50 lives and left hundreds of people injured in February 2020.

18-11-2021||New Delhi||India among countries with lowest quit rates for smoking, says new report||India ranks second in the number of smokers aged between 16 and 64 years and is among the nations with one of the lowest quit rates for smoking, according to a new report.The report prepared by ‘The International Commission to Reignite the Fight Against Smoking’ using secondary data from sources like the World Bank, said that China and India are home to more than 500 million tobacco users between the ages 16 and 64 years.“India ranks second with 2,50,002,133 smokers between 16 and 64 years of age. Tobacco prevalence in India is three times higher among men than women. India also accounts for some of the highest rates of smokeless tobacco use and oral cancer in the world,” it said.According to the report, 37 per cent of Indian respondents showed a desire to change behaviour with a plan to quit smoking. However, India is among countries with the lowest quit rates for smoking. The quit rates for men are less than 20 per cent, it noted.The report said an estimated 1.14 billion people worldwide still use tobacco, which kills nearly eight million people and eliminates nearly 200 million disability-adjusted life years annually.“The cost to the world is nearly USD 2 trillion a year. The drastic socio-economic impact makes it urgent to reignite the fight against smoking,” it said.According to the report, nearly all countries ban the marketing and direct sales of tobacco products to children but in low-to-middle income countries, these prohibitions are not rigorously enforced.The report cites data from Consumer Voice 2019, which states that despite prohibitions in India, a study of areas around 243 schools found nearby vendors displaying tobacco products in ways that are appealing to children and the youth.“Around 91 per cent of displays were at 1 meter (at a child’s eye level.) An estimated 54 per cent of the points of sale have no visible health warning; and 90 per cent of displays were beside candy, sweets and toys, items marketed to children,” it said.The report recommends adopting best practices to combat misinformation and build a healthier information environment to reduce harm from tobacco by leveraging multi-national, multi-disciplinary and participatory foresight studies.It advocated risk-proportionate regulations as a means of making it easier for smokers to quit while nudging expansion of access to tobacco-harm reduction products in low-to-middle-income countries.

18-11-2021||Mumbai||Sameer Wankhede ‘framed’ ex-wife’s cousin in drugs case to pressure her family not to speak against him: Nawab Malik||Maharashtra Minister Nawab Malik on Thursday levelled fresh allegations against Naroctics Control Bureau’s (NCB) Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede, saying the officer wrongly framed the cousin of his former wife in a drugs case to pressure her family not to speak against him.Talking to reporters here, NCP leader Malik said Wankhede also framed another youth, the son of an IPS officer, in a drugs case following a dispute with the latter’s family and the youth was subsequently arrested.Malik also strongly backed former Maharashtra home minister and party colleague Anil Deshmukh, arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case, saying he was being “framed” by misusing central agencies.On Wednesday, NCP president Sharad Pawar also said injustice was being done to Deshmukh, who is currently in judicial custody.Malik on Thursday continued his tirade against Wankhede, an Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer, who is married to actress Kranti Redkar since 2017. The NCB officer divorced his first wife Shabana Qureshi in 2016. “Wankhede thought his first wife will speak against him. So, through a peddler, Wankhede planted drugs and got her cousin arrested through the Anti-Narcotics Cell of the state police,” the minister alleged. “His first wife’s family was threatened that if they spoke against Wankhede, the entire family will be dubbed as drug peddlers and arrested,” he further charged. Malik has been attacking Wankhede following the NCB’s raid on a cruise party last month, following which around 20 people, including actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan, were arrested. Aryan Khan and some of the other accused were later released on bail. The minister has also accused Wankhede of wrongly framing people in drugs cases, and securing government job by forging his documents. Wankhede’s father recently filed a defamation case against Malik. On Wednesday, Malik sought the Bombay High Court’s permission to file an additional affidavit with documents to prove his allegations about Wankhede’s caste certificate, saying he wanted to submit the latter’s school admission forms and his primary school leaving certificate. These documents mention Wankhede’s religion as Muslim, he alleged. The minister had earlier alleged that the NCB officer was born a Muslim, but secured a central government job claiming to belong to a scheduled caste. Wankhede has denied the allegations levelled against him.

18-11-2021||Aditi Tandon||Congress leader Randeep Surjewala moves Supreme Court against ordinances extending tenures of ED, CBI chiefs||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 18Congress general secretary and chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala on Thursday moved the Supreme Court challenging the recent ordinances promulgated by the government to extend the service tenures of the CBI and ED chiefs from two to five years.The Congress leader also challenged the November 15 amendments by the Ministry of Personnel to the fundamental rules that allow such service extension.“The present writ petition is being filed under Article 32 of the Constitution challenging a set of Ordinances and a Notification published by the Respondents, namely, the Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021, dated 14.11.2021; Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021, dated 14.11.2021 along with the Corrigendum dated 15.11.2021; Notification No. G.S.R. 795(E) dated 15.11.2021 titled Fundamental (Amendment) Rules, 2021 issued by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions. These Ordinances empower the Government of India to provide piecemeal extensions (of one year each), following the conclusion of the fixed terms provided in their respective statutes, to the tenures of the Director of Enforcement and the Director, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). There are no criteria provided save for a vague reference to ‘public interest’ and is in fact, based on the subjective satisfaction of the Respondents. This has the direct and clear impact of eroding the independence of the investigative bodies in question,” the petition states.Surjewala says in his petition that the Ordinances and Government Notification were against the express principles and safeguards laid down by the Supreme Court in Vineet Narain vs Union of India (1998) case and Alok K Verma vs Union of India case.The two judgments categorically dealt with the need to ensure fixity of tenure for the Director, CBI, and expressly prohibit any further extension of tenure for the Director of Enforcement.“These Ordinances go against the aforementioned rulings that give much-needed stability to the tenure of Director of Enforcement and the Director, CBI, to protect them from political interference,” the petitioner states.The grounds for challenge mentioned in the petition include extension of tenure in an “ad-hoc and episodic fashion”.“Such extension in fact reaffirms the control of the executive over investigative agencies and is directly antithetical to their independent functioning. The Impugned Ordinances and Notification are also in direct contravention of the recommendations suggested by the Independent Review Committee (IRC) constituted in 1997 which recommended that the Director, CBI, should have a minimum tenure of two years, and that a “change in the existing Tenure Rules is not recommended,” the petitioner says.“The Ordinances and Notification reveal a clear abuse of power by the Respondents and also a flagrant contravention of the observations of this court,” states Surjewala.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-leader-randeep-surjewala-moves-supreme-court-against-ordinances-extending-tenures-of-ed-cbi-chiefs-339804

Suppose you are sitting abroad and taking legal recourse through power of attorney then what happens. If that is so then you will come to India if the court rules in your favour, we don't know what you have in mind. No protection, no hearing until we know where you are," said the bench also comprising Justice MM Sundresh.It said: "The petition has been filed through power of attorney. Where are you? Are you in this country or outside? In some state, where are you? We will come to the remaining, first we know where are you?"A magistrate's court in Bombay on Wednesday declared Singh a "proclaimed offender" in an extortion case registered against him and some other police officers in the city.Singh had last attended his office in May this year after which he went on leave. The state police had told the Bombay High Court last month that his whereabouts were not known.

18-11-2021||Tribune Web Desk||Gujarat couple plunges into sea as rope snaps while parasailing in Diu||Chandigarh, November 18On a holiday in Diu, Ajit Kathad and his wife got saved as they escaped a mid-air accident without injuries. The couple were parasailing off the Nagoa beach in Diu on Sunday when the rope of the parachute broke and they plunged into the sea. The mishap has been captured in a video that is doing the rounds on the internet. Ajit Kathad, 30, and his wife Sarla Kathad, 31, had life jackets on and were rescued by lifeguards deployed at the beach.In the mind-boggling video, one can see that within a minute after they were airborne, the rope connected to the powerboat that was dragging it snapped, leaving them unstrapped.Ajit Kathad’s elder brother Rakesh, who was on the powerboat, is heard screaming in panic as the coupled plunged into the sea. As he shouts, the boat operator tells him, ‘kain nahi thay (nothing will happen).He told The Indian Express, “I was recording the video and had no idea what to do when the rope broke. I could see my brother and sister-in-law falling from a great height and I never felt so helpless as I did at that moment.”Lifeguards of Palms Adventure and Motorsports, the private firm that runs the parasailing service, eventually saved the couple.“After the rope snapped just as we attained the maximum altitude, the parachute started swaying from one way to the other as we didn’t know how to control it. Seconds later, we plunged into the sea. While we remained afloat thanks to our life jackets, my wife was in a state of shock and couldn’t speak for a few minutes. We requested help from the powerboat to which our parachute was anchored but they told us the lifeguards would save us. Around five minutes later, the lifeguards came on another powerboat and rescued us,” Ajit, a multipurpose health worker (MPHW) at the Ghed Bagasara primary health centre (PHC) in Mangrol taluka of Junagadh told The Indian Express.Ajit’s brother, Rakesh, had even pointed out to the operators that the parachute rope looked worn-out but the operators in return assured him that nothing would happen. He was told that the frayed part of the rope would not be reeled out in the air.Here's the video: @VisitDiu @DiuTourismUT @DiuDistrict @VisitDNHandDDParasailing Accident,Safety measures in India,and they said very rudely that this is not our responsibility. Such things happens. Their response was absolutely pathetic.#safety #diu #fun #diutourism #accident pic.twitter.com/doN4vRNdO8The couple went to the Diu police station to file a complaint but later decided otherwise. However, they said the Palms Adventure and Motorsports staff was very rude and irresponsible. They told The Indian Express, “The response from the service operator was very irresponsible. They said we were rescued and nothing happened and no one died. We asked them if they are waiting to do something after someone dies. We asked why they did not pay heed to my brother’s complaint about the weak section of the rope. But they were rude. Therefore, I went to the police station with the intention to lodge a complaint. But returned without filing a complaint as my family members were still in shock,” said Ajit.The owner of PAM, Mohanbhai, blames the incident on strong winds. “It was an accident. The rope snapped all of a sudden, maybe, due to sudden strong winds, and the parachute remained unanchored for a while. But we had taken precautionary measures such as strapping the couple with life jackets and our lifeguards rescued them in no time,” Satvik told The Indian Express, adding, “As per safety protocols, we change the anchoring rope after every 100 flights. The rope that snapped was around 100-flight-old. But sometimes, the rope is cut by the edges of the winch (on the boat).” In parasailing, a parachute is anchored to a powerboat via a rope that is reeled in and out by a winch.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-couple-plunges-into-sea-as-rope-snaps-while-parasailing-in-diu-339795

You have to go to them,” he said.Stating that banks had adequate liquidity and non-performing loans are lowest in five years, he said despite the Covid pandemic, the banking sector had remained strong in the first half (April-September) in current fiscal. This has led to an upgrade in sector outlook by international agencies.He also said that the recently set up National Asset Reconstruction Co (NARCL) would help resolve Rs 2 lakh crore of stressed assets.“Reforms in last six-seven years have led to banking sector in a strong position today...We have addressed non-performing assets (NPAs) of banks, recapitalised banks, brought bankruptcy laws and strengthened debt recovery tribunal,” Modi added.

18-11-2021||New Delhi||India needs USD 10.1 trillion investment to achieve net-zero emission by 2070: Study||India will require a total investment of USD 10.1 trillion to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070, while the nation could face a shortfall of USD 3.5 trillion, a study by CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF) said.At the recently concluded COP26, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced India’s aim to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070.“India would need cumulative investments of USD 10.1 trillion to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070, according to an independent study released today by the CEEW Centre for Energy Finance (CEEW-CEF),” a statement said.According to the statement, these investments would help decarbonise India’s power, industrial, and transport sectors. However, the first-of-its-kind study also estimated that India could face a significant investment shortfall of USD 3.5 trillion to achieve its net-zero target.Hence, investment support of USD 1.4 trillion, in the form of concessional finance, would be required from developed economies to mobilise foreign capital that bridges the gap, it suggested.The CEEW-CEF study—Investment Sizing India’s 2070 Net-Zero Target—also highlighted that the majority of the investments would be needed to transform India’s power sector.Such investments, totalling USD 8.4 trillion, will be required to significantly scale up generation from renewable energy and associated integration, distribution and transmission infrastructure, the statement said.Another USD 1.5 trillion will have to be invested in the industrial sector for setting up green hydrogen production capacity to advance the sector’s decarbonisation, it added.“At COP26, India announced bold near-term and long-term climate targets. Our analysis finds that a transition to net-zero emissions would require mammoth investment support from developed countries.“Developed countries must ramp up hard targets for climate finance over the coming years. Also, on the domestic front, financial regulators like RBI and SEBI need to create an enabling ecosystem for financing India’s transition to a green economy.“Finally, given the size of the investments required, private capital, from both domestic and international institutions, should form the bulk of investment, while public funds should play a catalytic role by de-risking investments in existing and emerging clean technologies,” Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, CEEW, said.The study also pointed out that India’s USD 1.4 trillion concessional finance requirement would not be uniformly spread across the five decades till 2070. The average annual concessional finance requirement would vary from USD 8 billion in the first decade to USD 42 billion in the fifth decade.“India’s 2070 net-zero target is a bold commitment that would not only contribute to global decarbonisation efforts but would also shape how businesses and jobs of the future would look like.“Traditional domestic and foreign sources such as domestic banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), and debt capital markets - both local and international - would not be able to fund the massive investments needed by themselves. Therefore, access to foreign capital on concessional terms would have to play a key role,” Vaibhav Pratap Singh, Programme Lead and lead author of the study, said.

It's a headache for the entire world. You cannot be treating (Pakistan) with kid gloves,” he told a gathering of Indian-Americans.All major terrorist incidents of the world have their footprints in Pakistan, Madhav, also a member of the RSS national executive, said.“Look at the footprints. You will find them in Pakistan. A country that sponsors, promotes, funds, protects terrorists, is a safer haven for terrorists; we need to tackle that country,” Madhav said.He claimed that a group of intellectuals in Washington DC are busy defending Pakistan and its spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).“They (ISI) are the terror. But they have successfully convinced some intellectuals in America that they are trying very hard, but these terrorist groups are not coming under their control,” he said.In a lighter vein, Madhav told the Indian-Americans amidst laughter and applause that the ISI should send some of these terrorists to India, which would bring them under control.“Allow us to come there, we will weed them out,” Madhav said as he told the audience that India had successfully defeated terrorist groups, including in Kashmir.

A country’s low score on the domain of business interaction with government indicates a low opportunity for bribery due to minimal interface with the system.The highest bribe risk worldwide is in North Korea, ranked last on the table, followed by Turkmenistan, Eritrea and Venezuela. China slipped nine points on the rankings from 126 in 2020 to 135 in 2021.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-slips-5-points-in-global-bribery-risk-rankings-339386

18-11-2021||---||Pandemic turned pupils from private to govt schools: Report||New Delhi, November 17The pandemic period saw a considerable jump in government school enrolments across rural India with Punjab and Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Kerala powering the shift.The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), 2021, which assessed enrolment patterns, tuition trends and smartphone access of children in rural areas, on Wednesday revealed the government school enrolments had risen from 64.3 per cent in 2018 to 70.3 per cent in 2021. The corresponding decline in private school enrolments has been from 32.5 per cent in 2018 to 24.4 per cent this year.The survey across 25 states and three UTs covered 581 districts, 17,184 villages, 76,706 households and 75,234 children (aged between 5 and 16).The proportion of girls enrolled in government schools was higher than that of boys for each grade and age like before. Percentage point increase in government school enrolments between 2018 and 2021 has been the highest at 13.2 in UP, 11.9 Kerala, 9.6 Tamil Nadu, 9.4 Rajasthan, 9.2 Maharashtra, 8.4 Andhra, 8.3 Karnataka, 6.8 Punjab and 6.6 Haryana.The survey also found massive increase in the proportion of children taking tuitions. By 2021, close to 40 per cent of the children are taking tuitions. This was 28.6 per cent in 2018 and 32.5 per cent in 2020. Smartphone ownership has almost doubled from 36.5 per cent in 2018 to 67.6 per cent in 2021. However, more children in private schools have a smartphone at home (79 per cent) as opposed to government schoolchildren (63.7 per cent).Having a smartphone at home alone however does not automatically translate to children having access to the device. “Across all grades, 67.6% of all enrolled children have at least one smartphone available at home. But 26% of them have no access to it at all,” the report says.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pandemic-turned-pupils-from-private-to-govt-schools-report-339394

It asked the Centre and NCR states to implement in letter and spirit the decisions taken in the emergency meeting held by the Commission for Air Quality Management.The Bench – which also included Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Surya Kant – deferred the hearing to next Wednesday after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta urged it to postpone harsher steps as the Met Department had said the situation would improve after November 21. “Basically by November 21, nature will come to your rescue,” responded Justice Chandrachud.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, representing petitioner Aditya Dubey, said if there were no directions, “Let them (states) ensure there is no stubble burning.”During the hearing that went on for almost two hours, the top court pulled up the bureaucracy for its “don’t take any step” attitude in dealing with any situation, including air pollution. “They do not want to take any decision. They want courts to pass orders and they are happy to implement it,” it said. “What I am observing as a Judge and before it as an AG is that bureaucracy has gone into inertia and they don’t want to do anything, like using sprinklers or water buckets, we have to say. This is the attitude of the executive,” the CJI said. “It is apathy and just apathy,” added Justice Chandrachud.“There has to be some responsibility…not everything can be done through judicial order,” it noted.“What we’re seeing is the plight of farmers. People sitting in Delhi in five, seven-star hotels criticise how they (farmers) contribute 4, 30 or 40% to pollution. Have you seen their (farmers’) earning per landholding?” it said.The Bench said debates on TV channels was creating more pollution than anything else. “They don’t understand the issue and they say anything...They have their own agenda…We are here for a specific purpose. We want to bring down pollution from (AQI) 500 to a lower level,” it said.In an affidavit filed in the top court, the Centre said instead of asking its employees in Delhi to work from home, the DoPT has advised them to go for carpooling.The advocates representing Punjab, Haryana and Delhi informed the court about the steps being taken to tackle the problem.Delhi AQI ‘very poor’||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bureaucratic-inertia-on-poor-air-quality-draws-flak-from-supreme-court-339395
18-11-2021||---||Retired judge RK Jain to monitor Lakhimpur Kheri probe; Supreme Court recasts SIT||New Delhi, November 17The Supreme Court on Wednesday appointed Punjab and Haryana High Court’s retired judge Rakesh Kumar Jain to monitor the probe into the Lakhimpur Kheri violence “to assure full and complete justice to the victims of crime” in which eight persons, including four farmers, were killed on October 3.The move is aimed at ensuring transparency, fairness and absolute impartiality in the outcome of the investigation, which is to be conducted in a time-bound manner. CJI-headed BenchThe move was aimed “at ensuring transparency, fairness and absolute impartiality in the outcome of the investigation, which is tobe conducted in a time-bound manner,” said a Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana.The Bench — which included Justice Surya Kant and Justice Hima Kohli — also upgraded and reconstituted the SIT formed by the UP Government by appointing three IPS officers suggested by the state. The officers are SB Shiradkar, Padmaja Chauhan and Preetinder Singh.Shiradkar, an IPS officer of 1993 batch from Maharashtra and presently serving as ADG Intelligence in Uttar Pradesh, would head the SIT, the apex court said in its order. The newly constituted SIT shall be free to seek assistance or include local officers for taking the investigation to its logical conclusion under the continuous monitoring of Justice Jain, it said. “While investigating such offences, justice must not only be done, but also be seen and perceived to be done. We thus deem it appropriate to reconstitute the SIT…to preserve the faith and trust of people in the criminal administration of the justice system,” it said.“The SIT shall make all efforts to conclude the investigation expeditiously and file the chargesheet,” it said, adding the matter would be heard after the filing of the status report and chargesheet. The top court said given the “nascent stage of the investigation”, it was reluctant to make any observation on the merits of the case. Noting that most officers in the SIT were in the grade of sub-inspectors from Lakhmipur Kheri region, the Bench had on November 15 asked the state to upgrade it by including some IPS officers. Four farmers were mowed down by an SUV in Lakhimpur Kheri when they were holding a demonstration against UP Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit on October 3. Two BJP workers and a driver were beaten to death allegedly by angry protesters. A local journalist was also killed in the violence.Ten persons, including Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra, have so far been arrested in the case.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/retired-judge-rk-jain-to-monitor-lakhimpur-kheri-probe-supreme-court-recasts-sit-339396
18-11-2021||New Delhi||Students shifting from private to govt schools, finds Annual Status of Education Report||There has been a clear shift from private schools to government schools in the last three years, with Uttar Pradesh and Kerala reporting the maximum increase in government school enrolment, according to Annual Status of Education Report (ASER), 2021.At least 62 per cent of the surveyed principals have attributed the shift to financial distress while 15 per cent of them cited migration due to the pandemic, as the reason behind move to government schools.The report is based on a survey that was conducted in 25 states and three Union Territories. It covered a total of 76,706 households and 75,234 children in the age group of five to 16 years.“At an all-India level, there has been a clear shift from private to government schools. For children in the age group of six to 14, enrolment in private schools has decreased from 32.5 per cent in 2018 to 24.4 per cent in 2021,” the 16th ASER report released on Wednesday stated.“This shift is seen in all grades and among both boys and girls. However, boys are still more likely to be enrolled in private schools than girls,” it added.In government schools, the average enrolment in 2018 was 64.3 per cent which increased to 65.8 per cent last year and 70.3 per cent this year.From 2006 to 2014, there was a steady increase in private schooling. After plateauing at around 30 per cent for a few years, there has been a significant decline in the pandemic years.Even before COVID-19, the proportion of girls enrolled in government schools was higher than that of boys for each grade and age. This continues to be the trend over time, it noted.“With out of school numbers stabilising or falling between 2020 and 2021  private school enrolment continuing to decline and a majority of children being back in school, government school enrolment has jumped significantly,” according to the 16th ASER survey.“Many affordable smaller private schools have been shut down during the pandemic, this could also be driving the shift to government schools. Finally with many migrants moving back to their villages with their families, the demand for public education is likely to have gone up during this period,” it said.However, the report said, “Time will reveal if these patterns constitute a transitory phase, as schools reopen across states or whether they become a permanent feature of schooling in rural India.” The report pointed out that the maximum increase in government schools has been registered in Uttar Pradesh (13.2 per cent), followed by Kerala (11.9 per cent).Rajasthan (9.4 per cent), Maharashtra (9.2 per cent), Karnataka (8.3 per cent), Tamil Nadu (9.6 per cent), Andhra Pradesh (8.4 per cent), Telangana (3.7 per cent), Bihar (2.8 per cent), West Bengal (3.9 per cent) and Jharkhand (2.5 per cent) are among the states that have reported an increase in government school enrolments.A total of 4,872 schools, which had reopened post their closure due to the pandemic, were surveyed physically while in-charges of 2,427 schools that had not opened at the time of the survey were contacted via phone.The report pointed out that there was no change in the proportion of children aged six to 14 who were not enrolled in school.According to the report, the proportion of children not currently enrolled in school increased from 1.4 per cent to 4.6 per cent in 2020. This proportion remained unchanged between 2020 and 2021.Among children in the age group of 15-16, an increase in government school enrolment from 57.4 per cent in 2018 to 67.4 per cent in 2021 has been driven by a marked decline in the proportion of “out of school” children from 12.1 per cent in 2018 to 6.6 per cent in 2021, as well as by a decrease in private school enrolment, it added.“There is a fair amount of variation in enrolment at the state level. The national increase in government school enrolment is driven by large northern states such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana, and southern states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh,” the report said.“In contrast, in many north-eastern states, government school enrolment has fallen during this period, and the proportion of children not enrolled in school has increased,” it said.

18-11-2021||New Delhi||Number of people fully vaccinated against Covid-19 surpasses those partially vaccinated||The number of fully vaccinated individuals on Wednesday surpassed the partially vaccinated eligible population under the mass vaccination coverage, for the first time in the country.The country has in total administered 1,13,68,79,685 vaccines as per 7 a.m. provisional reports, with the administration of 67,82,042 vaccine doses in the last 24 hours.It has been achieved through 1,16,73,459 sessions out of which, 75,57,24,081 doses were administered as first dose and 38,11,55,604 doses were administered as second dose.The number of fully vaccinated individuals which stands at 38,11,55,604, exceed those who have been administered a single dose -- at 37,45,68,477."This feat has been made possible due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision of 'Jan-Bhagidari' and 'Whole of Government Approach', people's faith and confidence in the government, and the ongoing 'Har Ghar Dastak' campaign which has seen tremendous response from various parts of the country," Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said.Lauding the collective spirit of the country on this achievement, Mandaviya in a tweet appealed to all eligible citizens to get vaccinated. "We will win the battle against Covid-19 together," he stated.The Union Health Minister expressed confidence that the country will have vaccinated every Indian by the end of the month-long 'Har Ghar Dastak' campaign."The nation achieved the distinction of having administered 100 crore doses on October 21 this year. Subsequently, PM Modi gave a clarion call and launched the 'Har Ghar Dastak' campaign on November 3 to knock every door and reach out to every household and immunize every citizen against Covid-19 in the spirit of Antyodaya," Mandaviya said.The month long 'Har Ghar Dastak' vaccination campaign aims to ensure that all the adult population is covered with the first dose of Covid vaccine, while those who are due for the second doses are motivated to take the second dose.Healthcare workers are conducting door-to-door vaccination of eligible people across India with a special focus on districts where less than 50 per cent of the eligible population has been vaccinated. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/number-of-people-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-19-surpasses-those-partially-vaccinated-339345
18-11-2021||Mumbai||Former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh declared 'proclaimed offender' in extortion case||A magistrate’s court here on Wednesday declared former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh a “proclaimed offender” in an extortion case registered against him and other police officers in the city.The Crime Branch of Mumbai Police, which is probing the case, had sought the proclamation, saying that the IPS officer could not be traced even after the issuance of a non-bailable warrant against him.Under Section 82 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a court can publish a proclamation requiring an accused to appear if a warrant issued against him or her cannot be executed.As per Section 83, after issuing such a proclamation the court can also order attachment of the proclaimed offender’s properties.Former Assistant Police Inspector Sachin Vaze is also an accused in the case, registered at Goregaon police station in the City.Besides Param Bir Singh, co-accused Vinay Singh and Riyaz Bhatti were also declared as proclaimed offender by Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate S. B. Bhajipale.Bimal Agrawal, a real estate developer and hotelier, had alleged that the accused extorted Rs 9 lakh from him for not conducting raid on two bars and restaurants which he ran in partnership, and also forced him to buy two smartphones worth around Rs 2.92 lakh for them.The incidents occurred between January 2020 and March 2021, he had claimed.Following his complaint, a case was filed under Indian Penal Code sections 384 and 385 (both pertaining to extortion) and 34 (common intention) against six accused.Singh is facing an extortion case in Thane too.He was shunted out from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in March 2021 after Vaze was arrested in the case of the SUV with explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence and the death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran.Singh, subsequently, accused then-Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh of corruption, a charge the latter denied.

18-11-2021||New Delhi||Cong leaders Sibal, Tharoor back comedian Vir Das for 'Two Indias' monologue; BJP files complaint||Police complaints were filed against stand-up comic Vir Das in Mumbai and Delhi as the sharp debate on his video “I come from two Indias” on Wednesday mirrored the polarity of the monologue itself with celebs, politicians and a host of others speaking out.The well-known satirist, who has issued a statement saying his comments weren’t intended to insult the country, found backing from TMC member Mahua Moitra as well as Congress leaders Kapil Sibal and Shashi Tharoor. However, their fellow politician Abhishek Manu Singhvi criticised him for “vilifying the nation” and actor Kangana Ranaut stepped in too to demand strict action against the comedian.And moving from just polemics, Delhi BJP vice president Aditya Jha from Delhi and Mumbai lawyer Ashutosh J Dubey went to the police with their complaints. While Jha  alleged that Das made “derogatory” statements at an international platform with an intention to malign the country’s image, Dubey also held him responsible “for defaming & spoiling the image of India in the USA, which is inflammatory”. No FIRs have been filed as yet.Das, who is in the US right now, on Monday uploaded a six-minute video on YouTube titled “I come from two Indias”. It is part of his recent performance at the John F Kennedy Centre in Washington DC.The Mumbai-based artiste, who has also dabbled in cinema, touched on various topics in the clip, including the farm protests, the battle against Covid, the duality in response to women, particularly rape, and the crackdown on comedians.As the issue gathered steam, senior Congress leader Sibal on Wednesday tweeted that none can doubt that there are two Indias. “…Just that we don’t want an Indian to tell the world about it. We are intolerant and hypocritical,” he tweeted.Tharoor praised Das as a stand-up comedian who knows that the real meaning of the term “stand up” is not physical but moral.Das spoke for millions in the six-minute take on the ‘Two Indias’ he hails from and stands up for, he said on Twitter Tuesday night.Tagging a tweet by a person who said he has filed a complaint against Das with Mumbai police, Tharoor said, “We know which India this comes from.” TMC MP Moitra also backed the comedian, thanking him for speaking truth about “Two Indias”.“Reactions also from 2 Indias - one having a laugh & other filing complaints with police!” she tweeted.  There were also some voices of support from the Hindi film industry with filmmaker Hansal Mehta and actor-producer Pooja Bhatt hailing the comedian for his courage.“I was moved by this @virdas. I come from an India where it needs courage for a Vir Das to say this, I come from an India where many admire this courage, yet choose to remain silent,” the director said, sharing the comedian’s stand up clip.Bhatt responded to Mehta, saying, “You said it Hansal. I was not amused as much as I was moved-more by the audience that cheered with their heart for the India that chooses love over hate & shows great dignity & decency in the face of suffering & despair. One that can unashamedly cry for itself yet laugh at itself.” There were plenty of voices on the other side too, reflecting the deep schisms in the discourse.Congress leader Singhvi hit out at Das, saying that “generalising the evils of a few individuals and vilifying the nation as a whole in front of the world is just not done”       “The people who painted India in front of the west as a nation of saperas and luteras during the colonial rule have not ceased to exist,” the Rajya Sabha MP said on Twitter using the hashtag “VirDas”.Actor Ranaut, known for her often incendiary comments and facing a backlash for her comment that India’s Independence was “bheekh”, said Das’ remarks were “soft terrorism”.“When you generalise all Indian men as gang rapists it gives rise and encouragement to racism and bullying against Indians all over the world,” she said, comparing Das’ remarks to Winston Churchill’s infamous comments after the Bengal famine.“He blamed Indians sex drive/fertility for the death millions because of hunger... Such creative work targeting an entire race is soft terrorism... strict action must be taken against such criminals,” Ranaut posted on her Insta stories while tagging Das.Sharing her views, Delhi BJP spokesperson Aditya Jha lodged a complaint at the New Delhi district police station against the “derogatory” statements.“We have received a complaint in this regard and it is being inquired,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (New Delhi) Deepak Yadav said, adding that no FIR has been registered yet.Lawyer Dubey, whose Twitter bio says that he is the legal advisor of BJP-Maharashtra Palghar district, posted that he has filed a complaint against the comedian with the Mumbai Police.Dubey also criticised Tharoor for supporting Das and shared a tweet by BJP leader Kapil Mishra, who hailed Dubey for using “constitutional measures to stop hate against India”.A section on Twitter posted clips and pictures from his monologue,  many picking on what he said about women—“I come from an India where we worship women during the day and gang-rape them during the night.”               During his monologue on Monday, Das had predicted he would be accused of “airing their dirty laundry”. On Tuesday, he issued a clarification, saying his intention was to serve a reminder that the country, despite its issues, was “great”.“Please do not be fooled by edited snippets. People cheer for India with hope, not hate. People clap for India with respect, not malice. You cannot sell tickets, earn applause, or represent great people with negativity, only with pride. I take pride in my country, and I carry that pride across the world,” Das said.The 42-year-old  said his video is a satire about the duality of two very separate Indias that do different things.“Like any nation has light and dark, good and evil within it. None of this is a secret. The video appeals for us to never forget that we are great. To never stop focusing on what makes us great. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cong-leaders-sibal-tharoor-back-comedian-vir-das-for-two-indias-monologue-bjp-files-complaint-339300

Trucks, other than those carrying essential supplies, will not be allowed to enter Delhi till Sunday. It said these restrictions might be extended depending on the air pollution condition.The Bench – which also included Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Surya Kant – decided to defer the hearing to next Wednesday after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta urged the court to postpone harsher steps as the Met Department had said that the situation would be better after November 21.“I have a suggestion, meteorological scientists were also there in the emergency meeting and as per them the wind flow will be there after November 21. Would this court not consider waiting till November 21, before implementing harsher measures?” Mehta submitted.‘Basically by November 21 nature will come to your rescue,” responded Justice Chandrachud.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, representing petitioner Aditya Dubey, said if there were no directions, “let them (states) ensure there is no stubble burning”.During the hearing that went on for almost two hours, the top court pulled up the bureaucracy for its "don't take any step" attitude in dealing with any situation, including air pollution."They do not want to take any decision. They want courts to pass orders and they are happy to implement it,” it said, adding, “It is unfortunate that bureaucracy has come to this pass.”“What I am observing as a judge and before it as an AG, I have observed that bureaucracy has gone into inertia and they don't want to do anything, like using sprinklers or water buckets, we have to say. This is the attitude of the executive,” the CJI said.  “It is apathy and just apathy,” added Justice Chandrachud.“There has to be some responsibility…not everything can be done through judicial order,” the Bench noted.“What we’re seeing is the plight of farmers. People sitting in Delhi in five-, seven-star hotels criticise how they (farmers) contribute 30 or 40 per cent to pollution. Have you seen their (farmers’) earning per landholding? But we ignore the fact that firecrackers are burning even after Diwali…” it said.The Bench said debates on TV channels were creating more pollution than anything else. “They don't understand the issue and they say anything they like...They have their own agenda…We are here for a specific purpose. We want to bring down pollution from (AQI) 500 to a lower level,” it said.In an affidavit filed in the top court, the Centre said instead of asking its employees in Delhi to work from home, the DoPT has advised them to go for carpooling to curb air pollution by reducing the number of vehicles used by them for commuting.This has been done in view of the fact that things were getting back to normal after a long time due to Covid pandemic during which most of its employees worked from home, it said.“Can the minimum impact it has on pollution outweigh the impact it will have on pan India functioning? That’s why we have suggested pooling of vehicles,” the Solicitor General said.The advocates representing Punjab, Haryana and Delhi informed the court about the steps being taken to tackle the problem.At the outset, the Solicitor General said his submissions on Monday regarding the contribution to stubble burning to air pollution were misconstrued in the media, and "irresponsible and nasty utterances" were made against him. It was projected as if due to elections in Punjab, the Centre said only four per cent was the contribution of stubble burning to air pollution, he said.However, Justice Chandrachud said the Bench wasn’t misled at all. "I have repeatedly told you that you get this type of criticism when you hold a public office,” the CJI told Mehta.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-refrains-from-passing-any-orders-on-delhi-air-pollution-defers-hearing-to-november-24-339262
