07-11-2021||Vibha Sharma||BJP says headed toward ‘big victory’ in upcoming polls, praises PM Modi||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 7The BJP on Sunday said the party is headed towards a “big victory” in the states due for polls next year, giving ambitious organisational targets to cadres ahead of elections to key Assembly polls in 2022 and the general elections in 2024.Repeating Home Minister Amit Shah’s words as the president, BJP president JP Nadda said ‘utkarsh abhi baki hai’ (the best is yet to come). In his valedictory speech at the party national executive meeting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed confidence in the “reporting” by leaders of five poll-bound states and told the cadres to become a “bridge of faith for common man”.In his presidential address, Nadda said BJP has constituted booth-level committees for 85 per cent of the 10.40 lakh booths in the country and the remaining 15 per cent will be completed by December 25. The BJP will also constitute ‘panna’ (page) committees on the lines of Gujarat, the work for which will finish by April, 2022. The BJP is also “institutionalising” PM Modi’s ‘mann ki baat’ radio programme on booth-level from May 2022.Significantly, the political resolution moved by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath included the “resolve of victory in upcoming elections”.“We are headed towards a big victory in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur on the strength of development work of our governments and the organisation. All the surveys are also pointing towards this,” stated the 18-point resolution.Praising the Prime Minister, the resolution slammed Opposition parties, condemning their “opportunist politics”, accusing them of “derailing India’s vaccination programme”.“They were not to be seen on the streets during Covid, but did everything to create confusion on Twitter. At a time when Prime Minister was trying so hard to build trust within the country and image of the country, they were trying to weaken it,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, briefing about the resolutionIt lauded the Prime Minister, including for India’s position at COP26 in Glasgow and foreign policy, Covid management and vaccination programmes, providing “corruption-free government”, welfare and development works and pro-farmer steps. “Under the leadership of PM Modi, an atmosphere of safety, peace and prosperity has been created in J&K,” it said.Moving the resolution has placed Adityanath in the top league of the BJP leadership. In the past senior leaders like Rajnath Singh did the honours. In fact, Adityanath was supposed to attend the meeting virtually from Lucknow like other BJP chief ministers. However, to everyone’s surprise, he was present at the venue, a move that indicated support by PM Modi and his place in hierarchy.Meanwhile, the PM told cadres to move forward with ‘sewabhav’ and reposed faith in the “reporting” by chief ministers and state presidents of the poll-bound states on works being done by respective governments and state-level organisations .The BJP is not centered around any family and its values are ‘sewa, sankalp and samarpan’ (service, resolution and commitment), the PM said, asking party members to become a bridge of faith between the party and the common man. He too expressed confidence that the saffron will win the trust of people in the upcoming assembly polls.Meanwhile, a ‘sentimental’ Nadda thanked people of West Bengal and assured them that the party will “stand by them” and “save them in a democratic way, giving an apt reply to anarchist elements in the next elections”. There are some challenges before the party like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra and Odisha, places where the ‘sangathan’ (organisation) has to become stronger, Nadda said.As many as 342 members registered digitally for the meeting, the first one since the Covid pandemic.Veteran leaders LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi attended from their residences.BJP leaders were given books on India’s position at COP 26, its economy and the vaccination programme.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-says-headed-toward-big-victory-in-upcoming-polls-praises-pm-modi-335210

Aryan Khan was released on bail on October 30.On Friday, he had visited the NCB office here to mark his weekly presence as per the bail conditions set by the Bombay High Court. It was Aryan Khan’s first appearance at the NCB office after his release from the Arthur Road prison.In its order, the high court had said that Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha, his co-accused who were also released on bail, will have to surrender their passports before the NDPS court and shall not leave India without taking permission from the special court. Besides, they have to attend the NCB office each Friday between 11 am and 2 pm to mark their presence.

07-11-2021||New Delhi||SC to hear Lakhimpur Kheri violence matter on Monday||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Monday the matter related to the October 3 Lakhimpur Kheri incident in which eight people, including four farmers, were killed in violence during a farmers’ protest.A bench comprising Chief Justice N V Ramana and justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli would hear the matter in which the apex court had on October 26 directed the Uttar Pradesh government to provide protection to witnesses under the Witness Protection Scheme, 2018.The top court had also asked the Uttar Pradesh government to record the statements of other witnesses before the judicial magistrate under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and expedite the examination of digital evidence by experts.Statements under section 164 of the CrPC are recorded before a judicial magistrate and they have evidentiary value.The bench had sought a status report from the state government on the alleged lynching of a journalist and one Shyam Sundar by the mob, after a vehicle mowed down four protesting farmers.The top court is hearing the Lakhimpur Kheri matter after two lawyers had written to the CJI seeking a high-level judicial inquiry, also involving the CBI, into the incident.The counsel appearing for the state government had told the apex court on October 26 that out of 68 witnesses, the statements of 30 witnesses have been recorded under section 164 of the CrPC and some more testimonies will be recorded.“Of these 30 witnesses, 23 claim to be eye-witnesses. A lot of witnesses are formal witnesses of recovery and all,” the state’s counsel had told the bench, adding that 16 accused have been identified so far.The police have so far arrested several accused, including Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra, in connection with the case.Four farmers were mowed down by an SUV in Lakhimpur Kheri when a group agitating against the Centre’s three farm laws was holding a demonstration against the visit of Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya on October 3.Two BJP workers and a driver were beaten to death allegedly by the angry protesters, while a local journalist was also killed in the violence.Farmer leaders have claimed that Ashish Mishra was in one of the cars that allegedly knocked down the protesters but the minister has denied the allegations.Several farmer organisations are protesting against the three laws—The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 and Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 -- since last November.The apex court had stayed the implementation of these laws in January.Initially, the protests started from Punjab but later spread to Delhi, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.

The leaders are brushing aside the Huzurabad election -- where the Congress candidate has lost his deposit -- by calling it an extraordinary poll.Uttam Reddy said the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government had failed its farmers as paddy brought by farmers to mandis years ago was still waiting for its turn for weighing and purchase.He said that as paddy was the main crop in the State, the slow procurement directly affects every farmer. He said, Though there is notification concerning procurement of paddy, the State government has remained insensitive, resulting in the hardship to the farmers of the State,”He demanded that the TRS government ensure that the farmers were given the Minimum Support Price of Rs 1,960. He lashed at the government for telling farmers to refrain from planting paddy for the yasangi crop season.Reddy said despite approval of the Rs 2 lakh crore budget in the Vidhan Sabha, the State was incapable of handling the purchase of paddy, putting the farmers into a lot of hardship.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/congress-to-back-farmers-to-stay-relevant-in-telangana-335194

Meanwhile, as we look ahead to negotiations in week two of COP, I urge all parties to come to the table with the constructive compromises and ambitions needed,” he said.Others besides India to sign up to the action plan include Australia, Uganda, Madagascar, Tanzania, Vietnam, Nigeria, Lesotho, Laos, Indonesia, Guinea, Ghana, Germany, Philippines, Ethiopia, UK, Colombia, Costa Rica, Morocco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Philippines, Sierra Leone, Spain, Switzerland and the UAE.The announcement follows Ocean Action Day on Friday of over 10 new countries signing up to the “30by30” target to protect 30 per cent of the world’s ocean by 2030.These include India, Bahrain, Jamaica, St Lucia, Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia, India, Qatar, Samoa, Tonga, Gambia and Georgia, with the target now supported by over 100 countries.Among other developments from week one of the COP26 climate summit, the World Bank will commit to spending USD 25 billion in climate finance annually to 2025 through its Climate Action Plan, including a focus on agriculture and food systems.The conclusion of the first week, which opened with the World Leaders’ Summit attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was marked by a massive protest march by environmental activists in Glasgow on Saturday.Swedish activist Greta Thunberg joined thousands at the “Global Day of Action for Climate Justice” march, the biggest so far during the COP26 summit which took place alongside hundreds of similar events around the world.After a brief break on Sunday, the climate talks will resume on Monday and conclude at the end of the summit next Friday.

There is already an Ayodhya station. Passengers will face confusion now.”Ram, who moved to Faizabad from Jalalabad in Shahjahanpur district when he was 12, said he was now in two minds - whether to call it “Faizabad” or “Ayodhya Cantt” while ferrying his passengers.Rajesh Kumar, 30, who has been working as a coolie at the Faizabad Junction since 2008, is equally perplexed after the renaming of the station that is said to have been opened in 1874.He showed the engraving on his brass badge: ‘Licenced Porter N.R. 77 Faizabad’ and then pointed towards the temporary banner at the station’s porch which carries the new name ‘Ayodhya Cantt’ in bold black fonts and in four languages—Hindi, Sanskrit, English and Urdu.“It will create a lot of confusion as there is Ayodhya City station already, about 10 km from here. Passengers coming to Faizabad or Ayodhya for the first time may end up getting down at the wrong destination,” he said.Faizabad city is located about 7 km from its twin town Ayodhya in Ayodhya district (earlier Faizabad district) and the Faizabad station is a major railway junction, which comes under the Northern Railway zone and falls in the Lucknow-Varanasi section. Ayodhya town is located about 120 km from state capital Lucknow.The trilingual signages—English, Hindi and Urdu—which earlier stood on top of the station building’s facade were removed recently after railway authorities issued an order on its renaming.On the day of Diwali, old station signboards were also painted over, replacing ‘Faizabad Junction’ (station code FD) with ‘Ayodhya Cantt’ (station code AYC).Posters have been put up by authorities on walls of the station premises, including at the enquiry counter, with a message in Hindi: ‘The public is hereby informed that from today, 02-11-2021 onwards, the name of Faizabad Jn station has been changed to Ayodhya Cantt’.A semi-circular poster fitted over the exit arch at platform 1 of the station carries an image of Lord Ram and a model of the proposed Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.However, railway time tables on display and train coaches’ labels still carry the ‘Faizabad’ name, contrasting with its new moniker ‘Ayodhya Cantt’ on station signboards.Also, a signage by Uttar Pradesh tourism outside station premises still carries the old name of the station, so does the welcome gate of the junction on the street outside.Ankit Pandey, 25, a tourist guide based in Ayodhya town, who takes pilgrims to Ramjanmabhoomi site, Hanuman Garhi and Kanak Bhawan in the temple town, said, “Renaming was necessary. Faizabad name cannot remain as the entire district is Ayodhya now, and Ayodhya is Prabhu Shri Ram ki Nagari”.While the opposition has dubbed the move as an attempt to play with Hindu sentiments for political benefits, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has justified the renaming, saying it is part of the efforts to “restore the rich historical and cultural identity” of the place.Manzar Mehdi, historian and editor of a Faizabad-based bilingual publication ‘Aap ki Taqat’, which promotes communal harmony with the slogan ‘Hindu-Muslim do bhai, Hindi-Urdu do behen’, feels dejected over the renaming.He alleged it was all “driven by dirty politics” and an “attempt to erase the very identity of Faizabad”.Mehdi, however, points out that many shops, government offices and other establishments in Chowk continue to use the old name ‘Faizabad’ on their boards or ‘Faizabad, Ayodhya’ referring to both the old city name and the new district name.“Faizabad was the first capital of the Nawabs of Awadh, saw a period of glory and has a rich architectural and literary heritage. I revere Ayodhya as a holy place, but my Faizabad has its own identity. Faizabad will neither be erased or replaced from my office board as long as I am alive,” he said.The BJP government had also renamed Allahabad as Prayagraj and Mughalsarai Railway Junction to Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Junction in 2018.Mehdi fears that more cities with Islamic names in Uttar Pradesh might get renamed.Delhi-based historian and author Rana Safvi said Ayodhya and Faizabad have always been known as twin towns and are a symbol of India’s “Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb (syncretic culture)”.“It’s not that Ayodhya was the old name of Faizabad. These are two different cities with different cultures and have co-existed for centuries. Now, they don’t want that co-existence. They can change names of a place or a station but I feel Faizabad has been etched in the hearts of the people,” she said.

07-11-2021||Mumbai||Has Union govt privatised prisons, central probe agencies: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday took a swipe at the BJP, wondering if the Union government has privatised prisons and central probe agencies.Speaking to reporters here, Raut said every day BJP leaders, who recently joined the party and had “no connection with the party ideology”, were threatening to put political rivals in jail.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi is privatising all public and government assets. Have prisons and central probe agencies been privatised? Are prisons your private property?” the Rajya Sabha member sought to know.Notably, former Maharashtra home minister and NCP leader Anil Deshmukh, whose party shares power with the Shiv Sena and Congress in the state, was earlier this month arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with a money laundering case.Maharashtra Transport Minister and Shiv Sena MLA Anil Parab had earlier appeared before the ED in connection with a money laundering case registered against Deshmukh and others.The Income Tax department last month raided some businesses linked to family members of state Deputy Chief Minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar.The ED recently summoned Shiv Sena MP Bhavana Gawali in another money laundering case.The agency had arrested her aide Saeed Khan in this criminal case filed under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering (PMLA) Act.

07-11-2021||New Delhi||We will ensure victory in the upcoming elections, says BJP in its political resolution||The Bharatiya Janata Part on Sunday “resolved” to ensure victory in the Assembly elections slated early next year.“There is a specific mention that we shall ensure victory in the upcoming elections,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, elaborating on the 18-point resolution passed by the saffron party BJP in its national executive meeting. “There was good positivity, energetic support, and complete unconditional support to see the party win in all these elections,” Sitharaman said.The resolution also slammed Opposition parties and condemned their “opportunist politics”.  “They were not to be seen on the streets during Covid, but did everything to create confusion on Twitter. At the time when Prime Minister was trying so hard to build trust within the country and image of the country, they were trying to weaken it,” said Sitharaman, briefing on the resolution moved by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath and seconded by Tamil Nadu BJP chief K Annamalai.The resolution lauded India’s position on climate change in the ongoing COP26 at Glasgow, vaccination programme, and other achievements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, including “corruption-free government” and “reduction in terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir.“J&K is moving towards less trouble and more development,” she said.On why Adityanath was asked to move the political resolution, Sitharaman said: “He is a senior leader of the party and CM of the biggest state of the country. The state has done so well in tackling Covid and generating jobs, why not (should he have been asked)?”Regarding the ongoing farmers' agitation, Sitharaman said that on this issue Agriculture Minister Narendra Tomar has held several rounds of talks with farmers. “They (farmers) have to tell which is one point they have an objection to. To date, they have not specified one point. If the opposition wants to raise this issue without telling that one point their story will also be incomplete,” she said on opposition parties making the three laws and the agitation an election issue in upcoming polls.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-will-ensure-victory-in-the-upcoming-elections-says-bjp-in-its-political-resolution-335171
07-11-2021||New Delhi||Over 30 states, UTs to use IIT Madras’ data driven model to make roads safer, improve trauma care||Over 32 states and Union Territories in the country have come on board for using a data-driven model developed by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras to help them make their roads safer and improve emergency response as well as trauma care.With road safety experts citing quality data crunch as a major roadblock in policy making and implementation in India, the model has been officially adopted by the Ministry of Road and Transport with funding from the World Bank.The IIT team has signed up MoUs with the state governments to help them develop a road map towards reaching the SDG goal of 50 per cent reduction in road fatalities by 2030 and eventually to zero deaths from road traffic accidents.              The team will also help states build strategies and implementation work packages for all stakeholder departments to work on safe roads and help build a data driven trauma care with institutional registry.According to Venkatesh Balasubramanian, Professor at Department of Engineering Design, IIT Madras, initially the project was launched on a pilot basis with six states with highest fatality rate in road crashes.The six states are Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.“However, as many as 27 states and five Union Territories across India are in various stages of implementing Integrated Road Accident Database (iRAD) now. At least 11 states and one Union Territory have already started live data collection using iRAD,” Balasubramanian told PTI.Under the project, a mobile application has been developed which enables police personnel to enter details about a road accident, along with photos and videos, following which a unique ID is created for the incident.Subsequently, an engineer from the Public Works Department or the local body will receive an alert on his mobile device. He or she will then visit the accident site, examine it, and feed the required details, such as the road design.“Data thus collected will be analysed by a team at IIT-Madras which will then suggest if corrective measures in road design need to be taken. Road safety is a collective responsibility of all the stakeholders.“Therefore, it is quintessential to develop a good strategy based on data. It is, therefore, necessary to have a design thinking approach to solve the problem by not just identifying the issues but implementing changes that are sustainable in the local conditions,” he said.The World Health Organisation classified India’s official data on road traffic fatalities as “unusable” or “unavailable” because of “quality issues” in the Global Health Estimates released in December 2020.A recent study by IIT Delhi had pointed out that the non-fatal injury data in India is unreliable and the biases implicit in which cases get recorded. Road safety experts have also pointed out that the government data on road crash deaths are not complete because the data reporting process of the police departments is flawed, there is significant under-reporting especially in rural India, and not enough public trust in the police.According to Road Transport and Highways Minister, Nitin Gadkari, the dream for India to be a five trillion economy will be met only when we can have safe roads for movement of goods and humans across the country in a timely manner.“While we have been consistently meeting and performing above our targets for laying roads, we continue to be dampened by the loss incurred in the form of accidents. With around 1,55,000 fatalities annually on all our road networks, road safety is a priority task for the ministry to improve efficiency of transit and propel the nation in its development journey,” he said.The officials from the Road and Transport Ministry asserted that the project will help enrich the accident databases from every parts of the country.“iRAD is one of our flagship road safety initiatives which has been conceptualised and designed by IIT Madras. It has enabled structured accident data collection involving all stakeholders. This is a single platform being implemented across India. This shall help the states and centre government and all stakeholders to develop strategies to improve road efficiency, and assess impact of improvements made,” said Giridhar Aramane, Secretary, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.The IIT Madras team explained that the project would generate various types of insights by analysing the collected road accident data across the country through implementation of data analytics technique.“The proposed system would represent the analysis output through Monitoring and Reporting dashboard and Analytics dashboard for easy understanding, accordingly forecasting and decision making by apex authorities for formulation of new policies and strategies,” a researcher and member of the team said.Rajasthan, which has been one of the lead states in implementation of the iRAD project, has trained its staff in over 30 districts already to use the model.“Using the model, we have recorded over 18,000 accidents in the state so far in nearly six months. While over 70 per cent of them were due to over speeding, the second highest reason behind the road accidents in the state were due to road engineering issues,” Mahendra Soni, Rajasthan Transport Commissioner, told PTI.“Ultimately linking iRAD with insurance services, integrated ambulance registry and mapping trauma care will be a game changer in the road safety drive,” he added.

07-11-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC remands ex-Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh in ED custody till Nov 12||The Bombay High Court on Sunday set aside a special court’s order remanding former Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh to judicial custody, and sent him in the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) custody till November 12 in a money laundering case.A vacation bench of Justice Madhav Jamdar was hearing an application filed by the ED, challenging the special court’s order of November 6 remanding Deshmukh to 14-day judicial custody, on the ground that it was bad in law and against the principles of natural justice.Deshmukh’s counsel Vikram Chaudhri and advocate Aniket Nikam told the court that while they were opposing the plea on merits and maintainability, the NCP leader has consented and volunteered to be interrogated by the ED.The court then remanded Deshmukh to ED custody till November 12.Deshmukh was arrested by the ED on November 1 after 12 hours of questioning in connection with a multi-crore money laundering case.He was produced before a special holiday court on November 2 which remanded him to ED’s custody till November 6.When he was produced before the special court on Saturday, the ED had sought further custody, but the court refused and sent him in judicial custody.The ED had initiated a probe against Deshmukh and his associates after the CBI filed its FIR against the NCP leader on April 21 on charges of corruption and misuse of official position.The ED had earlier arrested two persons in the case – Sanjeev Palande (additional collector rank official who was working as Deshmukh’s private secretary) and Kundan Shinde (Deshmukh’s personal assistant).The agency earlier submitted its prosecution complaint (equivalent to a charge sheet) against the duo before a special court.

07-11-2021||Pune||Maharashtra hospital fire: Some Covid-19 patients died due to smoke, say police||A day after a major fire at the ICU of a civil hospital in Maharashtra’s Ahmednagar district killed 11 people, it has emerged that some of the victims died due to smoke which engulfed the ward following the blaze, according to a police official.The blaze erupted around 11 am on Saturday in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) ward where 17 COVID-19 patients, many of them senior citizens and some on ventilator or oxygen, were undergoing treatment at the hospital in Ahmednagar, located 120 km from Pune and 253 km from Mumbai.The ward had been added to the hospital after the pandemic began, officials earlier said.“Some patients died of burns, while some died due to the smoke. We are waiting for a detailed postmortem report. Further investigation in the case is on,” Topkhana police station’s assistant police inspector Juber Mujawar said on Sunday.One of the deceased is yet to be identified, he said.Late Saturday evening, a case was registered against unidentified persons under Indian Penal Code Section 304 (A) (causing death by negligence), Ahmednagar district Superintendent of Police Manoj Patil.A short circuit was suspected to be the cause of the blaze, though it was yet to be confirmed, chief fire officer of the city civic body Shankar Misal said.According to the patients’ relatives who normally waited in the corridor outside the ICU, they had been asked to step out as cleaning was going on. Many of them rushed back when they saw thick black smoke billowing from the ward and tried to rescue the patients.As per district Collector Rajendra Bhosale, a fire audit had been carried out at the hospital. But according to Misal, after the audit, the work of installing necessary safety systems was incomplete due to “want of funds”.Most of those who died were aged between 65 and 83, according to hospital officials.A probe committee headed by Misal will look into what led to the tragedy, the collector earlier said.Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday said an in-depth probe will be conducted by the district collector, according to a statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Office.Maharashtra Energy Minister Nitin Raut ordered a detailed inquiry into the fire.

They helped get freedom and never backed away from any struggle,” he had said.During a programme launching online transfer of money in the accounts of parents of 1.80 crore students, Yogi said, “Remember, if education is incomplete, culture is lacking, then you cannot expect that person to feel the difference between a national hero and a traitor.” — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sp-chief-cultureless-says-yogi-over-jinnah-remark-334792

A court on Tuesday remanded him in the agency’s custody till November 6. He was produced before the special court at the end of his ED custody.While seeking his further custody, the ED told the court that the NCP leader was evasive in his reply and gave vague answers. The money laundering case against Deshmukh and others was made out after the CBI booked him in a corruption case related to allegations of at least Rs 100 crore bribery made by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh.The ED alleged that their investigation has revealed that 27 companies, which are directly or indirectly controlled by Deshmukh and his family, have been utilised for infusion of his ill-gotten money. The ED said another accused, Sachin Waze, has a significant role in this money laundering case as he has played a key role in collecting the illegal gratification from the bar owners of Mumbai at the direction of Anil Deshmukh. From the investigation, it is clear that Anil Deshmukh received approximately Rs 4.70 crore, collected from the orchestra bar owners/managers for smooth functioning of bars, the ED said. Part of the said bribe money was sent to his trust Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha with the help of Delhi-based paper companies by attempting to colour it as a donation.Besides Anil Deshmukh, the Enforcement Directorate had arrested his two aides — Kundan Shinde and Sanjeev Palande — in connection with the case. The duo is currently in judicial custody.

MEA spokespersons have said the USCIRF was biased and had a limited understanding of India and its Constitution. No US Secretary of State has acted on its recommendations as far as India is concerned.Last year, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had declined the USCIRF’s recommendation to list India as a CPC. He had not even accepted USCIRF’s recommendation to put Uzbekistan on the list as the country is deemed strategically important for US foreign policy interests. India is of far greater value in its economic and military heft. Three of India’s neighbours — Pakistan, China and Myanmar—are on the department’s CPC list along with North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Nigeria.Successive US Ambassadors for Religious Freedom have drawn a sharp distinction between India and Pakistan, though both are accused of state-sponsored violence on its citizens. “Some of the violence in India was carried out by the government but a lot of the actions are by the government in Pakistan… half of the world’s people who are locked up for apostasy or blasphemy are in Pakistan,” the US Ambassador for Religious Freedom Senator Sam Brownback had said last year when asked why Pakistan was on CPC and India wasn’t.For the 2020 reporting period, the US body has also recommended the expansion of “yellow list” or the Special Watch List (SWL) to include countries such as Afghanistan, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Turkey and Uzbekistan.MEA calls it bias||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/religious-freedom-us-body-wants-india-russia-placed-on-red-list-334811

The annual India-France Strategic Dialogue, co-chaired by NSA Ajit Doval and French President’s Diplomatic Adviser Emmanuel Bonne in Paris, agreed to pursue new initiatives in maritime, space and cyber domains, according to an official release.The French Presidency of the EU in the first half of 2022 is expected to give a further shape to EU’s engagement in the Indo-Pacific region — security, connectivity and economic development included.With France and India aiming for a major defence and security partnership in the Indo-Pacific, NSA Doval called on French President Emmanuel Macron, Defence Minister Florence Parly and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. The areas discussed were expansion of bilateral and regional cooperation, ways to deal with new threats and support to India’s defence industrialisation.Doval also discussed the long-term challenges in the Indo-Pacific, Afghanistan, Africa, Southeast Asia and West Asia. With territories retained since colonial time in the Indo-Pacific, France is a major player and has been seeking to step up its activities bilaterally with regional maritime powers as well as through the EU. During his last visit to India in January, Bonne had called on PM Narendra Modi and interacted with NSA Doval. He had said France was supportive of India on Kashmir and “does not allow China to play procedural games” at the UNSC.But French opposition to the Chinese is nuanced. Three weeks later, at the China-France annual dialogue co-chaired by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Bonne said Beijing was “an important strategic cooperative partner of France.” Defence and security, that usually denotes closeness between nations, was not mentioned.In April, Bonne and Wang Yi spoke on the phone.

07-11-2021||---||India, France to step up defence, security ties||New Delhi, November 6India and France have agreed to strengthen bilateral defence and security partnership through enhanced intelligence and information sharing, operational cooperation and bolstering mutual capabilities.The annual India-France Strategic Dialogue co-chaired by NSA Ajit Doval and French President’s Diplomatic Advisor Emmanuel Bonne in Paris also agreed to pursue new initiatives in maritime, space and cyber domains, according to an official news release.The French presidency of the EU in the first half of 2022 is expected to give further shape to EU’s engagement in the Indo-Pacific region, including in security, connectivity and economic development.With both France and India aiming for a major defence and security partnership in the Indo Pacific, NSA Doval also called on French President Emmanuel Macron, Defence Minister Florence Parly and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. The areas discussed were expansion of bilateral and regional cooperation, dealing with new threats and support to India’s defence industrialisation, said the official release.NSA Doval also discussed the long-term challenges in the Indo-Pacific region; Afghanistan, Africa, Southeast Asia and West Asia.With territories retained since colonial time in the Indo-Pacific, France is a major player and has been seeking to step up its activities bilaterally with regional maritime powers as well as through the EU.During his last visit to India in January, Bonne had called on PM Narendra Modi and interacted with NSA Doval. He had also said France was supportive of India on Kashmir and does not allow China to play “procedural games” at UNSC.But French opposition to the Chinese is nuanced. Three weeks later, at the China-France annual dialogue co-chaired by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Bonne said Beijing was “an important strategic cooperative partner of France”. But defence and security, that usually denotes the closeness between nations, was not mentioned.Two months later in April this year, Bonne and Wang Yi spoke on the phone. Bonne, who had initiated the call, said France was ready to strengthen communication with China in civil nuclear energy, aerospace and public health, and jointly address climate change, biodiversity and other global challenges.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-france-to-step-up-defence-security-ties-334762

07-11-2021||---||US human rights body for placing India, Russia on Red List for religious freedom||New Delhi, November 6A month before the US State Department releases its religious freedom rights rankings, a US human rights body has recommended that it should put four more countries, including India, on its Red List or Countries of Particular Concern (CPC).The MEA has frequently slammed the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), the body which has made the recommendations. MEA spokespersons have said the USCIRF is biased and has a limited understanding of India and its Constitution. No US Secretary of State has acted on its recommendations as far as India is concerned.Last year, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had declined the USCIRF’s recommendation to list India as a CPC. He had not even accepted USCIRF's recommendation to put Uzbekistan on the Red List as the country is deemed strategically important for US foreign policy interests. India is of far greater value in its economic and military heft.       Three of India’s neighbours – Pakistan, China and Myanmar -- are on the US State Department’s CPC list along with North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Nigeria. The USCIRF wants the State Department to add India, Russia, Syria and Vietnam to the list.Successive US Ambassadors for Religious Freedom have drawn a sharp distinction between India and Pakistan, though both are accused of state violence on its citizens. Some of the violence in India was carried out by the government but a “lot of the actions are by the government in Pakistan” and half of the world’s people that are locked up for apostasy or blasphemy are in Pakistan, the US Ambassador for Religious Freedom Senator Sam Brownback had said last year when asked why Pakistan was on CPC and India wasn’t.For the 2020 reporting period, USCIRF has also recommended the expansion of “Yellow List” or the Special Watch List to include Afghanistan, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Turkey and Uzbekistan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-human-rights-body-for-placing-india-russia-on-red-list-for-religious-freedom-334701
