Four days before his superannuation on July 31, the Appointments Committee of Cabinet appointed him as Delhi Police commissioner. He will have one-year tenure as Delhi Police chief.His appointment as Delhi Police Commissioner was challenged mainly on the ground that it went against the top court’s ruling on such appointments in Prakash Singh’s case (2006) on police reforms.However, the high court had said the Supreme Court’s decision in the Prakash Singh case, which mandated a minimum tenure for certain police officials and the constitution of a UPSC panel before selection, was not applicable to the appointment of Police Commissioner for Delhi as the directions were “intended to apply only to the appointment of a State DGP”.The HC had said: “It ought to be kept in mind that Delhi, being the Capital of India, has a unique, special, and specific requirement. It has witnessed several untoward incidents and extremely challenging law and order situations/riots/ crimes, which have an international implication, which in the wisdom of the Central Government necessitated the appointment of an experienced officer possessing diverse and multifarious experience of heading a large Para-Military Security Force apart from other factors”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-pil-against-rakesh-asthanas-appointment-as-delhi-police-chief-343108
26-11-2021||New Delhi||India’s growth story being disrupted by forces with colonial mindset: PM Narendra Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said India’s growth story is being disrupted by forces with a colonial mindset, including in the name of freedom of expression.Addressing a Constitution Day event organised by the Supreme Court, he said a colonial mindset still exists, years after the end to colonialism, and these forces are putting obstacles in the path of growth of the developing nations.“We are the only country that is in the process of achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement ahead of time and yet, in the name of environment, various pressures are being created on India. All this is the result of a colonial mindset,” the prime minister said.“But the unfortunate thing is that in our country too, due to such a mindset, obstacles are being put in the path of development, sometimes in the name of freedom of expression and sometimes with the help of something else,” he added.The Constitution is the greatest strength to remove the obstacles being created by a colonial mindset, Modi said.He said both the government and the judiciary are born out of the Constitution and hence, they are twins.The government and the judiciary have come into existence only because of the Constitution, the prime minister said, adding that the two complement each other even while being different.He said “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas” is a powerful manifestation of the Constitution’s spirit.Modi said a government dedicated to the Constitution does not discriminate when it comes to development and “we have shown that”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indias-growth-story-being-disrupted-by-forces-with-colonial-mindset-pm-naredra-modi-343099

This also has life-saving medicines that we wanted to send,” he said.Bagchi said India has always stood by the people of Afghanistan, be it humanitarian support or development assistance.“This was about humanitarian access into Afghanistan on the delivery of the 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat and life-saving medicines we are supplying to the people of Afghanistan,” he said.“We are examining the response of the government of Pakistan, we are also working on the modalities with the Pakistan side. We believe that humanitarian assistance should not be subject to conditionalities,” he said.Pakistan on Wednesday said it has formally informed India about its decision to allow the transportation of an Indian humanitarian shipment of 50,000 metric tonnes of wheat and life-saving drugs to Afghanistan through its territory.Prime Minister Khan announced on Monday that his government will allow India to send humanitarian shipment of wheat to Afghanistan through its territory after the finalisation of the transit modalities.“The decision of the government of Pakistan to this effect was formally conveyed to the Charge d’affaires of India at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” the Pakistan Foreign Office (FO) said on Wednesday. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/working-on-modalities-with-pak-for-transporting-humanitarian-aid-to-afghanistan-india-343096
26-11-2021||New Delhi||Plea in SC seeks fair investigation on complaint regarding hate crime in Noida||A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking a fair investigation and trial on a complaint by a senior citizen who has claimed that he was abused and tortured in an alleged hate crime in Noida in July this year.The plea, which has also sought initiation of appropriate departmental or punitive proceedings against some police officers of district Gautam Buddh Nagar (Noida, Uttar Pradesh) for allegedly failing to comply with the preventive and remedial measures as directed by the apex court in one of its earlier verdicts, came up for hearing on Friday before a Bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar and CT Ravikumar.The Bench said the matter would be heard along with other pending petitions related to the issue of hate speech.The apex court granted liberty to the petitioner to serve advance copy of the plea to the standing counsel Uttar Pradesh and other respondents.The Delhi-based petitioner has said in his plea that he has been a victim of a “dastardly hate crime” in Noida where he was “abused, tortured and systematically stripped of his dignity” by a group of individuals on July 4 this year.“The petitioner is constrained to approach this court on account of the special fact that this court has already issued a number of directions regarding prevention and punishment in relation to hate crimes, i.e. people being mob lynched or subjected to mob violence on account of their identity in the Indian social context; and certain further consequential directions are prayed for from this court,” said the plea, filed through advocate Talha Abdul Rahman.It claimed that despite several representations to the concerned police authorities as well as the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), no concrete action has been taken on the petitioner’s complaint regarding the incident.The plea, which has also sought direction to the state to pay compensation, alleged that the police have sought to dissuade the 62-year-old petitioner from pressing his complaint by “exerting unwarranted pressure” on him and his family members.Detailing the incident, the petitioner has said he was attacked and many derogatory words related to his “religious identity” were hurled at him.“The present facts disclose a shocking state of affairs where the petitioner’s status as an equal citizen of India is doubly challenged. First in the hate attack on him, and then secondly in the complete negation of the hate crime and resulting trauma caused to him by the state authorities,” it said, alleging that the petitioner was attacked because of “his beard and ostensible Muslim identity”.The plea said it is the duty of the police to bring the perpetrators of the crime to justice and unfortunately, by not registering FIR immediately and not swinging into immediate action in this case, the concerned police officers have failed to perform their duties.“The Indian Constitution recognises the duty of the state to protect individuals. If hate crimes are permitted to occur with impunity, and without prompt legal action, the promise of the Constitution makers will be broken,” it said.The plea has also sought directions, including to ensure that the petitioner or his family is not intimidated and harassed. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/plea-in-sc-seeks-fair-investigation-on-complaint-regarding-hate-crime-in-noida-343081

26-11-2021||New Delhi||Constitution Day: Conduct of MPs in Parliament should be same as in places of worship, says President Ram Nath Kovind||Public service and national interest should be the sole priorities of elected representatives and political competition should not be confused with rivalry, President Ram Nath Kovind said on the occasion of Constitution Day celebrations on Friday before he led the country in the collective reading of the Preamble.Urging MPs to be mindful of the fact that the makers of the Constitution sat where they sit today, the President said the Parliament was the temple of democracy and MPs’ conduct in the Houses should be the same as in places of worship. “We all believe that our Parliament is a ‘Temple of Democracy’. Therefore, it becomes the responsibility of every parliamentarian to conduct themselves in this temple of democracy with the same spirit of reverence with which they do in their places of worship,” said the President.He said if the MPs recognised the fact that the makers of the Indian Constitution sat in the same places where they were sitting today, they would have a deep realisation of history and duty. The President also described the opposition as the most important element of democracy noting, “Without an effective opposition, democracy becomes ineffective.”With 13 opposition parties including the Congress and TMC boycotting the event, the President said, “All MPs are defenders of the dignity of the Parliament, whether they represent the ruling party or the opposition In fact, elected representatives should have only one priority—working for the welfare of their constituents and for the interest of the nation. There may be differences of opinion but no difference should be big enough to hinder the purpose of public service,” said the President at the celebrations in the central hall of Parliament with 13 opposition parties including the Congress and TMC skipping the event.The President added that while it was natural for the ruling and opposition faction parliamentarians to compete, “such competition should not be confused with rivalry.”Earlier Vice President and Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu noted that the Constitution mandated debate and dialogue while disruption negated its spirit. Lamenting a progressively dysfunctional legislature, RS chairman said the productivity of the Upper House had hit the lowest ever of 35.75 pc during 2018 and further slipped to 29.60 pc during the last 254th Session.“While the annual productivity of RS has been over 100 pc for 16 years from 1979 to 1994, it has been so only twice in 1998 and 2009 during the next 26 years,” Naidu said urging all parties to introspect.He also asked the opposition to honour the people’s mandate noting that in a democracy, people’s will was conveyed as the mandate to the governments of the day.“Tolerance towards the mandate of the people should be the guiding spirit for the legislatures,” he said recalling the “dark period of Emergency” which the people of India thwarted.Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, speaking on the occasion, also called upon MPs to use the house for constructive debate instead of disruptions.President releases calligraphed version of the ConstitutionPresident Kovind today released the digital version of Parliament debates and the calligraphed version of the Constitution saying younger generations would benefit from both.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/constitution-day-conduct-of-mps-in-parliament-should-be-same-as-in-places-of-worship-says%C2%A0president-ram-nath-kovind-343072

26-11-2021||New Delhi||Bihar, Jharkhand, UP emerge as poorest states in India: Niti Aayog||Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh have emerged as the poorest states in India, according to Niti Aayog’s first Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) report.As per the index, 51.91 per cent population of Bihar is poor, followed 42.16 per cent in Jharkhand, 37.79 per cent in Uttar Pradesh. While Madhya Pradesh (36.65 per cent) has been placed fourth in the index, Meghalaya (32.67 per cent) is at the fifth spot.Kerala (0.71 per cent), Goa (3.76 per cent), Sikkim (3.82 per cent), Tamil Nadu (4.89 per cent) and Punjab (5.59 per cent) have registered the lowest poverty across India and are at the bottom of the index.Among union territories (UTs), Dadra and Nagar Haveli (27.36 per cent), Jammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh (12.58), Daman & Diu (6.82 per cent) and Chandigarh (5.97 per cent), have emerged as the poorest UTs in India, Puducherry having 1.72 per cent  of its population as poor, Lakshadweep (1.82 per cent ), Andaman & Nicobar Islands (4.30 per cent) and  Delhi (4.79 per cent) have fared better.Bihar also has the highest number of malnourished people followed by Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.Bihar also ranks worst when it comes to percentage of population deprived of maternal health, percentage of population deprived of years of schooling, school attendance and percentage of population deprived of cooking fuel and electricity.According to the report, India’s national MPI measure uses the globally accepted and robust methodology developed by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).Importantly, as a measure of multidimensional poverty, it captures multiple and simultaneous deprivation faced by households, it added.The report said, India’s MPI has three equally weighted dimensions, health, education and standard of living - which are represented by 12 indicators namely nutrition, child and adolescent mortality, antenatal care, years of schooling, school attendance, cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water, electricity, housing, assets and bank accounts.The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework, adopted by 193 countries in 2015, has redefined development policies, government priorities, and metrics for measuring development progress across the world.The SDG framework, with 17 global goals and 169 targets, is significantly wider in scope and scale relative to the Millennium Development Goals (MDG), its predecessor.Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar in his foreword said, “The development of the National Multidimensional Poverty Index of India is an important contribution towards instituting a public policy tool which monitors multidimensional poverty, informs evidence-based and focused interventions, thereby ensuring that no one is left behind.”                Kumar further said this baseline report of India’s first ever national MPI measure is based on the reference period of 2015-16 of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS).The national MPI measure has been constructed by utilising 12 key components which cover areas such as health and nutrition, education and standard of living, he said.The report said the national MPI, an aggregate measure which defines poverty, in simple terms, as the deprivation in crucial and basic parameters of health, education, and living standards, is a significant departure from the way poverty has been understood and conceptualised historically.In early 2020, the Cabinet Secretariat, Government of India, identified 29 global indices to monitor, analyse and evaluate with the aim of improving India’s position in global rankings.Under this mandate, also known as the Global Indices for Reforms and Growth (GIRG) mandate, Niti Aayog was identified as the nodal agency for the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bihar-jharkhand-up-emerge-as-poorest-states-in-india-niti-aayog-343062

26-11-2021||New Delhi||Samajwadi Party wants AAP to accommodate it in Delhi as reciprocal gesture||The Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav has put pressure on the Aam Aadmi Party to enter into an alliance with his party and share seats with it in future assembly elections in Delhi.Yadav wants AAP to adjust SP as a reciprocal gesture if the former is accommodated in the SP-led alliance for the upcoming Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. Yadav is believed to have set such a condition on AAP during his meeting with AAP Rajya Sabha MP and in charge of Uttar Pradesh Sanjay Singh in Lucknow on Wednesday. The two leaders had met to explore the possibility of an alliance between their two parties in Uttar Pradesh.SP and AAP are major players in the politics of Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, respectively. AAP is in power in the National Capital Territory of Delhi.The SP is heading an alliance of about four smaller parties and has left doors ajar to rope in more political outfits to present a challenge to the ruling BJP in Uttar Pradesh.A source said on condition of anonymity that when Singh pitched for the alliance between the two parties on the ground to avoid splitting of non-BJP votes to defeat the Saffron party in Uttar Pradesh, Yadav sought the former’s views with regard to Delhi when the Assembly elections take place in future.Yadav is said that AAP must adjust SP in Delhi as a reciprocal gesture if it was accommodated electorally in Uttar Pradesh. This would help in strengthening the opposition unit to defeat the BJP nationally, sources said.Also, Yadav is said to be hesitant with the list of 25 seats put forth by Singh to Yadav to be left for AAP in an alliance.The meeting between the two, however, remained inconclusive.While Yadav told Singh that he would discuss AAP’s proposal for the alliance in his party forum, Singh assured to take up the relationship between the two parties in Delhi with his party’s national Convener and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.Sources close to Yadav said in the present circumstances the possibility of an alliance between the two parties in Uttar Pradesh is bleak.AAP is trying to open its account of seats in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly Kejriwal had visited the State recently and performed prayers at the birthplace of Lord Ram in an obvious move to signal its soft-Hindutva stance to curry favour with the Hindu community to counter the BJP.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/samajwadi-party-wants-aap-to-accommodate-it-in-delhi-as-reciprocal-gesture-343058
26-11-2021||New Delhi||Centre proposes framework for cross-border insolvency; seeks comments till December 15||The government is preparing to come out with a cross-border insolvency resolution framework based on the UNCITRAL model law and is proposed to be made applicable for both corporate debtors as well as personal guarantors to such debtors.The corporate affairs ministry, which is implementing the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), has sought comments on the draft framework till December 15.Broadly, cross-border insolvency process pertains to those debtors having assets and creditors overseas.According to the ministry, the need for having robust institutional arrangements to deal with cross-border insolvency issues has gained momentum in various jurisdictions, particularly under the aegis of UNCITRAL Model Law, during the last few decades.The UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, 1997, is the most widely accepted legal framework to deal with cross-border insolvency issues. The law provides a legislative framework that can be adopted by countries with modifications to suit the domestic context of the enacting jurisdiction.It has been adopted by nearly 50 countries, including Singapore, the UK, the US and South Africa.The ministry has proposed that the immediate application of the cross-border law for corporate debtors and personal guarantors to corporate debtors.In a notice dated November 24, the ministry said that cross-border issues may sparingly arise in the pre-pack process as it applies to small businesses."Further, since it has been introduced recently, jurisprudence and practice under the pre-pack mechanism are at a nascent stage. Given this, applying cross-border insolvency provisions to the pre-pack process may not be suitable at this stage," it noted.The pre-pack process is a simpler resolution process for MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises).Another proposal is to exclude financial service providers from the applicability of cross-border insolvency provisions."Such exclusion is in line with the design of the Code as financial service providers are subject to a special insolvency process that has been notified under Section 227," it added.Section 227 of the Code enables the Central government to notify, in consultation with the financial sector regulators, Financial Service Providers (FSPs) or categories of FSPs for the purpose of insolvency and liquidation proceedings. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/business/centre-proposes-framework-for-cross-border-insolvency-seeks-comments-till-december-15-343055

26-11-2021||Aditi Tandon||'Parties for the family, by the family' a threat to democracy: Modi||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 26Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday called for a national awakening against family-based political parties describing outfits controlled and run by families as a danger to Indian democracy.In wide-ranging remarks on the occasion of the Constitution Day celebrations at the Central Hall of Parliament, the prime minister also flagged the trend of public felicitation of politicians convicted of corruption as a matter of grave concern asking if this was the society we wanted for our youngsters.He also questioned the past governments for not stressing constitutional duties enough and noted that if the path of duties had been emphasised after Independence, rights of the people would have been naturally secured.But the PM's most direct attack was on dynastic politics."India is a democratic nation. Parties have their special significance and are a tool to taking the principles of the Constitution to the people. But can parties that themselves have lost democratic character protect Indian democracy? Today, India is moving towards a danger from Kashmir to Kanyakumari. Political parties for the family, by the family are a danger to democracy," the PM said in veiled attacks on the Congress and other family-run parties.Drawing a distinction between families that send more than one person into politics on the basis of merit and parties that are controlled by a single family over generations, the PM said a national awakening is needed towards this threat."Family-controlled parties are a threat to our democratic character. They are the antithesis of what the Constitution teaches us. I don’t say more than one people from a party can’t enter politics on the grounds of merit but a party run by one family for generations, controlled by one family is a danger to democracy. We need national awareness to this end," said the PM, citing an example of Japan where a similar movement against dynastic politics succeeded.The PM then went on to question people who fete those convicted of corrpution."Does the Constitution license corrpution? It is a matter of concern that after courts have convicted someone of corruption, there is a competition to fete and honour such people publicly for political purposes. What impression does such a trend give to youngsters? Won't they feel it is normal to be corrupt because society will accept you after some years? Chances for improvement should be given to such people but the competition to honour them in public is worrisome," the PM said.He also lashed out at the past governments for “squandering” Mahatma Gandhi's legacy of stress on national duties saying had duties been emphasised right since Independence the rights of people would have been protected in normal course."Mahatma Gandhi in his lifetime stressed duties by way of cleanliness, women's empowerment. After Independence the seeds he had sown should have transformed into a thriving tree but governance structures that took root stressed only rights. It would have been better if after Independence, duties would have been emphasised. That way rights would have been protected on their own," the PM said, noting that fulfilment of duties led to the creation of a cohesive society and every time someone does their duty, someone else's right is protected.The prime minister asked for moving towards the path where citizens seek to realise their rights through the performance of their duties.The PM also took the occasion to take a jibe at the opposition with 13 parties, including the Congress, boycotting the Constitution Day event."I wonder if we could have written even a single page had we been tasked with the drafting of the Constitution in today's times when politics overwhelms national interest more often than not. The founders of the Indian Constitution, on the other hand, had national interest foremost in their minds and kept personal differences apart to give us the Constitution," Modi said to a thunderous applause.He added that the Constitution Day event in Parliament was not a BJP or a government function."This is an event to hail the memory of Dr BR Ambedkar and other founders of the Constitution and has been organised by the presiding officers of the two Houses. Their chairs have a dignity which everyone must honour," the PM said, recalling that the opposition had similarly boycotted in Parliament his speech to mark the 150th anniversary of Dr Ambedkar.The PM also asked past governments why they never thought of celebrating Constitution Day as a marker of evaluation of whether governance was headed in the right direction."These very people asked why the NDA government decided to celebrate Constitution Day. What was the need? It is surprising that while we hail an event associated with Dr Ambedkar's memory, such thoughts should even cross someone's mind. The country will not accept this," the PM said.President Ram Nath Kovind also addressed the event calling for MPs to perform their duties as expected of them under the Constitution.The President later led a joint reading of the Preamble.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dynastic-parties-matter-of-concern-to-people-committed-to-constitution-modi-343034

Even candidates were not allowed to vote. There were violent incidents. Even media reports said that there was violation of Supreme Court orders,” Sibal submitted.“Let’s see what can be done,” Justice Chandrachud said even as he made it clear that judges were busy with various official functions on Constitution Day.As the Bench said it had passed a detailed order on Thursday, Sibal said, “I know but two battalions of CAPF were not provided. Two constables were also not provided to the contesting candidates. We have electronic media evidence with us. Kindly list these applications urgently”.The Supreme Court had on Thursday ordered the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to provide two additional companies of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) to secure every polling booth during the Tripura municipal polls that took place on November 25 after the opposition TMC and CIP(M) alleged violence and intimidation of voters by ruling BJP supporters.“In the circumstances, we direct that the Union Ministry of Home Affairs to provide additional two companies of any CAPF as expeditiously as possible having due regard to the fact that polling has already commenced and in order to secure the polling booths so that polling can take place without any disturbance or dislocation, it had said.It had ordered the State Election Commission, Tripura DGP and the state’s Home Secretary to ensure that all 770 polling booths were manned by a sufficient strength of Central Armed Police Force personnel, “to ensure free and fair elections.” Counting of votes is to take place on November 28.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-moves-supreme-court-alleging-violation-of-court-orders-for-free-and-fair-tripura-municipal-polls-343031

The various events by the community to remember the victims are an expression of its yearning for justice to be meted out," India's ambassador to Israel Sanjeev Singla said in a statement on Friday.The 26/11 attack by 10 heavily-armed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists killed 166 people and injured more than 300.The terrorists launched coordinated shooting and bombing attacks at several landmarks in Mumbai, including the Chabad House at Nariman point where six Jews were killed in the attack.Isaac Solomon, 84, an Indian Jewish community leader in the southern coastal city of Eilat, at an event organised at the club Sitar told the gathering that both India and Israel had been at the receiving end of terror even though both the countries seek peace with their neighbours, as well as internationally."The terrorists do not really have a real objective. They have only one goal – to harm people. India and Israel are democracies that seek peace and will continue to raise their voice against the menace of terrorism anywhere in the world,” Solomon said.Eilat Deputy Mayor Stas Bilkin also participated in the event in solidarity with the victims of the attacks.Jewish outreach movement, Chabad, last year unveiled a plaque in the city in memory of the six Jewish victims of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks."To the memory and rise of souls of Rabbi Gavriel Noah and Rivka Holtsberg, who were martyred during the time of their holy mission in a terror attack at Chabad House in Mumbai, India from which the message of Torah was being spread all over the area. And for the four guests who stayed in Chabad house at the time of the attack, and were also martyred: Rabbi Gavriel Taitelbaum, Norma Rabinovich, Rabbi Ben Zion Kurman, Yocheved Orpaz. May their souls be bound up in the bond of eternal life," the plaque in Hebrew reads.Ceremonies were also held at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv University, Ben-Gurion University and Technion in Haifa with a large number of Indian students turning up to participate while observing Covid norms."It is a shame that the real masterminds of the attack roam around freely while the families of the victims await justice. All peace-seeking nations must unite in their resolve to defeat terror and their state sponsors. The 26/11 is a shared pain between India and Israel and we must do everything to bring the perpetrators to justice,” said Ankit Chauhan, a researcher at Ben-Gurion University."On this day, we remember the tragic loss of human life during the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai. Through the candles we light in this vigil, we pay homage to all the innocent souls that were victims of blind rage and terror," Trivikram Muralidharan, a PhD student in the department of industrial engineering and management at Ben-Gurion University, told PTI."The candles that we lit today also symbolise the everlasting hope in humanity that each of us shares for working together towards a future that is safer and harmonious for the generations to come," Muralidharan said.Some of the participants also recounted the valiant efforts of the Indian soldiers in dealing with the terror attack in Mumbai in 2008."Remembering the heroes who gave up their lives for our safety on this day, 13 years ago. I salute their spirit and bravery. Let's never forget their sacrifice. We will forever be indebted to our bravehearts for their supreme sacrifice,” said Ajay Wagh, a postdoctoral fellow at the Technion in the northern coastal city of Haifa.

In the 2018 Assembly elections, we were confident of forming the government, but could not. After the elections, there were attempts to poach our members, but we demonstrated our commitment. We were failing in our duty as far as the role of the Opposition is concerned,” Sangma said.The breakaway group had submitted a list of MLAs crossing over to the TMC to Assembly Speaker Metbah Lyngdoh.

I would like to reaffirm India’s commitment to cooperate, plan, invest, and build physical and digital connectivity in the SCO region,” he said.Earlier this month, Iran, which is also an SCO member, had expressed dissatisfaction with economic ties with India. In a meeting with National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval, the visiting secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) of Iran Ali Shamkhani had reportedly commented on India’s slow pace in developing the Chabahar port.Jaishankar dwelt at length on India emerging as an economic force at the global level and pointed out that despite the devastation caused by Covid, “India’s agile response in fighting the pandemic and ensuring economic stability has been noteworthy”.India’s trade performance has also been strong, growing by more than 20 per cent this year.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/connectivity-vital-economic-multiplier-india-at-sco-meeting-342859

A total of six such vessels are to be made. The two are scheduled to join the fleet in 2022 and 2023.Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL), Mumbai, is making the submarines under collaboration with the Naval Group of France.With today’s addition, the number of undersea vessels with the Indian Navy goes up to 17, much less than the envisaged plan drawn out in 1999. The plan was to have 24 modern submarines by 2030.It would be near impossible to meet this target. Of the 17 subs, four are the Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) German-origin, Shishumar-class boats that are in their fourth decade of service and running on an extended life and need to be phased out.There are eight Russian Kilo-class boats, some of them older than three decades and need to undergo a mid-life upgrade. India operates one nuclear-powered submarine, the INS Arihant, and now four submarines of the Scorpene class.Besides, the Ministry of Defence is working on having six next-generation stealth conventional submarines at a cost of $5.8 billion (Rs 42,000 crore). Bids have been invited from Indian and foreign companies.On the other hand, China is racing to add submarines to its fleet. The US Department of Defence report “Military and Security Developments Involving the People’s Republic of China 2021” says: “Over the past 15 years, the Peoples Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has constructed 12 nuclear submarines and, by 2025, it is expected to make 25 Yuan-class conventional submarines.”The PLAN will likely maintain between 65 and 70 submarines through the 2020s, replacing older units with more capable units on a near one-to-one basis, the report said.Despite modern technology, tracing a submerged submarine at sea is a Herculean task and the submarine remains the most potent threat at sea.To be part of Western Naval Command||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sub-vela-inducted-into-navy-342857

The project will be executed by Zurich Airport International AG. PM Modi said, “For the first time after Independence, the double-engine government is giving Uttar Pradesh its due. Earlier, UP would be criticised for bad roads, poor infrastructure, mafia, etc. The previous governments kept UP poor. Today, the state is making its mark on the global stage.”The PM said that BJP government ensured timely execution of projects. “Earlier projects would be announced, but nothing would happen on the ground. Costs would escalate and blame games used to be the order of the day.

For this purpose, it is necessary for the commission to engage expert agencies with domain knowledge in meteorological data and statistical modelling,” it said in its order uploaded on Wednesday night.On Wednesday, it postponed the hearing on worsening air pollution in Delhi-NCR to November 29. “Take the measures for the next two-three days and we will again hear this matter next Monday,” it had said.Provide subsistence to workers, states toldThe SC has ordered the NCR states to provide subsistence money to workers from the funds collected as labour cess during the construction ban period||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aqi-very-poor-sc-reimposes-ban-on-construction-in-ncr-342832

They should be dragged out of their homes to work in the society,” Singh is heard saying on a video that went viral on social media.However, during a conversation with IANS on Thursday on the issue, the Minister said that he has no intention to hurt anyone’s sentiments but his words were “taken otherwise” by the Opposition and the media.The minister said he was addressing a gathering in his constituency where people are familiar with each other and they take jibes at each other as well.“The video that went viral on social media shows a particular line only... not the entire speech. Those who were present were locals, including some upper caste men and women. I stated it replying to one of the known ones, and district level party worker who belongs to upper caste. We know each other and live together in the society, and therefore, sometimes, we takes dig at each other as well,” the minister said.Singh, an MLA from Anuppur, is considered as one of the prominent tribal leaders in Madhya Pradesh.Associated for years with the Congress, he had joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2018.

26-11-2021||New Delhi||Demographic shift: NFHS survey finds more women than men in India||Indicating a demographic shift, the number of women surpassed men for the first time in India with the sex ratio being 1,020: 1,000, according to findings of the National Family and Health Survey-5.“With this, we can say India moves in the league of the developed countries -- as the sex ratio crosses 1,000,” a health ministry official said, attributing it to measures taken for women empowerment such as financial inclusion and for combating gender bias and disparities.The sex ratio at birth also improved from 919 in 2015-16 to 929 in 2019-20, indicating positive impact of measures like implementation of the PC and PNDT Act and various other interventions.According to NFHS-3, conducted in 2005-06, the sex ratio was 1000: 1000 and in 2015-16 (NHFS-4), it declined to 991:1000.On November 24, the Union health ministry released NFHS-5 (2019-21) results for India and 14 phase-II states and union territories in the form of fact-sheets of key indicators on population, reproductive and child health, family welfare, nutrition and other health related areas.The findings of NFHS-5 in respect of 22 states and union territories covered in phase-I were released in December, 2020.According to NFHS-5, 88.6 per cent of the births (in the 5 years before the survey) in the country were delivered in a health facility. A significant rise since NFHS-4 (78.9 per cent) is a proof that India is marching towards achieving universal institutional births, officials said.“Assistance by properly trained health personnel working within an enabling environment is needed to eliminate preventable maternal and newborn deaths. A key strategy to ensure skilled care during childbirth is to that all births take place in health facilities in which obstetric complications can be treated when they arise,” the official said.Nearly four-fifth (78 per cent) mothers received postnatal care from health personnel (doctor/nurse/LHV/ ANM/midwife/other health personnel) within two days of delivery in the country, a significant rise from 62.4 percent in NFHS-4.This would result in reducing the maternal and infant mortality rates in the country. The days and weeks following childbirth - the postnatal period, are a critical phase in the lives of mothers and newborn babies. Most maternal and infant deaths occur in the first month after birth. Thus, it is recommended to receive postnatal care from health personnel within the first 48 hours (2 days) of delivery, the official said.The survey findings stated total fertility rate (children per woman) in the country has reached the replacement level of fertility, a significant demographic milestone. The TFR for India in 2019-21 has reached 2.0 children per woman compared to 2.2 in 2015-16.This means women are giving lesser number of births in their reproductive period compared to earlier. This also indicates better knowledge and use of family planning services, late entry into marriage/union, etc, the ministry official said.The birth registration (with the civil authority) for children under age 5 years has increased from 79.7 per cent (NFHS-4, 2015-16) to 89.1 per cent.In 41 per cent of the households, at least one usual member is covered under a health insurance/financing scheme, a rise from 28.7 per cent in the last round. This indicates a larger reach and greater acceptance of health insurance/financing scheme in India.Health insurances provide coverage for medical expenses and prevents out-of-pocket-expenditures and catastrophic health expenditures especially from the marginalized households. It is to be noted here that, the Ayushman Bharat- Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (PMJAY) was not fully rolled out in the country during the period of survey and its coverage may not have been factored in the factsheets, the official explained.Besides, two-third (66.7%) of the currently married women aged 15-49 years in the country use any method of family planning to delay or limit pregnancies as per NFHS-5 compared to only 53.5 per cent in NFHS-4.“This is a significant rise since the last round. Use of contraception prevents pregnancy-related health risks for women, especially for adolescent girls, and properly planned intervals between births prevent infant mortality,” the official said.The unmet need for family planning among currently married women aged 15-49 years in the country has declined from 12.9 per cent in 2015-16 to 9.4 per cent in 2019-21.Acording to the findings, more than three-fourth (76.4 per cent) of the children age 12-23 months are fully vaccinated (with BCG, measles-containing vaccine (MCV)/ MR/ MMR/ Measles, and 3 doses each of polio excluding polio vaccine given at birth and DPT or pentavalent vaccine) based on information from either vaccination card or mother’s recall.The survey found nutritional status of children under 5 years of age has improved marginally in the country since the last round. However, specific targeted interventions are required to address these challenges in the country.

26-11-2021||New Delhi||NEET-PG admissions: Centre tells SC it will revisit Rs 8 lakh annual income limit for EWS; counselling put off for 4 weeks||The Centre on Thursday told the Supreme Court that it has taken a considered decision to revisit the limit of Rs 8 lakh annual income fixed for determining the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) category for reservation in NEET admissions for Post-Graduate medical courses.A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Surya Kant, and Vikram Nath was informed by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that a committee will be constituted to determine the criteria for EWS and it would take four weeks.Expert panel to re-examine error in Hindi version of Physics paper in NEET-UG exam: NTA to SCMehta said that NEET (PG) counselling would stand postponed for a further four weeks as per assurance earlier given to the court.The top court was hearing a batch of pleas filed by Students challenging the Centre and Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) July 29 notice providing 27 per cent reservation for Other Backward Class (OBC) and 10 per cent for EWS category in the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET-PG) admissions for medical courses for the current academic year.Justice Kant said that the EWS quota is a very enabling and progressive kind of reservation and all States should support the Centre in its endeavour.The bench said that the only question is that determination of the category should be in a scientific manner and it appreciates that the Centre has taken a decision to revisit the criteria earlier fixed.Senior advocate Arvind Datar, appearing for petitioners (students), said since a lot of time has passed and Centre should push back implementation of the EWS quota for the next academic year and the current year counselling should be allowed to go on.The bench agreed with the submission of Datar and asked Mehta whether it could push the implementation of the constitutional amendment for the next academic year and allow the counselling to go on for the current academic year.Mehta said that the government has taken a decision to implement the 103rd constitutional amendment from the current academic year and pushing back would not be appropriate.He said that if the determination is done earlier than four weeks then it will inform the court.The bench told Datar that four weeks is not unreasonable and it doesn’t want to push the government to do it earlier otherwise the criteria would be fixed in an unscientific and haphazard manner.Advocate Shashank Ratnoo, appearing on behalf of some OBC candidates, requested that the application of reservation to OBC students should not be deferred as the Centre is planning to revisit the EWS criteria.The bench said that it has not said anything about OBC students and is not disposing of the petition.It then recorded the submission of Mehta and posted the matter for further hearing on January 6.On October 21, the top court asked the Centre whether it would like to revisit the limit of rupees eight lakh annual income fixed for determining the EWS category for reservation in NEET PG admissions.The top court had clarified that it is not embarking into the policy domain but is only trying to ascertain whether constitutional principles have adhered or not.It was annoyed as no affidavits were filed by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Department of Personnel and Training (DOPT) and formulated questions to be answered by the Centre in a week.It had asked the Centre whether any exercise was undertaken before fixing a limit of Rs 8 lakh annual income for determining the EWS category and whether Major Gen (retd) SR Sinho commission report of 2010 was considered before ascertaining the criteria?Major Gen SR Sinho (retd) commission was constituted by the UPA government in 2010 and has recommended welfare measures for the EWS category, including reservation to them.The Centre had said the commission’s report was one of the basis for determining the criteria but after that several deliberations were held and other factors were also taken into account.It had asked the Centre to respond to a question that since the income limit of determining the creamy layer in OBC category and EWS is the same Rs 8 lakh, whether it would be arbitrary to provide a similar income limit for EWS and OBC.The bench said as per the explanation in the 103rd constitution amendment says that criteria for EWS will be notified by the state governments, then how can the Centre notify a uniform EWS criterion for the whole of the country.On October 7, the top court had posed searching questions to the Centre on its decision to fix a limit of rupees eight lakh annual income for determining the EWS category for

26-11-2021||Jewar (UP)||Modi lays foundation stone of Noida International Airport in UP?s Jewar||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday laid the foundation stone for the Noida International Airport at Jewar in Uttar Pradesh.It will be one of the largest aerodromes in Asia.The airport, the second international aerodrome in Delhi-National Capital Region, is expected to be operational by September 2024 with an initial capacity to handle 1.2 crore passengers per annum.The airport, spread over 1,330 acres, will be developed by Zurich Airport International AG.On Wednesday, Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said the Noida International Airport would become one of the largest airports in Asia.It will be the fourth largest international airport in the world and the project would create more than one lakh job opportunities, according to the Uttar Pradesh government.The first phase of the aerodrome is being done at a cost of more than Rs 10,050 crore, and the ground work regarding land acquisition and rehabilitation of the affected families had been completed, an official release said on Tuesday.The airport at Jewar will help decongest the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport in the national capital. It is strategically located and will serve the people of cities, including Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Aligarh, Agra, Faridabad and neighbouring areas, the release said.The airport will also be the country's "first net zero emissions airport".According to the Union government, the airport will be the logistics gateway of northern India, and with its scale and capacity, the aerodrome will be a "gamechanger" for Uttar Pradesh.For the first time, an airport has been conceptualised with an integrated multi-modal cargo hub, with a focus on reducing the total cost and time for logistics. The dedicated cargo terminal will have a capacity of 20 lakh metric tonnes, which will be expanded to 80 lakh metric tonnes.The airport will also develop a Ground Transportation Centre that will feature a multi-modal transit hub, housing metro and high-speed rail stations, taxi, bus services and private parking.Among other aspects, the airport will be linked to the planned Delhi-Varanasi high-speed rail, enabling the journey between Delhi and airport in only 21 minutes, the release said.There will also be a state-of-art MRO (maintenance, repair and overhauling) service. The airport will introduce a swing aircraft stand concept, providing flexibility for airlines to operate an aircraft for both domestic and international flights from the same contact stand, without having to re-position the aircraft.In poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, various development projects have been inaugurated in recent months. On October 20, Modi inaugurated the Kushinagar international airport.Currently, there are nine operational airports in Uttar Pradesh, including three international aerodromes at Lucknow, Varanasi and Kushinagar. Eight more airports, including the one at Jewar, will be coming up in three years.The six other operational airports in the state are at Agra, Gorakhpur, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Hindon and Bareilly.On Wednesday, Civil Aviation Secretary Rajiv Bansal said five aerodromes are expected to be ready at Aligarh, Chitrakoot, Azamgarh, Mordabad and Shravasti in 2022.In 2023, two more are expected to come up at Ayodhya and Muirpur.

26-11-2021||New Delhi||Supreme Court re-imposes ban on construction in Delhi-NCR, asks states to pay affected workers||Taking note of the worsening air quality, the Supreme Court has re-imposed the ban on construction activities in Delhi and national capital region (NCR) and directed the states to provide subsistence to workers from the funds collected as labour cess for the period during which such activities are prohibited.Read also:Workers affected by ban on construction activities to be given Rs 5,000 each: KejriwalA special bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana, in an interim order uploaded on Wednesday night, also directed the Commission for Air Quality Management in the NCR and Adjoining Areas to "commission a scientific study of air quality based on available data of previous years bearing upon recorded levels of air pollution"."We direct that instead of waiting for the air quality to deteriorate before initiating action under the graded response plan, necessary measures must be put into place in anticipation of a deterioration of air quality. For this purpose, it is necessary for the commission to engage expert agencies with domain knowledge in meteorological data and statistical modelling," said the bench which also comprised Justices DY Chandrachud and Surya Kant.Asking the commission on pollution and NCR states - Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan - to continue with their measures to curb the spike in pollution, the bench reversed the decision to allow construction activities from November 22 in view of improved ground situation in air pollution level."In the meantime, as an interim measure and until further orders, we re-impose the ban on construction activities in the NCR subject to the following two conditions: Non-polluting activities relating to construction such as plumbing work, interior decoration, electrical work and carpentry are allowed to be continued."The states shall use the funds which have been collected as labour cess for the welfare of construction workers to provide them subsistence for the period during which construction activities are prohibited and pay wages notified under the Minimum Wages Act for the respective categories of workers,” the order said.The order took note of the submissions of solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, that a plan for graded response has been prepared in pursuance of which measures are identified to be taken progressively on the basis of worsening levels of ambient air pollution.The bench said as of now, the action is proposed after air quality has deteriorated and directed the commission to take preventive advance measures to deal with the rise in the air pollution.Asking the panel to undertake a study, the order said such a study "must factor in seasonal variations and other relevant parameters"."Once a scientific model is available, which factors in wind velocity as well as natural and man-made phenomena, the graded response plan can be modulated to provide for measures being taken in advance, based on anticipated changes in air quality without waiting for the air quality to deteriorate."On this basis, steps can be planned at least a week in advance and even earlier, based on anticipated levels of air pollution in the foreseeable future. The Commission shall carry out the above exercise within a month and report the steps taken for compliance with this direction," it said.
