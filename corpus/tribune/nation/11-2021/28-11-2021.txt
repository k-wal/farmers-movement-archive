According to Dr BR Ambedkar, inter-caste marriage is one remedy to get rid of casteism in order to achieve equality. His vision for ensuring justice and equality to all sections of the society, especially to the repressed segments, is well enshrined in the preamble of the Constitution. The bigotry perpetuated by such caste-based practices which are prevalent even today, impedes this objective of the Constitution of equality for all its citizens,” the Bench said.Noting that a marriage proposal by Roshni belonging to Jat community, with Vijendra—a Jatav—resulted in their deaths, the top court said, “Though the number is a tad less, honour killings have not stopped in this country and it is high time that the civil society reacts and responds with strong disapproval about the ghastly crimes committed in the name of caste.”Recalling the directions to the administrative authorities and police officials to take strong measures to prevent honour killings and the Law Commission’s report on the issue, the Bench emphasised that harsh punishment was recommended to those “brutal and feudal minded persons” who commit atrocities in the name of caste.Twenty witnesses were examined by the prosecution and four witnesses were produced by the defence. When the trial resumed in 1998, 12 out of the 20 prosecution witnesses turned hostile. The trial was stayed for six years between 1992 and 1998 due to orders passed by the Allahabad High Court.“Even if the witnesses have turned hostile, their evidence can be accepted, if they are natural and independent witnesses and have no reason to falsely implicate the accused,” it said, adding, as a protector of its citizens, the state has to ensure that during a trial a witness can safely depose the truth, without any fear of being haunted by those against whom he or she has deposed.“This unfortunate situation prevails because of the reason that the state has not undertaken any protective measures to ensure the safety of these witnesses, commonly known as ‘witness protection’,” the Bench said, referring to an earlier judgment of the top court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/honour-killings-casteism-not-annihilated-even-after-75-years-of-independence-laments-sc-343863

Their physical examination on Friday revealed that the consignments actually contained 2,245 handsets of iPhone 13 Pro, 1,401 handsets of iPhone 13 Pro Max, 12 handsets of Google Pixel 6 pro and one Apple Smart Watch, collectively valued at Rs 42.86 crore.The above-mentioned mobile phones and the Apple smart watch were not declared in the imported goods under the Customs Act. The declared value of these goods was only Rs 80 lakh.The detection of attempted smuggling of these high-end phones of the latest models in such large numbers shows how quickly the smugglers establish their smuggling networks for the latest products, like iPhone 13, an official release said.“This detection has helped unearth a serious import fraud having substantial revenue implications,” it added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dri-seizes-3-646-undeclared-iphone-handsets-at-mumbai-airport-343860

Martial arts programmes do take place (in it), but Sangh is neither an all India gym nor a martial arts club. Sometimes, the Sangh is described as a paramilitary (force). But Sangh is not a military organisation,” he said.Sangh is a group with family atmosphere, the RSS chief added.He was speaking here at the closing event of the four-day Ghosh Shivir (musical band camp) of the Sangh’s Madhya Bharat Pranth.“Western countries consider music as entertainment. It is played for thrill there. But in India, music is meant to soothe the soul. It is an art that calms down the mind,” he added.Bhagwat had reached Gwalior on Friday midnight to address and guide the ghosh shivir that began here on Thursday.The musical band camp concluded at Saraswati Shishu Mandir (school) located Gwalior’s on Shivpuri Link Road, a senior RSS Madhya Bharat functionary said.More than 500 instrumentalists drawn from 31 districts of RSS Madhya Pradesh Bharat Pranth (including Gwalior and Bhopal divisions) took part in the camp.Last week, Bhagwat had attended ‘Ghosh Pradarshan’, a programme on demonstrating musical instruments by band members in Chhattisgarh.RSS functionary Vinay Dixit said the RSS was formed in 1925 while its musical branch came up in 1927. He added that musical bands, especially drums, are used in shakhas during the drills. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rss-not-a-military-organisation-its-a-group-with-family-atmosphere-bhagwat-343854

Police protection was provided to the yatra.Farmers and leaders had gathered at the Maidan to attend a kisan mahapanchayat or mega conclave under the banner of the Samyukta Shetkari Kamgar Morcha (SSKM).After the procession reached the iconic monument, select farmers boarded a boat with urns and immersed them in the middle of the sea amid chants of hymns.The ‘Shaheed Kalash Yatra’ of the farmer victims of Lakhimpur Kheri, which kicked off from Pune on October 27 and traversed over 30 districts in Maharashtra, visited the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the Chaitya Bhoomi of Babasaheb Ambedkar in Mumbai, the memorial to Shaheed Babu Genu and the statue of Mahatma Gandhi on November 27, the SSKM had said in a release earlier in the day.On Sunday, this yatra visited Hutatma Chowk, which commemorates 106 martyrs of the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement in the 1950s, in south Mumbai and the ashes of the martyrs were immersed in the Arabian Sea off the Gateway of India in a special programme, said Ashok Dhawale of the SSKM.Earlier last month, eight people were killed in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in UP. Of the eight killed, four were farmers, who were allegedly knocked down by vehicles driven by BJP workers travelling to welcome Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to an event in the area.The other four were two BJP workers, a driver of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Kumar Mishra and a journalist working for a private television channel.

28-11-2021||Mathura (UP)||Section 144 imposed in Mathura after Mahasabha threat to install Lord Krishna idol in mosque||The Mathura district administration has imposed prohibitory orders under CrPC section 144 following an announcement by the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha that it will install a Lord Krishna idol at the deity’s “actual birthplace”, which it claims is in a mosque close to a prominent temple here.“Nobody will be allowed to disturb the peace and tranquillity in Mathura,” District Magistrate Navneet Singh Chahal said.The clampdown comes even as another right wing organisation, the Narayani Sena, has said it will take out a march from Vishram Ghat to Sri Krishna Janmasthan, demanding the “removal” of the mosque.Section 144 of the CrPC prohibits the assembly of four or more people in an area.Police said they have detained Narayani Sena secretary Amit Mishra in Mathura Kotwali, while the outfit claimed its national president Manish Yadav has been detained in Lucknow.Chahal said he, along with Senior Superintendent of Police Gaurav Grover, reviewed the security around both the religious places, the Katra Keshav Dev temple and the Shahi Idgah.He said the Mahasabha had requested permission to install the idol at the mosque but it was turned down.Question of granting permission to any event that may potentially disrupt peace does not arise, Chahal added.Hindu Mahasabha leader Rajyashri Choudhary had earlier said her organisation will install the idol of Lord Krishna in the Shahi Idgah after a “maha jalabhishek” to “purify” the place on December 6.The date marks the demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, the site of a temple-mosque dispute, in 1992.The Mahasabha’s threat to perform the ritual inside the Shahi Idgah comes at a time when the local courts are hearing a series of petitions seeking the “removal” of the 17th century mosque.

Also, it has to simultaneously match up to Congress in Punjab, Goa and Uttarakhand polls.Gupta said AAP has been siding with the farmers opposed to the three agri-laws.The party will raise the issue, and other demands of the farmers, including law backing MSP, compensation to the families of farmers who died during the protests, and against inflation among others in both the Houses of Parliament.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aap-to-use-winter-session-of-parliament-to-increase-its-visibility-343843
28-11-2021||Indore||Veer Savarkar era has already arrived in India: CIC Uday Mahurkar||Central Information Commissioner (CIC) Uday Mahurkar on Sunday said the era of V D Savarkar, known as the architect of Hindutva ideology, has already set in in India and that his personality is above Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian honour.“I feel Savarkar (stature) is above Bharat Ratna. If he gets the award it is fine. But even if he does not get this award that won’t affect his stature as the Savarkar era has already begun in India,” Mahurkar, who is taking part in the Indore Literature Festival here, told PTI.The BJP in its manifesto for the Maharashtra Assembly polls in 2019 had stated that it will recommend Veer Savarkar’s name to the Centre for the highest civilian award if the saffron party retained power.Many right-wing organisations have also sought the Bharat Ratna for Savarkar.“Earlier we did not even imagine that Article 370 of the Constitution would be abrogated in Jammu and Kashmir. But it has been repealed. This step marked the dawn of the Savarkar era in India,” said Mahurkar, the author of ‘Veer Savarkar: The Man Who Could Have Prevented Partition’.Speaking about the controversy over Savarkar purportedly seeking mercy from the British, Mahurkar said, “The more the hunger for Muslim appeasement grows in Indian politics, the need for defaming Savarkar would rise in that proportion given he was the biggest symbol of unity and diversity in India.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/veer-savarkar-era-has-already-arrived-in-india-cic-uday-mahurkar-343841

Though he gave vague directions, he could not remember the exact route back home, a senior official said, adding that he did mention the Uttam Nagar Metro Station.Police did not reveal the boy’s name as he is a minor.The boy left his house after noon and reached the Red Fort in the evening. It was already dark and after being around the monument for some time, while returning he got lost, the officials said.They said the Kotwali Station House Officer reached the spot where the PCR van was station and took the boy to the Kotwali Police Station.Though the boy had heard about the Red Fort, he never imagined he would reach it, the officials said.Constable Vinay Vasla was tasked to safely drop the boy back to his home, they said, adding that the boy told police that he could guide them to Nawada from the Uttam Nagar Metro Station.The boy was taken home and reunited with his anxiously waiting family members, the officials.“He said he can identify the route to his house after reaching Uttam Nagar Metro Station. When we reached there, he said there was a government school beside his house. We followed his instructions and finally reached his house,” said Valsa said.His father said even last month, he just took his cycle and went away, and a missing report was lodged, the police officer said.The boy’s father said if had not returned home by night, this time, another missing report would have been lodged, Valsa said.Police officials said that the boy lives in a rented accommodation at Nawada village with his grandparents and father, who is a painter.

28-11-2021||New Delhi||'Increase testing, monitor hotspots': Centre alerts states over new Covid variant||ln view of the possible threat that the new COVID-19 variant can pose to the nation, the Centre has asked all states and UTs to focus on intensive containment, active surveillance, enhanced testing, monitoring of hotspots, increased coverage of vaccination and augmentation of health infrastructure.Listing a series of measures which states and UTs should undertake, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan also stressed on rigorous surveillance of international passengers, ensuring prompt dispatch of samples for genome sequencing and strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour to effectively manage this Variant of Concern (VoC).As a proactive step, the government has already placed nations, where this VoC has been found, in the category of ‘at risk’ countries for additional follow-up measures of international travellers coming into lndia from these destinations, he said in a letter dated November 27.“ln view of the possible threat that this VoC can pose to the nation, it is imperative that the intensive containment, active surveillance, increased coverage of vaccination and Covid- appropriate behaviour must be enforced in the field in a very proactive manner to effectively manage this VoC,” Bhushan said.The health secretary said it is essential that the disease surveillance network in the country is geared up for rigorous follow-up of international travellers from all countries, especially those designated as ‘at risk’.There is already a reporting mechanism for obtaining past travel details of passengers coming through international flights, he said, adding this should be reviewed and the protocol provided by the ministry should be strictly ensured, including testing on disembarkation of travellers coming from ‘at risk’ countries and sending all positive samples for genome sequencing to INSACOG labs in a prompt manner.Emphasising that ample testing infrastructure need to be operationalised to tackle any surge due to this mutated virus, Bhushan said it has been observed that the overall testing as well as the proportion of RT-PCR tests have declined in some states.“ln the absence of sufficient testing, it is extremely difficult to determine the true level of infection spread. States must strengthen the testing infrastructure and strictly implement the testing guidelines,” he said.Bhushan also stressed on continued monitoring of hotspots, the areas where recent cluster of positive cases have emerged.“ln all such ‘hotspots’, saturation testing and sending of positive samples quickly for genome sequencing to designated INSACOG labs must be ensured in collaboration with Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of lndia, and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). States should keep a close check on the emerging trend of cases and the positivity in an area and quickly delineate hotspots for effective containment of COVID-19,” he said.The health secretary said states should aim at achieving positivity rate below 5 per cent while focusing on increasing the number of tests and share of RT-PCR tests to aid in early identification.“Having adequate availability of health facilities across the state is essential to ensure that there are no delays in providing care,” he said, adding that trained human resources, infrastructure, logistics and procurement should be planned and strengthened, considering the geographical spread of the pandemic, and there shall be no compromise in providing prompt, quality treatment to patients.Bhushan urged the states to optimally utilise the financial support provided by Government of lndia under ERCP 1 and 2 diligently.INSACOG has been established to monitor the circulating variants in the country, he said, underlining it is important that states must significantly increase sampling from the general population for genome sequencing by sending these samples to INSACOG lab network as per the policy.He also urged states and UTs to hold regular press briefings.“We have seen in the last surges in the country that discourse on Covid is often influenced by misinformation leading to anxiety in the masses. To address this, all states should proactively and regularly address the concerns of community through press briefings and state bulletins providing evidence-based information,” Bhushan said in the letter.States may also ensure that the community is well-informed regarding the measures undertaken and be advised to follow measures like Covid-appropriate behaviour and getting vaccinated.He said it is critical for states and UTs to adhere to the overarching ‘Test-Track-Treat Vaccinate and Covid-appropriate behaviour’ principle to ensure stringent implementation of containment measures as per the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) guidelines.“I’m sure that under your continued leadership we will be able to maintain the momentum and build on the progress made so far to address the latest threat of the pandemic. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare assures of all requisite support to the states and UTs,” Bhushan said.The new, potentially more contagious B.1.1.529 variant was first reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) from South Africa on November 24 and has also been identified in Botswana, Belgium, Hong Kong and Israel.It was on Friday designated as a “Variant of Concern” by the WHO, which named it Omicron. A variant of concern is the WHO’s top category of worrying COVID-19 variants.

28-11-2021||New Delhi||ED summons Amazon, Future Group executives in FEMA probe||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned senior executives of Amazon India, including its country head Amit Agarwal, and that of the Future Group for questioning in a foreign exchange violation probe linked to the disputed deal between the two conglomerates, official sources said on Sunday.The executives have been summoned along with documents for the coming week under the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), they said.Amazon India head Agarwal, some other senior officials of the company and those of the Future Group have been called, the sources said.The investigation is being conducted under various sections of the FEMA after the federal agency received a communication from the Commerce Ministry early this year seeking “necessary action” against e-commerce players like Amazon and Flipkart pertaining to certain multi-brand retail businesses and an observation made by the Delhi High Court in relation to Amazon.The HC had said that the attempt made by the US-based firm to control Future Retail through a conflation of agreements it has with an unlisted unit of the Indian company will be considered as violative of the FEMA and foreign direct investment (FDI) rules.The executives have been asked to join so that investigation can be taken forward. The agency has gathered details from the documents submitted by the companies earlier and other sources over the last few months, agency sources said.  An Amazon spokesperson said they were examining the ED summons.“We are in receipt of summons issued by the ED in connection with the Future Group. As we have just received the summons, we are examining it and will respond within the given time frame,” the spokesperson said in a statement.The Kishore Biyani-led Future Group did not respond to the queries over the development.Amazon and Future Group have been battling it out in courts after the Kishore Biyani-led group in August last year agreed to sell its assets to billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail on a slump sale basis for Rs 24,500 crore.Amazon is objecting to the sell-off plans, accusing Future Group of breaching its 2019 investment pact. Future Coupons was founded in 2008 and is engaged in the business of marketing and distribution of gift cards, loyalty cards, and other rewards programmes to corporate customers. The US-based company had approached the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) as well as in Indian courts.Earlier this month, a promoter entity of Future Retail Ltd (FRL) had been asked by the ED to provide documents pertaining to the 2019 deal with Amazon. FRL had noted that it has not received any direction to provide any document.The independent directors of FRL have approached the Competition Commission of India (CCI), urging it to revoke the approval it had given to the Amazon-FCPL deal in 2019, alleging the e-commerce major of making false statements before it.Amazon has also written to the independent directors of FRL, alleging “significant financial irregularities”, and said this warrants a “thorough and independent examination” of relevant facts and related party transactions between FRL and other Future Group entities.It has also reached out to CCI, requesting it to “act in aid of the binding injunctions operating against FRL, FCPL and the Biyanis, in terms of the EA (emergency arbitrator) Order and the Order on Vacate Application and recall the Observation Letters forthwith”.

There are several issues related to the agriculture and labour sectors that need attention and we will travel all over the country to highlight them,” he said.Tikait also demanded that financial aid be given to the kin of farmers who died in the year-long protest against the Centre’s three agri marketing laws.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the government’s decision to repeal the three farm laws, which were at the centre of protests by farmers.Many farmers were encamped at Delhi’s borders since November 2020 with a demand that the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, the Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law enacted to guarantee the MSP on crops.The Centre, which held several rounds of talks with the protesting farmers, had maintained that the laws were pro-farmer, while the protesters claimed they would be left at the mercy of corporations because of the legislations. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rakesh-tikait-demands-law-to-guarantee-msp-to-farmers-343806
28-11-2021||Vijay Mohan||Stress among female employees higher but job satisfaction also more as compared to males, says DRDO study||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 28Though perceived stress among female employees is higher, job satisfaction level in females is slightly more than their male counterparts, a study published recently by the Defence Research and Development Organisation has revealed. Further, government employees were more satisfied with their jobs than private-sector employees, with perceived stress among private-sector employees being higher. The study observed higher psychological well-being in public sector employees than those in the private sector.“The government sector has superior democratic functioning and involves less time-bound target projects, which is not the case in the private sector. Moreover, positive relations with others can be established if one finds people to be on the same level in terms of liking, choices, and decisions. It provides government personnel in India a modest advantage because they spend the majority of their time in the same departments and promotions are  time-limited,  which  is  not  the  case  in  the  private  sector,” the study observed.Titled “Effect of Job Satisfaction on Psychological Well-Being and Perceived Stress among Government and Private Employee,” the study was undertaken by experts from the Defence Institute of Psychological Research, New Delhi, Amity Institute of  Psychology and Allied Sciences, Noida and Department  of  Psychology,  School  of  Humanities  and  Language,  Phagwara,  Punjab.The purpose of the study, according to the its authors, was to shed light on the effect of job satisfaction, psychological well-being and perceived stress among government and private employees. The well-being and health of individuals is influenced by job satisfaction, which is explained as the mental gratification derived from employment.The results determine that the deadline-based work, or the over-burdening positions in the private sector or in the government sector, can be one major cause for stress, the authors said.“Studies have revealed that in the Indian context, there is more freedom and cooperation in the government sector, while strict attendance policy in terms of absenteeism is taken into account and an ‘always on the toes-attitude’ has been part of the private sector,” the authors observed.Another “striking result” put forth by the authors showed a significant negative correlation of autonomy and positive relationships with perceived stress. The existence of a negative correlation can be explained in a way that when an individual has more autonomy, he or she has less stress.Pointing out that having a sense of control over one’s work reduces stress, the authors observed that the locus of control plays a significant part in foreseeing the level of job satisfaction, stress and performance. Further, positive relationships have a negative association with perceived stress, implying that social support is always positively related with and caters to reducing stress in every aspect of life, including employment.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stress-among-female-employees-higher-but-job-satisfaction-also-more-as-compared-to-males-says-drdo-study-343797

28-11-2021||New Delhi||London museum correct record on general disembowelment by Chhatrapati Shivaji||A major error regarding its information on a significant episode of Indian history associated with Chhatrapati Shivaji recorded in London’s famous Victoria and Albert Museum has been corrected after a Delhi-based history enthusiast pointed out the flaw to the museum authorities.Shivaji’s killing of Afzal Khan is a well-known chapter of Indian history. The story went like this: Afzal Khan, commander of the Bijapur army, invited Shivaji for a meeting to discuss a truce. Khan’s real intention was to kill the Maratha ruler. Shivaji correctly anticipated Khan’s motive and killed him by disemboweling him with a steel “waghnak” he was secretly wearing in his left fingers.The “waghnak” (tiger claw), with which Shivaji was said to have killed Khan, is kept at the V&A Museum in London. The incident took place on November 9, 1659. Tributes were showered on Shivaji by his admirers on this occasion earlier this month.“Some of the admirers also posted pictures of the ‘waghnak’. I never knew that the weapon has been preserved. I got curious and checked out the links and found that the weapon was an exhibit at the V&A Museum in London,” the history buff, who wants to remain anonymous, told this reporter.The history buff noticed that in the museum write-up, Afzal Khan has been described as a Mughal army commander. “Afzal Khan was an army officer of the Bijapur state which was not a part of the Mughal Empire. Describing him as a Mughal commander is wrong. In fact, Bijapur had also fought war with the Mughals,” he said.The enthusiast, who says that studying medieval Indian history was a hobby with him, wrote a letter to the museum authorities pointing out the flaw.On Wednesday (November 24), Ekta, staff member from the museum’s South and South Asia Section, wrote to the letter writer thanking him for “pointing out some discrepancies in the catalogue record”.  “The summary repeats the erroneous description inscribed on the fitted case, which is clearly wrong. I have corrected the record,” Ekta wrote him in a mail.The “waghnak”, when handed over to the museum, was accompanied by a leather case on which it was inscribed, “The ‘Wagnuck’ of Sivajee with Which He Killed the Moghul General. This Relic was given to Mr. James Grant-Duff of Eden When he was Resident at Satara By the Prime Minister of the Peshwa of the Marathas”. Apparently, this had led to the incorrect description of Khan in the museum catalogue.Till Saturday, the summary of exhibit number O134202, kept at room number 41 of the South Asia Section of the museum, read: “This weapon is reputed to be the one used by the Maratha leader Shivaji to kill Afzal Khan, the Mughal commander of the opposing Bijapur army”. The museum authorities dropped the word “Mughal” from the summary on Sunday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/london-museum-correct-record-on-general-disembowellment-by-shivaji-343788
28-11-2021||New Delhi||Winter Session of Parliament to begin on stormy note on Monday||The Winter Session of Parliament is set to begin on a stormy note on Monday, with the government ready to bring in a bill to repeal the three contentious farm laws.The Farm Laws Repeal Bill is slated to be introduced in the Lok Sabha.Thousands of farmers have been protesting for the past one year to repeal the three legislations.The bill states that though “only a small group of farmers are protesting” against these legislations, the need of the hour is to take along everyone for inclusive growth.The ruling BJP and main opposition party Congress have issued whips to their MPs to be present on the day.The opposition will seek to target the government on the issue of farmers’ plight as well as their demand for legal backing for minimum support price.The Congress has also demanded a condolence resolution for the farmers who died during the year-long protests against the three laws.Besides the repeal bill, the government has listed 25 draft legislations for the Parliament session, including one to ban all but a few private cryptocurrencies while allowing an official digital currency by the RBI.A report of the Joint Committee of Parliament on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, will also be tabled in the two Houses during the session.The bill, seeking to provide for the protection of personal data of individuals and establish a Data Protection Authority for the same, was brought in Parliament in 2019 and was referred to the joint committee for further scrutiny on the demand of opposition members.The main objection of opposition members was granting “unbridled powers” to the central government to exempt any of its probe agencies, including the Enforcement Directorate and the CBI, from the purview of the entire act.According to the government’s legislative business list for the session, three bills have also been listed to replace as many ordinances.These three bills are Narcotics Drug and Psychotic Substances Bill to amend an act of the same name, the Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Bill and the Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Bill.The Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Bill and the Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Bill propose to extend the tenure of directors of the CVC and CBI.There is also a politically significant bill specifically for poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, The Constitution (Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) Order (Amendment) Bill, to amend the SC and ST list of the state. It is being introduced just a few months before the UP assembly election slated to be held early next year.Similarly, there is another bill to amend the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes list of Tripura.Then, there is the High Court and Supreme Court Judges (Salaries and Conditions of Service) Amendment Bill, 2021, to amend the salaries act of judges of the higher judiciary.The list of businesses also includes the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill, The Pension Fund Regulatory Development Authority (Amendment) Bill.Other listed bills include the Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Bill, 2021, which seeks to “empower the Commander-in-Chief or the Officer-in-Command of Inter-Services Organisations in respect of persons subject to the Army Act, 1950, the Navy Act, 1957, and the Air Force Act, 1950, who are serving under or attached to his command, for maintaining of discipline and proper discharge of their duties”.The Emigration Bill, 2021, will replace the Emigration Act, 1983 to establish a robust, transparent and comprehensive emigration management framework that facilitates safe and orderly migration.The National Anti-Doping Bill, 2021, aims to provide a legislative framework to the NADA for meeting the obligations of India under the convention and the obligations of NADA as a signatory of the WADA Code, as amended from time to time.The Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill, 2021, seeks to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, especially women and children, to provide care, protection, assistance and rehabilitation to the victims, while respecting their rights, and creating a supportive legal, economic and social environment for them, and also to ensure prosecution of offenders, and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.The session beginning Monday will conclude on December 23. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/winter-session-of-parliament-to-begin-on-stormy-note-on-monday-343786

28-11-2021||Mumbai||MVA Govt turned crisis into opportunity: CM Thackeray on completing 2 years in office||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said most part of his government’s two-year tenure was spent on COVID-19 management and that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) succeeded in turning the crisis into an opportunity.In a statement to mark the completion of his two years in office, Thackeray (61), who is recuperating in a private hospital after a spine surgery, thanked the people for supporting his government in all its endeavours and said it is the “people’s government”.“We did not panic during man-made and natural calamities and our focus remained on the welfare of the common man. Most part of the last two years went in COVID-19 management. We succeeded in turning the crisis into an opportunity,” the chief minister said. There is a vast difference between health, medical facilities and infrastructure that existed two years ago and now, he claimed.After the Maharashtra Assembly polls in 2019, the Thackeray-led Shiv Sena parted ways with long-term ally BJP over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post. It then forged an alliance with the NCP and the Congress to form the MVA government.Thackeray said there was no negativity in his government and the administration while tackling the pandemic.“We have worked hard in improving the industrial investment, agriculture infrastructure, housing, employment, water supply, solar energy, environment, tourism, forest and the focus has been on how the government’s efforts will ensure welfare of the common man,” he said.Under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule farm loan waiver scheme, debts of cultivators to the tune of Rs 20,000 crore have been waived off, the CM said.The state government has provided Rs 2,600 crore to hospitals and 14.4 lakh people have been treated free of cost under the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Arogya Scheme, he added.

28-11-2021||Sydney||Travel bans aren’t the answer to stopping new Covid variant Omicron||There is global concern and widespread alarm at the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.529, which the World Health Organization (WHO) has called Omicron.The WHO has classified Omicron as a “variant of concern” because it has a wide range of mutations. This suggests vaccines and treatments could be less effective.Although early days, Omicron appears to be able to reinfect people more easily than other strains.Australia has followed other countries and regions – including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and the European Union – and banned travellers from nine southern African countries.Australians seeking to return home from southern Africa will still be able to do so. But they will have to enter hotel quarantine and be tested, as will those who have returned from the nine stipulated countries – South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, the Seychelles, Malawi and Mozambique – in the past 14 days.But Omicron has already been detected in other regions, including the UK, Germany, Israel, Hong Kong and Belgium. So while a travel ban on southern African countries may slow the spread and buy limited time, it’s unlikely to stop it.As the Australian government and others act to protect their own citizens, this should be accompanied by additional resources to support countries in southern Africa and elsewhere that take prompt action.When was Omicron detected?The variant was identified on November 22 in South Africa, from a sample collected from a patient on November 9.South African virologists took prompt action, conferred with colleagues through the Network of Genomic Surveillance in South Africa, liaised with government, and notified the World Health Organization on November 24.This is in keeping with the International Health Regulations that guide how countries should respond.The behaviour of this new variant is still unclear. Some have claimed the rate of growth of Omicron infections, which reflects its transmissibility, may be even higher than those of the Delta variant. This “growth advantage” is yet to be proven but is concerning.‘Kneejerk’ response vs WHO recommendations               African scientists and politicians have been disappointed in what they see as a “kneejerk” response from countries imposing travel bans.They argue the ban will have significant negative effects for the South African economy, which traditionally welcomes global tourists over the summer year-end period.They note it is still unclear whether the new variant originated in South Africa, even if it was first identified there.As Omicron has already been detected in several other countries, it may already be circulating in regions not included in the travel ban.Travel bans on countries detecting new variants, and the subsequent economic costs, may also act as a disincentive for countries to reveal variants of concern in future.The WHO does not generally recommend flight bans or other forms of travel embargoes. Instead, it argues interventions of proven value should be prioritised: vaccination, hand hygiene, physical distancing, well-fitted masks, and good ventilation.In response to variants of concern, the WHO calls on all countries to enhance surveillance and sequencing, report initial cases or clusters, and undertake investigations to improve understanding of the variant’s behaviour.Omicron must be taken seriously. Its features are worrying, but there are large gaps in our current knowledge. While further analyses are undertaken, the variant should be controlled with testing, tracing, isolation, applying known public health measures, and ongoing surveillance.What can wealthier countries do to help?Wealthy countries such as Australia should support African nations and others to share early alerts of potentially serious communicable disease threats, and help mitigate these threats.The panel recommended creating incentives to reward early response action. This could include support to:       - Establish research and educational partnerships.Strengthen health systems and communicable disease surveillance.Greatly improve vaccine availability, distribution, and equity.Consider financial compensation, through some form of solidarity fund against pandemic risk.Boosting vaccine coverage is keyVaccines remain the mainstay of protection against the most severe effects of COVID-19.It’s unclear how effective vaccines will be against Omicron, but some degree of protection is presumed likely. Pfizer has also indicated it could develop an effective vaccine against a new variant such as Omicron within 100 days or so.COVID’s persistence is partly attributable to patchy immunisation coverage across many parts of the world, notably those least developed. South Africa itself is better off than most countries on the continent, yet only 24% of the adult population are currently fully vaccinated. For the whole of Africa, this drops to only 7.2%.Greater global support is urgently needed to boost these vaccination rates.African institutions and leaders, supported by global health and vaccine experts, have argued for mRNA vaccine manufacturing facilities on the African continent. These would prioritise regional populations, overcome supply-chain problems, and respond in real time to emerging disease threats.Yet developing nations face significant barriers to obtaining intellectual property around COVID-19 vaccine development and production.While there is still much to learn about the behaviour and impact of Omicron, the global community must demonstrate and commit real support to countries that do the right thing by promptly and transparently sharing information.

There are fears that it would also wreck the diplomatic calendar, which was slowly getting into its groove.In tandem with the fall in oil prices, commodities such as copper to cotton have also fallen, putting stock markets, a clutch of IPOs next month and even the sale of PSUs, especially Air India, under a cloud.The Reserve Bank will also be under pressure as it will have to battle a creeping inflation rate as well as continue with flexible monetary policies to counter the expected slowdown.The fears of the virus spreading have already led to the cancellation of the ‘12th Ministerial Conference’ (MC12) of the WTO scheduled in Geneva from November 30 to December 3.It may even lead to the postponement of the visit of the Russian President Vladimir Putin who along with his Foreign and Defence Ministers is poised to venture out of his country for only the second time since the virus broke out last year. Putin is scheduled to visit India and officials were not willing to hazard a guess about the prospects of a meeting with PM Modi on December 6.A meeting of ‘OPEC +’, the Saudi-Russia led cartel of oil producers, on December 2 will provide indications where global trade and travel is headed in the wake of the new strain.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-strain-casts-shadow-over-putin-visit-economic-recovery-343602

Without taking away the existing mechanisms available to the farmers, new avenues were provided for trade of their produce. Besides, farmers were free to select avenues of their choice where they could get more prices for their produce without any compulsion.”Amrut Mahotsav behind moveDuring Covid, farmers worked hard to raise production and fulfil the needs of the nation…the need of the hour is to take everyone along as we celebrate Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsav… in view of that, farm laws are proposed to be repealed. —Draft BillNoting that the enactments were made for the overall socio-economic uplift of the farmers and rural sector after “extensive consultations with various stakeholders”, the draft Bill says, “The operation of the laws has been stayed by the Supreme Court. During Covid period, the farmers have worked hard to increase production and fulfil the needs of the nation. As we celebrate the 75th year of Independence – Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsav – the need of the hour is to take everyone together on the path of inclusive growth and development. In view of the above, the farm laws are proposed to be repealed.”The draft Bill, to be tabled by Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, lists measures to boost agriculture and farm income and says a sum of Rs 106 lakh crore had been directly transferred to the bank accounts of 11 crore farmers.Questioning the wording of the draft Bill, Congress MP Manish Tewari remarked: “Why rub it in especially when PM Modi has apologised to farmers? In the statement of objects and reasons, why write — ‘even though a small group of farmers’ are protesting against these laws? This demeans the sacrifice of 700 -odd farmers who died struggling.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/repeal-bill-defends-farm-laws-343604

Targeting the PM, she accused him of doing nothing for farmers.“Do you know the income of PM’s big industrialist friends? They earn Rs 10,000 crore daily and you are earning Rs 27 a day, and this government is doing nothing for you, she alleged.”“Do you know the cost of the aircraft used by him? It is Rs 8,000 crore.

Hence, it is also incumbent upon the judges to exercise utmost discretion in their utterances in the courtrooms.”Underling that judges in India were seen as a model of rectitude, he said, “We have a rich history of legions of such judges known for their utterances full of sagacity and conduct beyond reproach, which have become hallmarks for the future generations.”He suggested creation of an all-India judicial service for selection of judges.

He flagged the need to monitor all international arrivals, test incoming passengers with focus on “at-risk” countries and review plans for easing of international travel restrictions.Omicron, a Super-spreader Be proactiveWe’ve to be proactive in view of the new variant. —Narendra Modi, PMAdvising improvement in the second vaccine dose coverage, intensive containment and active surveillance in high-burden areas and active genome-sequencing, the PM asked people to be more cautious by way of masking and social distancing. He also asked officials to review paediatric facilities, stocks of essential medicines and ventilators and medical oxygen availability in preparation for any potential future wave. The meeting came as India witnessed a low of 8,318 new Covid cases with vaccination expanding.The Africa Centres for Disease Control (CDC) has issued a statement strongly discouraging the imposition of travel ban for people originating from countries that have reported Omicron variant.“Imposing ban on travellers from countries where a new variant is reported hasn’t yielded a meaningful outcome. Rather Covid safety protocol should be encouraged,” Africa CDC said.On the new variant (B.1.1529), it said some of the mutations it carried had been detected in previous variants Alpha and Delta and had been associated with increased transmissibility and immune evasion.“Many other identified mutations are not yet well characterised and have not been identified in other currently circulating variants. More investigations are underway to determine the possible impact of these mutations on the capacity of the virus to transmit more efficiently, impact vaccine effectiveness and evade immune response and cause more severe or milder disease,” said the CDC.In view of the surge in cases elsewhere globally and detection of Omicron, the WHO appealed to countries in the South-East Asia Region (SEARO) to scale up surveillance, strengthen public health and social measures and enhance vaccination coverage.As of today, 31 per cent of the region’s population had been fully vaccinated, 21 per cent partially while nearly 48 per cent (about 100 crore people) were yet to receive even a single dose of vaccine, said Poonam Khetarpal, Regional Director, World Health Organisation, SEARO.Khetarpal said unvaccinated people continued to be at risk of contracting severe disease and spreading it further.Poor show31% of South-East Asia population fully vaccinated21%of the region’s population partially vaccinated100 crore people yet to get even a single doseMasks must: WHOThe WHO has advised strict enforcement of distancing, masks, hygiene, containment, surveillance and sequencing||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/review-plans-on-easing-travel-curbs-pm-amid-omicron-fears-343541

Hours later, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of unions spearheading the farm stir, called off its November 29 tractor march to Parliament.Unions on MSP panelFarm unions will be part of panel announced by PM Modi for reviewing the MSP regime... Farmers should now return home. —NS Tomar, MinisterThe minister said the farmers’ demand originally was to repeal the laws and that had been agreed along with another demand to decriminalise stubble burning. On the issue of MSP, he said farmer organisations would be part of the committee the PM had announced for review of minimum support price regime and for the realisation of crop diversification and zero budget farming goals.On the farmers’ demand to withdraw cases registered against them during the course of the year-long agitation against farm laws and for compensation to the families of 700 farmers who died protesting, the minister said, “The issue of registered cases is under the jurisdiction of the state governments and they will review the cases depending on seriousness and then take a decision.

He also highlighted that simply re-branding the existing courts as commercial courts, without creating a special infrastructure, would not have any impact on the pendency.Addressing judges and lawyers, CJI Ramana said, “We must remember that whatever criticism or obstacle that we may encounter, our mission to render justice cannot stop. We have to march on in pursuing our duty to strengthen the judiciary and protect the rights of the citizenry.”Artificial intelligence can help reduce backlog of casesArtificial intelligence can help in surprising ways to ensure sustainable justice delivery and reduce backlog of pending cases. —Kiren Rijiju, Union Law MinisterThe CJI, who was speaking at the valedictory ceremony of the Constitution Day celebrations in the presence of President Ram Nath Kovind and Union Law Minister Kiren Rijiju, said the issue of pendency of cases in the judiciary was multi-faceted in nature and hoped that the government would take into consideration the suggestions received during this two-day programme and resolve the prevailing issues.Besides, the Centre has approved Rs 9,000 crore for development of judicial infrastructure and allied facilities, Rijiju said. Noting that various sections of society were concerned about the huge pendency of cases, Rijiju said judicial infrastructure was essential for the reduction of backlog of cases.The government was sensitive to the needs of strengthening the judicial infrastructure and committed to investing maximum resources for developing next generation infrastructure, he added.The CJI thanked the Law Minister for approving Rs 9,000 crore for development of judicial infrastructure even as he said the problem was not about funds but their under-utilisation.He reiterated his demand for a special purpose vehicle in the form of judicial infrastructure authority to ensure proper utilisation of the funds meant for the judiciary.He complained that some states were not contributing their share towards this purpose. “Unfortunately, some of the states are not giving their share of money as a contributing share. So, no infrastructure schemes are taking off. This is the reason why I am strongly advocating the creation of a National Judicial Infrastructure Corporation,” the CJI said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cji-legislature-doesnt-study-or-assess-impact-of-laws-it-passes-343545

The party’s snub to the Congress came days after Kharge, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, said the grand old party would coordinate with all Opposition camps, including the TMC, during the winter session. Amid the strained relationship between the two, the TMC advised the Congress that it should have “proper internal coordination and set their own house in order”.“We are disinterested in coordinating with the Congress during the winter session. Congress leaders should first coordinate among themselves. They should set their own house in order and then think about coordinating with other camps,” said a senior TMC leader.Asked if the TMC would coordinate with other Opposition parties, he said, “We will raise several issues concerning people’s interest and will coordinate with them.

Sohan Murmu, who won ward no. 2 of Deepakarhar village, falling under the Khaira block, was nowhere to be found.“On enquiry, we learnt that Murmu had died on November 6, more than a fortnight before voting took place,” Khaira BDO Raghavendra Tripathi said with a sense of bewilderment. Deepakarhar happens to be a remote hamlet situated along the state’s border with Jharkhand.“Family members of Murmu, who defeated his rival by 28 votes, said it was the last wish of the deceased, who had been ailing, to win the election. So they kept quiet. No resident of the village informed us either. It appears that they all voted in his favour to honour his last wish,” said the BDO.“The winner’s certificate cannot be issued to anybody.

28-11-2021||Bhopal||Congress taught wrong history saying India became independent only because of Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru and Indira: MP CM||The Congress has taught the wrong history to the people by claiming that the country became independent only due to the contributions of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan alleged on Saturday.Addressing a gathering at Baroda Aheer, the birthplace of tribal revolutionary Tantya Bhil aka Tantya mama to mark the launch of Gaurav Kalash Yatra, Chouhan said, “We were not taught the right history. We were told that only Mahatma Gandhi ji, Nehru and Indiraji got Independence for us. I salute Mahatma Gandhi. He is a vishwa bandhu (universal brother) but the Congress taught us the wrong history.”He said the life and role of revolutionaries who laid their lives for the country such as Tantya mama, Rani Laxmibai, Nana Saheb Peshwa, Bhima Nayak, Raghunath Shah, Shankar Shah, Birsa Munda and several others were never taught to the people.Chouhan thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for declaring ‘Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas’ to mark the birth anniversary of Birsa Munda, a tribal icon.He said Tantya mama had fought against the exploitation by money lenders and led an armed battle against the British. Tantya mama used to loot treasuries of the British government and distribute the wealth among the poor, the chief minister said.Tantya mama was caught by deception and hanged by the British in the Jabalpur jail, he said, adding that the BJP government will teach the right history of Tantya mama.Chouhan said that it was painful to note that Congress had named a tribal university in the name of (ex-prime minister) Indira Gandhi and not after revolutionaries hailing from tribal communities.“They (Congress) glorified only one family while the rest of the martyrs were forgotten. But we (BJP) are rectifying this historical mistake,” he said.On the occasion, the CM honoured the descendants of Tantya Bhil and also announced the installation of Bhil’s statue.Gaurav Kalash Yatra will conclude on December 4, the martyrdom day of Tantya Bhil, at Patalpani after passing through various parts of MP.

So people need not worry," Bengaluru Rural Deputy Commissioner K Srinivas, under whose jurisdiction Kempegowda International Airport comes, said.Speaking to reporters here, he said, both the infected persons have been quarantined, are being monitored by the authorities and their samples have been sent for further tests to ascertain the variant. Noting that ten countries have been identified as high risk, the DC said all those coming from there are made to compulsorily undergo tests, and those tested positive are being quarantined. As many as 584 people have arrived in Bengaluru from ten high-risk nations from November one to 26, he said. Observing that cases of the new variants have been detected in the last one week in countries like Botswana, South Africa, Hong Kong and Israel, state Health Minister K Sudhakar earlier today said guidelines have been given to airports stating those travelling from these countries to the city have to undergo a test despite having negative Covid test report, and they will be allowed outside the airport only after testing negative. "Even after testing negative they will have to remain at home and after seven days they will have to undergo a test once again, and after getting a negative report, one can go out," he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/two-south-africans-test-positive-for-covid-19-as-threat-of-new-variant-looms-343496

So they kept quite. No resident of the village informed us either. It appears that they all voted in his favour to honour his last wish,” said the BDO.The naivete of the bereaved family members and fellow villagers, nonetheless, has brought meant more work for the officials.“The winner’s certificate cannot be issued to anybody. We are going to write to the state election body with the request that election for the ward concerned be nullified and fresh polls held,” said Tripathi in a matter of fact way.

However, they have called off their proposed tractor March to Parliament on Monday.“To enable the farmers to sell their produce at higher prices and benefit from technological improvements, farmers have been provided access to agriculture markets which will help them increase their income.

This demand will also be fulfilled with the setting up of a panel as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 19 on the day of Gurupurab.“The farmers’ demand was to decriminalise stubble burning. The Government of India has agreed to this demand,” the minister said.With regard to withdrawal of cases against farmers during the agitation, Tomar said this is in the domain of the state governments.“Looking at the severity of the cases, the state governments have to take a call and the issue of compensation is also to be decided by them,” he said, adding that every state will decide as per their state legislations.Stating that there is no justification for the continuation of the agitation after the government announced repeal of the three farm laws, Tomar said:  “Therefore, I appeal to all farmers organisations to end the protest ethically and show their big heart. They should return to their respective homes.”  The minister said the protesting farmers’ had initially demanded repeal of the three farm laws, which the government agreed to keeping  their interest in mind.The Cabinet has approved a bill to repeal the three farm laws, which will be introduced in the beginning of the coming session of Parliament starting November 29, he said.Tomar also said that the government is unhappy that it could not succeed in convincing some of the protesting farmers’ unions about the benefits of the farm laws.It has been over a year now that farmers, especially from Punjab, Haryana and parts of Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting against the three farm laws at Delhi borders.Although farmer unions have welcomed the government’s recent move to repeal the three farm laws, they said their protest would continue until the laws are totally and formally withdrawn and other demands, including legal guarantee to MSP, are met. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-agrees-to-farmers-demand-of-decriminalising-stubble-burning-agriculture-minister-narendra-tomar-343457
