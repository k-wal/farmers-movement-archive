But when it’s needed to defend the nation’s borders, then it’s a serious predicament the court has to encounter in cases like this,” it noted.“All development has to be sustainable…But sustainable development has to be balanced with defence of the nation. We can’t deny the fact…We are really in a terrain and altitude where the defence of the nation is extremely important. Can we, therefore, say we will override the concerns of the armed forces or the defence?” said the Bench which will continue the hearing on Wednesday.The ‘Char Dham’ highway project is to connect the four holiest places in Uttarakhand through 900-km all-weather roads. The Centre has contended that it will facilitate rapid deployment/movement of Armed Forces along India-China border which has witnessed face-offs at several points in recent times.Attorney General KK Venugopal told the Bench the Army needed feeder roads of a certain width to transport men and material in times of war. “There are seven projects leading to international borders which are needed for Army movements. There is a need for Armed Forces’ vehicles, rocket launchers etc to travel on these roads and all this was not taken into account,” Venugopal said, adding the Army’s needs must be taken into account.While highlighting the dangers of environmental degradation as reflected in recent disasters and landslides, senior Advocate Colin Gonsalves said, “Even if there is a whiff of suggestion that environmental concerns must triumph over the country’s defence, I must not win this case.”In view of a 2018 notification mandating a 5.5 metre limit for road width in hilly terrains, the Supreme Court had in September 2020 asked the government to comply with it in the Char Dham project. However, the Government amended the notification in December 2020 and sought the top court’s permission to construct 10 metre wide roads.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/national-security-vs-environment-sc-in-a-fix-over-char-dham-road-project-336016
09-11-2021||New Delhi||Navy information leak case: CBI seeks government sanction to invoke Official Secrets Act||The Central Bureau of Investigation has sought sanction of the central government to invoke the Official Secrets Act in the case of leak of sensitive documents related to the acquisition of three hulls of submarines being deliberated in the navy and other related information, officials said on Tuesday.The CBI had carried out raids on retired naval officers Commodore Randeep Singh and Commander Satwinder Jeet Singh on September 2 after getting information that the latter was going to share crucial details related to a meeting in the navy on the procurement of “three hulls”.S J Singh, who was working in the Directorate of Submarine Acquisition (DSMAQ) before taking VRS on July 31, 2021, allegedly provided regular information on internal deliberations to Randeep Singh in return for pecuniary advantage, the FIR has alleged.The CBI has accused the two officers of obtaining illicit money for themselves as well as for others by sharing “secret information of internal files for processing and passing of tender related to procurement and maintenance” of the Navy with private international companies, according to sources privy to the FIR.The agency has alleged that S J Singh has been leaking “internal information regarding operations/procurement from various Navy offices” to Randeep Singh who was working as middleman in return for huge bribes.The CBI had received an input that on August 16 Randeep Singh had sought “the main report of a meeting held in the Navy office regarding the procurement of three hulls” from S J Singh, the FIR alleged.S J Singh sought clearance of his previous dues from Randeep Singh before handing over documents related to the meeting, it alleged.Randeep Singh had promised S J Singh that all his previous dues totalling Rs 2.9 lakh will be cleared in the September 2 meeting, it said.During the searches, the CBI which had initially registered a case of corruption had recovered sensitive documents related to at least two naval projects following which a recommendation was made to invoke the Official Secrets Act in the case, they said.The CBI mentioned it in a special court during the bail hearing of the accused on Tuesday.Last week, the CBI had filed two charge sheets—one against Randeep Singh and S J Singh and the second against serving Commander Ajeet Kumar Pandey, three executives of Hyderabad-based Allen Reinforced Plastics Ltd and the company in addition to the two retired officers accused in the first charge sheet.The executives of the Hyderabad-based firm named in the charge sheet are Executive Director T P Shastri and Directors N B Rao and K Chandrasekhar.The CBI has arrested six persons—the two accused retired officers, Pandey, another serving officer under him and two private individuals—in an operation which started on September 3.The agency filed the charge sheet within 60 days of first arrests made on September 3 to ensure that the accused do not get easy bail, officials said.One of the naval officers under custody has not been named in the charge sheet and may be named in the supplementary charge sheet to be filed soon.The CBI has to file a charge sheet within 60 days of arrest of accused in corruption cases, else they become eligible for bail. The limit for special crime cases is 90 days. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/navy-information-leak-case-cbi-seeks-government-sanction-to-invoke-official-secrets-act-336014
09-11-2021||New Delhi||India not signed up to COP26 action agenda on sustainable agriculture||The Centre on Tuesday clarified that India has not signed up to a sustainable agriculture policy action agenda during the COP-26 Climate Summit in Glasgow.The clarification was issued by the Union Agriculture Ministry following media reports that India had signed up for the agenda.“It is clarified that such statements are baseless and factually incorrect. India has not signed up for the Sustainable Agriculture Policy Action Agenda during the COP-26 Climate Summit,” the ministry said in a statement.A National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) is one of the Missions within the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) that is operational in the country to deal with the issue of climate change, it said.The mission aims to evolve and implement strategies to make Indian agriculture more resilient to the changing climate, it added.According to the ministry, NMSA was approved for three major components: rainfed area development, on-farm water management as well as soil health management.Subsequently, four new programmes were introduced namely Soil Health Card (SHC), Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), Mission Organic Value Chain Development in North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER) and Sub Mission on Agroforestry (SMAF), it said.During 2015-16, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) was operationalised and subsumed under Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component of PMKSY.In addition to aforementioned programmes under NMSA, the Restructured National Bamboo Mission (NBM) was launched in April 2018. “Several steps are being taken to ensure that Indian agriculture remains on the path of sustainability,” the ministry added.

09-11-2021||New Delhi||Centre moves SC against HC order clearing Delhi govt’s ‘Doorstep Ration Delivery Scheme’||In a fresh face-off, the Centre has moved the Supreme Court challenging a Delhi High Court’s order giving the green signal to the Delhi government’s ‘Doorstep Ration Delivery Scheme’.In its September 27 order, the Delhi High Court had permitted the city government to cut down supplies to fair price shops for those opting for doorstep delivery, noting that “an overwhelming majority” has opted for doorstep delivery.On Tuesday, a Bench led by Justice LN Rao deferred hearing on the Centre’s petition after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta sought an adjournment for a day. It posted the matter for hearing on November 12 after senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the Delhi government, also urged it to defer the hearing as he had some personal difficulty.The Delhi government’s doorstep delivery of ration scheme had attracted criticism from the Union Food and Consumer Affairs Ministry which had taken exception to the use of the term “Mukhyamantri” for a scheme involving distribution of food grains allocated under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).The Centre maintained that any change in the delivery mechanism was possible only through an amendment in the Act passed by Parliament.Following the Centre’s strong objection, the Delhi government had dropped the term “Mukhyamantri” and launched the scheme on March 25. But the Centre maintained that the Delhi Government’s ‘Doorstep Ration Delivery Scheme’ in its present form can’t be implemented without amending the NFSA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-moves-sc-against-hc-order-clearing-delhi-govts-doorstep-ration-delivery-scheme-336007
09-11-2021||New Delhi||18 CRPF personnel killed in fratricide incidents since 2018: Officials||The recent fratricide killing in Chhattisgarh has prompted the world's largest paramilitary force, CRPF, to again ask its formations to check mental and emotional stress among the troops, officials said on Tuesday.The fresh advisory comes a day after a jawan killed four of his colleagues by spraying bullets on them at a camp in Chhattisgarh's Naxal violence affected Sukma district, taking the number of deaths to 18 in 13 fratricide incidents since 2018.READThe guidelines and measures to ensure and check mental and emotional stress among the troops have been "reiterated", they said.Six of these fatalities have taken place this year in five incidents in the force, which has about 95 per cent of its total strength on operational duties at any given point of time, they said.CRPF director general (DG) and other senior officers are travelling to Chhattisgarh to take stock of the situation in the wake of the Sukma incident on Monday.After the incident, a CRPF spokesperson had said that "prima facie, it seems that due to some emotional stress leading to sudden psychological disbalance, constable Reetesh Ranjan lost his control and in a fit of rage opened fire on his colleagues." The paramilitary force, which has about 3.25 lakh personnel in its ranks and is the mainstay for internal security in the country, has recently issued a communication to all its formations to identify personnel who are either under depression or are stressed, and undertake appropriate counselling for them to curb suicide and fratricide like incidents.According to official data, a total of 193 suicides have been reported in the force since 2018, with 52 incidents being registered this year alone. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/18-crpf-personnel-killed-in-fratricide-incidents-since-2018-officials-336002

Waze is accused in that case.The ED recently arrested Deshmukh, who was remanded in the agency’s custody till November 12.In its plea, the ED said they have recorded Deshmukh’s statement which needs to be confronted with Waze.It is imperative to record the statement of Waze as early as possible under relevant provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on an urgent basis and make him confront the documents/evidence collected during the investigation, the ED told the court.However, special public prosecutor Shekhar Jagtap, appearing for the crime branch, argued that no person or agency can interfere in the investigation being conducted by a probe agency.The grounds mentioned in the ED’s application don’t show any urgency, he said.“The application for two hours or two days doesn’t stand legally.... legally speaking it’s not maintainable in any form,” he said.“Our investigation is in progress. They (ED) are trying to sabotage our investigation...the so-called accused (Waze) is a puppet in their hands,” Jagtap said.The ED had launched the investigation against Deshmukh and his associates after the CBI filed an FIR against the NCP leader on April 21 on the charge of corruption and the misuse of his official position.Deshmukh’s private secretary Sanjeev Palande (an additional collector rank official) and his assistant Kundan Shinde were arrested by the ED.The agency earlier submitted its prosecution complaint (equivalent to a charge sheet) against the duo before a special court. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sachin-waze-a-puppet-in-eds-hands-mumbai-police-tells-court-335993
09-11-2021||Lucknow||BJP, SP want UP polls to be ‘Hindu-Muslim affair: Mayawati||BSP chief Mayawati on Tuesday accused the ruling BJP and the Samajwadi Party of the bid to give a communal colour to next year’s Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls, saying both outfits want the elections to be a “Hindu-Muslim affair”.Mayawati told reporters that both parties complement each other as their thought process is “casteist and communal”.The statement by Mayawati has come in the wake of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath invoking the alleged Kairana “exodus”, and the Ram temple in Ayodhya during his public meetings.Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav recently equated Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah with freedom fighters like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, attracting sharp reaction from the opponents.“The BJP government in order to hide its failure and divert the attention from it has colluded with the SP,” Mayawati told reporters here at a press conference.They are making efforts to raise communal issues like the Ayodhya police firing (on karsevaks) and Jinnah so that the Assembly elections “become a Hindu-Muslim affair”, she alleged.“This naturally exposes vested political interests of the SP and the BJP. This is true that the SP and the BJP have always been complementary to each other and the thought process of both these parties is casteist and communal,” she alleged. “So, when the SP is in power, the BJP becomes stronger, but if the BSP is in power, the BJP becomes weak,” she said.The former UP chief minister said the public has now become aware of the “conspiracies” of the BJP and the SP. “The BSP hopes that people of the state will not fall prey to any of the conspiracies,” she said, adding that as elections draw near, the BJP and other anti-BSP parties start “enacting a drama to woo and mislead people”. She alleged that the Centre and the UP government in the past couple of months made numerous announcements and laid several foundation stones besides inaugurating “half-baked works”. “This shows that the BJP is going to lose the Assembly elections,” Mayawati said. Targeting the Congress, Mayawati said had the party fulfilled half of the promises it had made during its long rule, it would not have been out of power at the Centre and in most states of the country.Taking a jibe at the BJP and the SP for claiming huge wins in the elections, she said, “The SP is claiming that it will win 400 seats in the upcoming UP Assembly elections while BJP is claiming that it will win 300 seats. This is childish and ‘hawa hawai’. From this point of view, the Election Commission has to increase the seats in the UP Assembly to 1,000.” —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-sp-want-up-polls-to-be-hindu-muslim-affair-mayawati-335990

Portions of sweet kheer were distributed among Dashrath’s wives after the ritual.In Prayagraj earlier, Nishad, a Member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Council had appeared to mock this.“No child can be born by feeding kheer,” he had said, arguing that the yagya was just for “namesake” and calling the kheer version a “respectful” story.He referred to Lord Ram as Dashrath’s “so-called son” and the saint’s “real son”.Asked to comment on the sidelines of the Allahabad University convocation on Monday, BJP’s election in-charge for the state and Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan was dismissive.“Sanjay Nishad has said a lot of things to me as well. His party is part of the NDA and he is our good ally, and we will fight the elections together,” he said.BJP state vice president Vijay Bahadur Pathak said he was not aware of Nishad’s remark.The opposition, however, sought to corner the BJP on the issue.All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi demanded a clarification from RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Nishad’s statement and said BJP leaders should give an explanation.Samajwadi Party spokesperson Ashutosh Verma said if Nishad can talk in this manner after joining hands with the BJP, then the ruling party should be asked about its stand on it.He said Nishad started talking about “Ram-Rahim” as soon as he came together with the BJP.“Inflation, unemployment and development are our main issues. I think Nishad ji should talk on serious issues now that he has become an MLC,” he said.Uttar Pradesh Congress spokesperson Lalan Kumar accused Nishad of losing his “mental balance” after allying with the BJP, and demanded an “unconditional apology” from him.He said Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath sometimes ”insults” Mother Sita and or calls Lord Hanuman a Dalit, and Nishad too has become a victim of “mental bankruptcy”.He accused the BJP and its allies of trying to change “religious history and facts”.The devout will not remain silent on this. The BJP, which is doing politics on Lord Ram and the temple, should clarify its stand on Nishad’s statement,” the Congress leader added.

There are some unpalatable remarks being made on social media, when you see closely how much judges have to perform, it’s difficult for people like us to comprehend,” Rijiju said at the Legal Services Day celebration, organised by the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) at Sharda University, Noida.“We are from public life, we are open. Judges can’t be open. It is not easy for them to come out of conventional duties and look after legal aid,” he said.Rijiju further said both the Legislature and the Judiciary want to ensure that people don’t have to struggle for bare minimum justice.Noting that four crore cases are pending in lower courts, he said the lower Judiciary is the place where greatest thrust must be given at this time.

A modest improvement in the month of October can be noticed following the sharp contraction in arrivals after the month of April. This reflects the improvement in international arrivals owing to factors such as vaccination advances around the world,” Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority said.India, the UK, Pakistan, Russia and Germany were the top five international tourist generating markets during October, it said.“India was the largest source of tourist visits to Sri Lanka with 37 per cent of the total traffic received in October. The UK and Pakistan accounted for 10 per cent and 9 per cent of the total traffic respectively,” the Tourism Development Authority said.The growth in arrivals from countries in the Americas, and Western, Central and Eastern Europe, suggests a slight revitalisation of leisure tourism, potentially enabled by factors such as the gradual improvement of traveller confidence, the lifting of travel restrictions, it said.As of October 31, a total number of 60,695 tourists had visited Sri Lanka, this year. It is a decline of 88 per cent over the last year when 5,07,311 tourists had visited the country from January to March 18.Sri Lanka’s economy has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic which has led to a slump in the arrival of foreign tourists to the island nation. The country has so far reported 5,45,935 confirmed cases and 13,875 deaths due to the disease. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/indians-top-list-of-tourists-to-sri-lanka-335985

This Mahapanchayat of the SKM will prove to be the last nail in the coffin of the anti-farmer government and the three black laws. Now the movement of ‘Annadata’ (food providers) will intensify even in Purvanchal,” Tikait, the national spokesperson of the BKU, tweeted in Hindi.Hundreds of farmers are encamped at Delhi borders with a demand that the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops.The Centre, which has held 11 rounds of formal dialogues with the farmers, has maintained that the new laws are pro-farmer, while protesters claim they would be left at the mercy of corporations because of the legislations. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kisan-mahapanchayat-in-lucknow-on-november-22-protest-to-be-intensified-in-purvanchal-rakesh-tikait-335967

09-11-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh Yadav slams BJP over pace of probe in Lakhimpur case||Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday hit out at the BJP over the Supreme Court’s observations on the probe into the Lakhimpur Kheri case, charging that the saffron party decides whom to implicate and where to take the investigation.“The BJP’s three engines—Delhi engine, Lucknow engine and Lakhimpur engine—are destroying law and order in Uttar Pradesh,” he told a press conference on Tuesday.The Supreme Court on Monday suggested that a former judge of a “different high court” should monitor the Uttar Pradesh SIT probe on day-to-day basis in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence case to infuse “independence, impartiality and fairness”, saying the investigation was not going the way it expected.Yadav said there is no hope of justice in the Lakhimpur case till the BJP is in power in the state.“The Supreme Court is saying that efforts are being made to save the accused in the Lakhimpur case. The courts have raised questions on the law and order of the state many times in the past. Why is the government not accepting the matter of monitoring of probe? We are already saying that as long as the BJP is in government here, there is no hope of justice in this case, he said. “Three engines of BJP are destroying law and order. First is the Delhi engine, then the Lucknow engine and Lakhimpur engine,” Yadav said while pointing fingers at the Centre, State and Union Minister of state Ajay Mishra whose son Ashish Mishra is named as an accused in the case.“The Minister of State for Home (Ajay Mishra), whose son was arrested in this case, has not been sacked yet,” the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said, adding that the Supreme Court has raised questions on the SIT.                        “BJP decides whom to implicate, whom to follow, where to take the investigation. When will the SIT finally itself be probed?”Four farmers were mowed down by an SUV in the convoy at Lakhimpur Kheri when a group agitating against the Centre’s three new farm laws was holding a demonstration against the visit of Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya on October 3.Two BJP workers and a driver were beaten to death allegedly by the angry protesters, and a local journalist was killed in the violence  Regarding Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s allegation of patronising of crime and criminals in the previous SP government, the SP chief said, “Which chief minister is speaking this after all. He should tell what sections were imposed on him, which he himself withdrew after becoming the CM”.Referring to the demonetisation carried out by the BJP government at the Centre in November 2016, Yadav said that despite so many years of this decision, the BJP was not telling what benefits it has given.“What was called a masterstroke turned out to be a brain stroke. It was done deliberately to harass the public,” he alleged.Yadav said after demonetisation, the assurance was given that black money stashed in foreign banks will be bought back.“There was talk of ending corruption but corruption has increased on a large-scale. BJP’s wrong policies are responsible for the plight of the economy,” he said.Alleging that a large number of youths, traders and farmers have committed suicide due to demonetisation, he said, “Does the government have any answer for this? This government did demonetisation to benefit big people. Today more cash has come in the market than it was in circulation earlier. BJP is master in doing propaganda”.Referring to Rakesh Pratap Singh, two-time MLA from Gauriganj seat, who is on a fast to protest against non-construction of two roads in his constituency, Yadav said, “One of our MLAs is on dharna. There is an appeal to him that to end the hunger strike against the ‘deaf and blind’ government. I appeal you to end the dharna and get healthy and fight with this government.” He said that Leader of the Opposition Ram Govind Choudhary would visit Singh and persuade him to end his fast.Singh, who was fasting to death in the capital, was forcibly admitted to Dr. Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Hospital by the police on Friday after his health deteriorated.During the press conference, birthday of a boy, who was born in a bank queue in Kanpur after demonetisation, was celebrated with party leaders giving him gifts. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/akhilesh-yadav-slams-bjp-over-pace-of-probe-in-lakhimpur-case-335963
09-11-2021||Beijing||Not attending Delhi security dialogue on Afghanistan due to ‘scheduling reasons’, says China||China said on Tuesday that it is not attending the security dialogue on Afghanistan convened by India due to "scheduling reasons".India will host the security czars from Russia, Iran and five Central Asian countries for a security dialogue on Afghanistan on Wednesday that will explore firming up a common approach for practical cooperation in confronting increasing threats of terrorism, radicalisation and drug trafficking following the Taliban's takeover of Kabul in August."Due to scheduling reasons, it is inconvenient for China to attend the meeting,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a media briefing here when asked about reasons why China is not attending the 'Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan' hosted by India."We have already given our reply to the Indian side,” Wang said.The security dialogue, to be chaired by National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval, will be attended by top security officials of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.The Ministry of External Affairs said in New Delhi that the dialogue would witness expanded participation of Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan and the countries would be represented by their respective NSAs or secretaries of the Security Councils."The high-level dialogue will review the security situation in the region arising from recent developments in Afghanistan. It will deliberate upon measures to address the relevant security challenges and support the people of Afghanistan in promoting peace, security and stability," it said in a statement.China, in coordination with Pakistan and Russia, has been maintaining close contacts with the Afghan Taliban though it is yet to recognise its interim administration in Kabul.Last month, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held talks with acting Deputy Prime Minister of Taliban's interim administration in Afghanistan Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in the Qatari capital of Doha.This was the second-time Wang met Baradar. They first met in China's Tianjin city in July this year, ahead of Taliban's take-over of power in Kabul. China has also pledged USD 31 million worth of aid to Afghanistan, including food supplies and coronavirus vaccines.

09-11-2021||Islamabad||Pakistani authorities restore land for first Hindu temple in Islamabad after public outcry||The city authorities in Islamabad have restored a piece of land allotted to the Hindu community for the construction of the first temple in the Pakistani capital following a huge public outcry after officials told a top court here that the allotment had been cancelled.The Capital Development Authority (CDA) revealed the cancellation of the plot on Monday during the hearing of a case in the Islamabad High Court (IHC), the Dawn newspaper reported on Tuesday.CDA's counsel Javed Iqbal told the court that the civic agency had already cancelled the plot for the Hindu community in February this year for not starting construction on it.According to the report, four kanals (0.5 acres) of land at H-9/2 in Islamabad was allotted to the community in 2016 for the construction of the first ever Hindu temple, cremation and community centre.Following the news of the cancellation of the plot, the mainstream as well as social media criticised the CDA, forcing it to withdraw the notification.CDA spokesperson Syed Asif Raza said that following a decision of the government, allotments of all lands issued to various offices, universities and other institutions on which no construction work had been started were cancelled.However, the officials concerned in the civic agency misinterpreted the Cabinet decision and had cancelled the plot allotted to the Hindu community.He said approval had already been given for construction of a boundary wall on the land allotted for the temple, so the decision of the Cabinet did not apply to it.This plot did not fall in the category of those where construction had not taken place, he added.The spokesperson also shared a copy of the new allotment letter which stated: “The allotment of subject plot allotted for temple, community centre and cremation ground for Hindu community in Sector H-9/2, Islamabad, stands valid as the same is not affected by the Cabinet decision dated 22-09-2020 as construction work on the subject plot had been initiated after approval of CDA dated 21-12-2020.”Asked if the CDA would initiate any inquiry against those who misinterpreted the Cabinet's decision, he said: “Actually, there was no bad intention involved in this case.""There was some sort of confusion and misinterpretation of the Cabinet decision and when the matter was brought into the notice of high-ups, the allotment was restored immediately,” he said.In July last year, after strong reaction from right-wing groups, which criticised the government for its intention to build a Hindu temple with government funding, the CDA had stopped the community from constructing the boundary wall around the plot.However, the matter was resolved in December when the city managers issued permission to the community to raise the boundary wall around the proposed site.There is no temple and cremation centre in Islamabad for the Hindu community. After lots of efforts by the community and on the direction of the Human Right Commission of Pakistan, the CDA had allotted the four kanals to the community in 2016.In the past, there was a temple in Saidpur village area of Islamabad but that was abandoned decades ago.

09-11-2021||Bhopal||Bhopal hospital fire snuffs out lives of 4 kids even before parents could name them||They had just been out of the protective womb of their mothers and yet to see the world around them, but the cruel fate snuffed life out of them in a split second after fire broke out at a hospital here and claimed the lives of four infants.The newborns, who were just about one to nine days old, had not even been named by their parents as they were admitted to the Special Newborn Care Unit (SNCU) of the government-run Kamala Nehru Hospital for treatment.The parents, overjoyed by the birth of their children, were probably thinking of names for them, but it could not happen. Now, they will only be remembered in this world as the “baby of Irfana, baby of Shivani, baby of Shajma and baby of Rachna,” a health official said.A picture of the medical equipment, monitors, ventilators, and other critical life-saving devices covered in black soot was enough to tell the tale of the ghastly tragedy inside the ward.State Medical Education Minister Vishwas Sarang, who was among the first few to reach the spot soon after getting information about the blaze, described the scene inside the ward as “very scary”.The fire broke out around 8.35 pm on Monday in the SNCU of the medical facility, situated on the campus of the Gandhi Medical College and Hamidia Hospital, which has the Upper Lake located on one side and state chief minister's official residence on the other.As the news of the fire spread, there was complete chaos in the hospital, according to eyewitnesses.Anxious parents were desperate to enter the ward to pick up and save their children, but they were prevented from doing so by the security staff, they said.Soon after the blaze, thick smoke engulfed the ward and it was pitch dark inside. A handy mobile phone torch was also not of much use amid the poor visibility there, eyewitnesses said.Doctors and nurses tried to shift the newborns to other wards. They managed to shift all the 40 children out, but were unable to save the lives of four of them who were already in a serious condition.Later, some of the parents also on their own shifted their children from other wards to safer places.In a video of the incident that went viral on social media, a stretcher was seen with four-five children along with a medical staff member carrying oxygen cylinders on his shoulders.Worried parents were seen running around the place in search of their children.Angry family members of some infants also alleged that instead of saving the children, the hospital staff fled.While a parent was searching for his child, some others rushed out of the hospital with their children, eyewitnesses said.Talking to PTI on Tuesday, minister Vishwa Sarang said, "I along with other medical staff shifted children to the other wards. I even broke the glass panes of the ward with my hand to allow the smoke to blow out so that we could shift the children to safer places." "We reached the spot along with others soon after getting information. It was dark inside the ward. We shifted the children to the adjacent ward," he said.Four children died in the fire that broke out probably due to a short circuit, Sarang said.Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has announced an ex-gratia of Rs 4 lakh each to the family members of the victims, he added.Forty children were admitted to the SNCU. Of these, 36 were undergoing treatment in different wards.In a tweet on Monday, Chouhan had said the rescue operation was swift and the blaze was brought under control."A high-level probe has been ordered into the incident. The probe will be conducted by ACS (additional chief secretary), health and medical education, Mohammad Suleiman," the chief minister said.Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly and former chief minister Kamal Nath termed it as a "very painful" incident and demanded stern action against those responsible for the tragedy.In a tweet, state BJP president Vishnu Dutt Sharma also expressed grief over the incident.

As the guardian minister of Mumbai, I get invited to various events. This was one of the invites,” Shaikh told reporters.He said two agencies — the NCB and the Mumbai Police — are probing this case. “As far as I can recollect, I don't remember speaking to Kashif on my mobile phone. It cannot be possible that I will have Kashif's mobile number because I don't know Kashif and he doesn't know me. He met at someplace (function) and he invited me and the matter got over,” Shaikh added.Targeting the BJP and the Centre, Shaikh added that concerted attempts are made to defame the Maharashtra government and its ministers since the tripartite MVA was formed nearly two years ago.Shaikh said while all the focus has been on the drug cruise raid, similar attention is not given to the multi-crore drug seizure in Gujarat in September.

It also claimed Indian agencies had been provided related documents in 2018. There has so far been no response on the matter from the Indian Ministry of Defence.‘Mediapart’ has published what it claimed were “false invoices” that allowed Dassault to pay secret commissions to the alleged middleman. “Despite the existence of these documents, the Indian federal police decided not to pursue the affair and has not begun an investigation,” the report said.The documents surfaced in another corruption case involving the supply of VVIP choppers by AgustaWestland, which is being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate.A judicial investigation is on in France since July into the allegations of corruption, influence-peddling and favouritism by Dassault to secure the deal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/french-media-house-makes-fresh-claims-of-bribery-by-dassault-aviation-335726

Developing indigenous and local capabilities to confront emerging security challenges and reduce dependence on borrowed technologies is, therefore, an imperative need, he said.

What will happen to the investigation then?” it wondered.Nothing in status reportWe have seen the status report. There is nothing in the status report. Lab reports have not come. It is not going the way we expected. —CJINoting that it was not confident about the manner in which evidence was being recorded by the UP SIT, the Bench said it wanted to appoint former Punjab and Haryana High Court Judge Ranjit Singh or Justice RK Jain to oversee the manner in which statements of witnesses were being recorded.The Bench asked Salve if the Uttar Pradesh Government would agree to the appointment of Justice Singh or Justice Jain for monitoring the SIT probe into the killing of four farmers, death of a journalist and the lynching of three others.Salve said he would seek instructions and come back on Friday. He also said local journalist Raman Kashyap died after being crushed by a car and that he wasn’t lynched by protesters’ mob at Lakhimpur Kheri.On behalf of Ruby Devi – the widow of slain BJP worker Shyam Sunder — senior counsel Arun Bhardwaj said he didn’t have confidence in the UP Police SIT investigation. Flashing a picture of Sunder with policemen in bullet-proof vests and AK-47 rifles, Bhardwaj demanded a CBI probe into the case.“The CBI can’t be a solution for everything,” the Bench said, adding that it was mulling the appointment of a retired judge of a High Court of another state to monitor the investigation on a daily basis.The Bench said it was trying to infuse some “fairness, independence and faith in the investigations” into the case. The top court made it clear that both incidents —- mowing down of protesting farmers by a speeding SUV and the lynching of the accused allegedly by angry protesters — had to be taken to a logical conclusion.During the hearing, it noted that as per police there were 16 accused in the mowing down incident of whom three were lynched.“Why have you seized the phone of only one accused? Where have you said in the status report that the rest of the accused threw away their mobiles but the police have recovered CDRs (call detail records),” it asked.“We have seen the status report. There is nothing in the status report. After the last hearing date, we granted a 10-day adjournment. Lab reports have not come. It is not going the way we expected,” the CJI said.Salve said it was beyond the control of the state government. Four farmers were mowed down by an SUV in Lakhimpur Kheri when farmers agitating against farm laws were holding a demonstration against Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit on October 3. Two BJP workers and a driver were beaten to death allegedly by angry protesters. A local journalist was also killed in the violence. Ten people, including Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra, have been arrested in the case by an SIT set up by the UP Government.The top court had on October 20 asked the Uttar Pradesh SIT to record statements of more witnesses before the magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC to prepare a fool-proof case. “We get the impression that you are dragging your feet…. Please do the needful to dispel that,” it had told Salve.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unhappy-with-lakhimpur-probe-sc-wants-it-monitored-by-retd-punjab-and-haryana-hc-judge-335690

Collective cry of the society must be responded by way of appropriate punishment to prevent re-occurrence of such crimes,” said Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) Pankaj Sharma, who also imposed a fine of Rs 2.25 crore each on the Ansal brothers.The three others sentenced to seven-year imprisonment were former court staff Dinesh Chand Sharma and private individuals PP Batra and Anoop Singh Karayat. They were fined Rs 3 lakh each.The court ordered that all the convicts be immediately taken into custody and sent to jail to serve the sentence.Noting that no amount of compensation could alleviate the agony, trauma and the pain suffered by the victims’ families, the CMM ordered that the amount collected from the convicts be paid as compensation to the victims’ families as it “can provide some succour to them”.Sharma had on October 8 convicted the real estate barons and the three others for tampering with evidence in the 1997 Uphaar cinema fire case in which 59 persons were killed during the screening of Bollywood blockbuster ‘Border’ on June 13, 1997.The Supreme Court had in 2015 held Ansal brothers guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentenced to the period already served and fined Rs 30 crore each. Later, it reviewed its decision and sent Gopal back to jail for a year. But Sushil was spared due to his old age. Two other accused—Har Swaroop Panwar and Dharamvir Malhotra—died during the protracted trial. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uphaar-ansals-get-7-year-jail-for-proof-tampering-335691

However, when compared to the recent conclaves in Tehran and Moscow, the dropping out of Pakistan and China stands out.The Ministry of External Affairssaid the high-level dialogue would review the security situation in the region and deliberate upon measures to address the relevant security challenges and support the Afghans in promoting peace, security and stability.What is common among these countries is their deep stakes in a stable Afghanistan as they will be the first to get hit adversely if terrorism and drugs flow out of the country.The participation of Tajikistan is crucial because it shares ethnicity with the restive province of Panjshir and hosted its rebels, including Amrullah Saleh and Ahmed Masood.Uzbekistan, Iran and Turkmenistan also share ethnicity and borders with Afghanistan. Like India and Russia, they are not happy with the domination of Pashtuns in Kabul. Russia is a crucial player since it provides additional security underpinning to many of the Central Asian countries to help keep their borders protected.However, the absence of China will be seen against the backdrop of increased military activities on both sides of the boundary and a stalemate in talks to disengage from eastern Ladakh.This means that the deadlock can only come at the politico-diplomatic level. The absence of China will indicate that there is no desire to break the deadlock.On the other hand, Pakistan and China have intensively engaged with the Taliban leadership in Doha, Kabul and Beijing. Islamabad will soon host Taliban Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi who will reciprocate the visit to Kabul by Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/8-nsas-to-attend-afghan-talks-in-delhi-china-to-stay-away-335693

Mediapart can reveal that detectives from India’s federal police force, the Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI), and colleagues from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), which fights money laundering, have had proof since October 2018 that French aviation firm Dassault paid at least 7.5 million euros (equivalent to just under Rs 650 million) in secret commissions to middleman Sushen Gupta,” Mediapart claimed in the report.“This was in the context of the French firm’s long and ultimately successful attempt to secure a 7.8 billion-euro-deal in 2016 to sell 36 of its Rafale fighters to India,” it said.Rafale manufacturer Dassault Aviation and India’s defence ministry have previously trashed allegations of any corruption in the contract.India’s Supreme Court too in 2019 dismissed petitions seeking a probe into the deal saying there was no ground for it.In a statement published in April, reacting to Mediapart’s report on the investigation, Dassault Aviation stated that the group, “acts in strict compliance with the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention and national laws”.The NDA government had inked a Rs 59,000-crore deal on September 23, 2016, to procure 36 Rafale jets from Dassault Aviation after a nearly seven-year exercise to procure 126 Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) for the Indian Air Force did not fructify during the UPA regime.The Congress accused the government of massive irregularities in the deal, alleging that it was procuring each aircraft at a cost of over Rs 1,670 crore as against Rs 526 crore finalised by the UPA government during the negotiations for the MMRCA.Prior to the Lok Sabha elections in 2019, Congress raised several questions about the deal and alleged corruption, but the government rejected all the charges.

It will be followed by the Budget Session, but this will be adjourned for recess after few days of proceedings for passage of the Union Budget.Inflation, rise in fuel prices, rise in prices of edible oil, militant attacks on civilians in Kashmir, the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, in which farmers were killed, and the farmers’ protests against three central agri laws, are among the issues, that are likely to be raised by the Opposition to corner the government.This year’s Monsoon Session was marked by protests by the Opposition, which sought answers from the government over the Pegasus spyware issue and demanded repeal of the three farm laws. The session was curtailed and adjourned sine die two days ahead of its scheduled adjournment due to the protests.

He was suspended and terminated from services on June 25, 2004.

09-11-2021||New Delhi||Restrictions lifted, fully vaccinated passengers from India take to US skies||Aditya Garg headed to San Francisco in the early hours of Monday, relieved that he could finally get back to work – and home – with the US government lifting travel restrictions for international travellers who are fully vaccinated against Covid.The young man from Jaipur, who works for a California-based electric vehicle company, was among the several people at the Delhi airport on Monday morning anxious to get to the US and boarding the first flight out they could.The coronavirus pandemic had prompted the US to close its borders to international travellers from many countries, including India, last year. Later, only passengers holding visas belonging to certain categories were permitted to travel.Starting Monday, November 8, the US has lifted all restrictions for fully vaccinated international travellers, including from India, but they will have to show proof of a negative coronavirus test before boarding a flight to the country.Garg, who took a United Airlines flight scheduled to depart at 4.30 am, said he had last travelled to the US before the pandemic-induced lockdown in March last year."I work and stay in Bay Area. It's a relief that after such a long time I am able to fly to the US as American authorities have eased restrictions for fully vaccinated passengers. Of course, we still have to take all precautions," he told PTI before entering the international departure lounge.Pritam Deshwal is also a US-based professional but was unable to travel from India due to restrictions.The airport designer, who took an Air India flight to the US, said, "I am based in New York, and the further lifting of restrictions on travellers will certainly help in getting reconnected to our offices and places, literally."Since the outbreak of the pandemic last year, most companies and institutions had allowed employees to work from home with digital technology playing a big role in helping colleagues stay connected in a 'new normal' scenario.Many US-bound passengers, including women, said their vaccination status had boosted their confidence."I am taking my first international flight after the outbreak of the pandemic. I am feeling fine," said a woman passenger who did not wish to be named.Among those who took flights out to the US were the Vij brothers, who are based in Miami."I am a US citizen, so, there was no restriction for me as such, but I am glad more people can fly now to the US," said Siddhant Vij, who took a Qatar Airways flight with his brother Shivek.American business executive Brad Nuss, who lives in Minnesota, flew to his home country on Monday and hoped that a sense of normalcy in international travel would return soon."The pandemic has changed our world and the way we see it and interact with others. And, with vaccination picking up in India and elsewhere, and the US further lifting travel restrictions, I feel it's a sign of things slowly getting back to normal in a way," Nuss told PTI before boarding a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines flight.At the airport, as family members bid goodbye to each other, many were overcome by emotion as they hugged, some taking the mandatory selfie to mark the occasion.The White House late last month said the US would lift all travel restrictions for incoming non-citizens and non-immigrant travellers from November 8, with only limited exceptions. They will be required to be fully vaccinated and produce proof of their Covid vaccination prior to boarding a flight to the country.Passengers will need to show their vaccination status, and the airlines will need to match the name and date of birth to confirm the passenger is the same person reflected on the proof of vaccination, according to an official statement issued earlier.Scheduled international passenger services have been suspended in India since March 23, 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. But special international flights have been operating under bilateral "air bubble" arrangements with 28 countries since July 2020.Under an air bubble pact between two countries, limited special international flights can be operated by their airlines between their territories with certain restrictions.

We want to protect the evidence collected," said the Bench.The top court made it clear that both incidents - mowing down of protesting farmers by a speeding SUV and the lynching of the accused allegedly by angry protesters - have to be taken to logical conclusion.During the hearing, it noted that as per police there were 16 accused in farmer mowing down incident of which three were lynched. "Why have you seized phone of one accused? Where have you said in the status report that the rest of the accused threw away their mobiles but the police have recovered CDRs," it asked."We have seen the status report. There is nothing in the status report. After the last hearing date, we granted a 10-day adjournment. Lab reports have not come. It is not going the way we expected,” the CJI said.Salve said it was beyond the control of the state government.Four farmers were mowed down by an SUV in Lakhimpur Kheri when farmers agitating against farm laws were holding a demonstration against Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit on October 3. Two BJP workers and a driver were beaten to death allegedly by angry protesters. A local journalist was also killed in the violence.Ten people, including Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra, have been arrested in the case by an SIT set up by the Uttar Pradesh government.The Supreme Court had on October 20 asked the Uttar Pradesh SIT to record statements of more witnesses before the magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC to prepare a foolproof case.“We get the impression that you are dragging your feet…Please do the needful to dispel that,” a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice NV Ramana had told senior advocate Harish Salve, who represented the UP government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/unhappy-supreme-court-wants-to-appoint-retired-punjab-and-haryana-high-court-judge-to-monitor-lakhimpur-probe-335541
09-11-2021||Sukma/New Delhi||CRPF jawan shoots dead 4 colleagues with AK-47 rifle in Chhattisgarh||Four CRPF jawans were killed and three others injured after their colleague opened fire at them in a camp of the paramilitary force in Chhattisgarh's Sukma district in the wee hours of Monday, a police official said.The incident took place at around 3.15 am in the camp of the 'C' company of Central Reserve Police Force's (CRPF) 50th battalion in Linganpalli village under Maraiguda police station of the area of the district, located nearly 400 km from the state capital Raipur, Inspector General of Police (Bastar range) Sundarraj P said.As per preliminary information, constable Reetesh Ranjan (25), a native of Bihar who was to proceed on leave from November 13, fired at his colleagues with his service weapon, an AK-47 rifle, leaving seven of them injured, the official said.The seven injured jawans were immediately shifted to a hospital in nearby Bhadrachalam area of neighbouring Telangana, where doctors declared four of them dead on arrival, the official said.“Ranjan (25), a native of Jehanabad in Bihar, was sanctioned leave from November 13 and he had booked a train ticket. He was about to get transferred to another unit of his battalion in Jammu and Kashmir as per the transfer policy of the paramilitary force,” Sundarraj said.Those killed were identified as constables Rajmani Kumar Yadav, Rajib Mondal, Dhanji and Dharmendra Kumar, he said.The accused constable was immediately nabbed and was being interrogated to ascertain the exact reason behind the incident, he said.“A preliminary investigation suggested that no quarrel took place between the accused constable and the victim jawans recently. There was also no issue of leave and service matters with Ranjan. The exact motive behind the incident will be known after an investigation," the IPS officer said.However, in New Delhi, the CRPF said the jawan who allegedly killed four of his colleagues and injured three others may have been suffering from "emotional stress" leading to sudden psychological disbalance.Sukma Superintendent of Police Sunil Sharma told PTI that Ranjan was scheduled to be on sentry duty at the camp from 4 am and after getting ready for it, he allegedly opened fire at his colleagues who were sleeping in a barrack.“Around 40 to 45 jawans were sleeping inside the barrack at that time. After all the bullets in Ranjan's rifle got exhausted, he was overpowered and captured by some of his colleagues who woke up on hearing the sound of gunshots,” the official said.“As per preliminary information, Ranjan and the victims had been exchanging jokes and teasing each other for the last two to three days. The accused might have been offended with the teasing and hence, took such a step,” Sharma said.Two of the three injured jawans were being airlifted to Raipur for further medical assistance, while the other one was undergoing treatment at Bhadrachalam, the SP said, adding their condition was stated to be out of danger.A postmortem of the deceased jawans was conducted at a medical college in Jagdalpur and their mortal remains will be sent to their native places on Tuesday morning by flights, Sharma added.Of the deceased jawans, three belonged to Bihar and one was from West Bengal, he said.Senior CRPF and police officials visited the Linganpalli camp after the incident, he added."The local police has begun investigation into the case and all legal actions will follow. The CRPF has ordered an inquiry into the incident to ascertain the cause of the incident and suggest remedial measures."Prima facie, it seems that due to some emotional stress leading to sudden psychological disbalance, constable Reetesh Ranjan lost his control and in a fit of rage opened fire on his colleagues," a CRPF spokesperson said in New Delhi.The spokesperson said the local CRPF deputy inspector general (DIG), Commandant of the 50th battalion in which the shooting took place, and other senior officers visited the incident site."Easy availability of a firearm to a personnel who either ends his life or attacks his colleagues is a big challenge for security forces. Different solutions are being looked to check this issue, but a perfect one is still to be found," a senior CRPF officer said in the national capital.The paramilitary force, which has deployed over 28 battalions in the state for anti-Naxal operations, recently issued a communication to all its formations to identify personnel who are either under depression or stressed, and undertake appropriate counseling for them to curb suicide and fratricide-like incidents.The CRPF is extensively deployed in south Bastar, comprising Bijapur, Dantewada and Sukma district for anti-naxal operations.Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel expressed grief over the fratricidal incident and directed police officers to take necessary measures to ensure such incidents do not recur, according to a government statement.In his condolence message, Baghel termed the incident as “unfortunate”.In another government release said, the CM asked police officers to take necessary steps to ensure such incidents do not recur.He instructed authorities to provide best treatment to the injured jawans, the statement said.With this incident, as many as 15 security personnel have died in five cases of fratricide in the state in the last three years, according to police officials.In a similar incident on January 29 this year, a CRPF jawan was killed and another one injured after their colleague opened fire at them in their camp in s Bastar district. The offender had then tried to commit suicide by shooting himself, they said.On May 29 last year, two Chhattisgarh Armed Force (CAF) jawans were killed and another one was injured after an assistant platoon commander of their unit opened fire at them at a camp in Narayanpur district.On December 4, 2019, six Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) jawans were killed at the camp of 45th battalion of the paramilitary force in Narayanpur district in a similar incident.In the wake of incidents of fratricide and suicide, the Chhattisgarh Police in June last year launched a special campaign, titled 'Spandan', for security staff to overcome mental stress and depression. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/crpf-jawan-shoots-dead-4-colleagues-with-ak-47-rifle-in-chhattisgarh-335521
