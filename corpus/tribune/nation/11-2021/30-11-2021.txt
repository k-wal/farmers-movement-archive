30-11-2021||New Delhi||Stricter norms for international passengers arriving in India effective from Tuesday midnight||The strict norms for arriving international passengers, especially from ‘at-risk’ countries, will come into effect from Tuesday midnight and authorities are stepping their vigil for effective surveillance amid mounting concerns over the emergence of the Covid variant Omicron.While no cases of Omicron have been reported so far in India, the Union government has asked states and Union Territories to ensure RT-PCR tests for travellers coming from ‘at-risk’ countries on the first day of arrival and retesting on the eighth day.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Tuesday advised states not to let their guards down and keep a strict vigil on the international passengers coming to the country through various airports, ports and land border crossings.Under the new norms, RT-PCR tests are mandatory for passengers arriving from ‘at-risk’ countries and they will be allowed to leave the airport only after the test results come. Also, randomly five per cent of the passengers arriving in flights from other countries will be subject to the test.As the authorities ready to implement the new norms from Tuesday midnight, the Union health ministry has advised international passengers from ‘at-risk’ countries to prepare to wait at the airports till the report of the RT-PCR test has come and not book connecting flights beforehand.Further, the ministry has asked states to send all positive samples for genome sequencing to INSACOG Labs (mapped with states) promptly.International airports in the national capital and other parts of the country have made preparations for implementation of the new norms.In the wake of the new guidelines, aviation regulator DGCA has issued a circular asking airlines and airport operators to ensure various measures are in place.“Separate holding area (while they are waiting for their RT-PCR test results) may be demarcated for the passengers coming from ‘at-risk’ countries in each airport, with proper amenities for passengers...,” the regulator said in the circular dated November 29.To avoid congestion, the DGCA has emphasised the need to ensure that Covid appropriate behaviour is followed.“Signages may be put up at prominent places and volunteers may be placed to guide the passengers to prevent any chaos,” it noted.With respect to identifying passengers for random RT-PCR tests, the watchdog said that airlines should put in place proper randomisation process.“Announcements as to the seat numbers selected through the randomisation process may be made in the flight itself so that passengers are prepared,” the regulator said.Among other requirements, international passengers have to fill the self declaration form on Air Suvidha portal.While filling up the form, all incoming passengers may be advised to plan their onward journey keeping in mind the stay at the airport to obtain the test results, the DGCA said.Also, passengers should be prepared for movement to quarantine facilities identified by state governments if they test positive at the airport.“Additional RT-PCR facilities, as required, may also be set up at all airports,” the regulator said. Officials on Tuesday said the Delhi international airport has made arrangements to accommodate at the airport up to 1,500 international passengers at a time, including those coming from ‘at-risk’ countries, till results of their RT-PCR tests taken after arrival are declared.Each passenger who will undergo the RT-PCR test will be charged around Rs 1,700. The amount includes charges for the RT-PCR test, and food and water during their stay at the airport till the test results come, they said.An Airports Authority of India (AAI) spokesperson said all AAI airports that have international operations are “fully prepared” to implement the guidelines issued by the Union government in coordination with state authorities.The spokesperson also said that the top management of the AAI is also monitoring the situation.State-owned AAI is involved in operations of 34 international airports, including customs airports.A spokesperson for the Bengaluru international airport said, “We are working with all the airlines and other stakeholders to implement the new procedures and minimise inconvenience to passengers.”A spokesperson for full service carrier Vistara said that in light of the new guidelines for testing and screening of international passengers at airports, it has already made necessary changes to the minimum connecting time for future bookings of relevant flights. “Additionally, we will also try and assist our passengers, as best as we can, to ensure that they have a convenient travel experience,” the spokesperson said.As per updated list on November 26, the countries designated as ‘at-risk’ include European countries, the UK, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Israel and Hong Kong.On Tuesday, Bhushan chaired a high-level meeting with States/UTs to review COVID public health response measures and preparedness amid concerns over Omicron.Civil Aviation Secretary Rajiv Bansal, Secretary (Health Research) & DG ICMR Balram Bhargava, NCDC Director Sujeet K Singh, State Health Secretaries and State Airport Public Health Officials (APHOs), among others, participated in the meeting.

The thrust of the meeting was also on reaching out to the Jatav sub-caste among the SCs.A BSP functionary associated with the meeting said on condition of anonymity that Mayawati directed for special efforts to take reach out to the OBC voters, Muslim, and the Jat community who are electorally influencers in about 120 seats in western Uttar Pradesh and the some contiguous areas.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mayawati%C2%A0asserts-bsp-will-contest-up-elections-solo-344726
30-11-2021||New Delhi||Change in demographic pattern in border areas behind decision to enlarge BSF jurisdiction: DG||BSF director general (DG) Pankaj Kumar Singh on Tuesday said that the “demographic balance” has been upset in border states like Assam and West Bengal over a period of time and that was probably the reason that the Centre recently extended the force’s jurisdiction.Rejecting allegations that the October notification of the Union home ministry (that expanded its jurisdiction to undertake search, seizure and arrest within a larger 50 km stretch from the international border in Assam, West Bengal and Punjab as compared to the earlier 15 km) interfered with local policing, he said the BSF was not trying to “act as a parallel police” and the powers to investigate and file charge sheets continue to remain with the state.“Over a period of time, you must have observed whether it is Assam or West Bengal, the demographic balance has been upset to a great degree...it has changed for whatever reasons. It has changed and there have been agitations in certain states and there have been many many times revolts because of these reasons...even the voter pattern has changed in certain districts neighbouring borders.”    “So, the government probably thought that in its vision that the BSF jurisdiction is changed from 15 km to 50 km and maybe now it can help and support and supplement the state police in catching hold of the infiltrators,” Singh told reporters here on the eve of the 57th Raising Day of the force.He said the new move will also help the BSF and state police in effectively curbing trans-border crimes like smuggling of narcotics and weapons among others.The Border Security Force (BSF) guards over 6,300 km of the Indian fronts with Pakistan on the west and Bangladesh on the east of the country.The DG said that the force has dome a survey in some border villages that found that there is a “definite” demographic change.He said the process of implementing the new notification was a “step-by-step” process like the BSF formations finalising the 50 kms distance from the border adding that “in times to come we have to see whether we need to establish (new) posts to have some backup.”Singh asserted there was “no concept of BSF trying to intrude into local police functioning or trying to act as parallel police.”   There is no problem at all, we work in tandem with local police, he said.The notifications, he said, issued by the central government were essentially in the context of The Passports Act and the Passport (entry into India) Act with the earlier dealing with people going out of the country and the latter with the people entering into the country.He said the government “standardised” the 50 km area from the border in all border states manned by BSF so that “forces can easily move from one theatre to the other.”       The Union home ministry had issued a notification in this context on October 11 amending a July, 2014 enabling provision for the BSF personnel and officers while they operate in the border areas.While in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam the BSF jurisdiction was enhanced from the earlier 15 km to 50 km in Gujarat, that shares border with Pakistan, the same limit has been reduced from 80 km to 50 km while in Rajasthan the limit has been kept unchanged at 50 km.The issue courted controversy as opposition ruled Punjab and West Bengal denounced the move and their respective assemblies moved resolutions against this decision of the Unin government.The BSF has a strength of about 2.65 lakh personnel at present and it was raised on December 1, 1965. It has 192 operational battalions at present and is the country’s largest border guarding force with ITBP, SSB and Assam Rifles being the other three.

30-11-2021||Vijay Mohan||After paying Rs 26 crore for land 16 years ago, title deed still eludes DRDO||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, November 30Almost 16 years after the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) had shelled out Rs 26 crore for purchase of land from another government entity, it has been unable to get the sale deed executed in its name.This has not only raised eyebrows over non-availability of complete land ownership records, but also putting unwarranted land tax liability on the seller.In March 2005, ITI Limited had transferred 22.945 acres of its land at KR Puram to DRDO, for which it received the entire amount as advance payment. However, the sale deed could not be executed as papers to prove ownership or title for certain pockets of the land were not available with ITI.Audit scrutiny of the pending transactions revealed that ITI got the required revenue documents in 2012, that is, eight years after the agreement with DRDO and physical transfer of the said land.ITI Limited, earlier known as Indian Telephone Industries Limited, is a government-owned telecommunications equipment manufacturing and digital security service enterprise functioning under the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).Later, ITI was referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) for restructuring its organisation and revamping its business operations. In August 2013, DoT directed that requisite clearance should be obtained from BIFR for executing the sale deed.In 2014, the central government approved a revival package for ITI. In the meantime, orders were issued mandating government approval for sale of land and property even of public sector undertakings. Hence, ITI sought DoT’s approval for sale of land to DRDO, which according to a report tabled in Parliament by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) on November 29, was still awaited.“In the absence of required approval, though ITI had received the agreed sale value from DRDO and handed over the land, it has not been able to execute the sale deed and register the sale in the name of DRDO. As a result, ITI would be liable for payment of property taxes due on the property,” CAG observed.On its part, DoT has maintained that all efforts have been put in for obtaining clearance for executing the sale deed in favour of DRDO and it expected that approvals would be obtained soon. The case is being processed for seeking sanction of the competent authority.“Besides, the disproportionately long time taken to process approvals, the root cause for the delay was the company’s inability to provide documents to prove their title over the land,” CAG pointed out.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-paying-rs-26-crore-for-land-16-years-ago-title-deed-still-eludes-drdo-344723
30-11-2021||New Delhi||NTA panel finds no discrepancy in Hindi version of Physics paper in NEET-UG exam, SC dismisses plea||The Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a plea by students alleging discrepancy in a question in the Hindi version of Physics paper in NEET (UG) 2021 after the NTA-appointed expert panel’s finding said the answer would remain the same in Hindi as well as English.A Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, AS Bopanna, and Vikram Nath said it would be beyond the remit of the court to conduct an exercise of re-assessing the correctness of the solutions.It said the National Testing Agency (NTA), entrusted with the duty of conducting the NEET (UG) 2021 examination, while responding to the apprehensions of the students, had the matter scrutinized again by three subject experts. “Hence, it would not be open to this Court to substitute its own view. In the circumstances, having given our anxious consideration to the submission which has been urged on behalf of the petitioners, we are unable to interfere. The petition is accordingly dismissed,” it said.Advocate Archana Pathak Dave, appearing on behalf of the petitioners, tried to persuade the top court that based on the underlying material in the 12th standard Board examination; there would be a variation in the solutions to the question in English and Hindi as a result of a difference in translation.At the outset, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the NTA, said that in compliance with the earlier order of the court, the agency has constituted an expert panel comprising of three Professors from IIT Guwahati, Delhi Technological University, Delhi, and National Physical Laboratory, Delhi for evaluating the solutions in both the English and Hindi versions of Question No 2 of Section A in the Physics Paper of the NEET (UG) 2021 examination.He said the panel found that irrespective of the medium, English or Hindi, the answer to the question will remain the same and therefore it clarifies the issue at hand.  On November 25, the NTA had told the top court that to allay the apprehensions of students who appeared for the NEET (UG) 2021 exam, it will appoint a committee of three experts to evaluate again the answers to an alleged error in the Hindi version of Physics paper.Mehta, appearing for NTA had said that the questions will be evaluated again by a committee of three experts.The top court was hearing a plea filed by Wajda Tabassum and 21 other NEET candidates alleging discrepancy and patent error in question number 2 of the Hindi version of Physics paper in which the word ‘amplitude of the current’ had been omitted.Mehta had said that the issue was examined by neutral experts and they have opined that the answer would be the same irrespective of the alleged discrepancy or omission of words in the Hindi translation of the question paper.Dave had said that due to the omission of the words, another answer in the Hindi version is correct.She had stated that out of over 15 lakh students, who appeared for the NEET-UG examination, nearly two lakh students opted for the Hindi version and they would be in a disadvantageous position as there was negative marking for wrong answers.The plea has claimed that due to the alleged omission of the words in the Hindi version, candidates who have attempted the question have arrived at a different answer than their English counterparts.It has been said that both the incorrect and the correct answers were provided as options to the multiple-choice questions and the students, alleging omission of the words, have sought deletion of the said question.They have also sought to declare the NEET-UG, 2021 examination as erroneous and faulty as the NTA without taking cognizance of the error has released the answer key based on the answer to the English translation and has put the Hindi version candidates at the disadvantageous position.The plea had sought deletion of disputed question from all the versions of the subject and declaration of fresh result.The National Eligibility and Entrance Test-Under Graduate (NEET-UG) examination was held on September 12, 2021, for MBBS and BDS courses in which over 15 lakh students have appeared. It was conducted by the NTA and results were declared on November 1. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nta-panel-finds-no-discrepancy-in-hindi-version-of-physics-paper-in-neet-ug-exam-sc-dismisses-plea-344722

And imagine any number of choices could be procured for a small amount without any auction.This came to light after the Cyberabad Police Special Operation Team busted a racket arrested gang members functioning as a parallel Regional Transport Office (RTO).Cyberabad Police Commissioner M Stephen Raveendra told reporters at a press conference that the gang thrived after exploiting loopholes in the process of issuing registration certificates.Seven people have been arrested, and hundreds of fake RCs, printers, stamps, etc., have been confiscated. The police believe that the gang was working on a pan-India level.Information has been sent out to several states, some in north India, where the counterparts of this gang could be operating without any suspicion, providing registration certificates for stolen and other vehicles.If nothing else changed and the gang provided an RC with a later year of manufacturing for the vehicle, it could increase the price by several times, a member of the police team said.Explaining the scam, the Police Commissioner said when vehicles were confiscated on default of loan payment, these were sold through auction by the finance companies with a ‘No-Objection Certificate’ to re-register. This was when the gang stepped in and fraudulently provided duplicate RC.The gang, he said, forged RCs that were sold to third party agents by the finance companies.

30-11-2021||New Delhi||People with A, B blood groups, Rh+ more susceptible to Covid: Study||People having blood group of A, B and those with Rh factor positive are “more susceptible to Covid-19 infection” compared to those having O or AB group and Rh negative, according to a new study conducted by doctors at a Delhi hospital.In a statement issued on Tuesday, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) said the research was conducted on a total of 2,586 Covid-positive patients, tested through real-time PCR (RT-PCR), who were admitted at the facility from April 8 to October 4 in 2020.The study by the Department of Research and Department of Blood Transfusion Medicine at the SGRH “has found that (those having) blood groups A, B and Rh+ are more susceptible to Covid-19 infection whereas (those with) O, AB and Rh- are at lower risk of Covid-19 infection”, the statement said.The researchers have also claimed that “there is no association between blood groups, and susceptibility to severity of disease as well as mortality”.Resus factor or Rh factor is a protein that may be present on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs).The positive or negative sign next to the blood groups is known as the Rh factor. If the blood type is positive, then the blood cells have the Rh protein, and they lack the Rh protein, if negative.The study has been published in November 21 edition of ‘Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology’, the statement said.Dr Rashmi Rana, Consultant, Department of Research, SGRH, said, “Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a new virus, and it is unclear whether blood groups have any impact on Covid-19 risk or progression. Therefore, ‘we investigated the association of ABO and Rh blood group with Covid-19 susceptibility, prognosis, recovery time, and mortality in this study”.During the study of admitted patients, follow-up was also taken up till their last date of admission as either discharged or deceased, hospital authorities said.According to Dr Vivek Ranjan, co-author and Chairperson, Department of Blood Transfusion, SGRH, “We also found that male patients of blood group B are more prone to Covid-19 than the female patients with blood group B, and blood group AB was observed to be more susceptible to infection in patients with age group of over 60 years.”                The study also claimed that blood group A and Rh + types are associated with a decrease in recovery period, whereas blood group O and Rh- are associated with increase in recovery period, according to the statement.“However, the ABO and/or Rh blood groups may not be responsible for this association, as these may indicate an unexplored underlying factor like co-morbidity. Therefore, larger, multicentre and prospective studies are needed to ascertain the relationship between blood groups and SARS-CoV-2,” it added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/health/people-with-a-b-blood-groups-rh-more-susceptible-to-covid-study-344709
30-11-2021||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Gandhinagar Lok Sabha seat to see Article 370 cricket, kabaddi tourneys||The ruling BJP in Gujarat has decided to organise kabaddi and cricket tournaments that will have ‘Article 370’ in their names in Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s Gandhinagar Lok Sabha constituency, party office bearers said on Tuesday.While modalities are still being worked out, the name of the tournament has been finalised as Gandhinagar Lok Sabha Premier League 370, and an official announcement of the tournament would be done soon, said Gujarat BJP general secretary Pradipsinh Vaghela.According to Vaghela, the tournament has been named after Article 370 of the Constitution because it was Amit Shah, the Lok Sabha MP from Gandhinagar, who was instrumental in the abrogation of that provision, which conferred a special status to Jammu and Kashmir.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked all MPs to organise sports tournaments in their constituencies. Thus, to provide a platform to talented youths, Shah had asked us to host such tournaments in his constituency. We will start with kabaddi and cricket and then take up other sports,” said Vaghela.He claimed people of Gujarat, especially in Gandhinagar, were in love with the term Article 370 because their local MP had tabled the proposal in the Parliament that led to its abrogation.“As of now, it has been decided to have one kabaddi and one cricket tournament for the entire Gandhinagar Lok Sabha seat. Since there will be more rush for cricket, one cricket tournament for each of the seven Assembly segments of Gandhinagar seat will be held and winners of these Assembly-level tournaments will again compete against each other for the crown,” he explained.A registration drive for the tournaments and teams would begin soon, he said.Hitesh Patel, the BJP’s media coordinator for north Gujarat, said people from Gandhinagar in the 16-40 age group can participate, with booth and ward level teams winning and advancing further as per the format of the tournament.“The process to select grounds has begun. It is possible the cricket games would be of 10-12 over duration so that at least five games can be played daily,” Patel added.Party sources said the tournament would most probably begin from December 15. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gujarat-amit-shahs-gandhinagar-lok-sabha-seat-to-see-article-370-cricket-kabaddi-tourneys-344707

30-11-2021||Mumbai||Kangana Ranaut alleges threats over posts on farmer protests, files FIR||Actor Kangana Ranaut on Tuesday said she has filed an FIR after allegedly receiving threats over her posts on farmers’ protests.Ranaut, who has been constantly critical and sometimes incendiary against the farmers’ movement, posted a lengthy statement in Hindi on Instagram.The actor alleged that she has been “constantly receiving” threats from “disruptive forces” over her recent posts.“I am getting constant threats from disruptive forces on this very post of mine. One man from Bathinda openly threatened to kill me. I am not afraid of these type of threats.“I will continue to speak against those who conspire against the country and terrorist forces, be it Naxalites killing innocent jawans, tukde tukde gangs or terrorists sitting abroad dreaming of forming Khalistan,” Ranaut said.Along with the post, the actor shared a photo of her and mother from their recent trip to Amritsar’s Golden Temple.“Democracy is the biggest strength of our country. The government may be of any party, but the fundamental right to protect the integrity, unity and fundamental rights of citizens and expression of ideas has been given to us by the Constitution of Baba Saheb Ambedkar.“I have never said anything derogatory or hateful about any caste, religion, or group,” Ranaut said.Sharing a copy of the FIR, the 34-year-old actor also requested interim Congress president Sonia Gandhi to direct Charanjit Singh Channi-led Punjab government to take action on her complaint.“I would also like to remind Congress President Sonia ji that you are also a woman and your mother-in-law Indira Gandhi ji fought strongly against this terrorism till the last moment. Kindly instruct your chief minister of Punjab to take immediate action on threats from such terrorist, disruptive and anti-national forces.“I have registered an FIR with the police against the threats and I hope the Punjab government will take action soon,” Ranaut said.The actor claimed there is politics behind the threats that she has received.

30-11-2021||Patna||Empty liquor bottles found in Bihar legislature premises, uproar ensues||Empty bottles of liquor were found in the premises of legislature in dry Bihar on Tuesday, in a fresh embarrassment to the Nitish Kumar government, which has been drawing flak over recent hooch tragedies that have claimed more than 40 lives.The bottles were found under a tree in the area earmarked as parking lot for two-wheelers.“This is outrageous. The spot is less than 100 metres away from the chief minister’s chamber,” Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav fumed upon inspecting the site.“Only yesterday the chief minister presided over a farce wherein NDA legislators took the pledge, inside the central hall here, against liquor consumption. Within 24 hours, liquor bottles have been found in the same premises,” he said.When asked if he favoured a repeal of the prohibition law, which his father Lalu Prasad claims to have been opposed to, Yadav said, “We are in favour of complete ‘nashabandi’ (non-consumption of intoxicants).”Upon being pointed out that the ruling NDA has been accusing RJD leaders of involvement in illicit liquor trade, he remarked sarcastically, “If they come out with the theory that we had planted the bottles in the premises, we will not be surprised.”          When the assembly resumed business after the lunch hour, the opposition leaders raised slogans, demanding a statement from the “chief minister or the home minister”.Chief Minister Kumar, who also holds the Home portfolio, informed the House that serious note has been taken of the incident and those responsible for the lapse would face stern punishment.“I will ask the chief secretary and the DGP to look into this matter of serious concern,” said Kumar.In response, Yadav said, “Please ensure that lower-level officials are not made scapegoats and the big fish do not go unpunished.”   The sale and consumption of alcohol were completely banned in Bihar in April 2016. The drastic move followed a promise made by Kumar to women of the state during the assembly elections of 2015, which his JD(U) had fought in alliance with RJD and Congress.However, bootlegging has been thriving in the state since then and opposition leaders claim that while the poor often end up being punished for flouting prohibition, those with resources get liquor delivered to their homes.Last month, more than 40 people had died in West Champaran, Gopalganj, Muzaffarpur and Samastipur districts after consuming spurious liquor.A review meeting was subsequently held by the chief minister where police officials were warned of severe punishment if they were found to be lax in implementing prohibition.This direction led to instances of high-handed behaviour by police personnel who have rounded up professionals coming from outside and consuming liquor unmindful of the law here, and conducted searches at wedding venues, triggering a public outcry. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/empty-liquor-bottles-found-in-bihar-legislature-premises-uproar-ensues-344695

Sathiyasundaram said.He further said that during inquiry, it was revealed that one drug addict from the same locality, Shiv Shankar alias Shiva, also went missing the same day.The police obtained Shiva’s number and the mother of the kidnapped child called him, but the accused told that he is in Pathankot and that he does not know anything about the missing child. Later, he switched off his mobile phone.As the police were monitoring the call, they found the suspect’s location was in Dharavi, Mumbai, and not Pathankot.The police contacted local sources in Dharavi and one social worker agreed to help them in the case. The social worker informed the police that Shiva used to stay in Dharavi four years ago, and that he has come again from Delhi two days back.He also told the police that Shiva was seen with a 10-11-year-old boy in the area.A police team was immediately dispatched to Mumbai where they safely rescued the child from near the Mahim railway station.During interrogation, the accused revealed that he had kidnapped the boy with a motive to sell him in Mumbai so that he could meet his drug requirements. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/delhi/minor-boy-abducted-in-delhi-rescued-from-mumbai-344690

It is likely to emerge into the Andaman Sea during the next 12 hours.“Thereafter, it is likely to move west-northwestwards and concentrate into a depression over southeast and adjoining east-central Bay of Bengal by December 2 and intensify into a cyclonic storm over the central parts of the Bay of Bengal during the subsequent 24 hours,” an IMD statement said.Thereafter, it is likely to move northwestwards, intensify further and reach north Andhra Pradesh–Odisha coasts around December 4 morning.The Met office predicted “heavy to very heavy rainfall and extremely heavy falls” at isolated places over coastal Odisha and “heavy to very heavy” rainfall at isolated places over adjoining interior districts of Odisha, coastal districts of West Bengal and north coastal Andhra Pradesh.“It is likely that the northeastern states also experience enhanced rainfall activity on December 5-6, with isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall owing to the likely northeastward movement of the remnant of the system during the same period,” it said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cyclonic-storm-likely-to-hit-odisha-andhra-coasts-saturday-morning-imd-344685

30-11-2021||Mumbai||NIA custody most 'traumatic time' of my life: Sachin Waze tells probe panel||Dismissed police officer Sachin Waze on Tuesday told an inquiry commission that the time he spent in the National Investigation Agency's (NIA) custody following arrest in the Antilia bomb scare case was the "most traumatic time" of his life, and claimed he had signed various documents "under duress".An explosives-laden SUV was found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's residence 'Antilia' in south Mumbai in February this year. Later, businessman Mansukh Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV, was found dead in a creek at Mumbra in neighbouring Thane district. In March, Waze, who was then serving as the assistant police inspector, was arrested by the NIA for his alleged role in the case and was later dismissed from service. He is currently being crossed-examined by the Justice K U Chandiwal Commission, which is probing corruption allegations levelled against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh by ex-Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh. Responding to a question by Anil Deshmukh's lawyer Anita Castellino on whether there was any kind of pressure or uncomfortable situation when he was in the NIA's custody, Waze said, "Yes, of course". "It was most traumatic time in my life" he said. To another query, Waze said in those 28 days (time spent in the central agency's custody), only the NIA was causing "harrasment and humiliation" to him. "I say the trauma is still there," he added. Waze also claimed that he had signed various documents "under duress of the NIA authorities".  He further said his request for furnishing him a copy of documents and the panchnama were denied by the NIA court. Waze's cross-examination will continue on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, former Maharashtra home Minister Anil Deshmukh appeared before the commission.  The single-member commission of Justice Chandiwal (retired) was formed by the Maharashtra government in March this year to probe the allegations levelled against Deshmukh by Param Bir Singh.  Singh, who was transferred from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in March in the aftermath of the Antilia bomb scare episode, had alleged that Deshmukh asked police officers to collect Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants in the city. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are also probing the allegations made against Deshmukh by the senior IPS officer. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-custody-most-traumatic-time-of-my-life-sachin-waze-tells-probe-panel-344679

30-11-2021||New Delhi||Congress, opposition parties walk out of RS after Naidu rejects demand to revoke suspension of 12 MPs||Members of Congress and other opposition parties on Tuesday staged a walkout from Rajya Sabha after Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu justified the suspension of 12 MPs for the entire winter session of Parliament, saying they haven’t shown any remorse for their act of sacrilege of the House in the previous session in August.“Motion (for suspension of the 12 opposition MPs) was moved, it was approved, action is taken, it is final,” Naidu said as he rejected an appeal by the Leader of the Opposition and senior Congress leader M Mallikarjun Kharge to revoke the suspension.Naidu said he was not considering Kharge’s appeal as the suspended MPs have not shown any remorse, but on the contrary, justified their acts.“You try to mislead the House, you disturb the House, you ransacked the table, you also threw papers on the chair and also some of them have got on to the table and then you are giving me lessons. This is not the way,” he said.“I don’t think the appeal of the Leader of the Opposition is worth considering. I am not considering it at all,” he added.Raising the issue when the House met for the day, Kharge said the motion for suspension moved by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi was in gross violation of the rules and action was taken in the current winter session of Parliament for alleged “unruly” conduct in the last session.Also, the rules require the chair to name the members before a motion of suspension is moved, which did not happen when the 12 MPs were suspended on a government motion on November 29, he said, adding that the chair had on Monday not even allowed him to raise of point of order, which according to the well-settled conventions of Rajya Sabha is always permitted.A member named by the chair has to withdraw from the proceedings of the House.Six of the suspended MPs are from the Congress, two each from Trinamool Congress and Shiv Sena, and one each from CPI and CPM.Naidu also rejected Kharge’s contentions of action being taken on deeds done in the last session, saying the Rajya Sabha is a “continuing institution” and the Chairman of the House is empowered to suspend members for unruly conduct under rules 256, 259, 266, and other residuary powers.He said the chair had on August 10, when the opposition members created a ruckus in the House demanding discussion on certain issues, named the members.“Chairman can take action and also the House can take action. What happened yesterday (November 29) is not chairman taking action, it is the house, after a resolution moved, that has taken action,” he said.Opposition MPs, however, objected to his comment that the House took the action by passing the resolution by voice vote as they felt only the treasury benches had given affirmative response to the motion moved by Joshi.“Not the House, except some opposition parties. I agree,” Naidu remarked.Naidu said the suspended MPs were named by the chair on August 10.“On 10th August, go through the proceedings of the House, the deputy chairman (who was in the chair) made appeals a number of times. Later, in the (Rajya Sabha) bulletin also it was published about the people who have indulged in this act,” he added.Naidu did not address Kharge’s charge of him not being allowed to raise the point of order when the motion of suspension was moved on November 29.Not satisfied with Naidu’s ruling, the opposition parties, including the Congress, AAP, RJD and Left parties protested, raising slogans.Naidu, however, did not allow them and went on to take up listed zero hour. The opposition MPs then staged a walkout from the House.TMC members too staged a walkout a short while later after their leader Derek O’Brien said it’s not the opposition but the 80 MPs of the treasury benches who should be suspended as they blocked certain discussions during the previous monsoon session.Earlier, Kharge said the moving of the motion and its adoption “is a gross violation of rules of procedures regarding the suspension of members provided under rule 256”. “Furthermore, when the Leader of Opposition is seeking to raise a point of order, they have to be allowed to raise the same. I was, however, not allowed to raise my point of order. This itself is a gross violation of well settled time honoured parliamentary conventions,” he said.Kharge said the suspension of any member can happen only when two conditions—him or her being named by the chairman and then a motion being moved—are fulfilled.“This procedure is relevant only on the date of occurrence of the alleged disregard or disorderly conduct of the member. However, yesterday the motion of suspension was moved for the alleged disorderly conduct which took place during the previous session,” he said.“In the present case, none of the 12 members have been named on that particular day. Bringing forward a motion to suspend the members months after the day of occurrence alleged disorderly conduct is not in order. The unprecedented, undemocratic action is a violation of the rules,” he said.He demanded that the suspension of 12 members may be revoked.“I request you, sir... we all members came to your house we requested you to revoke it and it has been dealt selectively. There are some members who have nothing to do with this. This incident happened in the last session how can you take this (action),” he said.He was referring to the leaders of 16 opposition parties meeting Naidu earlier in the day.Later Naidu said there were 33 members who are named for the August 10 incident, out of these 12 members were suspended.“Some people are complaining we should have been given another opportunity. Another opportunity to say what?” he asked. “And after this action, some of the members who have suspended their reaction outside their comments outside under their TV (bytes) also are very much there.”           He said it’s a “really unfortunate situation that as a chairman, I’m not happy to take action on anybody for that matter, comment on anybody, but at the same time, I have a sacred duty to see that the house is run. At the end of the day, people are going to question the chair and the house, not the individuals and I am answerable to that.”    “That’s why time and again I’m appealing,” he said.Referring to the refrain of bills being passed in the din, he said, “you create a din, whoever creates din, and then you don’t participate (in debate)”. Members are called by they don’t speak, he said.“I’m afraid if we continue this trend. If you continue this trend, people will lose their faith in the system which is very harmful to the country and to the system. Yes, protest... you made your point. You walked out. You got every right to walk out. And I also appeal to the house... somebody is walking out. Please don’t make any comments. It is their right to walk out to talk out democratically and walk out and then go to the people create momentum,” he said.Naidu said he is not here to defend the government but to see that the members do not offend the parliament, offend the people. “This has to be understood by one and all.”        “There are instances as I said ... the action was taken for what they have done outside in this house and I remember during the division of the state of Andhra Pradesh, the action was taken a large number of people.... And it is wrong to say it’s anti-democratic. It is to protect democracy action has been taken,” he said. “So there are precedents. Keeping all these things in mind, I hope that everybody will realise and members who walked out they will come to the house again, participate in the discussions and debate and do justice to the mandate given by the people to them.”  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-says-ready-to-review-suspensions-if-mps-apologise-rajya-sabha-adjourned-for-the-day-344670

30-11-2021||---||Opposition walks out of Rajya Sabha after Chairman refuses to revoke suspension||New Delhi, November 30Opposition MPs walked out of the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday after Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu refused to consider Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge’s request to revoke the suspension of 12 opposition MPs for their unruly behaviour on the last day of the previous session.Kharge said the suspension was not carried out in accordance with rules. He said the moving of the motion by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi regarding the suspension of the 12 MPs and its adoption amounted to “gross violation of the rules of procedure on suspension of member provided under Rule 256”.Khage said when Joshi was moving the motion, he wanted to raise a point of order under Rule 258 but was denied permission. This was done in gross violation of well-settled parliamentary conventions. Kharge added that under the rules, before a member was suspended, the chairman must name him. Furthermore, a member could be suspended only on the date of the occurrence of the alleged acts of disregard by the member. The 12 members suspended on Monday were punished for something they did in the last session, he pointed out.“We all went to your house also, sir. I request you, please revoke their suspension,” Kharge said.In response, Naidu said the Rajya Sabha is a “continuing institution” and the Chairman, under Rules 256, 259 and 266 and also under various other provisions, could take action. Moreover, the suspension was not ordered by the Chairman. It was the House which decided to put the members under suspension after a resolution was moved, he said.Naidu added that the suspended members were named on August 10, the day they had indulged in acts of disregard. The Deputy Chairman had appealed to the members a number of times to maintain decorum and he also took the names on many occasions, the Chairman said.“You disrupt the house, you climb on the table, you ransack the House and now you are giving me lessons,” Naidu remarked. “The motion was moved, it was approved,” Naidu said, adding, “it is final”.“The members, who committed the sacrilege in the House, have not expressed remorse. On the other hand, they are justifying themselves. Therefore, I do not think the appeal of the Leader of the Opposition is worth considering. I am not considering it at all,” Naidu said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-walks-out-of-rajya-sabha-after-chairman-refuses-to-revoke-suspension-344666

Proceedings for extradition have attained finality and the respondent no. 3 (Mallya) has exhausted all avenues of appeal in the United Kingdom…The matter (sentencing in contempt case) shall be dealt with finally on January 18, 2022,” a Bench led by Justice UU Lalit said.It appointed senior advocate Jaideep Gupta as an amicus curiae to assist it in the case.Mallya, an accused in a bank loan default case of over Rs 9,000 crore involving his now defunct Kingfisher Airlines, has been in the UK since March 2016. He is on bail on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard in April 2017.The top court had earlier dismissed his plea seeking review of the 2017 verdict which held him guilty of contempt for transferring USD 40 million to his children in violation of court orders. On August 31 last year, the top court had directed Mallya to appear before it on October 5, 2020.The Centre had on January 18 told the Supreme Court that it was making all efforts to extradite fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya from the UK but the process was taking time due to legal issues involved.Listing the matter for disposal on January 18, the top court said if Mallya wanted to take part in the proceedings personally, he would be here through the extradition proceedings and in case he was not, it will hear the submissions of his lawyer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-proposes-to-go-ahead-with-hearing-on-sentence-in-contempt-proceeding-against-vijay-mallya-344656
30-11-2021||New Delhi||Centre advises states to ramp up testing for early detection of cases in view of Omicron scare||Underlining that the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 does not escape RT-PCR and RAT tests, the Centre on Tuesday advised states and UTs to ramp up testing and undertake effective surveillance of international passengers even as it asserted that no case of the new variant has been found as yet in the country.Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan chaired a high-level virtual meeting with states and UTs to review Covid-19 public health response measures and preparedness amid cases of Omicron variant of Covid19 being reported across various countries.Reiterating that the revised guidelines and international travel advisories of the Union Health Ministry have been shared with the states, Bhushan advised states not to let their guard down and keep a strict vigil on the international passengers coming to the country through various airports, ports and land border crossings and stressed on strict monitoring of hotspots, a health ministry statement said.Also, noting the critical role of vaccination as a powerful defence against Covid-19, NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr V K Paul said the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ vaccination campaign has been extended till 31st December with a focus on 100 percent first dose coverage and completing the backlog of second dose vaccination, the statement said.India has so far not reported any case of the new Covid-19 variant Omicron, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya informed Parliament on Tuesday, noting that the government has taken measures to ensure that it does not reach the country.The Centre has issued an advisory after looking at the developments globally and is keeping a close watch at ports, he said, adding genome sequencing of suspected cases is also being done.During the Question Hour in the Rajya Sabha, the minister said, “Omicron variant has been found in 14 countries now. It is being studied here although it has not been reported in India.” At the meeting chaired by Bhushan, the states were specially advised to undertake effective surveillance of international passengers.Testing of samples of international travellers coming from “At Risk” countries on the first day and of specified category of passengers on the eighth day needs to be scrupulously done, Bhushan stressed.He said international passengers from “at-risk” countries are being advised to prepare to wait at the airports till the report of the RT-PCR test is available.States were asked to send all positive samples for genome sequencing to INSACOG Labs (mapped with states) promptly and that states should undertake contact tracing of positive individuals and follow up for 14 days, the statement said.DG, ICMR Dr Balram Bharagava informed that the Omicron variant doesn’t escape RT-PCR and RAT and hence, states and UTs were advised to ramp up testing for prompt and early identification of any cases the statement said.The Union health secretary urged states to strengthen the testing infrastructure while strictly implementing the testing guidelines and ensure ample testing in each district while maintaining the RT-PCR ratio.States and UTs were advised to have continuous monitoring of areas where recent clusters of positive cases have emerged and send all positive samples for genome sequencing to the designated INSACOG Lab in a prompt manner.They were asked to do effective and regular monitoring of home isolation cases, with physical visits to homes of passengers from “at-risk” countries.The status of those who are negative after the test on the eighth day has to also be physically monitored by the state administration, Bhushan said.“States were also asked to ensure the preparedness of health infrastructure (availability of ICU, O2 beds, ventilators, etc.) and to implement  Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness (ECRP-II) with a focus on rural areas and for paediatric cases,” it said.They were asked to work for early implementation of sanctioned pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generating plants, along with ensuring a seamless supply of logistics, drugs, O2 cylinders, etc.States have been asked to co-ordinate with Airport Health Officers (APHOs) and ‘Air Suvidha’ portal for a list of positive travellers, including details of all international travellers, and strengthen support to them for effective surveillance.Effective and timely coordination between State admin, BOI officials, APHOs, Port health officers (PHOs) and Land Border Crossing Officers (LBCOs) was stressed upon.States have been advised for meetings with relevant officials to ensure smooth implementation of the new Guidelines for International Travelers which come into effect from midnight today.Daily monitoring by the State Surveillance Officer has been directed to track and contain the spread of transmission of any VoCs in the country, especially from any recent clusters of positive cases.Regular dissemination of evidence and science-based information on the merging scenario should be shared with the masses through weekly media briefings, it re-emphasised. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-advises-states-to-ramp-up-testing-for-early-detection-of-cases-in-view-of-omicron-scare-344654
30-11-2021||Aditi Tandon||Congress-led Opposition to boycott Rajya Sabha over suspension of 12 MPs; govt defends suspensions||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 30The Congress-led opposition will boycott proceedings of the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday in protest against the suspension of 12 MPs on Monday.Congress chief whip in Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh confirmed the decision saying, “All opposition parties, including TMC and BSP walked out of Rajya Sabha and won’t attend proceedings today to protest against the manner in which 12 MPs were suspended for entire session, and farm bills were passed undemocratically and then repealed undemocratically. Those who raise their voices have been suspended. This is New India.”The decision to boycott was taken at a morning meeting of opposition parties which the TMC did not attend.The 16 party attendees at the meeting were the INC, DMK, Shiv Sena, NCP, CPM, CPI, RJD, IUML, MDMK, LJD, NC, RSP, TRS, Kerala Congress, VCK and AAP.The opposition decided not to apologise for their misconduct on the last day of the monsoon session, August 11, 2020.किस बात की माफ़ी?संसद में जनता की बात उठाने की?बिलकुल नहीं!  The government in a motion on Monday cited MPs’ misconduct to move a motion to suspend them for the remainder of the session.The government also rejected the opposition charges of selective action saying the suspensions pertained to MPs’ misconduct on the last day of the session, and suspensions were done at the first available opportunity which was the first day of the Winter Session on Monday.Starting tomorrow 1 Dec, from 10 am to 6 pm Mon-Fri- the 12 Opposition MPs suspended from Rajya Sabha will sit in dharna in front of Mahatma Gandhi statue #Parliament  Government sources also said the opposition should look within.“We did not propose to suspend people for one year. The NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress government in Maharashtra suspended 12 MLAs for a whole year and in the instant case, the erring MPs were given opportunities to apologise for their conduct or join a committee. They refused to do both. In such a case it becomes the obligation of the government to preserve the dignity of the Chair. Everyone would recall how distressed Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu was on August 11. We need not remind anyone,” government sources said.The motion to suspend the MPs came on Monday in the Rajya Sabha after Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi recorded the misconduct of 12 MPs in a letter to Chairman Naidu.The letter records “unprecedented misconduct by the said MPs” and condemns their actions ranging from—assault on marshals, attempts to pull out LED TV screen installed in the Rajya Sabha chamber, forming of a noose by a woman MP and putting it around the neck of a fellow MP, tearing and flinging of papers.“On August 11, some MPs crossed all limits of parliamentary decorum and decency during the discussions on the General Insurance Business Amendment Bill. The 254th session of Rajya Sabha would indeed be counted as the most reprehensible and shameful session in our parliamentary history. The disgrace caused is irreversible and no amount of condemnation and repentance can undo the damage. The unruly acts, standing on the table, throwing papers at the Chair, preventing parliament staff from performing their duties, coupled with violent behaviour of some MPs, terrifying and injuring staff members have brought disrepute to Indian democracy. The unfathomable circumstances demand exemplary remedy,” Joshi said in his letter to Naidu before the government moved the suspension motion.The suspended MPs are Chhaya Verma, Phulo Devi Nehtam, Ripun Bora, Nasir Hussain, Rajamani Patel and Akhilesh Prasad Singh of the Congress, CPM’s Elamaram Karim, CPI’s Binoy Viswam, TMC’s Dola Sen and Shanta Chhetri, and Shiv Sena’s Priyanka Chaturvedi and Anil Desai.The 16 opposition parties that met on Tuesday morning argued they had not been given a hearing.Government sources, however, said the chances to apologise were many.“Moreover, the opposition even refused to join the committee the government has proposed to look into the issue and suggest code of conduct for the future. They could have presented their part before the panel but you won’t apologise and you won’t join the committee and will say let bygones be bygones. That won’t happen. Limits were crossed on August 11,” a government source said.The opposition leaders protested at Gandhi statue outside Parliament chamber on Tuesday against the suspensions.The 12 suspended MPs will start a sit-in protest outside Parliament at the Gandhi statue from Wednesday. TMC leader Derek O Brien said “Starting tomorrow 1 Dec, from 10 am to 6 pm Monday to Friday the 12 Opposition MPs suspended from Rajya Sabha will sit in dharna in front of Mahatma Gandhi statue Parliament.”Earlier, Congress-led opposition walked out of both Houses of Parliament over the suspension of MPs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-leaders-meet-naidu-seek-suspension-of-12-rajya-sabha-members-be-revoked-344650
30-11-2021||New Delhi||Lok Sabha adjourned till 3 pm amid Opposition protests||For the second straight day, Lok Sabha proceedings were disrupted on Tuesday and the House was adjourned till 2 pm amid Opposition protests over various issues.Later, it was adjourned till 3 pm.Despite repeated pleas of Speaker Om Birla, members of the TRS shouted slogans and displayed placards standing in the Well of the House while other Opposition members, including from Congress and Left parties, sought to raise certain issues from their seats.In signs of deepening rift between the government and the Opposition, members from the Congress, NCP, Left parties and DMK walked out of the House alleging that the government was suppressing the voice of the Opposition. These members protested from their seats and did not come into the Well before walking out of the House.However, Trinamool Congress members neither joined the protests nor walked out.Soon after a new member took oath and the first question of the Question Hour was taken up, members of TRS trooped into the Well demanding a law on Minimum Support Price (MSP) as well as compensation for the families of farmers who lost their lives during the agitation against the farm laws.Appealing to the members to go back to their seats, Birla said they should discuss issues during Question Hour and that their conduct was not sending out the right message.A visibly anguished Birla said that important questions were being answered but the proceedings were being disrupted.It is not right, the Speaker repeatedly asserted but as the din continued, he adjourned the proceedings till 2 pm.Earlier, Shiv Sena's Delkar Kalaben Mohanbhai, representing Dadra and Nagar Haveli constituency, took oath.

Digvijay has been continuously demanding a share of the property, and this has caused much trouble to me. My son does not respect me and often misbehaves with me. There is no reason for me to care about him. I have been asking him to focus on the business that I have developed over the years, but he is instead trying to grab my property. That is why, I have made up my mind to transfer the property to the District Magistrate so that it can be properly utilised by the government after my death. I have enough money to sustain myself," he said.According to sources, Ganesh Shankar Pandey, along with his three younger brothers, had acquired a 1,000 square yard property in 1983.The four brothers built a big house on that plot.

30-11-2021||Mumbai||Omicron scare: 1,000 travellers from African nations landed in Mumbai in last 15 days; 100 tested||At least 1,000 travellers landed in Mumbai in the last fortnight from African countries where the potentially more transmissible 'Omicron' variant of coronavirus has been detected, a senior official of the city civic body said.Swab samples were collected of at least 100 travellers out of the 466 whose list was received so far, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's (BMC) Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani told PTI on Monday.The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Monday warned that the global risk from the Omicron variant is “very high” based on early evidence, saying the mutated coronavirus could lead to surges with “severe consequences”.The UN health agency, in a technical paper issued to member states, said "considerable uncertainties” remain about the variant, that was first detected days ago in southern Africa.Amid these concerns, Kakani said the airport authority has informed that around 1,000 travellers landed in Mumbai from African countries in the last fortnight, but it has handed over a list of only 466 such passengers so far."Out of the 466 travellers, 100 are from Mumbai. We have already collected their swab samples. Their reports are expected soon. It will be clear if they are positive or negative to coronavirus," Kakani said."There won't be an issue if their test report is negative, but the civic body is going to conduct genome sequencing of positive samples, along with the S-gene missing test that is advised by the WHO for faster detection of the infection due to Omicron, without genome sequencing," he said.If the S-gene is missing, in that case, it is presumed that he (traveller) may be infected (with Omicron), the official said, adding that the genome sequencing would confirm the infection.The infected travellers, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, will be shifted to the civic body's institutional quarantine facility at the civic-run Seven Hills Hospital in suburban Andheri, he said.Amid the rising concerns over Omicron, the BMC has kept all its five hospitals and jumbo facilities ready, the official said.Measures are being taken for the structural audit, fire audit, oxygen supply system audit, stocking adequate medicines and appointment of manpower.

The petitioner also raised the issue of police invoking the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) against 102 people, including journalists, for reporting on the communal violence. The northeastern state recently witnessed incidents of arson, looting and violence after reports emerged from Bangladesh that Hindu minorities there had been attacked during “Durga Puja” on allegations of blasphemy.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tripura-violence-sc-notice-to-centre-on-plea-for-sit-probe-344387

The government is ready to answer every question. We want both questions and peace in Parliament,” the PM said, adding that the session was very important as the country was marking the 75th year of Independence with all citizens participating positively.No need for discussion, oppn too for repealBoth the government and Opposition parties are for the repeal of the three farm laws. So there is no need for any discussion. —Narendra Tomar, Agriculture MinisterIn the Rajya Sabha, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, however, said: “Both the government and Opposition parties are for the repeal of the laws. So there is no need for any discussion on the repeal Bill.” The Upper House passed The Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, by a voice vote amid din after the Lok Sabha similarly passed the draft law at 12 noon. The passage came three days after the first anniversary of farmers’ protests that started in Delhi on November 26, 2020. Parliament had enacted the laws last September.Admitting that the government had failed to convince the farmers of the “benefits of the laws”, Tomar said the Congress in its election manifesto had also spoken of farm sector reforms.“The Congress is adopting double standards. The PM showed a large heart by announcing the repeal on Guru Nanak Dev Jayanti,” the minister said in the RS, where Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge accused the Centre of acting out of electoral considerations after the recent bypoll setbacks and in the wake of five state elections early next year.In both Houses, the Opposition insisted on a debate which was not granted on the grounds that repeal Bills were conventionally passed without a discussion.The Congress, however, cited 17 repeal Bills which, it said, were discussed. In the Lok Sabha, TMC, TRS and DMK MPs were in the well when Tomar introduced the Bill at noon. Speaker Om Birla said he would allow a debate if the parliamentarians returned to their seats, but they did not.After the repeal, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi said the government was terrified of discussing farmers’ issues.“We wanted to have a discussion on the MSP, Lakhimpur Kheri violence and on 700 deceased farmers but that was not allowed. The government is terrified. It does not have the guts to stand up for its actions,” Rahul said. He added that the PM had apologised to the nation which meant he accepted that his fault led to the death of 700 farmers.“The government will have to give compensation to the families of 700 deceased farmers,” Rahul said, accusing the Centre of insulting the farmers by stating in the repeal Bill that “only a small group of farmers are protesting.”The House proceedings is expected to be disrupted until a debate is allowed as Opposition parties said they would keep insisting on a discussion on the legal guarantee for MSP.Both Houses were adjourned after the passage of the repeal Bill with no other legislative agenda taken up today.The withdrawal Bill comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assurance of repeal on November 19. Once President Ram Nath Kovind gives his assent to the Bill, the laws will stand annulled.The Statement of Reasons of the Repeal Bill, meanwhile, defended the laws as beneficial to farmers. It noted, “Even though only a small group of farmers are protesting against these laws, the government tried hard to sensitise the farmers on the importance of the laws through several meetings. Without taking away the existing mechanisms available to the farmers, new avenues were provided for trade of their produce….“As we celebrate the 75th year of Independence — Azadi ka Amrut Mahotsav — the need of the hour is to take everyone together on the path of inclusive growth and development. In view of the above the farm laws are proposed to be repealed.”The final stepThe Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, now awaits the assent of President Ram Nath Kovind for the formal withdrawalFrom ordinances to rollback in a yearJune 2020: The Centre issues ordinances on the farm lawsSept 17: The government gets the laws cleared in the Lok SabhaSept 20: Contentious laws get cleared in the Rajya Sabha tooSept 27: President Ram Nath Kovind gives his assent to lawsNov 26: Farm unions begin stir, 11 rounds of talks with govt inconclusiveNov 19, 2021: PM Narendra Modi announces repeal of the laws||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-debate-parliament-passes-bill-to-repeal-farm-laws-will-answer-all-queries-says-pm-modi-344295

The guidelines will come into effect from December 1.Besides, air travellers will have to submit their 14-day travel history and a negative RT-PCR report on the Air Suvidha portal before coming to India.A declaration with respect to the authenticity of the Covid test report will also be required. Fake reports would make the passengers liable for criminal proceedings in India, the government said.Omicron: norms for flyers revised As per the revised rules, all travellers (irrespective of vaccination status) coming to India from “at risk” countries will have to undergo post-arrival Covid test at the airport in addition to a pre-departure test undertaken 72 hours before boarding the plane.The high-risk countries include the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel.“Passengers testing positive (at the airport) will be isolated and treated as per the clinical management protocol. Besides, their samples will be taken for the whole genome sequencing. Those who test negative can leave the airport, but they will have to undergo home isolation for seven days, followed by testing on the eight day of arrival in India. Subsequently, they would have to undergo seven days of self-monitoring,” the guidelines stated.Further, in view of reports of increasing number of countries reporting the Omicron variant, the guidelines also mandate that five per cent of the travellers coming from countries not in the “at risk category” will be tested randomly at the airports.Samples of all individuals testing positive for Covid, either at airports or during random sampling, will also be sent for whole genomic sequencing at identified INSACOG network laboratories to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants (including Omicron).The Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had yesterday said it would review the “effective date” on the resumption of scheduled international flights in view of the global scenario.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pre-departure-post-arrival-testing-must-344318

He also attacked the Congress for adopting "double standard" on the laws, as its own election manifesto talked about the need for reforms in the farm sector.He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi showed a large heart by announcing the repeal of the laws on Guru Nanak Jayanti.He said as both the government and the opposition parties are for repeal of the laws, so there was no need for any discussion on the farm repeal bill.The House passed the bill with voice vote amid protests by the Congress and TMC members. Dola Sen (TMC) and Nadim-ul-Haque (TMC) were in the well to protest against the passage of the bill without a debate.After the passage of the bill, the House was adjourned for half an hour.
