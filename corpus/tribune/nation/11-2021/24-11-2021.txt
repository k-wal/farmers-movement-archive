It is just a process. Now, what we want from the government is to take up our other demands,” Shiv Kumar ‘Kaka’ of the Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh (RKM) told PTI.“Ideally, after they finally decide to repeal the laws they should have had another round of talks with us during which we would have discussed the MSP issue as well. This way the government could have gone ahead with both the bills—repealing of farmer laws and legalising MSP—simultaneously,” he added.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a joint body of farmer unions leading the current protests, on Sunday wrote to the prime minister urging him to immediately resume talks on the farmers’ six demands, including legal guarantee to procurement of crops at MSP.The other demands include sacking and arrest of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, withdrawal of cases against farmers and building of a memorial for those who lost their lives during the agitation.Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait, in his tweet on Wednesday, clarified that the farmers’ movement is far from over and said he will call it farmers’ victory only when they’ll start getting the right prices for their crops.“This protest will not end yet. We have a meeting on November 27 after which we will take further decisions. (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi ji has said farmers’ income would be doubled from January 1, so will ask him how it would be done. Farmers’ victory will be ensured when they get the right price for their crops,” Tikait tweeted in Hindi.Another farmer leader Kavita Kuruganti called the Union Cabinet nod a “logical step” in the whole process of tabling the bill in the Parliament, which she claimed “doesn’t hold any more significance than what they have already stated on November 19”—the day when the prime minister made the announcement of repealing the laws.“The cabinet approval is a logical step. It doesn’t hold any more significance than what we have already stated on November 19. The repeal of these bills is of course a welcoming development but this is only the first victory for the protesting farmers. We will wait for the other demands to be addressed,” said Kuruganti, who is also a member of the SKM.The farmers, in their list of demands, have also sought removal of penal provisions on farmers in the “Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Act 2021” and withdrawal of the draft “Electricity Amendments Bill, 2020/2021” proposed by the government.However, for farmer leader and representative of the Rashtriya Kisan Majdoor Sabha Abhimanyu Kohar the cabinet approval to repeal of the three anti-farmer laws is a “big day” as it makes the government’s stand “official”.“This is a welcome step, and a big day for not only our movement but for democracy as well. Because don’t forget this was a fight for democratic rights as well. Our victory gives stamp of approval to the Gandhian way of non-violent movement where people from every caste, creed, sex and religion participated. That said, our stand is clear and we’ll continue fighting till all our demands are not met,” he said.The three laws to be repealed are: Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act; The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.These laws, passed in September last year, had triggered widespread protests by thousands of farmers mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh at Delhi borders.The protest started at the fag-end of November 2020, and is still continuing.

24-11-2021|| Hyderabad||Andhra seeks Rs 1000 crore interim relief for floods||Andhra Pradesh has sought Rs 1000 crore interim relief from the Union Government to compensate people for the heavy losses due to rains and floods in the state.  After an aeriel survey of the worst affected areas, Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for financial help.  He also asked the Centre to depute a team of experts to evaluate the loss so that a correct assessment of the damage could be made. So far, 40 people have died and over two dozen are still missing, besides massive damage to infrastructure and crops. The chief minister’s letter estimates the losses to be to a tune of Rs 6,000 crore. Jagan has requested an Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) to visit Andhra Pradesh and assess the damage.  Besides breach of irrigation canals in the four flood-affected districts of Chittoor, Nellore, Anantapur and Kadapa, the state has reported damage to many highways and railroads.  According to the initial estimates, about 1.5 lakh hectare of crop and 42,000 hectares of horticulture crop has been thoroughly washed away, causing massive loss to farmers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhra-seeks-rs-1000-crore-interim-relief-for-floods-342348

The respondents are not following the guidelines of reservation as per the constitutional mandate,” Pandey submitted in his petition.The IITs were not following the transparent process of recruiting the faculty members which opens up the window for non-deserving and candidates to enter IITs through connections that increases the chances of corruption, favouritism and discrimination, affecting internal ranking and technological growth of the country, he alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-notice-to-centre-iits-on-petition-seeking-implementation-of-reservation-policy-342347
24-11-2021||New Delhi||India assessing ties with China in areas relating to trade: Foreign Secretary Shringla||India is carefully assessing various options in terms of its trade ties with China to protect the Indian economy from any vulnerability, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Wednesday in comments that came in the backdrop of the border standoff in eastern Ladakh.In an interactive session at an industry chamber, he said that India needs to evaluate its ties with China in terms of supply chains, investment tie-ups and technology in keeping with its larger strategic and security interests.“Trade continues, there are investment ties that continue but all of this has to be examined very carefully and the government is examining all these options very, very carefully to ensure that our integrity and security remain intact,” he said.Shringla said China maintained an aggressive posture and attempted multiple transgressions along the border in eastern Ladakh which was not conducive to peace and security.“And as a result, we are not able to conduct normal relations. Having said that, of course, trade continues, import and export continues, China continues to be an economic partner,” he said.“But obviously we need to today evaluate whether we are over extended in terms of our supply chains, in terms of our investment tie-ups, in terms of the technology that we get,” he said.The virtual interactive session was organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.“We need to examine all of those very carefully to see that it is in keeping with our larger strategic and security interests and that obviously, as we move forward, our own economy grows, our own interactions grow,” Shringla said.He said India needs to ensure that it is not vulnerable in any way.“On the contrary, our growth and development can be faster and better ensured,” he said, adding “This is a process that I think we will have to see how that continues.”Shringla noted that India and China have held several rounds of talks on the border issues and resolved some of them.“We have resolved some of the issues but there are still some outstanding issues and until we can resolve those issues, obviously we will not be in a normal relationship mode,” he said.Referring to the genesis of the bilateral ties, the foreign secretary said the objective of India restarting the relations with China in 1988 was to allow normal business to be conducted without the border issue coming in the way of the relationship.“In other words, we would have trade, commercial ties, scientific and technological ties, people-to-people contacts but we would isolate the border issues that would be discussed separately through the special representatives of both countries,” he said.“But of course, that was predicated on peace and tranquillity being maintained in the border areas,” he added.Describing China as a growing power, Shringla said its rise of itself is a phenomenon that “we have to contend with”.“As it rises economically, militarily, and in a manner that has seen extremely rapid growth in both these areas in all of its dimensions, I think this is an issue the world is grappling with in many ways,” he noted.The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.The tension escalated following a deadly clash in Galwan Valley on June 15 last year.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in the north and south banks of the Pangong lake in February and in the Gogra area in August.

24-11-2021||New Delhi||More than half women, kids anaemic in 14 states, UTs: NFHS-5 phase 2 findings||Anaemia among children and women continues to be a cause of concern, with more than half of them being found anaemic in 14 states and UTs, according to the findings of phase two of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5).The government on Wednesday released the factsheets of key indicators on population, reproductive and child health, family welfare, nutrition and others for India as well as 14 states and UTs, clubbed under phase two, of the 2019-21 NFHS-5 here.The states and UTs which were surveyed in this phase were Arunachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, NCT of Delhi, Odisha, Puducherry, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, a Health Ministry statement said.At the national level, the occurrence of anaemia among women and children was found to be the same as that in 14 states and UTs. The findings for national level were calculated by using data from phase one and phase two of the NHFS-5.The findings of phase one of the NFHS-5 for 22 states and UTs were released in December 2020.According to the findings, child nutrition indicators showed a slight improvement at all-India level as stunting declined from 38 per cent to 36 per cent, wasting from 21 per cent to 19 per cent and underweight from 36 per cent to 32 per cent.In all phase two states and UTs, the situation improved in respect of child nutrition but the change was not significant as drastic changes in respect of these indicators are unlikely in a short span, the statement said.“Anaemia among children and women continues to be a cause of concern. More than half of the children and women (including pregnant women) are anaemic in all the phase two states and UTs and all-India level compared to NFHS-4, in spite of substantial increase in the composition of iron folic acid (IFA) tablets by pregnant women for 180 days or more,” it said.Exclusive breastfeeding to children under six months of age has shown an improvement in all-India level from 55 per cent in 2015-16 to 64 per cent in 2019-21. All the phase two states and UTs are also showing a considerable progress, it said.There is an increase from 51 per cent to 58 per cent of women receiving the recommended four or more ANC visits by health providers at all-India level, the findings stated.Also, all the phase two states and UTs have shown improvement, except Punjab, between 2015-16 to 2019-20.Institutional births have increased substantially from 79 per cent to 89 per cent at all-India level. Institutional delivery is 100 per cent in Puducherry and Tamil Nadu and more than 90 per cent in seven states and UTs out of 12 phase two states and UTs, the statement said.Along with an increase in institutional births, there has also been a substantial increase in C-section deliveries in many states and UTs, especially in private health facilities, it said.According to the findings, unmet needs of family planning have witnessed a significant decline from 13 per cent to 9 per cent at all-India level and in most of the phase two states and UTs.The unmet need for spacing, which remained a major issue in India in the past, has come down to less than 10 per cent in all the states, except Jharkhand (12 pc), Arunachal Pradesh (13 pc) and Uttar Pradesh (13 pc).Full immunisation drive among children aged 12-23 months has recorded substantial improvement from 62 per cent to 76 per cent at all-India level.Also, 11 out of 14 states and UTs have more than three-fourth of children aged 12-23 months with full immunisation and it is the highest for Odisha at 90 per cent, the statement said.On comparing NFHS-4 and NFHS-5 data, the increase in full immunisation coverage is observed to be expeditious in many states and UTs. More than 50 per cent of phase two states and UTs are sharing over 10 percentage points during the short span of four years. This can be attributed to the flagship initiative of Mission Indradhanush launched by the government in 2015.The Total Fertility Rate (TFR), the average number of children per women, has further declined from 2.2 to 2.0 at the national level and in all 14 states and UTs. All phase two states have achieved replacement level of fertility (2.1), except Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh, it said.Overall Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) has increased substantially from 54 per cent to 67 per cent at all-India level and in almost all phase two states and UTs, with the exception of Punjab. Use of modern methods of contraceptives has also increased in almost all states and UTs, according to the statement.Women’s empowerment indicators portray considerable improvement at all-India level and across all 14 states and UTs. Significant progress has been recorded between NFHS-4 and NFHS-5 with respect to women operating bank accounts from 53 per cent to 79 per cent at all-India level, it said.For instance, in the case of Madhya Pradesh, the increase was from 37 per cent to 75 per cent. More than 70 per cent of women in every state and UT in the second phase have operational bank accounts.The main objective of successive rounds of the NFHS is to provide reliable and comparable data relating to health and family welfare and other emerging issues, the ministry said in the statement.The NFHS-5 survey work has been conducted in around 6.1 lakh sample households from 707 districts (as on March, 2017) of the country.

The judge said there were some restrictions due the coronavirus pandemic and cleaning is done better now.The court then asked her to remain present whenever required, to which Thakur agreed.Seven persons, including Thakur and Army officer Lt Col Prasad Purohit, are facing trial in the case.Over 200 witnesses have been examined and eight of them have turned hostile during the trial so far.No witnesses were examined on Wednesday. The next date of hearing is December 1.Six people were killed and over 100 injured when an explosive device strapped to a motorcycle went off near a mosque in Malegaon, a communally sensitive town in north Maharashtra, on September 29, 2008.According to Maharashtra police who conducted initial probe, the motorbike was registered in Thakur’s name which led to her arrest.The case was later handed over to the National Investigation Agency.The Bombay High Court granted bail to Thakur in 2017. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-mp-pragya-thakur-appears-before-court-in-2008-malegaon-blast-case-342325

In many parts of Andhra, either the entire crop is lost or more than 80 percent of the cultivated crop is damaged.As a result, the tomato crop has been damaged causing tight supply situation. Ideal wedding gift?

Look at the signal we are sending to the world. You can stop these activities in anticipation itself so the severe grade does not even become…Suddenly when pollution comes you start sprinkling water, it will not help. If you have a statistical model then there will be a graded response. It has to be science-based,” it said.The top court had on November 17 refrained from passing any harsh directives on worsening air pollution in Delhi-NCR and deferred the hearing to November 24 after the Centre said the condition would improve after November 21.However, it had asked the authorities not to lower the guard. It asked the Centre and NCR states to implement in letter and spirit the decisions taken in the emergency meeting held by the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas.On Wednesday, the Bench said the government should prepare a scientific model based on previous years' data to determine average air pollution levels in different seasons during the year. This model can be used to take appropriate measures in advance to prevent air quality from getting worse, it noted.However, the top court made it clear that it intended to pass orders on measures to be implemented by the Centre, Delhi and NCR states to improve the air quality and bring it to a satisfactory level.It said that in the meantime, if the pollution situation improved and AQI became 100, some of the bans could be lifted and interior works such as electricity, etc, allowed to go on.Noting that crores of rupees collected as cess for welfare of construction workers was lying with states, the Bench asked the governments of Delhi and NCR states to consider paying subsistence allowances to construction workers for loss of work on the days when construction work was banned on account of severe air pollution.The Bench again pulled up the bureaucracy for its “lackadaisical attitude” in dealing with the issue of air pollution and stubble-burning. “We are using common sense to discuss the issues. What is the central and state bureaucracy doing? Why can't they go to the fields, talk to farmers and scientists and devise a permanent solution to prevent stubble-burning?” it said.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Bench that on November 16 AQI was 403 and now it had improved to 260.Mehta said dust management directions were being followed and 250 anti-smog guns had been installed, 23 mechanised road sweeping machines and 1007 water sprinklers were also in place. He said 57 construction sites had been closed.“What is done now is ad hoc. The commission under the act has to conduct a scientific study, so seven days’ data can be there. There has to be a model to see that if measures are taken with wind patterns then there will be a reduction in pollution,” the Bench emphasised.On behalf of petitioner Aditya Dubey, senior counsel Vikas Singh alleged that farmers were not being fined for stubble burning in Punjab in view of the ensuing Assembly elections.“We are not concerned. We are concerned only with pollution, the Bench said, adding, “We can’t micromanage such things.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-defers-hearing-on-delhi-air-pollution-to-nov-29-says-immediate-preventive-measures-needed-342272

He had tweeted, “Why was Bengal CM Mamata prevented by Home Ministry from attending an international conference in Rome? Which law prevented her going?”Swamy demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi intervene in the matter. “In the Constitution, freedom to travel is a fundamental right subject to reasonable restrictions. What was the reasonable restriction told to her? Modi should intervene & permit her,” Swamy had tweeted.Incidentally, Swamy and his wife met West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar at Raj Bhavan, Kolkata, on Tuesday. Following the meeting, Dhankhar tweeted, describing Swamy as a “well-wisher for over three decades” and noted his “enormously benefiting out of his reflections on a host of issues”.Mamata, following the TMC’s third consecutive victory in the Assembly elections in West Bengal held early this year, is set upon making the TMC a national-level player by 2024 when the next general election is slated.On Tuesday, cricketer-turned-politician Kirti Azad, former Congress leader Ashok Tanwar and former JD (U) MP Pavan K Varma joined the TMC in Delhi in the presence of Mamata.The official reason for Mamata’s Delhi trip is to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and raise various state-related issues with him. Her meeting with the PM is slated to take place at 5 pm on Wednesday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/political-circles-abuzz-as-bjp-mp-subramanian-swamy-to-meet-mamata-banerjee-today-342258

However, assistant police inspector Ramesh Chintankidi, who was on duty there at the time, noticed that the leader's car did not have a number plate on its front side," he said.Chintankidi then asked Owaisi's driver to pay fine as the vehicle was without a number plate, he said.Following this, a few supporters of the AIMIM chief gathered outside the guest house, but soon senior police officials also reached the spot.Traffic police inspector Chandrakant Wable then collected Rs 200 fine from the driver, he said."Solapur Police Commissioner Harish Baijal then honoured API Chintankidi by giving a cash reward of Rs 5,000 for his action," the official said.

24-11-2021||Washington||US has not made determination yet on potential CAATSA waiver to India on S400 purchase from Russia: Official||The US has not made a determination yet on any potential CAATSA waiver to India for its purchase of the S-400 missile defence system from Russia, the Biden administration has said, pointing out that the law does not have a country-specific waiver provision attached to it and bilateral conversations regarding the subject will continue.The State Department's comments come a week after India started receiving the supplies of the Triumf S-400 missile defence system from Russia and amidst calls from top Republican and Democratic lawmakers not to impose Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) sanctions on India.The CAATSA, enacted by the US Congress in 2017, provides for punitive actions against any country engaged in transactions with Russian defence and intelligence sectors.Asserting that the US values its “strategic partnership” with India, State Department Spokesperson Ned Price maintained the Biden Administration's suspense over the issue by telling reporters that the CAATSA does not have a blanket or country-specific waiver provision attached to it.“We would need to refer you to the Indian government for any comments on potential deliveries of the S-400 system. But we have been clear when it comes to the system, not only in the Indian context but more broadly as well, that we've urged all of our allies, all of our partners to forego transactions with Russia that may risk triggering sanctions under so-called CAATSA, the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act. We have not made a determination on a potential waiver with respect to Indian arms transactions with Russia,” Price said on Tuesday.“CAATSA, however, does not have a blanket or country-specific waiver provision attached to it. We also know that our defence relationship with India has expanded and deepened significantly in recent years. It's deep and commensurate with the broad and deep relationship that we have with India and its status as a major defence partner,” he said.“We expect this strong momentum in our defence relationship to continue. We certainly value our strategic partnership with India. As you know, we had an opportunity to travel to India not all that long ago. In August, I believe it was, we've met with Foreign Minister Jaishankar many times. We have discussed this concern directly, including with the highest levels in the Indian government,” Price said in response to a question.CAATSA is a tough US law which authorises the administration to impose sanctions on countries that purchase major defence hardware from Russia in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections.In October 2018, India had signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy five units of the S-400 air defence missile systems, despite a warning from the then Trump administration that going ahead with the contract may invite US sanctions.

24-11-2021||New Delhi||Covaxin shows 50 per cent effectiveness against symptomatic Covid in real-world assessment: Lancet study||Two doses of Covaxin are 50 per cent effective against symptomatic Covid, according to the first real-world assessment of India's indigenous coronavirus vaccine published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases journal.The results of an interim study recently published in The Lancet showed that two doses of Covaxin, also known as BBV152, had 77.8 per cent efficacy against symptomatic disease and present no serious safety concerns.The latest study assessed 2,714 hospital workers at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi, from April 15–May 15, who were symptomatic and underwent RT-PCR test for Covid detection.Researchers noted that the Delta variant was the dominant strain in India during the study period, accounting for approximately 80 per cent of all confirmed Covid cases.Covaxin, developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the National Institute of Virology, Indian Council of Medical Research (NIV-ICMR), Pune, is an inactivated whole virus vaccine administered in a two-dose regimen, 28 days apart.In January this year, Covaxin was approved for emergency use in India for people aged 18 and above. The World Health Organisation (WHO) added the vaccine to its list of approved emergency use Covid vaccines earlier this month.The latest study was conducted during India's second Covid surge and in healthcare workers who were primarily offered Covaxin."Our study offers a more complete picture of how BBV152 (Covaxin) performs in the field and should be considered in the context of Covid surge conditions in India, combined with the possible immune evasive potential of the Delta variant," said Manish Soneja, Additional Professor of Medicine at AIIMS, New Delhi."Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that rapid vaccine rollout programmes remain the most promising path to pandemic control while public health policies must continue to include additional protective measures, such as mask-wearing and social distancing," Soneja said in a statement.The Covid vaccination centre at AIIMS, New Delhi, exclusively offered Covaxin beginning January 16 this year to all of its 23,000 employees.Researchers evaluated the effectiveness of the vaccine against symptomatic RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.Of the 2,714 employees in the study population, 1,617 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid, and 1,097 tested negative.Positive cases were matched to negative RT-PCR tests (controls).The odds of vaccination with Covaxin were compared between cases and controls and adjusted for occupational exposure to Covid, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and infection dates.The study found that the vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic Covid after two doses of Covaxin with the second dose administered 14 or more days before undergoing RT-PCR testing was 50 per cent.The effectiveness of two vaccine doses remained stable over the seven-week follow-up period, the researchers said.The adjusted vaccine effectiveness of the first dose, estimated after seven and 21 days, was low, which is consistent with the performance of other preventives against the Delta variant, they said.

It is our considered view that short of postponing of elections, the apprehensions which have been expressed on behalf of the petitioners by the counsels can be suitably addressed by issuing peremptory directions to the state of Tripura, so as to ensure that the municipal elections take place in peaceful and orderly manner,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said.Acting on the TMC’s plea seeking contempt action against the Tripura Government and other officials for failing to curtail violent incidents against opposition parties in the run-up to the upcoming municipal polls, it ordered reassessment of deployment of paramilitary forces in critical areas and warned of coercive action if its orders were not followed scrupulously. “The DGP and the IGP (law and order) shall hold a joint meeting with the State Election Commission by tomorrow morning for the purpose of assessing the availability of sufficient strength of paramilitary forces drawn from the CRPF for ensuring peaceful conduct of the elections,” it said.Seeks details of FIRs on violenceThe SC sought details of the FIRs registered in view of violent incidents during campaigning and the arrests made in those cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/take-steps-to-ensure-fair-civic-polls-sc-to-tripura-342105

For a state that has no compunction in brutally slaughtering innocent people, restraint is not a sign of strength, but it is perceived as a symbol of weakness. It is therefore my considered opinion that India should have auctioned a kinetic response,” Tewari writes in book “10 Flashpoints: 20 years”.The BJP lashed out at the Congress with IT head Amit Malviya saying the Congress’ muddled thinking made India weak.

24-11-2021||---||India to release 5 mn barrels of oil from reserves to cool prices||New Delhi, November 23India will release five million barrels of its strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) in conjunction with other major economies led by the US to cool international oil prices.India currently has a capacity to store 38 million barrels of crude at three underground locations in Mangalore, Visakhapatnam and Padur (Udupi). The first release may happen in a matter of days with dates being worked out with other countries.The impact of the coordinated announcement from world capitals was immediate. Brent crude fell to $78 from $86.4 per barrel, but recovered slightly on reports that “OPEC +” could cut down production.China, Japan, South Korea and the UK also announced releases or were preparing to do so. But they were comfortably topped by the US, which will release 50 million barrels of oil from its SPR of which 32 million is a new announcement and 18 million barrels were authorised by the US Congress after oil prices had hit a 32-month high.The US had opened diplomatic negotiations after OPEC+ (including Russia) added just 4 lakh barrels per day, which was seen as inadequate. They then rebuffed US President Joe Biden’s call at the G-20 summit late last month to add more crude to the market to further cool prices.Coupled with high inflation, high pump prices were affecting the Democrat’s electoral prospects in the next round of Parliamentary elections next year. In India, after the BJP’s poor showing in bypolls, the Centre immediately reduced taxes on petrol and diesel with the states quickly following suit.India first sold its SPR to its own refiners in August when international prices were high, following the path taken recently by China.Accusing the major oil producing countries of cartelisation, an official statement said, “India strongly believes that the pricing of liquid hydrocarbons should be reasonable, responsible and be determined by market forces.”The stocks will be sold to Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, which are connected to the SPRs by pipelines.Move in tandem with other major economies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-release-5-mn-barrels-of-oil-from-reserves-to-cool-prices-342102

It is very unlikely that we will see a third wave,” Guleria said on a day when India logged 7,579, the lowest daily new infections in 543 days, and the active cases the lowest in 536 days.Asked if a booster dose was necessary, the AIIMS director said no.“Covid vaccines are holding out – we are not seeing breakthrough infections, we have a high seropositivity rate and antibody presence. As of now, we really do not need a booster dose. We are quite well-protected and should focus on getting more and more people covered with the first and second doses. That is the way to get maximum protection against the disease,” Guleria said.The AIIMS chief was speaking at the launch of “Going Viral”, written by ICMR director general Balram Bhargava.

We have identified 3,033 coaches or 190 trains for these theme-based trains. After passenger and goods segments, we will start the tourism segment to run Bharat Gaurav trains. These trains will showcase India’s culture and heritage. We have invited applications for them from today.“As of now, ICF coaches have been earmarked for the Bharat Gaurav scheme. But in the future even Vande Bharat, Vista Dome and LHB coaches can be included based on demand,” he said.He said that anyone, from individuals to societies, trusts, consortia, tour operators and even state governments can apply to take these trains and run them on special tourism circuits based on a theme.The minister said that state governments like Odisha, Rajasthan, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu have shown interest in these trains.He further added that the core strength of the professionals of tourism sector would be leveraged to develop and identify tourist circuits and run theme-based trains to tap the vast tourism potential of India.The idea, the minister said, originated from Prime Minister Narendra Modi who suggested theme-based trains so that people in the country can understand, appreciate and take forward India’s heritage.The highlight of these trains will be that the service provider will offer all-inclusive package to tourists, including rail travel, hotel accommodation, sightseeing arrangement, visiting historical or heritage sites, tour guides, the railways said, adding that they will also have full flexibility to decide package cost based on the level of services being offered.However, the minister stated that the railways will ensure that there is no abnormality in the prices.“Stakeholders will modify and run the train and the railways will help in maintenance, parking, and other facilities,” the minister said.He said that the service provider will also have a choice of coaches suiting the clientele, and different segments like luxury and budget can be availed, officials said. They are also free to design and furnish the interiors of the coaches based on their theme.Branding and advertisement are permitted both inside and outside of the trains, and the train composition will be of 14 to 20 coaches, including guard vans.According to a press statement issued by the national transporter, the process of applying for these trains will be through a one-step transparent online registration process with a fee of Rs 1 lakh.The allotment of coaches to all eligible applicants will be subject to availability and priority will be based on the rake security deposit time and date.The security deposit will be Rs 1 crore per rake and the right to use would be between 2 and 10 years.Customer support units will be made functional in the field for hand-holding the service provider and for smooth implementation of this scheme. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/make-way-for-theme-based-trains-under-bharat-gaurav-service-341965

It also seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India, however, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses”.Currently, there is no regulation or any ban on the use of cryptocurrencies in the country. Against this backdrop, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, earlier this month, held a meeting on cryptocurrencies with senior officials, and indications are that strong regulatory steps could be taken to deal with the issue.Recently, there have been a rising number of advertisements, featuring even film stars, promising easy and high returns on investments in cryptocurrencies in recent times, amid concerns over such currencies being allegedly used for luring investors with misleading claims.Last week, the Standing Committee on Finance, chaired by BJP member Jayant Sinha, met the representatives of crypto exchanges, blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC), among others, and arrived at a conclusion that cryptocurrencies should not be banned, but it should be regulated.The Reserve Bank of India has repeatedly reiterated its strong views against cryptocurrencies, saying they pose serious threats to the macroeconomic and financial stability of the country and also doubted the number of investors trading on them and their claimed market value.RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das too had earlier this month had reiterated his views against allowing cryptocurrencies, saying they are a serious threat to any financial system since they are unregulated by central banks.The RBI had announced its intent to come out with an official digital currency in the face of the proliferation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, about which the central bank has had many concerns.Private digital currencies/virtual currencies/ cryptocurrencies have gained popularity in the past decade or so. Here, regulators and governments have been sceptical about these currencies and are apprehensive about the associated risks.It can be noted that on March 4, 2021, the Supreme Court had set aside an RBI circular of April 6, 2018, prohibiting banks and entities regulated by it from providing services in relation to virtual currencies.

24-11-2021||Satya Prakash||Brace up for pro-reform farmers’ agitation||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 23Four days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the repeal of the three contentious farm laws in the ensuing Winter Session of Parliament, Shetkari Sangathan leader Anil Ghanwat on Tuesday said he will organise a rally of one lakh farmers in the national capital to demand agricultural reforms.“Within a few months, we will bring at least one lakh farmers to Delhi to support the reforms and organise an event for a day or a week to make our voices heard,” Ghanwat told reporters.“We didn’t want to create a farmer-versus-farmer scenario in Delhi. However, now we have no option but to protest and make our voice heard,” he said, adding he will travel across India to inform farmers about benefits of farm reforms.Maintaining that the repeal has set a precedent for future governments not to bring the much-needed reforms in the agriculture sector, Ghanwat said, “We will prove that there is support for reforms.”Ghanwat – who is a member of the Supreme Court-appointed committee that examined the three farm laws – said show of support for the farm laws was important to make farmers aware about the laws’ benefits.He said he has written to Chief Justice of India NV Ramana again, requesting him to consider releasing the committee’s report at the earliest, or authorise the panel to make it public.The three-member panel had submitted its report to the top court in a sealed cover on March 19 on measures to end the deadlock.The other two panel members are Pramod Kumar Joshi (Director South Asia international Food Policy), and agriculture-economist and former Chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) Ashok Gulati. The fourth member of the panel Bhartiya Kisan Union President Bhupinder Singh Mann had recused himself.Had the report been released well in time, it would have pre-empted the repeal of the laws as a timely discussion on the recommendations of the committee would have dispelled the misgivings that fueled the protest, said Ghanwat who met Gulati on Monday.He wrote that the report “can also play an educational role and ease the misapprehensions of many farmers who have, in my opinion, been misguided by some leaders who do not seem to appreciate how a minimally regulated free market can allocate national resources to their most productive use”.Ghanwat sought “to bring to the notice of the court that, for many decades, India’s farmers, as entrepreneurs in their own right, have suffered from regulation that chokes their production and marketing efforts. Many of India’s farmers are desperate for renewed, not less, focus on reforms particularly market freedom and technology freedom...These laws were accepted in principle by our farmers’ movement, but were not accepted entirely by the farmers because the policy process of the Indian government is not consultative”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/brace-up-for-pro-reform-farmers-agitation-341951

The SDG Urban Index and dashboard, a product of innovative partnership between Niti Aayog and GIZ, will go a long way in instituting a robust SDG monitoring system in our cities, and is a milestone step in our SDG localisation journey.”The statement said the index highlights the strengths and gaps of ULB-level data, monitoring, and reporting systems.“The index and dashboard will further strengthen SDG localisation and institute robust SDG monitoring at the city level,” it said.Top 10 Urban areas in SDG Urban Index and Dashboard 2021-22 are Shimla, Coimbatore, Chandigarh, Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi, Panaji, Pune, Tiruchirapalli, Ahmedabad and Nagpur.While, bottom 10 Urban Areas in SDG Urban Index and Dashboard 2021-22 are Dhanbad, Meerut, Itanagar, Guwahati, Patna, Jodhpur, Kohima, Agra, Kolakata and Faridabad.Out of 56 urban areas ranked in the index, 44 are with population of above one million, 12 are state capitals with a population of less than a million.While for some indicators, ‘urban area’ implies urban local bodies (ULBs), in other cases, it refers to all urban areas within a district collectively.The data on these indicators have been sourced from official data sources such as NFHS, NCRB, U-DISE, data portals of various ministries, and other government data sources.According to the government think tank, for each SDG, the urban areas are ranked on a scale of 0-100.A score of 100 implies that the urban area has achieved the targets set for 2030; a score of 0 implies that it is the farthest from achieving the targets among the selected urban areas.The areas with ranking between 0 and 49 have been ranked as aspirants, those with 50-64 are termed as performers, 65-99 are called front-runners and the ones with perfect score are called achievers. However, not a single area has a perfect score.Launching the index and dashboard, Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar said that cities are fast becoming engines of growth.

There comes a time when actions must speak louder than words. 26/11 was one such time when it just should’ve been done. It is therefore my considered opinion that India should have auctioned a kinetic response in the days following India’s 9/11,” Tewari writes in the book “10 Flashpoints: 20 Years”.The BJP was quick to lash at the Congress, with the party’s IT head Amit Malviya saying that Congress Party’s muddled thinking made India weak.“After Salman Khurshid, another Congress leader throws UPA under the bus to sell his book. Manish Tewari in his new book slams the UPA for weakness in the name of restrain post 26/11. Air Chief Marshal Fali Major is already on record saying IAF was ready to strike but UPA froze,” Malviya said.The BJP leader added that just yesterday another former UPA Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar questioned defence spending.“Today Manish Tewari rues UPA’s weak response to 26/11. P Chidambaram as Home Minister wanted to launch offensive against Naxals, Digvijay Singh opposed. This muddled thinking on national security made India a weak state under the Congress,” Malviya said.The Congress for its part evaded queries on Tewari’s book. Party spokesperson Pawan Khera said he would respond after reading the book.“I haven’t read the book and can’t do a post-mortem without reading it,” said Khera. He added that more important than the book and its contents is how strongly people are enduring their daily challenges caused by rising prices of essential commodities.“We will not deflect from key issues concerning people. It is our duty to raise the concerns of people. We won’t deflect no matter how much the BJP wants us to deflect,” said Khera.He added that every leader had a right to say what they wanted to say.“Of course, national security is a major issue. China is aggressive against India from all quarters. They are building villages inside the Indian territory. Indian security is a major issue. Foreign policy has faltered. Our old friends are no more our friends. India has no intervention in Afghanistan. It’s not a small thing,” said the Congress, adding that individual comments did not amount to anti-party comments.I thank all my Self appointed Publicists especially @BJP4India for giving one para of my yet to be released book kind of saturation space,albeit un - contextualised.I wonder how these headless chickens will catch their own tails when the book is released & shoe is on other foot🤪||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/manish-tewari-questions-weak-indian-response-post-26-11-in-new-book-bjp-slams-congress-341882

The first release may happen in a matter of days with dates being worked out with other countries.The impact of the coordinated announcement from world capitals was immediate. Brent crude fell to $78 from $86.4 per barrel, but recovered slightly on reports that “OPEC +” could cut down production.China, Japan, South Korea and the UK also announced releases or were preparing to do so. But they were comfortably topped by the US, which will release 50 million barrels of oil from its SPR of which 32 million is a new announcement and 18 million barrels were authorised by the US Congress after oil prices had hit a 32-month high.The US had opened diplomatic negotiations after OPEC+ (including Russia) added just 4 lakh barrels per day, which was seen as inadequate. They then rebuffed US President Joe Biden’s call at the G-20 summit late last month to add more crude to the market to further cool prices.Coupled with high inflation, high pump prices were affecting the Democrat’s electoral prospects in the next round of Parliamentary elections next year. In India, after the BJP’s poor showing in bypolls, the Centre immediately reduced taxes on petrol and diesel with the states quickly following suit.India first sold its SPR to its own refiners in August when international prices were high, following the path taken recently by China.Accusing the major oil producing countries of cartelisation, an official statement said, “India strongly believes that the pricing of liquid hydrocarbons should be reasonable, responsible and be determined by market forces.”The stocks will be sold to Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, which are connected to the SPRs by pipelines.Move in tandem with other major economies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-release-5-mn-barrels-of-oil-from-reserves-to-cool-prices-342102

We have identified 3,033 coaches or 190 trains for these theme-based trains. After passenger and goods segments, we will start the tourism segment to run Bharat Gaurav trains. These trains will showcase India’s culture and heritage. We have invited applications for them from today.“As of now, ICF coaches have been earmarked for the Bharat Gaurav scheme. But in the future even Vande Bharat, Vista Dome and LHB coaches can be included based on demand,” he said.He said that anyone, from individuals to societies, trusts, consortia, tour operators and even state governments can apply to take these trains and run them on special tourism circuits based on a theme.The minister said that state governments like Odisha, Rajasthan, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu have shown interest in these trains.He further added that the core strength of the professionals of tourism sector would be leveraged to develop and identify tourist circuits and run theme-based trains to tap the vast tourism potential of India.The idea, the minister said, originated from Prime Minister Narendra Modi who suggested theme-based trains so that people in the country can understand, appreciate and take forward India’s heritage.The highlight of these trains will be that the service provider will offer all-inclusive package to tourists, including rail travel, hotel accommodation, sightseeing arrangement, visiting historical or heritage sites, tour guides, the railways said, adding that they will also have full flexibility to decide package cost based on the level of services being offered.However, the minister stated that the railways will ensure that there is no abnormality in the prices.“Stakeholders will modify and run the train and the railways will help in maintenance, parking, and other facilities,” the minister said.He said that the service provider will also have a choice of coaches suiting the clientele, and different segments like luxury and budget can be availed, officials said. They are also free to design and furnish the interiors of the coaches based on their theme.Branding and advertisement are permitted both inside and outside of the trains, and the train composition will be of 14 to 20 coaches, including guard vans.According to a press statement issued by the national transporter, the process of applying for these trains will be through a one-step transparent online registration process with a fee of Rs 1 lakh.The allotment of coaches to all eligible applicants will be subject to availability and priority will be based on the rake security deposit time and date.The security deposit will be Rs 1 crore per rake and the right to use would be between 2 and 10 years.Customer support units will be made functional in the field for hand-holding the service provider and for smooth implementation of this scheme. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/make-way-for-theme-based-trains-under-bharat-gaurav-service-341965

24-11-2021||New Delhi||Govt to bring Bill in winter session to bar all but a few pvt cryptocurrencies, regulate RBI’s digital currency||The government is likely to bring a bill in the ensuing winter session of Parliament to bar all but a few private cryptocurrencies and create a framework to regulate digital currency issued by the RBI.The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, is listed for introduction in the Lok Sabha in the winter session, scheduled to begin from November 29.The bill seeks to “create a facilitative framework for the creation of the official digital currency to be issued by the Reserve Bank of India. It also seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India, however, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses”.Currently, there is no regulation or any ban on the use of cryptocurrencies in the country. Against this backdrop, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, earlier this month, held a meeting on cryptocurrencies with senior officials, and indications are that strong regulatory steps could be taken to deal with the issue.Recently, there have been a rising number of advertisements, featuring even film stars, promising easy and high returns on investments in cryptocurrencies in recent times, amid concerns over such currencies being allegedly used for luring investors with misleading claims.Last week, the Standing Committee on Finance, chaired by BJP member Jayant Sinha, met the representatives of crypto exchanges, blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC), among others, and arrived at a conclusion that cryptocurrencies should not be banned, but it should be regulated.The Reserve Bank of India has repeatedly reiterated its strong views against cryptocurrencies, saying they pose serious threats to the macroeconomic and financial stability of the country and also doubted the number of investors trading on them and their claimed market value.RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das too had earlier this month had reiterated his views against allowing cryptocurrencies, saying they are a serious threat to any financial system since they are unregulated by central banks.The RBI had announced its intent to come out with an official digital currency in the face of the proliferation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, about which the central bank has had many concerns.Private digital currencies/virtual currencies/ cryptocurrencies have gained popularity in the past decade or so. Here, regulators and governments have been sceptical about these currencies and are apprehensive about the associated risks.It can be noted that on March 4, 2021, the Supreme Court had set aside an RBI circular of April 6, 2018, prohibiting banks and entities regulated by it from providing services in relation to virtual currencies.

24-11-2021||Satya Prakash||Brace up for pro-reform farmers’ agitation||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 23Four days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the repeal of the three contentious farm laws in the ensuing Winter Session of Parliament, Shetkari Sangathan leader Anil Ghanwat on Tuesday said he will organise a rally of one lakh farmers in the national capital to demand agricultural reforms.“Within a few months, we will bring at least one lakh farmers to Delhi to support the reforms and organise an event for a day or a week to make our voices heard,” Ghanwat told reporters.“We didn’t want to create a farmer-versus-farmer scenario in Delhi. However, now we have no option but to protest and make our voice heard,” he said, adding he will travel across India to inform farmers about benefits of farm reforms.Maintaining that the repeal has set a precedent for future governments not to bring the much-needed reforms in the agriculture sector, Ghanwat said, “We will prove that there is support for reforms.”Ghanwat – who is a member of the Supreme Court-appointed committee that examined the three farm laws – said show of support for the farm laws was important to make farmers aware about the laws’ benefits.He said he has written to Chief Justice of India NV Ramana again, requesting him to consider releasing the committee’s report at the earliest, or authorise the panel to make it public.The three-member panel had submitted its report to the top court in a sealed cover on March 19 on measures to end the deadlock.The other two panel members are Pramod Kumar Joshi (Director South Asia international Food Policy), and agriculture-economist and former Chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) Ashok Gulati. The fourth member of the panel Bhartiya Kisan Union President Bhupinder Singh Mann had recused himself.Had the report been released well in time, it would have pre-empted the repeal of the laws as a timely discussion on the recommendations of the committee would have dispelled the misgivings that fueled the protest, said Ghanwat who met Gulati on Monday.He wrote that the report “can also play an educational role and ease the misapprehensions of many farmers who have, in my opinion, been misguided by some leaders who do not seem to appreciate how a minimally regulated free market can allocate national resources to their most productive use”.Ghanwat sought “to bring to the notice of the court that, for many decades, India’s farmers, as entrepreneurs in their own right, have suffered from regulation that chokes their production and marketing efforts. Many of India’s farmers are desperate for renewed, not less, focus on reforms particularly market freedom and technology freedom...These laws were accepted in principle by our farmers’ movement, but were not accepted entirely by the farmers because the policy process of the Indian government is not consultative”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/brace-up-for-pro-reform-farmers-agitation-341951

24-11-2021||Aditi Tandon||Manish Tewari questions weak Indian response post 26/11 in new book; BJP slams Congress||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, Nov 23The Congress on Tuesday found itself weathering a fresh storm with former Minister Manish Tewari questioning the erstwhile UPA government’s weak response post Mumbai terror attacks and the ruling BJP attacking the grand old organisation for “making India weak with its muddled thinking.”Tewari, who was information and broadcasting minister during the Congress-led UPA Government, in a book to be launched on December 1, said of Indian response to 26/11 attacks: “there comes a time when actions must speak louder than words.”“For a state that has no compunction in brutally slaughtering hundreds of innocent people restraint is not a sign of strength but it is perceived as a symbol of weakness. There comes a time when actions must speak louder than words. 26/11 was one such time when it just should’ve been done. It is therefore my considered opinion that India should have auctioned a kinetic response in the days following India’s 9/11,” Tewari writes in the book “10 Flashpoints: 20 Years”.The BJP was quick to lash at the Congress, with the party’s IT head Amit Malviya saying that Congress Party’s muddled thinking made India weak.“After Salman Khurshid, another Congress leader throws UPA under the bus to sell his book. Manish Tewari in his new book slams the UPA for weakness in the name of restrain post 26/11. Air Chief Marshal Fali Major is already on record saying IAF was ready to strike but UPA froze,” Malviya said.The BJP leader added that just yesterday another former UPA Minister Mani Shankar Aiyar questioned defence spending.“Today Manish Tewari rues UPA’s weak response to 26/11. P Chidambaram as Home Minister wanted to launch offensive against Naxals, Digvijay Singh opposed. This muddled thinking on national security made India a weak state under the Congress,” Malviya said.The Congress for its part evaded queries on Tewari’s book. Party spokesperson Pawan Khera said he would respond after reading the book.“I haven’t read the book and can’t do a post-mortem without reading it,” said Khera. He added that more important than the book and its contents is how strongly people are enduring their daily challenges caused by rising prices of essential commodities.“We will not deflect from key issues concerning people. It is our duty to raise the concerns of people. We won’t deflect no matter how much the BJP wants us to deflect,” said Khera.He added that every leader had a right to say what they wanted to say.“Of course, national security is a major issue. China is aggressive against India from all quarters. They are building villages inside the Indian territory. Indian security is a major issue. Foreign policy has faltered. Our old friends are no more our friends. India has no intervention in Afghanistan. It’s not a small thing,” said the Congress, adding that individual comments did not amount to anti-party comments.I thank all my Self appointed Publicists especially @BJP4India for giving one para of my yet to be released book kind of saturation space,albeit un - contextualised.I wonder how these headless chickens will catch their own tails when the book is released & shoe is on other foot🤪||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/manish-tewari-questions-weak-indian-response-post-26-11-in-new-book-bjp-slams-congress-341882
