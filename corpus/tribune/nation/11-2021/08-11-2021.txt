08-11-2021||New Delhi||NSAs from Iran, all five Central Asian nations to participate in November 10 talks||After Pakistan, China has also decided to stay away from the “Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan” on Wednesday which will now see participation from eight NSAs including host Ajit Doval.“The Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan will witness an expanded participation of Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan,’’ said a release from the Ministry of External Affairs.The first two editions of the Dialogue were hosted by Iran in 2018 and 2019, added the MEA. However, when compared to the recent conclaves in Tehran and Moscow, the dropping out of Pakistan and China stands out.The MEA said the high level dialogue will review the security situation in the region and deliberate upon measures to address the relevant security challenges and support the Afghans in promoting peace, security and stability.What is common among these countries is their deep stakes in a stable Afghanistan as they will be the first to get hit adversely if terrorism and drugs flow out of the country.The participation of Tajikistan is crucial because it shares ethnicity with the restive province of Panjshir and hosted its rebels including Amrullah Saleh and Ahmed Masood. Uzbekistan, Iran and Turkmenistan also share ethnicity and borders with Afghanistan. Like India and Russia, they are not happy with the domination of Pashtuns in Kabul. Russia is a crucial player since it provides additional security underpinning to many of the Central Asian countries to help keep their borders protected.However, the absence of China will be seen against the backdrop of increased military activities on both sides of the boundary and a stalemate in talks to disengage from Eastern Ladakh. This means that the deadlock can only come at the politico- diplomatic level. The absence of China will indicate that there is no desire to break the deadlock.On the other hand, Pakistan and China have intensively engaged with the Taliban leadership in Doha, Kabul and Beijing. Islamabad will soon host Taliban Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi who will reciprocate the visit to Kabul by Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi.Details of Participating NSAs Iran: Rear Admiral Ali Shamkhani¸ Kazakhstan: Karim Massimov Kyrgyzstan: Marat ImankulovRussia: Nikolai PatrushevTajikistan: Nasrullo MahmudzodaTurkmenistan: Charymyrat AmavovUzbekistan: Victor Makhmudov||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nsas-from-iran-all-five-central-asian-nations-to-participate-in-november-10-talks-335610

08-11-2021||New Delhi||Model builder-buyer agreement: Important matter in public interest says SC, seeks Centre's reply||The Supreme Court on Monday said a model builder-buyer agreement is needed in the real estate sector and the Centre should file its reply on the issue as it is an "important matter in the public interest".A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna asked Additional Solicitor General KM Nataraj to seek instruction and file the reply by November 22.“It is an important matter and not an adversarial issue. This is an important matter in the public interest. Government has the power to make a model builder-buyer agreement under RERA. Please look into it and file your reply by November 22. A group of home buyers has come to this court seeking such model agreement,” the bench told Nataraj.The top court asked petitioner in-person advocate Ashwini Upadhyay to prepare a short note on the issue and share it along with the petition with the law officer.On October 4, the top court had said it is important for the country to have a model builder-buyer agreement in the real estate sector for consumer protection because developers try to put numerous clauses in it, which common people may not be aware of.It had issued notice to the Centre on the plea and had sought its response. Upadhyay had said that there should be a model agreement prepared by the Centre as some states have it and some don't, and there is no uniformity in those agreements.  Senior advocate Vikas Singh earlier appearing for Upadhyay had said that in states which have model agreements, builders try to influence the conditions to be incorporated, and hence, the Centre should frame it and directions be issued to all the states and Union Territories to implement the model agreement.The PIL filed by Upadhyay has sought direction to the Centre to frame model pacts for builders and agent buyers to protect customers and bring in transparency in the realty sector in line with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) Act, 2016.The plea, which was filed in October last year, has also sought a direction to all states to enforce the 'Model Builder Buyer Agreement' and 'Model Agent Buyer Agreement' and to take steps to avoid "mental, physical and financial injury" to customers."Promoters, builders, and agents use manifestly arbitrary one-sided agreements that do not place customers at an equal platform with them, which offends Articles 14, 15, 21 of the Constitution. There have been many cases of deliberate inordinate delays in handing over possession and customers lodge complaints but the police don't register FIRs, citing arbitrary clauses of the agreement, the plea said.Due to deliberate excessive delays in possession, real estate customers are not only suffering mental and financial injury but also a brazen violation of their right to life and livelihood stated the PIL filed through advocate Ashwani Kumar Dubey."Builders issue revised delivery schedules again and again and adopt arbitrary unfair restrictive trade practices. All this amounts to criminal conspiracy, fraud, cheating, criminal breach of trust, dishonestly inducing delivery of the property, dishonest misappropriation of property, and violation of corporate laws," said the plea.It contended that many developers across the country still follow a common practice of pre-launching a project without securing requisite approvals from the authorities and term it "soft launch" or "pre-launch", thus openly violating the law, but no action has been taken against any builder till date."It is necessary to state that registration of the project with the regulatory authority has been mandatory before it is launched for sale and for registration the basic prerequisite is that the developer must have all the requisite approvals."Thus the buyer is protected as the project is ring-fenced from the vagaries of non-approvals or delays in approvals which are one of the major causes of delay for the project," the plea said.It has also sought directions to compensate the buyers for losses incurred due to inordinate delays on the part of Promoters-Builders and to recover their money. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/model-builder-buyer-agreement-important-matter-in-public-interest-says-sc-seeks-centres-reply-335593
08-11-2021||New Delhi||SC to hear on November 29 plea seeking disclosure of data on COVID vaccines' clinical trials||The Supreme Court said on Monday that it would hear on November 29 a plea seeking directions for disclosure of data on clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines as also on post-jab cases.The apex court had asked the Centre, Bharat Biotech, SII and others in August to respond to the plea that sought directions to also disclose post-vaccination data regarding adverse events.As the bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and A S Oka, which was scheduled to hear the matter, was about to rise for the day, advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the petitioner, mentioned the plea and urged the court to give some date for hearing.He claimed people are losing jobs due to the coercive vaccine mandates being issued by the government if someone is not vaccinated.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta strongly opposed the submission and said the petitioner wants a mandate that vaccines should not be administered.However, Bhushan said this is not so and he was not saying this at all.Mehta said he needs three weeks to reply and said, ”let the country go the way the country wants to go”."I will file my reply and need time for that," Mehta said adding that "we don't know whose interest he (Bhushan) is representing in this matter." Bhushan said three months have passed and they have not filed their reply to the petition filed by Dr. Jacob Puliyel, who is a former member of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation and has sought directions to also disclose post-vaccination data regarding adverse events.He had earlier maintained it is not an anti-vaccine petition and transparency on the issue was needed as disclosure of data would rather clear all the doubts and hesitancy.Bhushan, while making clear that the petitioner was not seeking to stop the ongoing vaccination, had said the plea has also raised the issue of coercive vaccine mandates being issued like putting a certain restriction on travel if someone is not vaccinated.The top court had issued notices to the Centre and others, including the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Bharat Biotech, and Serum Institute of India (SII), seeking their responses on the petition within four weeks.Observing that it does not want to get into the scientific decisions taken by the experts, the apex court had said personal autonomy will have to be balanced with public health.Bhushan had referred to reports and argued that they say vaccine hesitancy is more among those who are educated people.He had told the bench that the government says the vaccine is voluntary but now people are coerced to take the vaccine."You cannot deny any service or job to anybody",  Bhushan had said while referring to vaccine mandates.He had said there are reports and data that vaccines are not that effective against the Delta variant of the virus which is spreading in several countries.The plea has sought directions to make public the segregated data of clinical trials for vaccines that are being administered in India under the emergency use authorisation granted by the Drugs Controller General of India.It has also sought the apex court's declaration that vaccine mandates, even by way of making it a pre-condition for accessing any benefits or services, is a violation of the rights of citizens and is unconstitutional. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-to-hear-on-november-29-plea-seeking-disclosure-of-data-on-covid-vaccines-clinical-trials-335581

08-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai court issues notice to Nawab Malik on defamation plaint by Mohit Bharatiya||A local court on Monday issued a process (notice) to Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik on a criminal defamation complaint filed by former Mumbai BJP youth wing president Mohit Bharatiya, who alleged that the NCP leader defamed him and his brother-in-law after the NCB’s raid on a cruise ship last month.The court in its order noted that prima facie Malik’s statements harmed the complainant’s (Bharatiya’s) reputation and  offence under Section 500 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code was made out against the NCP leader.The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) last month raided the cruise ship off the Mumbai coast and claimed to have seized drugs onboard. The agency subsequently arrested 20 people, including Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan, in connection with the cruise drugs case. Aryan Khan and some others were later granted bail.Malik has repeatedly termed the cruise drugs case as “fake” and levelled several allegations against NCB’s Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede, who has denied the charges.Bharatiya in his complaint filed before a metropolitan magistrate claimed that Malik, in a press conference held on October 9 on the NCB raid and arrest of several persons including Aryan Khan, “purposefully and intentionally defamed” him and his brother-in-law Rishab Sachdev.On Monday, magistrate P I Mokashi in the order noted that prima facie offence under Section 500 (defamation) of the Indian Penal Code was made out against Malik.The court said it has perused the documents and video clips of Malik’s press conference.“It is prima facie proved that the words spoken by accused Nawab Malik were such that it had harmed the reputation of the complainant (Bharatiya),” the court said in its order.“Thereby, ingredients of (IPC) Section 500 are prima facie proved against the accused (Malik),” the court said.“Issue process against accused Nawab Malik for offence punishable under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code,” the court said and posted the matter for further hearing on November 29.Bharatiya in the complaint filed before a metropolitan magistrate had sought action against Malik for allegedly committing offences under Sections 499 and 500 (defamation) of IPC.In the complaint, Bharatiya alleged that Malik grossly misused his dominant position to defame him and his family with highly speculative statements without any evidence to substantiate his malicious claims.As per the complaint, Malik claimed the “NCB was acting under the influence of the BJP” and tried to connect Bharatiya with the raid.Bharatiya further claimed Malik later also made false and absurd allegations that he (Bharatiya) had met NCB’s Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede.Bharatiya said such allegations and statements have harmed his reputation.The complainant said he had issued a legal notice to Malik on October 9, asking the minister to cease and desist from making any further statements. However, Malik continued with the allegations and on October 11, Bharatiya sent a second legal notice, asking him to prove whatever has been stated by him or cease from making such claims.When Malik did not stop from making statements, Bharatiya filed the defamation complaint before the magistrate. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mumbai-court-issues-notice-to-nawab-malik-on-defamation-plaint-by-mohit-bharatiya-335574

As per preliminary information, Ranjan fired at his colleagues with his service weapon, an AK-47 rifle."The local police have begun investigation and all legal action will follow. The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) has ordered an inquiry to ascertain the cause of incident and suggest remedial measures."Prima facie, it seems that due to some emotional stress leading to sudden psychological imbalance, constable Reetesh Ranjan lost his control and in a fit of rage opened fire on his colleagues," a CRPF spokesperson said.He said the CRPF deputy inspector general (DIG), Commandant of the 50th battalion in which the shooting took place and other senior officers, are present at the incident site."All the injured are being provided requisite medical care and evacuation of the injured in need of better medical care has been tied up," he said.The incident is reported to have taken place around 3.25 am in the 'C' company of the 50th CRPF battalion.Another officer said the accused jawan was to begin his sentry post duty from 4 am, but soon after getting ready he sprayed bullets on his colleagues who were sleeping.The preliminary information was collected from other jawans present in the camp. More information about the incident and the exact chain of events of over the past few days is being ascertained under the Court of Inquiry (CoI) initiated by the CRPF, he said.The paramilitary force, which has deployed over 25 battalions in the state for anti-Naxal operations, has recently issued a communication to all its formations to identify personnel who are either under depression or are stressed, and undertake appropriate counselling for them to curb suicide and fratricide-like incidents."Easy availability of a firearm to a personnel who either ends his life or attacks his colleagues is a big challenge for security forces. Different solutions are being looked to check this issue, but a perfect one is still to be found," a senior CRPF officer said.

Why hasn't black money come back? Why hasn't the economy gone cashless? Why hasn't terrorism been hit? Why hasn't price rise been reined in?" Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi, using the hashtag 'DemonetisationDisaster'.The Congress has been alleging that demonetisation was not in the interest of people and had adverse effects on the economy, a charge the Modi government has dismissed repeatedly.

Price of electric vehicle, too, would see a downward trend as a result, the minister said.Gadkari said that at present 81 per cent of India’s requirement of lithium batteries was being met by local producers. Research was going on regarding developing alternative battery technologies and breakthrough in this field was expected sooner than later, he said.The minister said his dream was to make India a manufacturing hub for electric cars including products by global players such as the Mercedes Benz and BMW. Fifty per cent of the e-vehicles manufactured by Indian two-wheeler producing giants like Bajaj and Hero were exported, Gadkari said.On the issue of availability of charging points for electric vehicles, Gadkari said that in the next two years a lot of charging points would come up in the country. Process has been already initiated for setting up 350 charging points at roadside as well as in market areas. Petrol pumps have also been allowed to install e-vehicle charging facilities on their premises, he said.A lot of electric vehicle owners in India were also having their own chargers, Gadkari said.Stating that “electric mobility is gaining good momentum in the country”, Gadkari said the cost effectiveness of e-vehicles would itself attract people to shift toward this mode of transport.Gadkari said that ideally the government would like to see a sale penetration of 30 per cent for private cars, 70 per cent for commercial cars, 40 per cent for buses and 80 per cent for two-wheelers and three-wheelers by 2030.The minister added that electricity for powering these vehicles would be produced from renewable energy sources like solar and biomass and not from the highly carbon-emitting coal.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gadkari-says-e-vehicles-will-cost-same-as-petrol-vehicles-in-next-two-years-335532

Initially, a plan was firmed up for the creation of an Air Defence Command and Maritime Theatre Command. The theatre commands are being planned to integrate the capabilities of the three services and to ensure optimal utilisation of their resources.Recently, the department of military affairs asked the three services to complete their studies on the proposed theatre commands by April so that the plan to create the new structures could be expedited, the people cited above said.

Aryan was last month arrested following a raid led by Wankhede on a cruise ship.The minister on Sunday claimed that Wankhede had met Bharatiya at a graveyard in suburban Oshiwara.“But, because of his (Wankhede’s) good luck, we couldn’t get the footage since police’s CCTV was not functioning. Hence, out of fear, Wankhede had lodged a false complaint that he was being stalked,” Malik said.“The alleged cruise rave party was a plot to kidnap Aryan for ransom, of which Bharatiya was the mastermind,” the NCP leader alleged. Accusing Wankhede of being involved in the plot, he claimed Bharatiya was a member of Wankhede’s “private army”.Malik also claimed that journalist RK Bajaj and advocate Pradeep Nambiar were members of Wankhede’s “private army”.The minister appealed to actor Shah Rukh Khan to come forward and support his fight against injustice. He accused Wankhede of creating fear among drug consumers while protecting peddlers and traffickers.He claimed the trap to kidnap Aryan was laid through Rishabh Sachdeva, brother-in-law of Bharatiya.“Rs 25 crore were sought, and the deal was finalised at Rs 18 crore...Rs 50 lakh were given. The deal got spoilt because the selfie of KP Gosavi (NCB’s witness in the cruise drugs case) with Aryan, after his arrest, became viral,” he claimed. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sameer-wankhede-was-part-of-plot-to-kidnap-aryan-khan-nawab-malik-335280

She told the journal that “the company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in Pfizer’s pivotal phase III trial”.The staff who conducted quality control checks were overwhelmed by the volume of problems they were finding, the regional director said.After repeatedly notifying Ventavia of these problems, the whistleblower, Brook Jackson, also emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day.Jackson provided The BMJ with dozens of internal company documents, photos, audio recordings, and emails.Flagging concerns over FDA inspection, the BMJ article notes that in Pfizer’s briefing document submitted to an FDA advisory committee meeting held on 10 December last year to discuss Pfizer’s application for emergency use authorisation of its vaccine, the company made no mention of problems at the Ventavia site and the next day the FDA issued the authorisation.Over 400 million doses of Pfizer have been delivered worldwide so far.Anomalies galore||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pfizer-falsified-covid-vaccine-trial-data-claims-uk-journal-335281

Sources said the inclusion of ZyCOV D in India’s inoculation programme, alongside Covaxin and Covishield, would help expand the vaccination drive with 77 per cent adults having received the first dose, but the second dose coverage hovering below 35 per cent.Sources said the government had negotiated the purchase order at Rs 358 a dose for the three-dose regime.The per dose cost is non-inclusive of taxes, but it covers the cost of a needleless applicator that would be used to administer the three shots at a difference of 28 days each. ZyCOV D is a needleless vaccine.Ministry sources said the shot would be delivered to adults first in the spirit of scientific priority. ZyCOV D is the first shot Indian regulator approved for use in children and persons aged 12 and above.The National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, the apex body that guides Indian vaccination policy, is, however, yet to take a call on vaccination of children with the WHO guidance on the matter pending too.Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya has also repeatedly stressed that child inoculations would have to be guided by science and evidence as would be boosters.

He expressed hope the BJP would win the trust of the people in the five poll-bound states—Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur.Significantly, the meeting saw UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath propose the party’s resolution that hailed “PM Modi’s leadership for India’s position at COP26 in Glasgow, Covid management, vaccination programme, corruption-free governance, welfare and development works and pro-farmer steps”. “Under PM Modi’s leadership, an atmosphere of safety, peace and prosperity has been created in Jammu and Kashmir,” it said. Moving the resolution has placed Adityanath in the top league of the BJP leadership. In the past, senior leaders like Rajnath Singh have proposed the resolution. In fact, Adityanath, like other BJP chief ministers, was supposed to attend the meeting virtually from Lucknow. However, to everyone’s surprise, he was present at the venue, a move that indicated the Prime Minister’s support and his place in the party’s hierarchy.The resolution also slammed the Opposition parties for their “opportunist” politics, accusing them of trying to derail India’s vaccination programme. “They were not to be seen on the streets during Covid, but did everything to create confusion on Twitter,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said while briefing about the 18-point resolution.As many as 342 members registered digitally for the meeting, the first since Covid outbreak. Veteran leaders Lal Krishna Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi attended the meeting virtually.The BJP leaders were given books on India’s position at COP26, its economy and the vaccination programme.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjps-best-yet-to-come-jp-nadda-at-national-executive-335285

While Pakistan said six Indian fishermen were taken into custody, there was no official word from the Indian side. The PMSA fired at the Indian fishing boat near the international maritime boundary line in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Gujarat on Saturday evening, the Coast Guard and Gujarat Police said in separate statements.Of UN conventionIt's sad.

He was on ‘Jalpari’, which had sailed from Okha on October 25 with seven crew members, five from Gujarat and two from Maharashtra,” said Dwarka SP Sunil Joshi. Chamre’s body was brought to the Okha port on Sunday and an FIR registered with the police station with jurisdiction over any incident that occurs beyond 12 nautical miles off the Gujarat coast.The violence in the maritime domain comes at a time when Pakistan has been at odds with India on several issues. Pakistan’s NSA will not attend a conference on Afghanistan this week, Indian trucks carrying aid to Afghanistan have been denied access and overflight permission to the Srinagar-Sharjah flight has been withdrawn. This is the first time in several years that a fisherman has been killed for alleged illegal fishing due to India and Pakistan’s inability to officially determine their maritime boundary, leaving small boats susceptible to inadvertently crossing territorial waters.Pakistan claimed its ships first attempted to interdict the boat, but it did not respond or change course even after repeated warnings. After warning shots failed to force the boat to shut off its engines, the PMSA opened fired on the boat. One person on board was killed and six occupants were taken into custody for questioning, it said.Violence had last erupted in the waters dividing Gujarat and Sindh in 2015 when the Indian security forces sank a Pakistani boat which appeared to be carrying suspicious cargo. The price for the absence of a maritime boundary and the promise of a good catch on waters away from the coast is paid by marginal fishermen from both countries.

He said when injustice happens, some day people react to it.In an indirect reference to the farmers’ protest against BJP leaders in Haryana, he said Chief Minister M L Khattar’s helicopter cannot land in any village in the state.He also targeted the government over the Central Vista redevelopment project, saying it would have been better if it built a world-class college instead of a new Parliament building as the country lacks quality education.He said the farmers’ issue can be resolved by addressing the subject of minimum support price (MSP). Even before the new farm laws were passed in Parliament, the Adani Group had set up its godown in Haryana’s Panipat, he said.

He never gives money to run the house. I worked as domestic help and nurtured my four children. I never thought that my son will rape me,” the woman told the police.About her son, she told police that his son has been living in a bad company and become a drug addict.“He would always keep a knife with himself and a blade in his mouth. He is cruel by nature and prone to picking up fights with local people,” she told police.On her complaint, police sent her for medical examination and managed to arrest the youth the following day, Singh said.

Only 4 pc children are severely acutely malnourished as per data from the women and child development ministry,” a top government source said.Among the 33 lakh SAM children in India, bigger states lead the wasting burden.WCD ministry data show Maharashtra has 6.16 lakh severely wasted children, Bihar 4.75 lakh, Gujarat 3.20 lakh, Andhra Pradesh 2.67 lakh, UP 1.86 lakh and Tamil Nadu 1.78 lakh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/4-pc-under-5-kids-severely-wasted-as-against-21-pc-estimated-earlier-govt-335187

He was referred to Saifai Medical College, where he died yesterday (Saturday). Today, when tea was given to the inmates around 8.30 am, they attacked the deputy jailor."Subsequently, there was stone pelting and arson in the barrack, and this was done by inmates with a criminal mindset. The police force then managed to control the situation. In this, 30 policemen were injured, and the deputy jailor, too, was attacked by the inmates," Superintendent of Police Ashok Kumar Meena told reporters earlier in the day.A fire brigade had to be called after the inmates resorted to arson. Heavy police force was deployed to control the situation, police said.Director General Jail Anand Kumar, when contacted, told PTI, "The DIG Jail is conducting an administrative inquiry. Judicial inquiry as per CrPC will also take place since an inmate has died in the incident in the jail."           District Magistrate Sanjay Kumar Singh said the guilty will be punished after investigation.Deputy Inspector General (Prisons) VP Tripathi arrived at the jail in the evening and said the entire matter will be investigated and action will be initiated against those found guilty.

This price includes the cost of a disposable painless jet applicator which has to be used for administering each dose,” an official source said.“The vaccine in all probability will be given to adults initially because of limited production capacity,” the source said.Zydus Cadila is in a position to provide one crore doses of ZyCoV-D per month, company officials are learnt to have conveyed to the ministry.For administering to adults, frontline workers and vaccinators will be provided a brief training for using the needle-free pharma jet application in actual field settings.The three doses of ZyCoV-D are to be administered 28 days apart, with each dose comprising a shot in both arms.ZyCoV-D received emergency use authorisation from the drug regulator on August 20.Meanwhile, a comprehensive programme for paediatric immunisation including developing a priority list of comorbidities is being worked out by the NTAGI (National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation) for the launch of ZyCoV-D and Covaxin. As for the emergency use approval for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin in the 2 to 18 years age group by the Drugs Controller General of India, it is under expert opinion and evaluation, official sources said.The Subject Expert Committee (SEC) on COVID-19 of the Central Drug Authority on October 12  had recommended granting emergency use authorisation to Covaxin for children and adolescents in the 2 to 18 years age group with certain conditions.At present, every citizen who is 18 years or above is eligible for the vaccination drive.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-places-purchase-order-for-one-crore-doses-of-zydus-cadilas-needle-free-covid-vaccine-335167
08-11-2021||Mumbai||NCB officer Sameer Wankhede was part of plot to 'kidnap' Aryan Khan, claims Nawab Malik||Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik on Sunday alleged that Narcotics Control Bureau's (NCB) Mumbai zonal director Sameer Wankhede was part of a plot to "kidnap" actor Shah Rukh Khan's son Aryan Khan for ransom. Speaking to reporters here, Malik claimed that Mohit Bharatiya, former president of Mumbai BJP's youth wing, was the "mastermind" of the plot.Aryan Khan was last month arrested following a raid led by Wankhede on a cruise ship from which drugs were allegedly seized. He was later granted bail by the Bombay High Court.Malik has repeatedly termed the cruise drugs raid as "fake" and levelled a series of allegations against Wankhede. The minister on Sunday claimed Wankhede had met Bharatiya at a 'kabarastan' (graveyard) in suburban Oshiwara. "But, because of his (Wankhede's) good luck, we couldn't get the footage since police's CCTV was not functioning. Hence, out of fear, Wankhede had lodged a false complaint that he was being stalked," Malik said. "The alleged cruise rave party was a plot to kidnap Aryan Khan for ransom, of which Mohit Bharatiya was the mastermind," the NCP leader alleged.Accusing Wankhede of being involved in the plot, he claimed Bharatiya was a member of Wankhede's "private army".Malik also claimed that journalist RK Bajaj and advocate Pradeep Nambiar were members of Wankhede's "private army".The minister appealed to Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan to come forward and support his fight against injustice. He accused Wankhede of creating fear among drug consumers while protecting peddlers and traffickers. He claimed the trap to kidnap Aryan Khan was laid through Rishabh Sachdeva, the brother-in-law of Bharatiya. "Rs 25 crore were sought, and the deal was finalised at Rs 18 crore...Rs 50 lakh were given. The deal got spoilt because the selfie of KP Gosavi (NCB's witness in the cruise drugs case) with Aryan, after his arrest, became viral," he claimed. The minister further said there have been attempts to frighten Shah Rukh Khan that since he "gave an amount of Rs 50 lakh", he too becomes an accused. "I appeal to him not to get scared. If your child is kidnapped and ransom is sought and the parent pays it, he is the victim and not the accused," Malik said. Aryan Khan was taken to the cruise party by Pratik Gabba and Aamir Furniturewala, he claimed, adding that Sachdeva, Gabba and Furniturewala were let off by the NCB."Kashif Khan, an organiser of the cruise party, had tried hard to invite state minister Aslam Shaikh and children of our top ministers to come to the party," he claimed."Besides cases of Aryan Khan and Sameer Khan (Malik's son-in-law), all 26 cases (being probed by the NCB) should be given to the SIT for probe. If there is an attempt to scare me by putting my son-in-law's case for re-examination, let me be clear that I am not scared," the minister said. Malik's son-in-law was arrested in January this year by the NCB in an alleged drugs case, and was granted bail in September. The minister on his Twitter handle also posted an NCB notice to issued to one Sanville Steanley D'Souza under the NDPS (Naroctic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act, dated June 23 this year, directing him to be present at the agency's office.Malik claimed this is the real name of Sam D'Souza, whose name had cropped up in connection with the pay-off allegations in the cruise drugs case, and released a purported telephonic conversation between D'Souza and NCB official VV Singh.He said V V Singh called D'Souza for interrogation in June this year and had also warned the latter against changing his phone handset."Why hasn't he (D'Souza) been arrested yet?" Malik asked, without revealing the case details. Bharatiya on Saturday alleged that one Sunil Patil from Dhule, "who is closely associated with NCP leaders including former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh", is the mastermind of the cruise drug bust episode. However, Malik on Sunday claimed Sunil Patil did not belong to the NCP and he had never met him. He also said the NCB had challenged the Gujarat government's forensic lab report which gave a clean chit to his son-in-law before an NDPS court in the alleged drugs case. Malik appealed to the NCB and the BJP not to "shield" tainted persons. "My fight is not against the NCB or the BJP. It is against those indulging in wrongdoings. Please support me. I am also supporting eradication of the drugs menace," he said. Malik also demanded that action be taken against NCB's "quartet"--- Wankhede, V V Singh, Ashish Ranjan and Wankhede's driver Mane—claiming they were involved in "wrongdoings" in the NCB's zonal office. Meanwhile, Bharatiya said he never mentioned that he is a BJP leader. Speaking to reporters, he said Malik did not answer how Chinku Pathan, an associate of fugitive underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, had a meeting with the then state home minister Anil Deshmukh. "Chinku Pathan is a close aide of Dawood Ibrahim...what was he doing in the Sahyadri Guest House on January 20, 2020?" he said. Bharatiya also said it was only after his press conference that Malik admitted he received a call from Sunil Patil. "He (Malik) was silent on him," he said. He further said Malik himself has admitted that a cabinet minister was also invited to the cruise party. "(Minister) Aslam Shaikh has to clarify...why and how a person could reach out to the minister and the sons and daughters of ministers?" he said. Bharatiya said Aslam Shaikh should clarify what is his relation with Kashif Khan that he was invited to the cruise party. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ncb-officer-sameer-wankhede-was-part-of-plot-to-kidnap-aryan-khan-claims-nawab-malik-335149
08-11-2021||New Delhi||BJP Executive Meeting: 'Panna' committees, 'pramukhs' part of BJP ambitious strategy ahead of 2022 Assembly, 2024 general elections||Repeating Home Minister Amit Shah’s words when he constituted his national executive committee in 2014, BJP president JP Nadda said on Sunday that ‘utkarsh abhi baki hai’ (BJP is yet to peak), giving ambitious tasks to cadres ahead of the elections to key Assemblies next year and the general elections in 2024.In his presidential address at the party’s national committee meeting, Nadda said BJP has constituted booth-level committees for 85 percent of the 10.40 lakh booths in the country. The remaining 15 per cent should be completed by December 25, union minister Dharmendra Pradhan said, quoting Nadda.Going a step deeper, the BJP will also constitute ‘panna’ (page) committees on the lines of Gujarat, Pradhan said. The work for appointing ‘page pramukhs’ should be completed by April 6, 2022. The priority, of course, will be the five states going to polls early next year.Meanwhile, the BJP is also “institutionalising” Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Mann ki Baat’ radio programme on booth-level from May 2022, he added, saying that the ambitious tasks will be completed within the next six months.  There are some challenges before the party like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra and Odisha, places where the ‘sangathan’(organisation) has to become stronger, Nadda said.A ‘sentimental’ Nadda thanked people of West Bengal and assured them that the party will “stand by them” and “save them in a democratic way, giving an apt reply to anarchist elements in the next elections”.The party will discuss issues related to upcoming elections during the meeting being conducted in a hybrid form. Veteran leaders LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi are attending from their residences and so are members from states.     As many as 342 members registered digitally, Pradhan said briefing about Nadda’s presidential address that began with welcoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi, “thanking him for his exemplary work for the country and people during the Covid pandemic”.   The PM delivered not just in the country but also outside, he said.“No one knew how to deal with the situation when the Covid started but soon he formed a task force and took control of the situation leading to a satisfactory situation where more than 100 crores are vaccinated, 30 percent are fully vaccinated and WHO has approved Covaxin. He has set an example for us and the executive thanked him on the behalf of the people,” said Pradhan, attributing it all to PM’s ‘doordrishti (farsightedness)”.  “He ran the biggest food programme in human history because of which the country’s economy is back on track, jobs have increased, the biggest example being the GST collection, school colleges have started opening, life is becoming normal. This is all due to ‘garib kalyan’ at the right time,” Pradhan said, quoting Nadda.Nadda said J&K is moving towards the path of development due to PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. “Investments, tourism have increased, the scene in Srinagar has changed, IIT and IIMs have started opening,” he said.He also praised the PM for implementing CAA, saying that the move received much criticism but “the situation in Afghanistan proved his farsightedness”. Referring to steps taken to resolve “several chronic issues with concrete measures,” he said “there is peace and brotherhood in the country”.Speaking on the farmers issues, he talked of measures taken during the past seven years, including increase in agrarian budget. Nadda also mentioned steps taken for benefit of the Sikh community by PM Modi, including simplification of FCRA grant for gurudwaras, keeping ‘langars’ out of the ambit of the GST, the Kartarpur Corridor and constitution of SIT on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-executive-meeting-panna-committees-pramukhs-part-of-bjp-ambitious-strategy-ahead-of-2022-assembly-%C2%A02024-general-elections-335144
