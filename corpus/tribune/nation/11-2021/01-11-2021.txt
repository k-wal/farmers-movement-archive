It (what the students did) may be offensive, but it is not illegal in any way”.        "Charging the students with sedition will ruin their careers, he said.Khuehami said: “We need to reach out to them (students) and counsel them rather than react with harsh decisions”.Seeking Modi’s intervention for the withdrawal of sedition charges against the students, he said that the association hopes that they will be given a chance to return to their studies.“Their future should not be destroyed in the larger interest of the country,” he said.National general secretary of Jammu and Kashmir Students’ Association Younus Rashid said the government should give a chance to the students so that their future can be preserved. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/students-arrest-in-agra-jk-students-body-seeks-modis-intervention-for-withdrawal-of-sedition-charge-332918
01-11-2021||New Delhi||WhatsApp banned over 2.2 million Indian accounts in September||More than 2.2 million Indian accounts were banned by WhatsApp while 560 grievance reports were received by the messaging platform in September, according to its compliance report.In its latest report released on Monday, WhatsApp said 2,209,000 Indian accounts on the platform were banned in September.An Indian account is identified via a ‘+91’ phone number, it added.“WhatsApp is an industry leader in preventing abuse, among end-to-end encrypted messaging services. Over the years, we have consistently invested in Artificial Intelligence and other state of the art technology, data scientists and experts, and in processes, in order to keep our users safe on our platform,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said.In accordance with the IT Rules 2021, WhatsApp has published its fourth monthly report for the 30-day period of September 1-30.“This user-safety report contains details of the user complaints received and the corresponding action taken by WhatsApp as well as WhatsApp’s own preventive actions to combat abuse on our platform,” the spokesperson said.Previously, the Facebook-owned company had stated that more than 95 per cent of the ban was due to the unauthorised use of automated or bulk messaging (spam). The global average number of accounts that WhatsApp bans to prevent abuse on its platform is around 8 million accounts per month.WhatsApp, in its latest report, said it received 560 user reports spanning across account support (121), ban appeal (309), other support and product support (49 each) and safety (32) during September.During this period, 51 accounts were actioned based on the reports received.WhatsApp explained that “Accounts Actioned” denotes remedial action taken based on the reports.Taking action denotes either banning an account or a previously banned account being restored as a result of the complaint.Also, reports may have been reviewed but not included as ‘Actioned’ for many reasons, including the user needing assistance to access their account or to use some features, user-requested restoration of a banned account and the request is denied, or if the reported account does not violate the laws of India or WhatsApp’s Terms of Service.About 2 million Indian accounts were banned by WhatsApp while 420 grievance reports were received by the messaging platform in August.The new IT rules—which came into effect in May—require large digital platforms (with over 5 million users) to publish compliance reports every month, mentioning the details of complaints received and action taken.Previously, WhatsApp had emphasised that being an end-to-end encrypted platform, it has no visibility into the content of any messages.Besides the behavioural signals from accounts, it relies on available unencrypted information, including user reports, profile photos, group photos and descriptions as well as advanced AI tools and resources to detect and prevent abuse on its platform, it had said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/whatsapp-banned-over-2-2-million-indian-accounts-in-september-332915
01-11-2021||New Delhi||Joint structures should be created between services to reduce decision-making cycles: IAF chief||Joint structures should be created between armed forces to capitalise on each of their strengths and reduce decision-making cycles, Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari said on Monday.Chaudhari, in his address to officers at the National Defence College in New Delhi, focused on the topic of transformation of the IAF to a contemporary aerospace power, the IAF said on Twitter.“During his address, the CAS (Chief of Air Staff) covered the need for integrated employment of military power by capitalising on strengths of individual services to create joint structures. He brought out that these structures should be future ready and cater to reduced decision-making cycles,” it said.The CAS spoke on the indigenisation programmes of weapons and systems in order to retain strategic autonomy and stressed on the importance of developing multi-domain capability to address future conflicts, the IAF said.Chief of Defence Staff Bipin Rawat has been working on the theaterisation model under which at least six new integrated commands are being envisaged.According to the plan, each of the theatre commands will have units of the Indian Army, the Indian Navy and the IAF and all of them will work as a single entity looking after security challenges in a specified geographical territory under an operational commander.At present, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force have separate commands. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/joint-structures-should-be-created-between-services-to-reduce-decision-making-cycles-iaf-chief-332909
01-11-2021||New Delhi||Govt issues FAQs on IT rules; says norms consistent with right to freedom of speech, expression||The government on Monday said the new IT rules are consistent with the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the Constitution, and do not place additional obligations on users.Releasing a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) around the intermediary guidelines, IT ministry said the rules have a clear focus on protecting online privacy of individuals, and that even with regard to identification of the first originator of messages, safeguards are in place to ensure that privacy of users is not violated.Overall, the FAQs seek to address queries that internet and social media users may have about scope of the new rules, major changes it brings over past provisions, how the rules enhance safety of women and children, and due diligence to be done by an intermediary, among others.In one of the questions, the ministry said the rules do not infringe on right to free speech and expression.“The new IT rules, 2021 have been framed consistent with these rights. The rules place no additional obligations on users and do not contain any sort of penalties applicable on users,” it said.Further, the ministry said the rules define ‘social media intermediary’ as an intermediary which primarily or solely enables online interaction between two or more users and allows them to “create, upload, share, disseminate, modify or access information using its services”.Typically, any intermediary whose primary purpose is enabling commercial or business-oriented transactions, providing access to internet or search-engine services, e-mail service or online storage service, etc. will not qualify as a social media intermediary, the ministry said in the 20-page document.To qualify as a social media intermediary, enabling of online interactions should be the primary or sole purpose of the intermediary, it explained.“Therefore, typically, an entity which has some other primary purpose, but only incidentally enables online interactions, may not be considered as a social media intermediary,” it said.The scope of enabling online interactions would extend to facilitating “socialisation/social networking, including the ability of users to increase their reach and following, within the platform via specific features like follow/subscribe etc.”According to the ministry, offering opportunity to interact with unknown persons or users, and ability of enabling virality of content by facilitation of sharing would also amount to enabling online interaction, it said.Separately, the ministry will come out with the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) around the IT rules and intermediary norms that would contain details of the appropriate agencies who will have the authority to issue takedown notices to platforms.The IT Rules, 2021 are meant to benefit general users, who are using any intermediary platform, it said, adding that the norms provide for increased safety of netizens and ensure accountability of platforms by way of a robust grievance redressal mechanism.“The rules, by providing these reasonable mechanisms and remedies, strive to ensure that social media platforms remain a safe space for all users, free from cyber threats, harassment and unlawful content,” it said.As per IT rules, the chief compliance officer and the nodal contact person cannot be the same person whereas the roles of the nodal contact person and the resident grievance officer may be performed by the same person.“However, keeping in view the functional requirements of the nodal contact person and the resident grievance officer, it is desirable that SSMI (Significant Social Media Intermediary) appoints separate persons for the two roles,” it said.A parent SSMI can appoint common officers across its products/services. But the contact details to approach these officers are required to be clearly mentioned on each of those product and service platforms separately.To a question on whether detection of first originator of the message could compromise end-to-end encryption, the ministry clarified that the intent of the rule is not to break or weaken the encryption but merely to obtain the registration details of the first Indian originator of the message.A typical principle of detection is based on the ‘hash value’ of the unencrypted message, wherein identical messages will result into a common hash irrespective of the encryption used by a messaging platform.“How this hash will be generated or stored needs to be decided by the concerned SSMI, and SSMI are free to come up with alternative technological solutions to implement this rule,” it said.It is pertinent to mention here that India enforced new IT intermediary rules earlier this year, aiming to bring greater accountability for big tech companies, including Twitter and Facebook.The rules require social media platforms to remove any content flagged by authorities within 36 hours and set up a robust complaint redressal mechanism with an officer being based in the country. Social media companies are required to take down posts depicting nudity or morphed photos within 24 hours of receiving a complaint.Significant social media companies—those with over 50 lakh users—also have to publish a monthly compliance report disclosing details of complaints received and action taken as also details of contents removed proactively.“Internet for all of the good things represents the ability to deliver good governance, ability for last person in democracy to reach out to government.“... but it also represents significant growth in things we refer to as user harm and criminality and so policy making has to address, grow the good, and address the bad in a manner that is transparent and effective,” Minister of State for Electronics and IT Rajeev Chandrasekhar said while releasing the FAQs.As the cyberspace is evolving, so is the nature of “good and bad” on cyberspace. The government’s policy making is aimed at ensuring that interest of users are protected by way of greater accountability of platforms, he said.“Internet must always remain open... openness means it is bereft from not just state and government influence but is also free from dominant big tech influence and one of ways to normalise that is to create among bigger platforms a culture of rules-based accountability to their users,” he said.He also said that the biggest stakeholders of internet are millions of Indians who are using it and nearly 80 crore Indians are online.“We appreciate the government’s efforts in bringing more clarity on the 2021 IT rules. We look forward to studying the FAQs” a Meta spokesperson said. Facebook recently rebranded itself as Meta.When contacted, Google said the company is reviewing the FAQs document.

Going forward, language learning will be promoted as a skill with a formal credit-earning system,” Pradhan said.The initiatives launched on Saturday will enable students to embrace the linguistic diversity of India and sensitise them about the richness of its culture, heritage and diversity, he said.‘Bhasha Sangam’ is a Ministry of Education initiative under ‘Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat’ to teach schoolchildren basic sentences of every day usage in 22 Indian languages.“The idea is that people should acquire basic conversational skills in an Indian language other than their mother tongue. We are aiming that at least 75 lakh people should acquire this skill during the ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’ period,” Pradhan said.India is celebrating ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ to mark 75 years of independence. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/language-learning-to-be-promoted-as-a-skill-with-formal-credit-earning-system-education-minister-dharmendra-pradhan-332891
01-11-2021||New Delhi||'Karva Chauth' ad withdrawn due to 'public intolerance', says Justice DY Chandrachud||Supreme Court judge DY Chandrachud has expressed anguish over the withdrawal of a ‘Karva Chauth’ advertisement featuring a same-sex couple due to “public intolerance,” saying there is a need to change the mindset of both men and women.The judge was referring to the advertisement of Indian firm Dabur on ‘Karva Chauth’, a Hindu festival prevalent in northern parts of the country and in which wives keep a day-long fast and perform ‘puja’ for the well being of their husbands.The advertisement, showing a same-sex couple celebrating the festival, was withdrawn by the firm after facing backlash on social media and from a politician of Madhya Pradesh.“Just two days ago, all of you would know, of this advertisement which a company was required to pull down. It was an advertisement for Karva Chauth of a same-sex couple. It had to be withdrawn on the ground of public intolerance,” said Justice Chandrachud.The judge was speaking virtually at the launch of the nationwide legal awareness programme, ‘Empowerment of Women through legal awareness’ at Varanasi on Saturday.The awareness programme was being carried out by the National Legal Services Authority, headed by the senior-most judge Justice U U Lalit, in collaboration with National Commission for Women and UP State Legal Services Authority.Justice Chandrachud said that awareness about the rights of women could truly be meaningful if it is created among the younger generation of men.“Awareness is not only a woman’s issue. I believe that the deprivation of rights of women if we have to find an answer to them, the origin must be in the changing of mindset, both of men and women. True freedom for women, in other words, is truly intersectional,” the judge remarked.He further said that there are real-life situations that show that there is a great divergence between ideals of the law and the real state of society.He said that even though legislations like the domestic violence act, prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace act have been enacted to achieve the goal of fulfilling the constitutional rights of women, the judges come across injustice against women every day.Justice Chandrachud stated that the entitlements which the law has created for women should not become a ruse or an excuse for perpetuating the domination of men.The apex court judge said the Constitution of India is a transformative document that seeks to remedy the structural inequalities rooted in patriarchy.           “It has become a powerful tool to secure material entitlements and provide public affirmations of dignity and equality of women,” he added.At the event held at Varanasi, several other top court judges Justices Vikram Nath, Krishna Murari, Judge, Chief Justice of Allahabad HC Justice Rajesh Bindal were also present among others. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/karva-chauth-ad-withdrawn-due-to-public-intolerance-says-justice-dy-chandrachud-332889

01-11-2021||New Delhi||Bypolls: Counting of votes on Tuesday in three Lok Sabha and 29 assembly constituencies||Counting of votes will take place on Tuesday in three Lok Sabha and 29 assembly constituencies spread across 13 states and the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli where byelections were held on October 30.INLD leader Abhay Chautala, who quit the Haryana assembly in protest against the three new central agri laws, Congress’ Pratibha Singh, wife of late chief minister Virbhadra Singh, former national footballer Eugeneson Lyngdoh and ex-minister from Telangana Eatala Rajender are among the prominent candidates whose fate will be decided.The assembly byelections which saw a high turnout were held in five seats in Assam, four in West Bengal, three each in Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Meghalaya, two each in Bihar, Karnataka and Rajasthan and one seat each is in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Mizoram and Telangana.Out of the 29 Assembly seats, the BJP had won in around half a dozen constituencies earlier, the Congress had nine, while the rest were with the regional parties.The seats where Lok Sabha by-elections were held are Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Mandi in Himachal Pradesh and Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh.In all the three Lok Sabha constituencies, the sitting members had died.The Mandi seat fell vacant after the death of Ramswaroop Sharma (BJP) in March. The byelection to the Khandwa parliamentary constituency was necessitated following the death of BJP member Nand Kumar Singh Chauhan while in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, it was due to the demise of Independent Lok Sabha member Mohan Delkar.In Mandi, Pratibha Singh is pitted against BJP’s Khushal Singh Thakur, a Kargil war hero.In Meghalaya, former national footballer Eugeneson Lyngdoh is contesting the election from Mawphlang on a United Democratic Party (UDP) ticket. He is up against former Congress MLA Kennedy C Khyriem and a sitting member of the district council (MDC) from the NPP, Lamphrang Blah.In Haryana, the by-election to Ellenabad Assembly constituency was necessitated by the resignation of Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Abhay Chautala as MLA in protest against the Centre’s new farm laws.Chautala, son of INLD chief Om Prakash Chautala, is contesting against Congress nominee Pawan Beniwal and BJP-JP candidate Gobind Kanda, the brother of Haryana Lokhit Party chief and legislator Gopal Kanda.It is an important contest for the Chautalas as Abhay Chautala had won the 2010 bypolls from Ellenabad when Om Prakash Chautala vacated the seat, and then retained it in 2014 and also in 2019 Assembly polls, when he was the lone INLD MLA in the House.In the Dadra and Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha constituency, seven-time independent MP Mohan Delkar’s wife Kalaben Delkar is contesting as Shiv Sena candidate against BJP’s Mahesh Gavit and Congress’ Mahesh Dhodi.In Huzurabad Assembly constituency in Telangana, the ruling TRS, opposition BJP and Congress locked in a triangular contest.The by-election was held following the resignation of Eatala Rajender in June after his removal from the state Cabinet over allegations of land grabbing. Rajender, who dismissed the allegations, had quit the TRS and is contesting on a BJP ticket.The result is significant for the BJP as it aims at emerging as an alternative to the ruling TRS in the 2023 Legislative Assembly elections.In Assam, the ruling BJP has fielded candidates in three seats leaving the other two to alliance partner UPPL. The Congress put up nominees in all five, while its former allies, the AIUDF and the BPF, are contesting in two and one seats respectively.In West Bengal, TMC heavyweight Udayan Guha is looking to reclaim Dinhata seat, which the BJP had snatched from him in the April elections.The by-election was held following the resignation of Nisith Pramanik, now Union Minister of State for Home Affairs, as he chose to retain his Lok Sabha membership.Bypolls to Dinhata and Santipur are seen as a prestige battle for the BJP, which is currently grappling with an exodus of MLAs and senior leaders.In Santipur, BJP MP Jagannath Sarkar had resigned from the assembly.In Rajasthan, the bypolls were necessitated due to the demise of Congress MLA from Vallabhnagar Gajendra Singh Shaktawat and BJP legislator from Dhariawad Gautam Lal Meena.In Vallabhnagar, the ruling Congress party has given a ticket to Gajendra Shaktawat’s wife, Preeti Shaktawat, while the BJP has fielded Himmat Singh Jhala.The Congress has fielded Nagraj Meena in Dhariawad against BJP candidate Khet Singh Meena.Both the BJP and the Congress are keen to win the results will send a message across the state about the performance of the Ashok Gehlot government, which is facing a challenge from the Congress faction led by Sachin Pilot.In Karanataka, the by-election was necessitated following the death of Sindgi JD(S) legislator M C Managuli and BJP’s C M Udasi from Hangal and will be the first electoral test for Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai, who had replaced B S Yediyurappa.Counting of votes will also take place in Andhra Pradesh’s Badvel seat, earlier held by the YSRC, Deglur in Maharashtra, which was held by the Congress, and Tuirial assembly seat in Mizoram.

He also appealed to farmers not to hoard fertilisers as production will surpass the demand, promising strict action against black marketers.“Categorically denouncing the claim (of shortage),” Mandaviya said he had reviewed the production targets of fertilisers for November with officials.“The production will surpass the demand raised by the states and UTs. While the demand of urea is 41 lakh MT, 76 lakh MT will be produced. Similarly, 18 lakh MT DAP will be produced against a projected demand of 17 lakh MT. The supply of 30 lakh MT of NPK will surpass the demand of 15 lakh MT,” according to an official statement.He appealed to all farmers “not to hoard fertilisers and pay attention to rumour-mongers”, promising “strict action against those who resort to black-marketing of fertilisers using rumour as a shield”.The Centre is constantly monitoring the production and movement of fertiliser in the country and adequate arrangements are in place to ensure that farmers get sufficient quantities of fertiliser, he assured.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mansukh-mandaviya-debunks-rumours-of-fertiliser-shortage-asks-farmers-not-to-hoard-332870
01-11-2021||Bhuj||Education in India not inclusive; we are lacking in terms of education: SC judge||As per the standards of sustainable development India is still lacking in terms of education as it has not achieved the goal of “inclusive education”, Supreme Court judge Justice UU Lalit said here on Monday and underlined the need to undertake more efforts on this front and to provide good and quality education to every child.Justice Lalit was in Bhuj in Gujarat to participate in a mega legal services camp and awareness programme organised as part of a pan-India outreach campaign of the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) that started on October 2 and will conclude on November 14.Justice Lalit, who is Executive Chairman of NALSA, said that national public sector institutions such as AIIMS, IITs, NITs, National Law Schools, etc. have achieved excellence in their respective fields, but the same is not the case with government primary and secondary schools in the country.“Are government schools the first choice for any citizen to send his child, or is it the school in the private sector which is supposed to be the first choice?” asked Justice Lalit while addressing the gathering.“Our education is not inclusive. Our education is not such that those provided (with it) in some villages and big cities have no difference in their qualities. We must consider all this. And unless we achieve this, according to sustainable development standards, we are still lacking in terms of education,” he said.Mentioning the Right to Education (RTE) Act, Justice Lalit said nearly 11 years since its introduction, the participation of girl students in elementary and secondary schools has increased.He said education alone is not enough, and one needs to consider the aspect of “inclusiveness in education. And I believe that there is more need to take some effort in this direction, he added.“If education is the most fundamental and cherished right of every child in this country, then it is our bounden duty to make available what is called good, quality education,” he said, adding that unless this is achieved one cannot consider poverty being eradicated in terms of world standards.Talking about “poverty alleviation,” Justice Lalit said it should be looked at from the yardstick of sustainable development goals and not just in terms of the figures of “Below Poverty Line”.Justice Lalit said that only one out of 100 people in the courts is availing the benefit of the aid provided by the legal services authorities.“Our effort through this pan-India awareness programme is an attempt to germinate the seed about the same right, to explain the rights,” he said.Justice Lalit said NALSA also aims at empowering women and elevating those with some form of mental disability.Induction of women to the National Defence Academy and them becoming fighter corps is a “big achievement,” empowerment that NALSA aspires to provide, he said.“NALSA believes that mental weakness or disability is not a permanent feature. It is a temporary phenomenon, and we have to overcome the temporary phenomenon with effort. And the efforts should not only be from the family, but it also depends on our society, systems, and how to raise the child,” he added.In his speech, Justice MR Shah of the Supreme Court said the people need to know about their rights in terms of availing the legal services.“You must know that free and quality legal services are our effort. Our effort is that nobody remains deprived of justice due to the lack of money and consultancy,” he said.Chief Justice of Gujarat High Court Aravind Kumar said the lack of awareness among people about free and competent legal aid and assistance is the reason due to which the access to justice remains a “distant dream” for a large number of poor, weaker and downtrodden population.“Until and unless legal awareness is carried out as a massive campaign, you may not succeed in achieving the motto of NALSA—Nyay Sabke Liye- that is access to justice to all,” he said.Justice RM Chhaya of Gujarat High Court, who is also the Executive Chairman of GSLSA, said that since the campaign started on October 2, 18,444 villages in Gujarat have been covered in the first of its three phases, and the second phase is also nearing completion.“Around 3 crore people were contacted in door-to-door campaigns, and 11 lakh people have benefited from legal education camps. Another 94 lakh people have been contacted through mobile vans,” Justice Chhaya added.

While BJP is always strengthened when Samajwadi Party is in power, it’s the opposite when BSP is at the saddle,” she said.Mayawati's BSP and the Samajwadi Party are archrivals and major players in Uttar Pradesh politics. Both compete for votes of Muslim and backward castes.Muslims constitute about 20 per cent of the voters in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fixed-match-says-mayawati-after-akhileshs-jinnah-reference-drew-bjps-criticism-332855
01-11-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Crime Branch takes Sachin Vaze’s custody in extortion case||The Mumbai Crime Branch on Monday took the custody of dismissed police officer Sachin Vaze in connection with an extortion case registered against him at suburban Goregaon, an official said.After taking Vaze’s custody, the crime branch personnel took him to the Esplanade court here to seek his further remand for interrogation in the case.A special court here last week allowed the Mumbai police to take the custody of Vaze, who was lodged in Navi Mumbai’s Taloja jail, for interrogation in the case.Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh is also an accused in the case.Vaze, the 49-year-old assistant police inspector, was dismissed from service after his arrest in March this year in the case related to recovery of an explosives-laden SUV near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence and the subsequent murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran.The Mumbai Crime branch, probing the extortion case registered at Goregaon police station, had sought his custody from the special court, saying it was necessary for further probe into the offence.Considering the fact that Vaze recently underwent a bypass surgery, the court had called for a report about his health condition from the prison authorities.The court, after finding that he was fit to travel for a few days, last week directed the jail authorities to hand over his custody to the Mumbai police on November 1.The extortion case had been registered against Vaze, Param Bir Singh and others on a complaint of builder-cum-hotelier Bimal Agrawal.Four others -- Sumit Singh alias Chintu, Alpesh Patel, Vinay Singh alias Babloo, and Riyaz Bhati -- have also been named as accused in the case.As per the complaint by Agarwal, the accused extorted Rs 9 lakh from him for not conducting a raid on two bars and restaurants, which he ran in partnership, and also forced him to buy two smartphones worth around Rs 2.92 lakh for them. The incident occurred between January 2020 and March 2021, police earlier said.Accordingly, the case was filed under Indian Penal Code Sections 384 and 385 (both pertaining to extortion) 34 (common intention) against the six accused and a probe in the case is on, they had said.

01-11-2021||New Delhi||Mandaviya reviews dengue situation in Delhi; Centre to send teams to states with rising cases||Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Monday directed the Union health secretary to identify and send team of experts to states with high active dengue cases, as he reviewed the situation in Delhi and assured the Centre’s full support.Mandaviya chaired a high-level meeting with the Delhi government to review the public health measures taken for control and management of dengue.“Reviewed the dengue situation in Delhi and assured Centre’s full support,” the minister tweeted.“On-ground initiatives like hotspot identification, fogging and timely treatment will be carried out to curb disease. Centre is also sending a team of experts to states with rising dengue cases,” he said.The minister directed Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan to identify the states with high active cases and send the teams. The best practices of these states are also to be recorded in the subsequent review meets, he said, according to a ministry statement.So far this year, six fatalities have been recorded in the national capital due to the mosquito-borne disease, while the number of cases has climbed to over 1,530, according to a civic report released on Monday.Highlighting the urgency of intervention, the minister pointed out that many poor people are affected by dengue in which low platelet count weakens a patient, the health ministry said in the statement.“Primary health care centres may prescribe anti-pyretic drugs to suppress the symptoms without addressing the root cause, which may lead to eventual demise of the patient. Since testing is the most important step to identifying dengue, these deaths will not be reported as such and the incidence will continue to be under-reported,” Mandaviya said.He directed officials to ramp up testing so that all cases of the vector-borne disease are reported and treated properly.The minister also stressed on the need for effective coordination between the Centre and states, and observed that some hospitals are over-burdened with dengue cases while beds continue to be empty in others, the statement said.Effective communication between all stakeholders was thus suggested as the way forward, it said.The health minister asked officials in Delhi to look into the possibility of repurposing COVID-19 beds to treat dengue patients.It was decided that health officials of the ministry will support their counterparts in the Delhi government to chalk out a detailed action plan to combat dengue, the statement said.Mandaviya also advised to take on board all the municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs), the New Delhi Municipal Council, the Cantonment Board and other stakeholders in the effort to intensify dengue control, the statement said.It was noted that although the health administration was very effective in its communication on vector disease control, the efficacy of these messages on the action taken by common people remains unknown.Use of mosquito nets, full-sleeved clothing and indoor fogging are to be encouraged while MCDs are conduct spraying in houses of dengue patients and 60 houses around it, the statement said.Other than removing stagnant water in houses, restaurants, industries, overhead tanks, the health minister stressed on the identification of slums without regular supply of water where water is stored for consumption.The statement said though extensive cleaning is required for some surfaces where water gets replaced frequently like coolers and refrigerator trays, the use of chemicals like Temephos granules is known to be effective in larvae control.Mandaviya was apprised that the Delhi government will take up a campaign to sensitise schoolchildren on larvae control and training them to ensure there is no stagnant water in flower pots, feeding bowls for birds and coolers etc, it said.The campaign will be taken up as schools are being re-opened, the statement said and also mentioned that larvicide fishes like Gambusia have been deployed in 163 site. The Delhi government has declared dengue a notified disease which will enhance reporting and monitoring of the disease.Delhi is monitoring all fever cases, suspected dengue cases and confirmed cases.              Hospitals have also been converted to sites with zero tolerance for mosquitoes, since vectors acquire the pathogen from infected persons and are able to transmit it in their offspring too. Mosquito nets will be provided to dengue patients, the statement.Though only 10 per cent cases are complicated and mortality seldom crosses one per cent, all Delhi government health officials assured the Union health minister that the outbreak shall be contained with the help of all stakeholders, it said.The meeting also discussed new vaccines developed to target dengue.Rajesh Bhushan, Union Health Secretary,  Vikash Sheel, Additional Secretary and Mission Director, NHM,  Arti Ahuja, Additional Secretary (Health), Dr S K Singh, Director, NCDC and other senior officials of the Union Health Ministry were present in the meeting. Bhupinder Bhalla, Additional Chief Secretary (Health), Delhi led the delegation of UT Health officials in the meeting, according to the statement.

01-11-2021||Mumbai||Nawab Malik tweets picture of Fadnavis’ wife with ‘drug peddler’; ex-CM says will expose minister's link with underworld||Maharashtra minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik on Monday sought to link the BJP with an alleged narcotics dealer by tweeting the latter's photograph with former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis' wife Amruta Fadnavis.Devendra Fadnavis, however, said Malik's tweet reflected his mentality and claimed that he would “burst a bomb” after Diwali by making revelations about the minister's “underworld links”, which he would also share with NCP president Sharad Pawar.In a series of tweets, Malik, who has been targeting the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) after it raided a cruise ship last month and claimed to have seized drugs on board, posted a photograph of Amruta Fadnavis with the alleged drug peddler.He also posted a similar photograph of Devendra Fadnavis with the alleged drug dealer.“Let's have a discussion of links between BJP and drug peddler,” Malik tweeted, referring to the photograph of Amruta Fadnavis with the person. In another tweet, the minister said the person was Jaideep Rana.Later, talking to reporters, Devendra Fadnavis said the creative team of River March, an organisation working for the conservation of rivers in Mumbai, had hired this person four years ago. Fadnavis was then the chief minister of the state.The former CM said he and his wife were associated with the cause of river rejuvenation.“The pictures were clicked during the shooting of a theme song. There are photos along with the team, not only with my wife, but also with me. But, Nawab Malik consciously shared the photograph of my wife. This reflects his mentality,” the leader of opposition in the state Assembly said.“Those people who have been photographed were brought by the 'River March' (organisation). They are not linked with me or my wife,” he said.Amruta Fadnavis, a banker by profession who also released her singing album in the past, has been a vocal critic of the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi in the state (comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress), and has often taken to Twitter to launch attacks on the state government."The cracker just before the Diwali was a damp squib and it gives the impression that Malik has made some big revelation,” Devendra Fadnavis said, referring to the photograph of his wife with the alleged drug peddler.“Those having links with the underworld and drugs should not talk to me. I will furnish all the proof after Diwali. Law will take its own course,” the senior BJP leader said.Just after the former CM's press conference, Malik tweeted, “We are ready.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nawab-malik-tweets-picture-of-fadnavis-wife-with-drug-peddler-ex-cm-says-will-expose-ministers-link-with-underworld-332848

Its vision is to transform the judicial system of the country by Information and Communication Technology (ICT) enablement of courts.

Understanding this, the Congress party has prepared a separate manifesto for women,” Vadra said in a tweet in Hindi.“On the formation of the Congress party’s government, three LPG cylinders will be given for free to women annually and women will be able to travel for free in state government buses,” she said.Priyanka Gandhi has also tagged a picture along with the tweet listing the Congress’ promises to the women if the party comes to power in the Uttar Pradesh.The assurances also included an honorarium of Rs 10,000 per month to ASHA and Anganwadi workers, appointment of women to 40 per cent posts according to the provisions of reservation, giving pension of Rs 1,000 to old widows, and opening of 75 skill schools across the state that will be named after the brave women (veerangnaao) of Uttar Pradesh.The Congress is facing an uphill task of consolidating its support base in Uttar Pradesh and Priyanka Gandhi is going all out to woo women in her election campaigns.The Congress general secretary had last month said all class 12 pass girls will be given a smartphone while all graduate girls will get an electric scooter if her party forms a government in the state.

However, no appearance is made on their behalf. We permit the counsel for the petitioners to intimate the standing counsel for the state of West Bengal as well as the West Bengal Pollution Control Board, if any, that the matter will be taken up at 3 pm through video-conference and to make themselves available with appropriate instructions,” the bench said.At the outset, the bench asked the counsel representing the petitioners whether they had served the advance copy of the pleas to the respondents.“Yes. We have served everyone through e-mail,” the counsel said.A lawyer, representing the petitioners on whose plea the high court had passed the October 29 order, said they are opposing the plea challenging the high court order.

With this new elevated corridor becoming functional from Monday, a total of 4.18-km-long flyover will become functional, connecting the Gota flyover till Sola Science City flyover, it said.People coming to the Gujarat High Court or the Sola Civil Hospital will benefit as they will directly get connected to it from National Highway no. 147 using this elevated corridor, the release said.The state government plans to convert the 44-km national highway from Sarkhej in Ahmedabad to Gandhinagar city and Chiloda (in Gandhinagar district) to a six-lane road with service roads on both the sides, at an investment of Rs 913 crore.Out of the total 13 flyovers to be constructed as part of the project, seven had become functional. The elevated corridor is the eighth to become functional with its inauguration on Monday.The remaining five flyovers are under-construction.

Will be joining the COP26 Summit, where I look forward to working with other world leaders on mitigating climate change and articulating India's efforts in this regard,” Modi said on Twitter soon after he landed here from the G20 Summit in Rome on Sunday night.Modi was received to the notes of Scottish bagpipes as he arrived at his hotel in Glasgow, where he was greeted by a large group of Indian diaspora representatives with chants of “Bharat Mata Ki Jai”.On Monday morning, he is scheduled to hold a meet with around 45 Indian diaspora representatives from Glasgow and Edinburgh, including prominent medics, academics and business people.He will also meet the Indian winner of Prince William's Earthshot Prize, Delhi-based recycling firm Takachar founder Vidyut Mohan, and 14-year-old prize finalist from Tamil Nadu Vinisha Umashankar, inventor of a solar-powered ironing cart.He will then proceed for the opening ceremony of day one of the World Leaders' Summit of the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, being held at the Scottish Event Campus in Glasgow.Modi's bilateral meeting with his British counterpart Boris Johnson is expected to take place soon after Monday's opening ceremony, which will include cultural performances and a speech by Johnson.Johnson has said the summit will be the "world's moment of truth" and has urged world leaders to make the most of it."The question everyone is asking is whether we seize this moment or let it slip away," he said, ahead of the two-week conference.According to official sources, the Johnson-Modi talks are expected to be quite brief and will focus on the UK-India climate partnership as well as a stock-take of the 2030 Roadmap for stronger UK-India Strategic Partnership – signed by the two leaders during a virtual summit in May this year.Modi is expected to reiterate his invitation for Johnson to visit India.“Both governments remain committed to the implementation of the Roadmap, within prescribed timelines. Accordingly, we are looking to launch negotiations in November 2021 for an Interim Agreement to be signed in March 2022 and eventually a comprehensive agreement, if all goes according to schedule, by November 2022,” India's High Commissioner to the UK, Gaitri Issar Kumar, said ahead of the prime ministerial talks.It would be the first in-person meeting between Modi and Johnson following the latter's twice-cancelled visit to India earlier this year due to the Covid pandemic.

01-11-2021||Ajay Banerjee||Key Indian post at 17K ft that China wants to occupy||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 31About four weeks ago when Indian and Chinese military patrol parties stood face to face against each other for hours along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Arunachal Pradesh, the bone of contention was control of a 17,000 feet high peak that provides commandeering view on both sides of the border.Strategic worthSources confirmed to The Tribune that the peak has been the target of the People’s Liberation Army of China.During the recent tension when the PLA made an attempt at an area called Yangtse, 35 km northeast of Tawang, its patrol parties came close to one of the access routes of the Indian Army to the top of the peak. The attempt was thwarted and the area is now under snow and will remain so till March.The location is of such strategic importance that the Indian Army and the PLA each have estimated 3,000-3,500 men on either side of Yangtse area. Unmanned aerial vehicles keep an eye and long-range sensors provide real-time images. Both sides have a network of roads and tracks along the LAC to counter patrol parties.The peak provides a commanding view of Tibet across the LAC. India is in firm control to the top and its access routes from own side. The Yangtse area is part of the wider area, which the military terms as ‘Mago-Chuna’. The Nuranang river meanders into India from Tibet close to the mountain spur where the peak is situated.Patrol parties come face to face several times in a year as both sides undertake patrolling activities up to their line of perception of the LAC (alignment of the LAC is disputed on ground). Whenever the patrols of both sides physically meet, the situation is managed according to established protocols and mechanisms agreed upon by both sides. One part of the protocol is unfurling a banner at each other, asking the rival side to return. “Physical engagement at any spot can last for a few hours prior to disengaging,” a source said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/key-indian-post-at-17k-ft-that-china-wants-to-occupy-332628

There are high expectations from Glasgow where speakers urged world leaders to fully implement the Paris pact and commit to more climate action to limit global warming to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.UK’s Alok Sharma, a British MP and the president of COP26, called on countries to work together, terming Glasgow summit the “last, best hope to keep 1.5°C in reach”. A glacier in Antarctica was also named after the summit.Things are not expected to go easy as developing countries like India want global climate action to be guided by principles and values of climate justice and equity.India, which will pitch for technology transfer and climate finance—two factors essential for level-playing field between developed and developing countries—today launched a tracking website to “build awareness, especially among the public of the global South, that climate action requires collective global action”.Built by private researchers, the website, “Climate Equity Monitor”, will monitor the performance of annex-I parties under the UNFCCC (developed countries) based on the foundational principles of the climate convention. The performance and policies of the non-annex-I parties (developing nations) will be also provided for comparison.“The website aims to debunk the narrative built by several developed countries and NGOs on what developing countries must do, constantly demanding greater commitment and action from them,” officials said.Welcoming the initiative, Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav said the website focusing on equity and climate action from data and evidence-based perspective would encourage a vigorous discussion on this crucial issue and engage experts from all countries.The monitor provides an online dashboard for assessing, at the international level, equity in climate action, inequalities in emissions, energy and resource consumption across the world and ongoing climate policies of several countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/climate-summit-begins-in-glasgow-332589

Only then the country will be able to attain its goals. Narendra Modi, PMIn an address to mark Sardar Patel’s birthday, celebrated as the National Unity Day, the PM said unity was the key to India’s development and everyone had a duty to contribute to national integrity.“The strong foundation of democracy, which has developed in India’s society and traditions over hundreds of years, has enriched the spirit of ‘one India’, but we also have to remember that every person sitting in the boat has to take care of the boat. If we remain united, only then will we be able to move forward, only then will the country be able to achieve its goals,” the PM said.He urged citizens to perform their “civic duties” saying that would be the most meaningful tribute to Sardar Patel. “India’s capability and determination on every front, water-land-sky-space, is unprecedented.

After independence, his contributions were never given due respect. He was neither given Bharat Ratna nor proper respect. Situation changed, as cloud cannot hide the sun forever. He was given Bharat Ratna and his statue, which is tallest in the world, is here before us to see.”Paying tributes to Patel on his 146th birth anniversary, which is celebrated as National Unity Day, Shah said the first Home Minister of the country gave a message to the world that nobody could destroy the unity and integrity of India.The Home Minister said Patel had thwarted British attempts to divide the country. “After Independence, while leaving, Britishers had conspired to divide the country. Sardar Patel foiled that conspiracy and resolved to make Akhand Bharat,” he added.Shah, who is also the Union Minister for Co-operation of the newly carved out ministry, at a separate function in Anand, Gujarat, later in the day recalled Sardar Patel’s contribution in the establishment of the Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union, which later came to be known as Amul.

Post-1962, we have had several skirmishes against the Chinese — at Nathu La in Sikkim in 1967, at Wangdung in 1986, at Doklam in 2017 and the recent skirmishes in the eastern Ladakh,” he noted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sardar-patel-wanted-independent-tibet-as-buffer-state-cds-bipin-rawat-332596
01-11-2021||Aditi Tandon||Only 30% of Covid orphan claims cleared by states so far||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, October 31Only three in 10 claims filed on the behalf of children orphaned by Covid-19 have been approved by state governments for central aid so far.Data procured by The Tribune from PM Cares portal that tracks the status of claims on a real-time basis reveals that as of October 29, district magistrates across India had approved only 1,306 of the 4,366 claims filed across 530 districts.This dismal approval rate of 29.9 per cent reflects that a large number of applications are either being rejected or are stuck at approval stage for want of authentication and proof.Under PM Cares for Children, state governments are mandated to conduct district magistrate-level verification of each claim received before sending it to the Centre for extending benefits to eligible children.The lowest rate of approval, as of now, is for Uttar Pradesh at 0.31 per cent and the highest is for Goa at 100 per cent. As of October 29, 314 claims had been filed on behalf of Covid orphans from UP’s 63 districts, but only one claim has been approved. Official sources said the authentication of claims was an ongoing process.In Goa, however, all five claims received from across the state have been approved and sent to the Women and Child Development Ministry for action. In J&K, 14 claims have been received but the child welfare committee has rejected three and not recommended any yet.Importantly, of the 4,366 claims received on the PM Cares portal so far, respective child welfare committees of 530 districts have recommended only 2,167 applications for district magistrate’s clearance. This means even the CWCs have approved only 49.6 per cent of the claims received so far.Official sources said while anyone could file an online claim for government support to a child orphaned by Covid, the applications required verifications. “A large number of applications failing to make it past the DM stage could also mean that not as many children have been orphaned by Covid as was anticipated. It could equally mean laxity on the part of district administrations and states to authenticate claims and fasten the process,” an official source said.Once approved by DMs, a claim would entitle an orphaned child to a range of Union Government benefits, including Rs 2,000 monthly stipend, which the Centre proposes to increase to Rs 4,000 soon; healthcare cover of Rs 5 lakh a year under PM Jan Aarogya Yojana; Rs 10 lakh once the child turns 23 and free education in a central government school in the child’s vicinity.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/only-30-of-covid-orphan-claims-cleared-by-states-so-far-332612
