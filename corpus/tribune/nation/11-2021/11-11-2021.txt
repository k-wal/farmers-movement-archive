11-11-2021||New Delhi||SC reserves its verdict on Char Dham Road Widening Project||The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its decision on widening of the 899-km Char Dham Road Project in Uttarakhand that hit headlines in view of clashes between Indian and Chinese armed forces on the Line of Actual Control (LAC).A Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud – which had earlier wondered if environmental concerns can override national security – asked the Centre and Citizens for Green Doon – an NGO that has challenged the widening of roads raising environmental issues—to file their written submissions in two days.Citing the Chinese military build-up on the other side of the LAC, Attorney General KK Venugopal said the court should allow widening of the road that would serve as feeder roads for the border roads.The ‘Char Dham’ highway project is to connect the four holiest places in Uttarakhand through 900-km all-weather roads.The Centre has contended that it will facilitate rapid deployment/movement of Armed Forces along India-China border which has witnessed face-offs at several points in recent times.“The Army will have to take Brahmos which is 42 feet long in case of a confrontation. How do we go if the roads are not wide enough?” Venugopal submitted.In view of a 2018 notification mandating a 5.5 metre limit for road width in hilly terrains, the Supreme Court had in September 2020 asked the government to comply with it in the Char Dham project.However, the government amended the notification in December 2020 and sought the top court’s permission to construct 10 metre wide roads.“All development has to be sustainable…But sustainable development has to be balanced with defence of the nation. We can’t deny the fact…We are really in a terrain and altitude where the defence of the nation is extremely important. Can we, therefore, say we will override the concerns of the armed forces or the defence?” it said on November 9.While hearing a PIL filed by Citizens for Green Doon challenging the Stage-I forest clearance and wildlife clearance granted for the improvement/expansion of roads under Char Dham Project, resulting in felling of trees in Dehradun, Justice Chandrachud had earlier underlined the limitations of judicial activism in such cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-reserves-its-verdict-on-char-dham-road-widening-project-336845

The rains also caused damage to roads and causeways.The flooding witnessed here for the past four days threw normal life out of gear as closed, inundated subways and traffic diversions gave people a harrowing time.With the passage of the depression on Thursday evening, there was a let up in rains in most northern Tamil Nadu regions and people could be seen visiting local markets to buy essentials after confining themselves to their homes for most part of the day.Till date in the ongoing monsoon season, 157 head of cattle have died, 1,146 huts and 237 houses have been affected in rain related incidents across the state.In view of water-logging, suburban train services saw suspensions and delay. The services, however, resumed later.In respect of flights, though departures continued suspended arrivals resumed as the depression faded. Chennai Corporation authorities distributed a total of over 6 lakh food packets to people in affected areas.Chennai and several other northern regions witnessed heavy rains since Wednesday night and the depression moved close towards the city today, with showers intensifying in several areas.Authorities used heavy duty motors, robotic excavators and deployed full manpower to pump out water, de-clog drains, remove trash and clear uprooted trees. As civic, revenue, public works, police and fire personnel slogged to help people and mitigate flood woes, Chief Minister M K Stalin said he bowed before all government workers involved in relief and rescue operations for their services to the people.“Your selfless services and sacrifice have removed the distress of crores of people,” the CM tweeted.The heavy rainfall covered almost the entire city under sheets of water including the downtown Mylapore and heavily inundated several parts of neighbourhoods including Velachery and rain water entered state-run hospitals in KK Nagar and Chromepet prompting authorities to shift patients to other facilities.Fearing damage, several residents of deluge-hit Ram Nagar in Madipakkam parked their cars on the nearby Velachery flyover’s margin or underneath similar facilities nearby.The bylanes of Pudupet, near the swollen Cooum River, Choolai, Semmancherry, Kodambambakkam, KK Nagar-MGR Nagar and Arumbakkam were among the innumerable neighbourhoods hit by the deluge.The streets around Hasthinapuram, close to suburban Chrompet resembled an angry speeding river, with water level raising over three-feet.Inundation in several places like the Five Furlong Road in Guindy-Velachary point was about three feet or a little over it.The inundation hit neighbouhoods like those off Mudichur, Perungalathur and Nandivaram-Guduvancherry appeared like mini islands with little access to essential needs and power supply was disconnected in all such areas considering safety.A woman who was riding a scooter on the road abutting Raj Bhavan was injured when a tree fell. She was rushed to a hospital by authorities and the fallen tree was removed.Besides Chennai and its suburbs which fall under the districts of Chengelpet, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram, other regions of the state including the northern belt too received heavy rainfall.Chief Minister Stalin held discussions with Ministers and chaired a meeting of top state officials led by Chief Secretary V Irai Anbu to review the rain situation.He directed officials specially deputed to manage rain-related issues in various districts to expedite the relief activities and ensure quality food and medical facilities in relief camps.The CM further wanted the authorities to take steps to prevent crop loss.Stalin also ordered constituting a six-member ministerial panel, headed by Cooperatives Minister I Periyasamy, to assess crop damage, especially in the Cauvery delta region, and submit a report to the government to expedite relief work, an official release said.The depression crossed north Tamil Nadu coast close to Chennai on Thursday evening.The rains began on November 6 night in TN and there was a let-up in many areas for a day.

RK Raghavan who headed SIT was made India’s High Commissioner to Cyprus,” he told the top court which was hearing Zakia’s petition challenging the Gujarat High Court’s October 5, 2017 order rejecting her plea against the decision of the SIT set up by the top court in 2008 to close the case.“The SIT was rendering conclusions contrary to facts they were aware of. In fact, SIT should be investigated. It is true...I am not concerned with individuals. I am concerned with the process. I am only saying SIT did not do its job. It was an act of protection. It did a collaborative exercise,” said Sibal.He demanded further investigation, saying “No judge can say there was no conspiracy. Who all were involved and why needed further probe.”He accused the SIT of ignoring call data records of senior police officials and mobs identifying houses of Muslims that alluded to a conspiracy. The SIT did not conduct any further probe into the matter and both the magistrate and the Gujarat High Court too overlooked it, he alleged.Sibal alleged that the CDR of then Ahmedabad Police Commissioner PC Pandey showed he was conversing with the accused and he later became the DGP of Gujarat. “The journey from accused to DGP is disconcerting,” he told the Bench. He also referred to some sting operations in support of his claims.The Bench – which had on October 26 said it would like to peruse the SIT giving a clean chit to 64 persons, including Modi, and the justification given by a magisterial court that accepted the closure report – would further take up the matter on November 16.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2002-gujarat-riots-those-who-collaborated-got-rehabilitated-alleges-sibal-336841

11-11-2021||New Delhi||Fight against Covid-19 at final stage, should not let our guard down: Mandaviya||Stating that the fight against Covid-19 is at the final stage, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday cautioned against letting the guard down before it is completely over and requested states to enhance the vaccination coverage and motivate the over 12 crore beneficiaries who are due for their second dose to take it.He also urged states and union territories to ensure the entire adult population is administered the first dose during the ongoing ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign.During a virtual interaction with the health ministers of states and union territories, Mandaviya observed that the fight against Covid-19 is at the final stage, a health ministry statement said.“The two weapons of vaccination and CAB (Covid-19-appropriate behaviour) will be our greatest defence against it and we should not let our guard down before it is completely over,” he said.The minister stated that at present 79 per cent of the adult population has got the first dose of vaccine and 38 per cent has also received the second dose.“Let us ensure collectively through collaborative and multi-stakeholder efforts that no eligible citizen is left without the ‘suraksha kawachh’ of Covid-19 vaccine in the country. Let us reach each corner and household across the country and motivate people to take both the doses under Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji’s ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign,” he said.He emphasised that while vaccination reduces the severity of the disease, adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour is of utmost important to ensure that the gains made collectively by the country so far are not frittered away and there is not any other surge of Covid-19 cases, according to the statement.The meeting also reviewed the public health measures for containment and management of Covid-19 in states and UTs.Noting that more than 12 crore beneficiaries are due for their second dose of Covid-19 vaccine, Mandaviya urged state health ministers to ensure they are motivated to take the second dose and all the adult population is covered with the first dose during the door-to-door campaign ongoing ‘Har Ghar Dastak’, according to the statement.Underlining that children can be the best ambassadors for behaviour change, he urged states and UTs to rope them in for taking forward the message of full vaccination. “Let the children motivate their parents and other family members to take both the vaccine doses,” he stated.Mandaviya reiterated Prime Minister Modi’s mop-up strategies for strengthening the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign, including deploying ‘Prachar Toli’ in advance to villages which would ensure mobilisation and counselling of the eligible population along with awareness campaigns, followed by the ‘Vaccination Toli’ which would ensure that all eligible citizens are vaccinated, the statement stated.A strategy of multiple vaccination teams to ensure 100 per cent coverage in the targeted area in a time-bound manner and development of a ranking mechanism for identifying and felicitating the vaccination teams which administer the maximum number of doses every 24 hours for motivated progress of the drive were stressed by Mandaviya, the statement said.He also laid emphasis on utilising weekly bazaars and haats for creating awareness and providing vaccination services, collaborating with local religious and community leaders, roping in civil society organisations, NGOs, etc. for motivating the unvaccinated in village/urban areas; multi-media awareness campaigns to effectively counter anti-vaccine rumours; and emulating innovative approaches and practices followed by high coverage districts.“Let us start Covid vaccination centres at bus stations, railway stations, etc., especially in large metros, as these are the primary points for a large number of people entering the city. Some states have started a ‘Roko and Toko’ campaign where the passengers alighting from buses, trains, rickshaws, etc., are motivated to take the vaccine doses,” he said.He also suggested that each day of the ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign can be dedicated to mobilisation and vaccination of different groups of beneficiaries. “One day can be dedicated for traders, hawkers, vendors, shopkeepers, etc., other days we can mobilise rickshaw-pullers and auto drivers. One day can be dedicated to labourers and farmers,” he added.The minister cautioned all states and UTs that Covid-19 was not over.“We shouldn’t think that Covid is over. Cases are rising globally. In Singapore, Britain, Russia and China cases are rising again despite more than 80 per cent vaccination. Vaccination and Covid-appropriate behaviour should go hand in hand,” he stressed.Health ministers Veena George (Kerala), Dhan Singh Rawat (Uttarakhand), Banna Gupta (Jharkhand), Lalthangliana (Mizoram), Mangal Pandey (Bihar), K Sudhakar (Karnataka), Rajesh Tope (Maharashtra), Prabhuram Choudhary (Madhya Pradesh), Jai Pratap Singh (Uttar Pradesh), Ma Subramanian (Tamil Nadu),  Vishwajit Rane (Goa), Rushikesh Ganeshbhai Patel (Gujarat), Keshab Mahanta (Assam), and Satyendar Jain (Delhi) were present at the meeting.Principal Secretaries/Additional Chief Secretaries/Mission Director (NHM) of all states were also present, the statement stated.The state health ministers expressed their gratitude to Mandaviya for the supply of vaccines, drugs, financial and technical resources for the Covid-19 management, according to the statement.They also shared the innovative steps being taken to ensure saturation of vaccination, especially in low-performing districts.Mandaviya thanked all states and UTs for their overwhelming support and urged them to emulate the best practices being undertaken by others, the statement said.

The fourth body, that of his son, was found in his car parked outside the police station in Mount Shasta.Police said at the time they believed Hangud killed his family during a week-long crime spree, murdering his wife and daughters over the course of three days.Hangud allegedly murdered his wife, his daughter and his youngest son on October 7 in their Roseville apartment at the Woodcreek West complex on Junction Boulevard.He later killed his older son, somewhere between Roseville and Mount Shasta, where he surrendered to police on October 13 with his son's body. The victims were identified as Jyothi Shankar, 46; Varum Shankar, 20; Gauri Hangud, 16; and Nischal Hangud, 13.Hangud was arrested shortly after the killings. He initially pleaded not guilty to the murders in 2019 but last month changed his plea, entering guilty pleas to three counts of first-degree murder for his three children and one count of deliberately aiding his wife in committing suicide, The Sacramento Bee newspaper reported.“The deaths of these young victims touched this community very deeply, and although there are no family members left to see justice served, many in our community remember the victims from school or from their neighbourhood,” Placer County Chief Assistant District Attorney David Tellman said in a statement.Prosecutors said Hangud claimed to be in despair after losing his IT job and dealing with a marriage that was falling apart.“It's hard to reconcile with the facts that this tragedy could happen because someone couldn't get employed. But it's an old-world, patriarchal thought pattern where if he can't be a provider, he doesn't want his family to have nothing. So he kills his family,” Tellman said.The district attorney's office said that because of the special circumstances of killing more than one person the Roseville father would get life in prison without the possibility of parole.

Reason being their lack of initiative and sincerity to further the cause of Bengal," Chatterjee tweeted.The West Bengal BJP, however, did not attach much importance to Chatterjee's decision and asserted that "it would hardly impact the party"."I really don't know whether she was with the party after the elections. It won't have an impact on the party," BJP state chief Sukanta Majumdar said.Echoing him, BJP leader Tathagata Roy, who has been training his guns on the party top brass for the election debacle, called Chatterjee's quitting the party a "good riddance".

People’s negative projections of Covaxin hurt the product. Politicians should take up different battles, not on the front of science,” Ella said at a television channel’s event today.Noting that he was happy India was the fourth country worldwide to manufacture a Covid vaccine, Ella said, “Negative perceptions about Covaxin delayed approvals and publication. But I am happy we finally won the game. Negativity also put WHO in an awkward position. WHO wanted to review Covaxin much more extensively. Covaxin was the only shot to go through so much WHO scrutiny.”Ella said although a million pregnant Indian women had received Covaxin and its safety among them is proven, the WHO had sought results of Covaxin safety among pregnant women in a clinical trial mode. The WHO is yet to approve Covaxin for pregnant women.“We will do the science, although the highest number of pregnant women worldwide has been vaccinated in India and a million of them are on Covaxin with proven safety,” he said.Ella also said Biotech was hoping for early emergency use approval to Covaxin for children aged 2 years and above. “We are the only global company to have developed a safe vaccine for children aged 2 years and above. Safety is established and subject experts have recommended approval. We hope the drug regulator will soon approve the shot as China is moving aggressively, having applied for approvals to a vaccine for 3 years and above. We need permissions not just for Indian children but also to remain globally competitive. I think supply level constraints are holding back approvals,” said Ella.On Biotech’s nasal Covid vaccine, he said phase-2 trials are complete and safety established. “In three months we hope to make progress. Nasal vaccine can serve as a booster as it would be easy to scale up,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/working-on-nasal-vaccine-as-booster-bharat-biotech-336608

We discussed a roadmap to ensure that the Congress returns to power in the next assembly elections.”“We also discussed the Congress’ good performance in the recently concluded assembly by-elections in the state,” he added.Maken, who is the general secretary in-charge of party affairs in Rajasthan, said there were a number of issues that were required to be discussed with the chief minister and the roadmap is now clear.The Cabinet expansion in Rajasthan is overdue as many in Gehlot’s rival camp are seeking accommodation in the Cabinet.Recently, former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Pilot too had met Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi to discuss his future as well the accommodation of some of his loyalists in Rajasthan Cabinet.The Congress managed to save the state government in Rajasthan after Pilot had rebelled against Gehlot last year over differences.

Because both sides have accepted it, it is become the right judgment, not the other way around. It’s not a right judgment, which both sides have accepted. Because both sides have accepted it, it has become the right judgment,” Chidambaram said.Noting that practices had acquired a new meaning Chidambaram said Nehru’s secularism was not the same to millions today as Nehru had conceived it to be.“Secularism has moved away from acceptance to tolerance and from tolerance to an uneasy coexistence. Unless we recognize what happened in the last 20 years, we won’t be true to what we believe India should be,” Chidambaram said lamenting that “we live in a world where lynching is not condemned by anyone in authority and certainly not the prime minister and Home minister.”The former finance minister said Babri Masjid demolition of December 6, 1992 was a terrible wrong and it was patronizing to ask 200 million people to reconcile.Speaking on the occasion former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh said temples in India had been vandalized “even before the advent of Islam.” “In history, vandalism of temples happened in India even before Islam came into the country. It did not start after Islam came. It used to happen whenever a king conquered another and wanted to establish his religion. But today it has been told that vandalism came with Islam and that is why they are responsible for it,” said Singh adding that Ram Janmabhoomi dispute was there since 1858 but VHP, Bajrang Dal and RSS never made it an issue.“It was after they were restricted to two seats in 1984 that they decided to make it a national issue,” said Singh.SAVARKAR HAD NO PROBLEM CONSUMING BEEFDigvijay Singh today said Hindutva had nothing to do with Hindu religion and Savarkar was not a religious man. “Savarkar had even said why is the cow considered ‘maata’. Savarkar had no problems in consuming beef. He brought Hindutva word to establish Hindu identity that caused confusion in people and that was propagated by the RSS,” said Singh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ayodhya-verdict-right-because-both-sides-accepted-it-chidambaram-336468

The WHO is yet to approve Covaxin for pregnant women.“We will do the science, although the highest number of pregnant women worldwide has been vaccinated in India and a million of them are on Covaxin with proven safety,” he said.Ella also said Biotech was hoping for early emergency use approval to Covaxin for children aged 2 years and above. “We are the only global company to have developed a safe vaccine for children aged 2 years and above. Safety is established and subject experts have recommended approval. We hope the drug regulator will soon approve the shot as China is moving aggressively, having applied for approvals to a vaccine for 3 years and above. We need permissions not just for Indian children but also to remain globally competitive. I think supply level constraints are holding back approvals,” said Ella.On Biotech’s nasal Covid vaccine, he said phase-2 trials are complete and safety established. “In three months we hope to make progress. Nasal vaccine can serve as a booster as it would be easy to scale up,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/6-months-after-2nd-covid-shot-best-time-for-booster-bharat-biotech-chief-krishna-ella-336456

11-11-2021||Lakhimpur (UP)||Lakhimpur Kheri violence: Weapon seized from Union minister’s son was fired, confirms FSL report||A forensic report has confirmed that weapons recovered from Union minister Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra and others after the Lakhimpur violence had been fired.Protesting farmers had alleged that Ashish Mishra had opened fire. Though the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report confirmed that the weapons had been discharged, it does not specify whether they were fired on the day of the violence or some other day.Four weapons, including a rifle belonging to Ashish Mishra alias Monu Mishra, had been seized following the Lakhimpur violence. A pistol owned by Ankit Das, nephew of former Union minister Akhilesh Das, and a repeater gun, which was with Das’ bodyguard Lateef Kale, were also among them.A forensic report of the fourth weapon, a revolver owned by Das’ aide Satya Prakash, is awaited.“Of the four weapons sent for ballistic examination to the FSL, it has been confirmed that firing took place from three, including Ashish Mishra’s rifle. However, the report did not confirm when the firing took place,” a senior official said here.The special investigation team (SIT) probing the case is yet to issue an official statement on the FSL report.After the arrest of Ashish Mishra, Das and Kale, the SIT had recovered their licensed weapons—a rifle, pistol, revolver and a repeater gun—and sent them for forensic examination on October 15.According to the First Information Report (FIR) registered by the police on a complaint of Jagjit Singh, a native of Bahraich district, the entire episode was “premeditated” for which the “conspiracy was hatched” by the minister and his son.The FIR stated that the farmers had gathered at the sports ground of the Maharaja Agrasen Inter-College on October 3 and they wanted to peacefully show black flags to Ashish Mishra and Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, who were visiting Banbirpur.“Around 3 pm, Ashish Mishra, along with 15-20 armed men, in three speeding four-wheelers, reached the protest spot in Banbirpur. Ashish Mishra, who was seated on the left side of a Mahindra Thar, opened gunfire. The Thar mowed down the crowd and sped ahead,” the FIR stated.“Because of the firing, farmer Gurvinder Singh, son of Sukhwinder, a resident of Matronia in Nanpara, died,” it stated.However, two successive autopsies conducted on Gurvinder Singh had ruled out bullet injuries.Ashish Mishra and 15-20 unnamed men were mentioned as accused and charged with murder, criminal conspiracy, rash driving, and rioting among others. Of them, police have so far arrested 13.Minister Ajay Mishra had refuted the allegations that his son was involved in the episode that took place near his native Banbirpur village in the Tikonia area of the district.The FIR has been lodged under Indian Penal Code sections 147, 148, 149 (all three related to rioting), 279 (rash driving), 338 (causes grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life), 304A (causing death by negligence), 302 (murder), and 120B (party to a criminal conspiracy).
