The Government of India, based on the recommendations of Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), fixes MSP for seed cotton (kapas).Later, Textiles Secretary U P Singh said, “Cotton Corporation does procurement by availing a loan from bank on interest. Therefore, it has been decided in today’s Cabinet that Rs 17,408 crore will be given to CCI so that it can fully repay its loan”.On cotton procurement for 2021-22, he said as of now the CCI does not see the need to purchase cotton as the prevailing market prices are higher than the minimum support price (MSP).He said the losses incurred by the CCI on cotton procurement were earlier pegged at Rs 7,464 crore and Rs 9,412 crore in 2020-21 and 2019-20, respectively.However, Singh added that the losses should be lower.The Secretary said a provision for payment of nearly half the amount has been made in the current financial year’s revised expenditure through supplementary grants while the remaining half will be provided for in the Budget 2022.“During the global pandemic in the last two cotton seasons (2019-20 & 2020-21), the CCI procured around 1/3rd of the cotton production in the country, i.e. about 200 lakh bales and disbursed more than Rs 55,000 crores directly in the bank account of around 40 lakh cotton farmers,” Singh said.The government extends full price support to the CCI for undertaking MSP operations in cotton, the ministry said in a release.For the current cotton season, the CCI has already made adequate arrangements in all 11 major cotton-growing states by opening 474 procurement centres in 143 districts, to meet any eventuality of MSP operations.The procurement of cotton at MSP helped stabilise the cotton prices and alleviate farmer’s distress. In another decision, the Cabinet approved reservation norms for Jute Packaging Materials for Jute Year 2021-22.As per the reservation norms, Thakur said, 100 per cent foodgrains and 20 per cent of sugar will be packed in jute bags during Jute Year 2021-22 under JPM Act, 1987.The decision is likely to bring relief to 3,70,000 workers employed in jute mills and ancillary units.

Every delegation was appreciative of the timing of the event and the opportunity to engage in frank and open discussions. Every country got opportunity to put across their views in a forthright manner. This is the only dialogue at the level of NSAs and there was complete unanimity on the need to continue this process and have regular consultations,” said sources here.They said there was extraordinary degree of convergence on the assessments of the situation in Afghanistan and the principal challenges in Afghanistan and the region.These included the security situation, heightened risk of terrorism and the impending humanitarian crisis. The NSAs noted the need to provide humanitarian assistance and emphasised that the land and air routes should be made available and no one should impede the process.The NSAs also reiterated the need to continue regular consultations among regional countries in this format.

It was unfortunate that the court was being called upon to examine and fill up vacancies in tribunals and if the government wasn’t inclined to continue with tribunals, it should abolish them, the top court had noted.On Wednesday, it said, “We remind the defaulting states that we will take stern action if reports are not submitted and Rs 2 lakh costs will be imposed on them. This will be recoverable from officers.”As amicus curiae Gopal Sankaranarayanan said some states had not filed status reports, the Bench said, “What is the status of reports? Time deadlines are not being adhered to and this throws hearing out of gear. We are not disciplining ourselves.”“Unless states are very keen to get notices of contempt, they should comply with the deadline,” it said, posting the matter for hearing after three weeks.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vacancies-in-consumer-commissions-sc-warns-states-of-contempt-rs-2-lakh-costs-336467

10-11-2021||New Delhi||Hardeep Singh Puri returns fire, calls Rahul Gandhi ‘jeb katra’||Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Wednesday responded to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s ‘pickpocket’ barb at the government over the levy of high taxes on petrol and diesel, and described him as a “jeb katra” who would not understand what capital expenditure is.Speaking at the Times Now Summit, Puri said he was ready to debate on economic progress and development under the Modi government.“How do you look at economic development, progress?... There has been record hike in capital expenditure. That is what is economic progress is,” he said responding to the question on Gandhi’s tweet of November 1 that cautioned against “pickpockets” as he charged the government of “profiteering” from record high fuel tax and “fleecing” common man.Gandhi tweeted “jebkatro se savdhan” (beware of pickpockets) before the government’s November 3 announcement of a Rs 5 per litre cut in excise duty on petrol and Rs 10 a litre reduction in the tax on diesel to bring down retail rates from their all-time high levels.Puri asked the anchor if she knew what ‘jeb katra’ means and said it means a pickpocket.The minister said he was willing to discuss the ‘scams’ associated with the UPA-era—from 2G scam to CWC—and also debate on the progress and development under the Modi government.Thereafter, he made the comment on record-high capital expenditure being done by the Modi government to boost the economy from the depths pandemic had thrown it in.“Par jeb katra ko kya pata hogo what capital expenditure is (but how will a pickpocket know what capital expenditure is),” he remarked.“Discourse on serious economic issues has to be responsible.”    On opposition charge of family jewels being sold in privatisation such as that of Air India, Puri said there are three types of foolish decisions—one is “sadharan” or ordinary, the other is “asadharan” or extraordinary and the third is “chakravarti-class’ or foolish.“Air India was a first-rate airline which was a world leader. An airline which was running well was nationalised and ruined,” he said alluding to the 1953 decision to nationalise an airline run by the Tata Group.He went on to refer to the nationalisation of Burmah Shell in 1976 to BPCL.“It was running well, making good profits. It was also nationalised.”          “Let us recognise ‘chakravarti-class murkh decision’ which is what they did to Air India,” he said. “And it is the Modi government which reversed it because of political commitment and some deft technical work by those involved in that.”     Puri said that he as the then minister for civil aviation did not have the capacity to go to the Finance Ministry every year with a begging bowl for an Rs 8,000 crore dole to keep the airline running.“The choice is not between disinvestment or no disinvestment, the choice is between disinvestment and closing Air India down,” he added.Puri said the record excise duty on petrol and diesel helped India navigate through very difficult times during the pandemic as it helped fund government schemes to provide free Covid vaccines, meals and cooking gas to millions.The government had levied record high excise duty on petrol and diesel during March-May 2020 when international oil prices had plummeted to multi-year lows and then reduced the tax only after relentless daily price increases took pump rates to all-time highs and the BJP suffered setbacks in assembly bypolls in states like Himachal Pradesh.He said the government of the day makes a determination of how much taxes are levied.But this time around, the pandemic made the difference as the economy had never been completely shut down in the past to save lives, he said.Because of the higher taxes on petrol and diesel, “we were able to meet the extra requirement of the pandemic”, he said.The higher accruals from the tax on petrol and diesel helped meet the cost of providing free vaccines, providing free meals to 90 crore people for one full year and supply free cooking gas LPG refills to 8 crore poor beneficiaries of Ujjwala scheme, he said.“All this and much more with that Rs 32 a litre excise duty (levied by the central government),” he asserted.The money collected from taxes also goes into building roads, constructing houses for the poor and other social welfare schemes.“We were able to navigate through very difficult times,” he said.The government last week cut excise duty on petrol by Rs 5 per litre and that on diesel by Rs 10 to cool retail rates which had touched an all-time high across the country.More than two-dozen states have cut sales tax or VAT to provide further relief to consumers.The decision to cut excise duty came as petrol and diesel consumption reached pre-Covid levels, giving confidence to the government that its revenues will not be eroded. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hardeep-singh-puri-returns-fire-calls-rahul-gandhi-jeb-katra-336444

Also, the Congress membership drive is commencing from November 1. We expect all to register themselves as Congress members too. Those who are participating in this abhiyan will get an opportunity to become the member of the Congress Party also,” Congress general secretary KC Venugopal said today, announcing the 515-day Jan Jagran Abhiyan in which party leaders will need to undertake foot marches on seven days to connect to the masses.Chairman of the Congress’ newly formed agitation plan committee and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Digvijay Singh today said, “The party felt that common people are not associating with its campaigns the way they should. Our programmes are attended mostly by Congress workers. That is why Congress president formed a committee for sustained agitations. For this we need trainers. A four-day training programme will be held at Wardha from November 12 to 15 and exclusively for the Jan Jagran Abhiyan on November 14,” Digvijay said.The veteran made it clear that the plan would require Congress leaders to engage people in intimate discussions and there would be no public meetings.“Congress leaders should hold pad yatras on seven days of the programme and spend the night at the place where they are marching,” Singh said.The Congress confirmed the participation of Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Vadra in the programme but did not say where they would be.The programme will be held across India, with several Congress workers to be trained on “how to connect to the masses on the economic challenges the country is facing.”“Those who are trained will need to the message of inflation to the people. We have prepared a pamphlet where people will be asked to answer questions,” Singh said, as the Congress gears to energise cadres ahead of the membership drive which will last from November 1 to March 31 next. The membership will be followed by the Congress organisational polls.Asked why, like the RSS, the Congress had decided to hold “prabhat pheris” between 6 and 7 AM daily during the agitation, Digvijay Singh quipped, “For God’s sake, don’t compare the two.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/soon-give-a-missed-call-to-become-a-congress-member-336443

He tried to strangulate himself with a string on the (jacket) hood that he tied to the tap of the toilet. When he did not return for some time, the policemen went inside and found him unconscious. He was rushed to the community health centre, Ashok Nagar in Kasganj, where he died,” the SP said.Postmortem of the victim is being conducted, he said.“The lax policemen will be punished. We have suspended five policemen in this connection,” he said.The victim’s kin, however, alleged that he was killed by the policemen.The Samajwadi Party took to Twitter to attack the Yogi Adityanath government, calling the incident another misdeed of UP’s “thoko (trigger-happy) police”.“In UP, under the patronage of the chief minister, criminal and police are committing an encounter of law and order.

You get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it!” it read.On Tuesday, Malik had said he would drop a “hydrogen bomb” and reveal Fadnavis’ alleged underworld links, while the latter alleged that there was a dubious land deal involving the NCP leader, his family members and two convicts of the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case. The minister had refuted the allegations.On Wednesday, Malik said while fake notes were seized in other states after demonetisation in 2016, there was not a single such instance in Maharashtra, where Fadnavis was the chief minister.On October 8, 2017, the Department of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) seized fake notes worth Rs 14.56 crore from the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) in Mumbai, he said.“But Fadnavis helped sweep the case under the carpet. The seized amount was later shown with a value of Rs 8.8 lakh,” Malik alleged, questioning why the case was not handed over to the National Investigation Agency.“Incidentally, Sameer Wankhede (the Narcotics Control Bureau officer against whom Malik has levelled several allegations) was the DRI’s joint director at that time,” he added.The NCP leader further said that Imran Alam Sheikh was arrested in the case, and later his brother Haji Arafat Sheikh was made chairman of the state minority commission.Fadnavis appointed people with criminal background to several state boards, he said, claiming that Munna Yadav from Nagpur was made chairman of the Maharashtra Construction Workers Welfare Board even though criminal cases like murder were registered against him.Fadnavis also sheltered an individual whose second wife was a Bangladeshi and when the Malad police tried to investigate the case, they were pressured,  he alleged.Malik and Fadnavis have been targeting each other with charges of underworld links. Both have denied any links with the underworld.Malik had last week sought to link the BJP leader with an alleged narcotics dealer by tweeting the latter’s photograph with the former chief minister and his wife.While Fadnavis himself did not reply to Malik’s allegations on Wednesday, BJP leader and former state minister Ashish Shelar defended the appointments questioned by Malik.“It is true that Haji Arafat, Haji Haider and Munna Yadav were appointed to some government boards...Haji Arafat and Haji Haider’s appointments were cleared after the inquiry reports against them came out clean,” he said.As to the allegation against Munna Yadav, he himself will clarify, Shelar added.Shelar also asked why the present government had not taken any action against these leaders if they were involved in wrongdoing.“Malik is tarnishing the image of all the budding minority leaders in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra,” the BJP leader claimed.Amruta Fadnavis, meanwhile, tweeted in verse in Hindi, referring to “Bigade Nawab” (spoilt prince), an apparent swipe at Nawab Malik.“He held press conference after press conference but only spoke lies, and his sole objective is to save his “black wealth” and “son-in-law”, she said.Malik’s son-in-law Sameer Khan was recently granted bail by a court  here citing lack of evidence, months after the NCB arrested him in an alleged drugs case.

Although right to fair trial of the respondents/accused was not infringed, since all documents relied upon by petitioner (CBI) were provided to the respondents/accused,” it had said.The agency contended that the very essence of trial is to unearth the truth for which the court cannot assist the accused in search of a plausible defence.The high court had on May 18 stayed trial proceedings in the case involving Chidambaram and his son.

Although the absence of clear evidence was consistent with human-to-human transmission still being possible, the nuance was not sufficiently clear,” the analysis says, holding out lessons for the future.Importantly, on January 22–23, 2020, the IHR Emergency Committee was convened to consider whether to advise the WHO Director-General that the outbreak constituted a PHEIC.Although confirming “human-to-human transmission is occurring”, the emergency committee said several members considered that it was too early to declare a PHEIC and did not recommend that determination.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lancet-report-blames-late-who-response-for-rapid-covid-spread-336045

The five problems on which they will try to find common ground are: Terrorism, radicalisation, cross-border movement, drug trafficking and vast amount of military weapons left behind by the western forces. Doval’s meeting with Tajik NSA Nasrullo Mahmudzoda was significant as people of his ethnicity account for over a quarter of the Afghan population. The Tajik majority areas in Afghanistan include the restive Panjshir province whose rebel leaders Amrullah Saleh and Ahmad Masood had tried to put up a fight against the Taliban.“There was a detailed exchange of views on Afghanistan, with significant convergence of assessments. Concerns were expressed on the sharp increase in terrorist threats. The Tajik side highlighted the gravity of the situation in Afghanistan,’’ sources said about the meeting.On the bilateral side, discussions took place on deepening cooperation in areas like defence, border management and border infrastructure development. Doval also met the Uzbek NSA Victor Makhmudov to especially discuss the problem of extremism. Uzbeks account for 9% of the Afghan population and anti-Taliban leaders such as Abdul Rashid Dostum and Rasul Pahlawan are from this stock. “Both sides emphasised the need for neighbours to ensure unhindered access of humanitarian assistance to Afghans. They felt that the legitimacy of any Afghan government within Afghanistan was important before the issue of its international recognition,” said the sources.Pakistan had cried off from the meeting when the idea was initially broached, the Chinese said “scheduling reasons made it inconvenient’’ for its representative to attend the Delhi Regional Security Dialogue.This means that the dialogue, to be chaired by Doval, will be attended by top security officials of Russia, Iran and all five Central Asian countries — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. All the NSAs are slated to call on Narendra Modi on Wednesday before the meeting that will have simultaneous translation in Russian and Persian.Incidentally, around the same time, Taliban acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi will be in Islamabad to reciprocate Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s visit to Kabul last month.Meanwhile, new US Special Representative for Afghanistan Tom West will be soon visiting India, Russia and Pakistan to discuss the way forward on Afghanistan.5 key points on agenda||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ajit-doval-meets-uzbek-tajik-nsas-ahead-of-afghanistan-meet-in-delhi-today-336056

Concerns were expressed on the sharp increase in terrorist threats from. Tajik side highlighted gravity of situation in Afghanistan,” sources said about the meeting.On the bilateral side, discussions took place on deepening cooperation in areas like defence, border management and border infrastructure development.Doval also met the Uzbek NSA Victor Makhmudov to especially discuss the problem of extremism. Uzbeks account for nine per cent of Afghan population and anti-Taliban leaders such as Abdul Rashid Dostum and Rasul Pahlawan are from this stock.“Both sides emphasised the need for neighbours to ensure unhindered access of humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan. They felt that the legitimacy of any Afghan government within Afghanistan was important before the issue of its international recognition,” said the sources.Pakistan had cried off from the meeting when the idea was initially broached, the Chinese said “scheduling reasons made it inconvenient” for its representative to attend the ‘Delhi Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan’.This means that the Dialogue, to be chaired by NSA Doval, will be attended by top security officials of Russia, Iran and all five Central Asian countries—Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. All the NSAs are slated to call on PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday before sitting down for the meeting that will have simultaneous translation in Russian and Persian.Incidentally, around the same time, Taliban Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi will be in Islamabad to reciprocate Shah Mehmood Qureshi’s visit to Kabul last month. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has also met Taliban Acting Deputy Prime Minister Mullah Baradar twice though not in Kabul. New US Afghan envoy to visit IndiaThe new US Special Representative for Afghanistan Tom West will visit India, Russia and Pakistan to discuss the way forward on Afghanistan. West is currently in Brussels discussing the issue with NATO and EU leaders and said he would be in Pakistan “later this week”.US State Department spokesperson Ned Price indicated the agenda when he said at a briefing, “Together with our partners, he will continue to make clear the expectations that we have of the Taliban and of any future Afghanistan government.”The US, as is India, wants the government in Kabul to include other ethnicities such as Uzbeks, Tajiks, Hazaras and Turkmen; make firm promises to check trans-national radicalism and give due place to women in society. “The international community must act together to be effective,” West said before leaving for the tour.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/on-eve-of-regional-nsas-conference-ajit-doval-meets-uzbek-tajik-counterparts-336006

10-11-2021||---||Fadnavis accuses Malik of striking property deal with Mumbai blast convict and Haseena Parkar’s front man||New Delhi, November 9In a major twist in the Mumbai potboiler, Leader of the Opposition in Maharashtra Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday accused NCP minister Nawab Malik of striking a property deal with 1993 Mumbai bomb blast convict Sardar Shah Wali Khan and Mohd Salim Ishaq Patel, a front man of Haseena Parkar, Dawood Ibrahim’s sister.The former Maharashtra CM told media in Mumbai that “a prime property of 2.80 acre was brought by Solidus Investment Private Limited for a meagre Rs 30 lakh. The signatory of the deal transacted was Faraz Malik, son of Nawab Malik.“Nawab Malik held a high post in the company but had resigned before becoming minister in 2019. His wife Mehjbeen Nawab Malik and son Aamir Malik, are the directors of the company,” he said.The NCP minister, who has refuted all allegations and termed the transactions legal, said he will “expose the underworld links of Fadnavis” tomorrow. “I will drop a hydrogen bomb tomorrow in connection with Devendra Fadnavis. I will expose his underworld links,” Malik was quoted as saying.“Devendra Fadnavis is trying to malign my image by connecting me to blast convicts and the underworld. They did the same by saying that drugs were recovered from my place... I will sent him a legal notice,” he added.According to Fadnavis, after the property deal and registration, Maliks paid Rs 15 lakh to Sardar Shah Wali Ali Khan and Rs 5 lakh to Mohd Salim Ishaq Patel. Although the deal was of Rs 30 lakh, the actual payment transacted was only Rs 20 lakh. The property whose market rate was Rs 8,500 per square metre was purchased by Maliks for as little as Rs 25 per square metre.“Sardar Shah Wali Khan was convicted in 2007 by Tada Court for Life Imprisonment in 1993 Mumbai Bomb Blast. The Supreme Court confirmed the said sentence in 2013“Mohd Patel alias Salim Patel was a front man of Haseena Parker. He was arrested in 2007 with Haseena Parkar in land grabbing and other fraud issues. Solidus Investment is Nawab Malik’s company and land was purchased from these underworld criminals,” Fadnavis claimed questioning the NCP minister why he purchases land from “criminals of Mumbai”.Stating that he bought the property from original owners, Malik said a watchman of erstwhile owners named Khan managed to create rights on a 300-sq-m plot. “I paid money to get these rights surrendered and ensure that he vacated that plot. Everything was done in a legal way and I have all necessary papers to prove this transaction,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fadnavis-accuses-malik-of-striking-property-deal-with-mumbai-blast-convict-and-haseena-parkars-front-man-335983

This happened during 2007-12,” Patra said.Patra referred the alleged middleman in the deal, Sushen Gupta, adding that he was also involved in the Augusta Westland deal for VVIP choppers. “It is too much of a coincidence and too much of a coincidence is a conspiracy,” he said.“The INC (Indian National Congress) stands for I need commission...During the UPA tenure, there was a deal within every deal,” he also alleged.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-accuses-upa-government-of-irregularities-in-the-rafale-fighter-jets-deal-cites-a-french-online-journals-report-335974

10-11-2021||New Delhi||Rafale deal: Congress demands JPC probe, alleges cover-up by Modi Government||The Congress on Tuesday accused the Modi government of trying to “cover-up” corruption in the Rafale fighter jet deal and demanded a JPC probe into it, asking why it did not investigate the role of a middleman despite recovering incriminating documents from him.The remarks came after French investigative portal Mediapart in fresh revelations alleged bogus invoices were used that enabled French aircraft maker Dassault Aviation to pay at least 7.5 million euros in secret commissions to a middleman to help it secure the Rafale deal with India.The report claimed that commissions were paid between 2007 and 2012 for securing the Rafale deal with India.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi told party leaders to not stop or be afraid of fighting against the “corrupt” central government as the truth was with them at every step.“When the truth is with you in every step, then what is there to worry about? My Congress colleagues - keep fighting like this against the corrupt central government. Don’t stop, don’t get tired, don’t be afraid,” Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi, using the hashtag “#RafaleScam”.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera also alleged that the BJP government has sacrificed national security, jeopardised the interests of the Indian Air Force and caused loss worth thousands of crores of rupees to the state exchequer.French investigative journal Mediapart in fresh revelations in a report has exposed how middleman Sushen Gupta got hold of confidential documents belonging to the Indian Negotiating Team (INT) in 2015 from the ministry of defence and bribe was paid in lieu, he said.The documents detailed the stance of Indian negotiators during the final lap of negotiation and in particular how they calculated the price of the aircraft. This gave clear advantage to Dassault Aviation (Rafale), Khera claimed, citing the Mediapart report.“The ‘operation cover-up’ by the Modi government to bury the melting pot of corruption, kickbacks and collusion in the Rafale deal is once again exposed,” he said.“The BJP government undermined national security, jeopardised the interests of the Indian Air Force and caused loss worth thousands of crores to our exchequer,” Khera said at a press conference.Citing the French media report, the BJP on Tuesday said the INC (Indian National Congress) should be renamed as “I Need Commission” and alleged that the Congress’ dissatisfaction with the cut that was offered was behind the failed negotiations when it was in power.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra launched a scathing attack on the Congress leadership, especially Rahul Gandhi who has been alleging corruption in the purchase of the fighter aircraft by the Modi government, and accused him of spreading “canard, disinformation and lies”.Patra also sought Rahul Gandhi’s response to the fresh revelation by French investigative journal Mediapart, alleging that he should respond from Italy, since he is currently not in India as per reports.Congress leader K C Venugopal said the only answer to the charges is to conduct a JPC inquiry into the Rafale issue.“If kickbacks have been given, then there has to be an inquiry. Why are you running away from the inquiry? It is very clear that there is a need for a JPC inquiry for which we are asking the government,” he said.Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said despite all evidence, why did the government agencies not investigate corruption in Rafale.“Not just parts of the deal, the entire deal is suspect,” he alleged.Khera alleged that a note of June 24, 2014, sent to Dassault by Gupta, offering a meeting with “the political high command” was also recovered and asked if such a meeting had taken place with the “high command” in the Modi government.He alleged that each revelation in the “murky affair in the last five years, every single allegation and each piece of the puzzle leads right up to the topmost leadership of the country- the prime minister’s doorstep”.The Congress leader asked whether it is not correct that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) recovered “secret defence ministry documents” from the middlemen in a raid conducted on March 26, 2019.“This is nothing short of endangering national security, sedition and a gross violation of Official’s Secrets Act,” he alleged.“Why did the ED not pursue this evidence further to investigate the scam? Why did the Modi government then not take action against Dassault, the political executive or the defence ministry officers who leaked the documents? Which ‘Chowkidar’ sold India’s national secrets,” Khera asked.“Why was the deletion of anti-corruption clauses approved by the prime minister and the Modi government in September 2016, despite the defence ministry’s insistence upon including it in the inter-governmental agreement in July 2015,” Khera asked.Khera claimed that on October 4, 2018, two former BJP Union ministers Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie and a senior lawyer submitted a complaint to the director of the CBI citing massive corruption in the Rafale deal.But, on October 23, 2018, CBI Director Alok Verma was removed in a “midnight coup” after the CBI headquarters was raided by the Delhi Police, Khera said, alleging that this was part of a concerted conspiracy to bury the Rafale ghost through the CBI.“Why has the Modi government and the CBI not acted upon the evidence of commission and corruption for the last 36 months? Why has it been buried? Why did the Modi government remove the CBI Chief in a midnight coup,” the Congress leader asked.Khera said the Supreme Court has never said no to a JPC.“We have been demanding JPC. Now, we want this truth to come out...  Why isn’t the BJP asking for a JPC?” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rafale-deal-congress-demands-jpc-probe-alleges-cover-up-by-modi-government-335958

From 22 November travellers fully vaccinated with a COVID19 vaccine recognised by WHO for Emergency Use Listing, including Covaxin, will not have to self-isolate; so joining those fully vaccinated with Covishield," Alex Ellis, British High Commissioner to India, said on Twitter on Monday.The changes will come into effect at 4 am on November 22.Besides Covaxin, China's Sinovac and Sinopharm, both on the WHO Emergency Use Listing, will be recognised by the UK government as approved vaccines for inbound travel, benefiting fully vaccinated people from the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia. These fully vaccinated passengers will not be required to take a pre-departure test, day-8 test or self-isolate upon arrival."As we continue to recover from the pandemic and expand our recognition of international vaccines, today's announcements mark the next step in our restart of international travel," said UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps.
