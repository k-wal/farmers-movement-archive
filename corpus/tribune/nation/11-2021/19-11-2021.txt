He has shown remarkable statesmanship,” he said.Several BJP leaders also quoted a part of Modi’s address to the nation to suggest that his decision to scrap the laws, dubbed as a defeat for the government, was driven by national interest.Quoting last Sikh Guru Gobind Singh, Modi had wished that he never back down from doing good work and said whatever he is doing is for the country.“Whatever I did, I did for the farmers and whatever I am doing, I am doing for the country. With your blessings, there was no deficiency in my hard work even earlier. Today I assure you that I will work harder now so that your dreams can come true, the dreams of the country can come true,” the prime minister said.Shah tweeted, “PM Narendra Modi announcement relating to the farm laws is a welcome and statesmanlike move. As the Prime Minister pointed out in his address, the Government of India will keep serving our farmers and always support them in their endeavours.”      The prime minister has shown remarkable statesmanship, he said.Welcoming the announcement, BJP president J P Nadda noted that it was made on the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak.Modi has shown that he has immense care for farmers, and this decision will further the atmosphere of brotherhood across the nation, he said.Another senior party leader and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said Modi took the big decision in farmers’ interests and to respect their sentiments.The decision shows his sensitivity towards farmers’ welfare, he added.

Kagzi said in his letter that college vice-principal RN Sharma was behind the incident to stop students from offering namaz in a corner of a parking lot. He sought appropriate action against Sharma.“University syndicate member and MLA Amin Kagzi is making efforts to spread religious enmity over the namaz offering incident in the college,” Devnani said, adding that such actions pollute educational institutions with “fundamentalist thinking”. “He should be suspended from the syndicate with immediate effect,” Devnani tweeted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-congress-mla-demands-action-against-college-vice-principal-for-stopping-student-from-offering-namaz-340308

Service of ready-to-eat meals will also continue,” the letter stated.While it is not clear when this service will be restored, sources indicated that the work of issuing new tenders for licensees to serve food on board trains has already begun. The menu, sources said, is likely to remain unchanged.In the pre-Covid times, the Railways used to serve 11 lakh meals daily.Earlier this month, the Railways had announced the running of normal trains, withdrawing the special tag which had been in place for the pandemic.With winter approaching, concerns have been raised by passengers over the availability of bedrolls on trains, which too had been discontinued due to Covid-19. Officials said that as of now, no decision has been taken on the resumption of this service.The Railways’ decision to resume serving cooked food on trains also comes days after the Ministry of Civil Aviation allowed airlines to serve meals on all domestic flights. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/railway-board-issues-order-to-resume-serving-cooked-meals-to-passengers-on-trains-340306

Approximately 1 kg of gold was recovered from each of the 80 imported electroplating machines, said an official news release.In a follow-up operation, the DRI seized 5.409 kg of foreign-origin gold from a Delhi-based jeweller in which the smuggled gold in the form of laminates was converted into bars.Further search operations led to several rented properties in Chattarpur and Gurgaon where this conversion was done and four foreigners were allegedly found to be the masterminds of the conversion technique. The recovered gold, weighing 85.535 kg, valued at approximately Rs. 42 crore, has been seized.During questioning, two of the foreigners said they had struck up a close relationship while being behind bars for previous offenses of gold smuggling.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/operation-molten-metal-dri-seizes-85-5-kg-gold-arrests-4-foreign-nationals-340296
19-11-2021||New Delhi||Failed to explain benefits of farm laws to some farmer groups: Agriculture Minister Tomar||Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Friday welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to repeal the three farm laws but expressed regret that the government was unsuccessful in convincing some farmer groups about the benefits of the laws.Noting that the latest decision is much appreciated, Tomar said it is also a reflection of the prime minister’s reverence and spirit of brotherhood as today also happens to be Guru Nanak Jayanti.The prime minister has always kept the nation’s interest and public sentiment above everything else and the decision also shows his large heartedness, Tomar said in a series of tweets.Apart from repealing the laws, Modi also announced setting up a committee to make Minimum Support Price (MSP) system more effective and transparent as well as suggest ways to promote zero budgeting based-agriculture.The formation of the committee is also a sign of the prime minister’s long-term vision towards agriculture as well as his sensitivities towards farmers, Tomar said.In a video message, the agriculture minister said the government wanted to remove restrictions being faced by the farming community by bringing three new farm laws.These laws, which were passed by Parliament last year, would have definitely benefited farmers, he said and added that the prime minister’s intention behind these laws was to bring a “revolutionary change” in the lives of farmers.“I am sad that we were not successful in convincing some farmers about the benefit of these laws,” Tomar said.The prime minister always tried to bring changes in the farm sector through these laws. But such situation arose that some farmers found problems in these laws. The government adopted the path of dialogue to discuss logically, he noted.“We tried to convince but we’re not successful,” the minister said, adding that the government has been committed to agriculture and farmers welfare since last seven years.Tomar also highlighted various schemes and programmes launched since 2014 for the agriculture sector.The government has decided to fix the MSP at least 1.5 times of the cost of production and procurement has doubled, he said.To support small farmers income, the government has launched the PM-KISAN scheme under which Rs 1.62 lakh crore has been disbursed to farmers so far.Crop loan has been doubled in last seven years, while the kisan credit card coverage has also been expanded. About Rs 1 lakh crore infrastructure fund has also been established, he added.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act is aimed at giving freedom to farmers to sell their produce outside the mandis. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act is to provide farmers the right to enter into a contract with agribusiness firms, processors, wholesalers, exporters, or large retailers for the sale of future farming produce at a pre-agreed price.The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act was implemented to remove commodities like cereals, pulses, oilseeds, onion, and potatoes from the list of essential commodities and also do away with the imposition of stock holding limits on such items except under ‘extraordinary circumstances’.Now, the government has decided to repeal these three laws during the winter session of Parliament scheduled to start from November 29.

19-11-2021||Amaravati||TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu breaks down, vows to stay away from Assembly||A sobbing Telugu Desam president N Chandrababu Naidu on Friday vowed to step into the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly again only after returning to power.“Till then, we will go to the people and sort it out,” he told a press conference at the TDP headquarters here.The former Chief Minister, who hitherto had rarely shown any emotions overtly, broke down in the press conference and cried for a while, alleging that the ruling YSR Congress had been humiliating him no end.“This is a dharma poratam (just battle) against the atrocious rule of the YSRC. I will go to the people and seek their support. If people co-operate, I will strive to save the state,” the TDP chief said.Earlier in the state Legislative Assembly, the Leader of the Opposition said in an emotion-filled tone that the Jagan Mohan Reddy-led party had been continuously casting a slur on him for the past two-and-a-half years.“I have been bearing the insults for the sake of people, but remained calm. Today they have targeted even my wife. I always lived with honour and for honour. I can take it no more,” Chandrababu said.Though he continued to speak, Speaker Tammineni Seetaram cut the mike even as the ruling party members called Chandrababu’s remarks a “drama”.The former Chief Minister vent his frustration following an acrimonious exchange of words between the two sides in the House during a short discussion on the farm sector.Later, he held an impromptu meeting with his party legislators in his chamber, where he reportedly broke down.Stunned TDP legislators consoled Chandrababu, after which they all came back into the House.Chandrababu then announced his decision, but that did not go on record, even as he left in a huff.Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, who later came into the House, said the Opposition leader’s behaviour and words were nothing but a drama.“Chandrababu only seeks to derive political mileage out of everything. It is very unfortunate. His drama was visible to all eyes, though I was not inside the House at the time,” Jagan observed.“Yes, Chandrababu Naidu’s condition, and that he is in frustration, is known not only to me, but also to everyone in the state. People of the state have openly rejected him. Even in his own Kuppam constituency, he, unimaginably, faced people’s rejection,” the Chief Minister remarked.He said the YSRC legislators did not speak anything about the (Opposition leader’s) family members.“It was Chandrababu himself who spoke about my family members (slain uncle, mother and sister) and there was no reference to his family from our side. The House records clearly prove that,” Jagan added.But Chandrababu himself over-reacted and became emotional. “Not only that, he went on to take a vow. We all have seen that. But ultimately, God will be observing all this from above,” the Chief Minister said.

19-11-2021||Singapore||India-China ties going through ‘bad patch’; Beijing has ‘no explanation’ on violation of agreements: Jaishankar||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Friday that India and China are going through a “particularly bad patch” in their ties because Beijing has taken a set of actions in violation of agreements for which it still doesn’t have a “credible explanation” and it is for the Chinese leadership to answer where they want to take the bilateral relationship.India has told China that progress in the disengagement process in eastern Ladakh was essential for the restoration of peace and tranquillity and that it is the basis for the development of overall bilateral ties.During his previous meeting with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Tajikistan’s capital Dushanbe on September 16, Jaishankar emphasised that the two sides should work towards early resolution of the remaining issues along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh while fully abiding by bilateral agreements and protocols.“I don’t think the Chinese have any doubt on where we stand on our relationship and what’s not gone right with it. I’ve been meeting my counterpart Wang Yi a number of times. As you would’ve experienced, I speak fairly clear, reasonably understandably (and) there is no lack of clarity so if they want to hear it, I am sure they would have heard it,” Jaishankar said in response to a question at a panel discussion on “Greater Power Competition: The Emerging World Order” at the Bloomberg New Economic Forum in Singapore.“We are going through a particularly bad patch in our relationship because they have taken a set of actions in violation of agreements for which they still don’t have a credible explanation and that indicates some rethink about where they want to take our relationship, but that’s for them to answer,” he further said, in an apparent reference to the eastern Ladakh border clash with China.The eastern Ladakh border standoff between the Indian and Chinese militaries erupted on May 5 last year following a violent clash in the Pangong Lake areas and both sides gradually enhanced their deployment by rushing in tens of thousands of soldiers as well as heavy weaponry.The tension escalated following a deadly clash in the Galwan Valley on June 15 last year.As a result of a series of military and diplomatic talks, the two sides completed the disengagement process in the north and south banks of the Pangong Lake in February and in the Gogra area in August. The last round of military talks on October 10 to end the standoff in the remaining friction points along the LAC in eastern Ladakh ended in a stalemate.Meanwhile, on Thursday the two sides agreed to hold the 14th round of military talks at an early date to achieve the objective of complete disengagement in remaining friction points along the LAC in eastern Ladakh.Jaishankar also dismissed as “ridiculous” the notion that the United States has been strategically contracting and yielding space to others amidst a global rebalancing of power.He said that the US is today, a much more flexible partner, much more open to ideas, suggestions, and working arrangements than in the past.“Don’t confuse it with the decline of the United States. I think that’s ridiculous,” he said in response to a question from the moderator at the session, also attended by former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.“It’s clear China has been expanding. But the nature of China, the manner of its growing influence is very different. And we don’t have a situation where China necessarily replaces the United States. Well, it’s natural to think of China, US (and) China as the overarching happening. The fact is, there are also a lot of other countries including India, which have come much more into play. There’s been a rebalancing in the world,” he said.Citing QUAD as an example, he pointed out that some countries are coming together on a certain set of concerns and issues or interests. The Quad comprising India, Japan, the US and Australia was formed to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the resource-rich Indo-Pacific free of any influence.He said the United States is today, a much more flexible partner, much more open to ideas, suggestions, and working arrangements than in the past. “I think this reflects a very different kind of world. We are moving into a world in a sense, you could say, the real transitions after 1992 are now occurring.”The minister also elaborated on a question about how the world is changing. “It is certainly not unipolar and it is not really really bipolar either. There are many more players. A lot of what we are doing in terms of repositioning, working with countries, (it) is multipolar work,” he said.“In a sense, it is partly a hedging strategy, partly autonomous partnership, often very issue based (as) we work with different countries on different sets of issues,” said Jaishankar.Noting that the COVID has called into question the old model of globalisation, he said, “we are actually at multiple levels in a very, very complex transition.”             He pointed out that countries are willing to pay additional costs for a greater sense of security.“We all want more reliable, more resilient supply chains. We want more options. Many of us were in touch during that period and went through very difficult issues. It could have been on health, even in some cases on food. So we are actually at multiple levels in a very, very complex transition. The transition, some of it is with the rise and fall and the rebalancing of powers,” he said.“The transition some of it is with the rise and fall and the rebalancing of powers. Some of it is many more players. Some of it is that our concept of what is national security has changed. We think much more of economic security, much more of health security, much more of digital security,” he said.He said that in the old days, it didn’t matter beyond a point what the neighbour’s domestic system was.“Today, issues of trust and transparency are much more relevant in a data driven world. So it does matter to me what the character of my partner is, who they are partners with. So these are all new factors, which I would suggest is really taking the world in a very, very different direction,” he said.Obviously, India would like to see how its interests are best served and those interests today are definitely served with a much closer relationship with the United States, with a much stronger relationship with Europe, and the UK as well as re-energising the relationships with the ASEAN and especially Singapore, he said.

It was the decision of the PM. Now, he himself has announced that they will be repealed in the next session of Parliament.

19-11-2021||Agra||Agra hospital treats idol of Hindu God Krishna||The staff at the district hospital here found themselves in a baffling situation on Friday, when a priest came wailing with a request to bandage the broken arm of an idol of Lord Krishna.The staff was faced with a priest who came distraught to the hospital urging them to attend to the deity’s idol, whose arm he accidently broke while giving it a bath in the morning.After some reluctance, the hospital carried out a registration in the name of ‘Shri Krishna’ and also bandaged the arm of the idol back.  A video of the crying priest with an idol of ‘Laddu Gopal’—the childhood form of the deity—with a broken arm also circulated on social media. According to some eyewitnesses, the priest reached district hospital at about 9 am and insisted that the hospital staff tend to the idol.Priest Lekh Singh said he broke the idol when he was giving it a bath.“When I was praying in the morning and giving bath to the idol of the lord, the idol slipped and its arm was broken,” he said.“I was deeply moved because I am attached with the god. In my desperation, I went to district hospital to get it treated,” he said.Lekh Singh said he is a priest at the Pathwari temple in Kheria Mod, Arjun Nagar, for the past 30 years.“No one took my request seriously at the hospital. I was broken from inside and began crying for my god,” he said.The priest was also accompanied by the locals, eyewitnesses said.Dr Ashok Kumar Agrawal, the Chief Medical Superintendent at the district hospital,  told PTI that he was informed by the hospital that a priest had come with an idol with a broken arm and was crying to get it treated.He said considering the priest’s sentiments they made a registration in the name of ‘Shri Krishna’ for the idol.“We also bandaged the idol for the satisfaction of the priest,” Agrawal said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/agra-hospital-treats-idol-of-hindu-god-krishna-340273
19-11-2021||Lucknow||Akhilesh credits farmers for withdrawal of farm laws, terms PM apology ‘false’||SP president Akhilesh Yadav on Friday gave credit to farmers’ agitation for the Centre’s decision to repeal the three farm laws in the upcoming parliamentary session but warned the government against enacting any similar law after the elections.Yadav also termed as “false” the apology that Prime Minister Narendra Modi tendered while announcing his decision to withdraw the law in the upcoming Parliament session, asserting that the “people will not pardon” the government.“I would like to congratulate all farmers. As a result of their continuous agitation and struggle, all three black laws have been withdrawn today. The withdrawal of the black laws is the defeat of their (government’s) arrogance,” Yadav told reporters.While announcing his decision to withdraw the laws, Prime Minister Modi had elaborated upon the expected benefits of the laws to farmers and his “good faith” in enacting them but apologised that the government could not convince some farmers of the bonafide of the laws.Yadav, however, lashed out at the government, asserting that people will “not pardon” them and the government will “be wiped out” soon.“People will not pardon them, they will be wiped out soon. The false apology of anyone against the death of hundreds of farmers will not hold much ground,” said Yadav.“Those who have apologised should also promise to leave politics for always,” demanded Yadav, asserting that “they are thinking that by offering ‘dekhavati maafi’ (false apology) they can come again (in power) but the people understand them”.“I congratulate this movement, the way the youths of Purvanchal and the young farmers came on roads. The government withdrew these laws in panic. But the people in this government are such that they can bring such a law again after the elections,” he warned.“Who will assure that such laws which put the farmers in trouble will not be brought again in future?” he asked, adding had the government’s intention been clear, farmers would not have to stand in line for fertilizer in the state.“Today’s decision is in the interest of farmers,” Yadav said, asserting that “farmers’ interests are of no priority to the government which is afraid of the coming elections and today’s decision has been taken for the vote.”   “How much farmers were humiliated? What all had been said about them? The BJP people used words for them which no one can imagine using for ‘annadatas’,” Yadav said.“This is not the responsibility of one person but a collective responsibility of all the ministers and the government needs to resign,” he demanded.“The minister who is facing the charge is still in the government,” Yadav alleged, referring to the Lakhimpur Kheri violence and asked, “How can the murderer of Lakhimpur go scot-free?He claimed the way a huge crowd of farmers and people of Purvanchal came out in support of the Samajwadi Party during its recent programmes “did not shake only Lucknow but also Delhi”.Yadav said one law (of demonetisation) was brought like this before the elections and asked if it improved the economy.“What was the decision of the government at that time? Has the economy improved today? That decision too was wrong,” he asserted.Earlier in a tweet in Hindi, Yadav claimed that the BJP government “withdrew the farm laws, fearing the public support to SP’s Vijay Yatra of Purvanchal”.“The pro-rich BJP wanted to dupe poor farmers with the land acquisition act and the (three farm) black laws,” Said Yadav in his tweet.“It put nails (on roads), made cartoons of farmers being pulled by the hair, trampled them under jeep but withdrew the black laws, fearing the public support to SP’s Vijay Yatra of Purvanchal,” he claimed.“The BJP should tell when the culprits behind the deaths of hundreds of farmers will be punished?” he asked.

However, no cogent proof is found that substantially and satisfactorily supports the claim of the plaintiff since all the documents are merely based on representations of the plaintiff.  In fact, it has come to pass that there are some contradictions between the plaint and documents,” she said.The civil judge noted that in a writ petition, Mian Singh had mentioned that his son went missing in the last week of November, as against averment in the plaint that he went missing in the last week of October.Furthermore, the judge said that in the plaint before the court, Ajit has been shown as the eldest son of Mian Singh, while in the letter to the Prime Minister, he has been mentioned as a younger son.As per Mian Singh, in 1979 he went to Nepal along with his family to earn his livelihood where he started a business of motor parts trading and his son Ajit Singh worked as a contractor for the supply of auto spare parts.It is thus Singh’s case that his son came to India to purchase the motor parts in the last week of October, but went missing during the anti-Sikh riots and till date, his whereabouts are not known, the court noted.The riots had broken out after the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-court-junks-fathers-plea-seeking-declaration-of-sons-death-during-1984-anti-sikh-riots-340266
19-11-2021||New Delhi||With decision to repeal farm laws, BJP hopes to recover ground in Punjab, placate Jats in western UP||As the campaign for the upcoming assembly polls gathers pace, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to announce the repeal of the three farm laws underlines the ruling BJP’s imperative to make amends and infuse a fresh momentum in its political drive, especially in efforts to retain its dominance in Uttar Pradesh.BJP leaders said that the decision also shows the party’s genuine efforts to win over the Sikhs, who joined by sections of Jat farmers in Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh have been in the vanguard of the over-a-year-long protests against these laws, in the border state of Punjab where the party and former chief minister Amarinder Singh have highlighted security concerns and alleged attempts by pro-Khalistan elements and Pakistan to fuel disaffection.That Modi made the announcement on the birth anniversary of Sikhism founder Guru Nanak, one of the holiest days in the Sikh calendar, quoted their last Guru Gobind Singh to stress on his intention to do good work and referred to the happy development of the reopening of Kartarpur Sahib corridor are a pointer to this.While the party will hope to make a fresh political start in Punjab in an expected alliance with Singh, who has been urging the government to take measures to end the protests, its stakes are the highest in Uttar Pradesh where it had won an unprecedented 312 seats in the 403-member assembly in 2017.With sections of Jats seemingly angry with the BJP and even several Jat leaders of the party admitting to slide in their fortunes in the western UP, where the community is concentrated, the region was seen as a roadblock in its efforts to repeat its 2017 show in the upcoming polls, more so as the Samajwadi Party had joined hands with the Rashtriya Lok Dal to pose a united challenge.Adding to it has been the grouse of sugarcane farmers over relatively low returns on their produce.The killing of eight people, including farmers, in Lakhimapur in Uttar Pradesh last month had added to the BJP’s woes as the opposition and farmer unions had alleged the role of Union minister Ajay Misra ‘Teni’, whose son remains under arrest in the case.The decision to roll back the farm laws will go a long way in placating the community, which had backed the saffron party wholeheartedly in the 2014 and 2019 Lok Sabha polls besides the 2017 assembly polls, and may queer the opposition’s pitch for forging a social alliance of Jats and several smaller communities with Muslims, another numerically strong group in the region, against the BJP, its leaders hope.However, an RLD leader claimed that the farm laws’ repeal will embolden the opposition and drive home the message of unity against the BJP, as the decision shows the government can be made to bend by popular protests.The BJP had lost its traditional ally Shiromani Akali Dal following the farm bills’ passage in Parliament in September last year and was facing increasing marginalisation in the Sikh-majority state of Punjab.Its leaders routinely faced protests in the state and, to a lesser extent, in Haryana as well where Jats made a common cause with Sikh farmers against the laws which they alleged will leave them to the mercy of market forces and dismantle government support systems like mandis and Minimum Support Price mechanism, a charge repeatedly denied by the government.With the laws now set to be buried, the BJP hopes to recover lost ground in Punjah with its likely new partner Singh.Besides Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur are also headed to the polls early next year but these protests have had little impact in other states.

It also defies decency, dignity and decorum, which is expected from a person who is conferred with one of the highest awards,” Andaman and Nicobar Territorial Congress Committee president Rangalal Halder said in the statement.Ranaut had recently described India’s Independence as “bheek”, or alms, and declared that the country attained “real freedom” in 2014.She was apparently referring to Narendra Modi becoming the prime minister that year.Ranaut had on Tuesday claimed Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh got no support from Mahatma Gandhi and went on to mock his mantra of ahimsa by saying that offering another cheek gets you “bheek” not freedom.The Congress had on Thursday said her remarks amounted to “treason” and demanded the government take back the Padma Shri bestowed on her recently as she has “insulted” the country’s Independence movement. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/complaint-filed-by-an-congress-against-kangana-ranaut-for-remark-on-indias-independence-340258

All three black farm laws be repealed and a legal guarantee ensured for minimum support price (MSP) for crops through a new law. Our protest will continue till both demands are met," BKU spokesperson Saurabh Upadhyay told PTI.Addressing the nation on the occasion of Guru Nanak Jayanti, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the three farm laws were for the benefit of farmers but "we couldn't convince a section of farmers despite best efforts".The goal of the three farm laws was to empower farmers, especially small farmers, he said.Sunil Pradhan, a BKU office-bearer from Gautam Buddh Nagar district, said the crowd at Ghazipur is expected to swell manifold later in the day."Many people have gone to Garh Mukteshwar to attend the Kartik fair and would return after taking a dip in the Ganga," he said."Celebrations have already begun here at Ghazipur. But this is just half victory as other issues, including law on MSP, are yet to be addressed," he told PTI.The BKU says further decision on the protest would be taken by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM).The BKU is part of the SKM, a farmers' collective which has been leading the protest at Delhi's borders.

The Centre did not succumb when the protest was at its peak and now it had gone down on its knees, he said.The government should have adopted other policies to address the issue rather than repealing them. In fact, the laws could have survived had the government discussed them properly during the passage in Parliament and even agreed to refer to a parliamentary panel, he told PTI.Also read: Victory for Punjab farmers comes at the cost of 669 livesTimeline of how farmers’ protest against farm laws unfoldedIn a major move, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation on Friday morning announced repealing of the three central farm laws.It's been over a year now that farmers are protesting at Delhi borders against the three central farm laws.Expressing unhappiness over the government's decision, Ghanwat said this decision "won't end the agitation too. Because their demand to make minimum support price (MSP) legal will be there. And this decision won't help the BJP politically either."He said, "This is a very unfortunate decision. Farmers were given some freedom, but now they will be exploited as they have been exploited since Independence or since British rule."Under the new farm laws, farmers were for the first time given some sort of "independence in marketing", but now they have to face restrictions like export ban and stock limits that were used to exploit the farmers to keep the farm produce rate low, he said.Ghanwat said the government should have used some other policies to manage the agitation. "But now it has succumbed to the pressure of the agitators. We don't hope anything good will happen now."Stating that it was a political decision, the panel member said, "They (the Centre) did not succumb when the agitation was at its peak. But now they have gone down on their knees because they want to win elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. To get their party elected once again in UP, they have decided to step back. This is not good."Actually, agitators had designed the agitation to prolong till the upcoming Assembly elections, he said.

19-11-2021||Singapore||India, with less than $2k per capita income, showed it’s possible to transform public health: Jaishankar||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Friday said India has shown by a combination of digital tools and greater production capacity that it is possible for a country which has a per capita income of less than USD 2,000 to actually reach out in a very massive way in public health as it has set up thousands of Covid-19 treatment centres as part of healthcare transformation.Jaishankar, speaking here during the Bloomberg New Economy Forum on the issue of Great Power Competition: The Emerging World Order, said that India’s health infrastructure has grown up in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.Asked by moderator Ian Bremmer, Founder and President, Eurasia Group and GZERO Media, “what have you learned about the geo-political order from India’s experience in Covid-19 pandemic”, the minister said that biggest lesson from that would be that “we should have done a better job building over many, many years, building our own capacities and in a sense we’re now under Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi, we have a programme which physically translates into self-reliant India”.Jaishankar said that at the time when Covid-19 hit India, it had just two companies which were assembling ventilators, there was no N95 mask producer and there was very little medical equipment.“What has happened is during that period, we’ve scaled up enormously… the health infrastructure has grown up in response to Covid-19,” he said.The minister said that India has set up thousands of Covid-19 treatment centres amidst a deadly spike in cases earlier this year.“We had a transformation on the health sector and we have shown by a combination of digital tools and greater production capacity that it is possible for a country which has a per capita income of less than USD 2,000 to actually reach out in a very, very massive way in public health,” Jaishankar said.“The second positive takeaway for us… if you see why has India become a major vaccine production centre… you have some vaccines, the same vaccine is being produced in multiple countries but the Indian plants have a very high very, very efficient result I think the quality of human resource, the skills are there, the practices, traditions, lot of that has really been brought to bear on the Covid-19 issue.“If I look, not just at vaccine but if I look at the pharma world as a whole, there was a time when hydroxychloroquine was very much in demand or paracetamol was in demand and we’ve actually had a sort of scaling up of 10X (10 times), even 15-20X (15-20 times) for different medicines,” he said.He said that it has been a test for India.“A lot of it was about our own survival, our own responses, it’s interesting one of the initiatives under the QUAD is to jointly produce and distribute a QUAD vaccine which would be an American vaccine made in India and Japan will come in with a lot of financial support and Australia with a lot of logistics support.“So again for me, it’s both a decentralised globalisation, more resilient reliable supply change, more trust and transparency but also more flexible combinations… it’s is a very good illustration of all of them,” Jaishankar added. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-with-less-than-2k-per-capita-income-showed-its-possible-to-transform-public-health-jaishankar-340222

Pakistan continues to deny unimpeded and unhindered consular access to Jadhav and had failed to create an atmosphere in which a fair trial could be conducted, he said.“We have seen reports of Pakistan enacting into law the earlier ordinance that was ostensibly enacted to bring into effect the ICJ judgment.

Multiple new villages can be seen spreading through roughly 100 sq km (25,000 acre) area. The villages were constructed between May 2020 and November 2021,” Congress spokesperson Goruav Vallabh alleged.“These new villages lie near the Doklam plateau where India and China had a faceoff in 2017, after which China bypassed Indian defences to resume road construction activity in the region,” Vallabh alleged.He said, “The new construction is particularly worrying for India since India has historically advised Bhutan on its external relations policy and continues to train its armed forces.”Noting that “100 sq km of illegal incursion by way of four Chinese villages in Bhutan next to Doklam is a blow to India’s national security”, the Congress asked the Prime Minister to answer.“When will the government respond to verbal, geographic, military and strategic aggression of China?

Narendra Modi, PMThe PM was delivering the keynote address at the Sydney Dialogue where Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had listed 63 critical technologies that would enable the Quad and AUKUS groupings to match China’s advances in technologies that could enable global economic and security dominance.“Take cryptocurrency or bitcoin for example. It is important that all democratic nations work together on this and ensure it does not end up in wrong hands, which can spoil our youth,” he said.India has unmatched experience in using digital technology in a democratic framework with strong guarantees for individual rights and the use of technology linked to values and vision, PM Modi said, using an idiom employed by US President Joe Biden and Morrison in their attempt to counter Chinese foray in critical technologies.While investing in developing indigenous capability in artificial intelligence and machine learning, India is taking care that it is human centered and used ethically. India has also created a robust framework of data protection, privacy and security. “The use of technology is linked to values and vision. It is essential for democracies to invest in future technology,” he underlined.The PM said, “The digital age has helped in ushering in a new era of opportunities for progress and prosperity but at the same time, it brings new challenges.”The government has set up a joint task force with the industry to make India a global hub of cyber security. “We have benefits of scale and global trust,” he said.India is now focusing on hardware and preparing a package of incentives to become a key manufacturer of semiconductors.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ensure-cryptocurrency-doesnt-end-up-in-wrong-hands-says-pm-modi-339889

We are continuing these efforts,” the PM said at the concluding session of “Creating Synergies for Seamless Credit Flow and Economic Growth”.The Centre had enacted the Fugitive Economic Offenders’ Act in 2018 and a Mumbai court had used its provisions to declare Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi as the first two “economic offenders”. Mallya is believed to have fled the country in 2016 and Modi in 2018.The PM said Rs 5 lakh crore had been recovered from defaulters through “proactive steps” and the recently set up National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd will help clear the banking sector’s stressed assets of Rs 2 lakh crore.Addressing a meet on the pharma sector, the PM said the pandemic brought this sector into sharp focus. But the “one frontier that India has to conquer” is to make India self-reliant by domestic manufacture of key ingredients for vaccines and medicines, most of which are imported from China. During the two Covid waves, “we found that this was one issue that needs much more attention”.Another area that the PM flagged was traditional medicines that have registered a sharp rise in exports – export of herbal medicines is over Rs 10,000 crore.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-firm-on-bringing-back-fugitive-economic-offenders-339890

Veteran leader Ambika Soni, former MP Jai Parkash Agarwal and former Deputy CM of Karnataka G Parameshwara were named as members and party general secretary Tariq Anwar as member-secretary.Comment: Hindutva vs Hinduism: Can Rahul orient party cadres in a way Gandhi and Nehru would have imagined?The differenceAll that Mahatma Gandhi stood for is Hinduism. All that Nathuram Godse stood for is Hindutva. -- Gourav Vallabh, Congress spokespersonThe reconstitution of the committee comes at a time when the party finds itself embroiled in a controversy over Hinduism versus Hindutva, a debate that started after former minister Salman Khurshid drew similarities between Hindutva and radical jihadi outfits ISIS and Boko Haram in his book on Ayodhya.This was followed by Rahul Gandhi saying that Hindutva and Hinduism were distinct and that the former endorsed violence. The issue has triggered an internal debate with Punjab’s Anandpur Sahib MP Manish Tewari on Wednesday taking to Twitter to say that the Congress had been going down a slippery slope ever since it distanced itself from Nehruvian socialism. Noting that the Hinduism versus Hindutva debate “confused him”, Tewari called for a larger debate on the issue. Responding, Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh today said: “All that Mahatma Gandhi stood for is Hinduism. All that Nathuram Godse stood for is Hindutva.”“All Godse could understand is exclusiveness. Mahatma Gandhi understood inclusiveness of the Hindu religion ... Godse killed Gandhiji because he spoke of inter-faith harmony,” he said. Vallabh slammed Kangana Ranaut for her anti-Gandhi remarks, calling her “ignorant government actor.” He demanded withdrawal of national awards given to her.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hindutva-debate-congress-recasts-disciplinary-panel-339891

Let the authorities continue to do their job.A Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar said such a direction at this stage would not be appropriate and would disturb the ongoing process.The term one board exams of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) have already commenced from November 16 while the semester one board examinations of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) were scheduled to begin on November 22, it noted.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the CBSE, told the Bench that all precautions had been taken for conducting the board examinations in the offline mode and the examination centres had been increased from 6,500 to 15,000.The Bench said it “hopes and trusts” that the authorities would take all precautions and measures to ensure that no one got exposed to anything untoward in the examination process.Six students, appearing in the board examinations, had moved the top court seeking directions to the CBSE and the CISCE to issue a revised circular for conducting the board exams in hybrid mode in view of Covid-19.The petition claimed, “The offline exam was “fraught with bad planning.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-junks-plea-on-hybrid-mode-option-for-exams-339896
19-11-2021||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court junks ‘skin-to-skin contact’ Bombay High Court verdict||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 18Holding that direct “skin-to-skin” contact is not essential to constituting an offence under the POCSO Act, the Supreme Court today set aside the Bombay High Court’s controversial verdict acquitting two men accused of groping a minor girl.POCSO offenceThe most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault under Section 7 of the POCSO Act is the ‘sexual intent’ and not ‘skin-to-skin’ contact. SC Bench“The HC erred in holding that there was no offence since there was no direct physical contact i.e. ‘skin-to-skin’ with sexual intent… The most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault under Section 7 of the Act is the ‘sexual intent’ and not the ‘skin-to-skin’ contact with the child,” said a Bench of Justice UU Lalit, Justice Bela M Trivedi and Justice S Ravindra Bhat. Writing the judgment for herself and Justice Lalit, Justice Trivedi said, “Restricting the interpretation of the words ‘touch’ or ‘physical contact’ to ‘skin-to-skin contact’ would not only be a narrow and pedantic interpretation of the provision contained in Section 7 of the POCSO Act, but it would lead to an absurd interpretation of the said provision. ‘skin-to-skin contact’ for constituting an offence of ‘sexual assault’ could not have been intended or contemplated by the Legislature,” Justice Bhat wrote a separate, but concurring verdict.“The very object of enacting the POCSO Act is to protect children from sexual abuse, and if such a narrow interpretation is accepted, it would lead to a very detrimental situation, frustrating the very object of the Act, inasmuch as in that case touching the sexual or non-sexual parts of the body of a child with gloves, condoms, sheets or with cloth, though done with sexual intent would not amount to an offence of sexual assault under Section 7 of the POCSO Act,” the top court said.Justice Pushpa Ganediwala of the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court had, on January 19, acquitted accused Satish and Libnus, holding that groping the breasts of a minor girl over her clothes didn’t amount to “sexual assault” under the POCSO Act. However, it convicted them of “outraging modesty of woman” under Section 354 of the IPC awarding them two-year jail term.However, reversing the HC verdict, the top court sent Libnus and Satish to jail for five years and three years besides imposing fine.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-junks-skin-to-skin-contact-bombay-high-court-verdict-339897

One such stunning image of a clean river from Meghalaya has left the netizens in wonderment.One of the cleanest rivers in the world. It is in India. River Umngot, 100 Kms from Shillong, in Meghalaya state. It seems as if the boat is in air; water is so clean and transparent. Wish all our rivers were as clean. Hats off to the people of Meghalaya. pic.twitter.com/pvVsSdrGQE   The Ministry of Jal Shakti has shared an aerial view of the pristine Umngot river from Shillong on its Twitter. “One of the cleanest rivers in the world. It is in India. River Umngot, 100 Kms from Shillong, in Meghalaya state. It seems as if the boat is in air; water is so clean and transparent. Wish all our rivers were as clean. Hats off to the people of Meghalaya,” wrote the Ministry of Jal Shakti.The water is so clear that even the waterbed with all the stones and pebbles is visible. There’s a boat with five people on it and it gives an impression that it’s gliding on air. The green tone in the photo makes it look like a view from a jungle. It’s a delight for nature-lovers.”While some people think the picture is photo-shopped, there are some who think people will go and pollute the clean river.I think this is a photo shopped image. Would be glad to be proven wrong though.I was there last month, and this is what the condition of it is right now. The music was played by the boatman... pic.twitter.com/qaIF8HyHeQI have seen the shopkeepers and locals not allowing the drains to get choked by litter. They all collect the litter from drains and let the drain water run unhindered. Besides they keep their surroundings quite clean too.There is a basic difference the people of Meghalaya treat their river well while in north India they call river as mother but the way they treats river they can be easily called as motherf**kersDon't get any ideas.

19-11-2021||Satya Prakash||Supreme Court quashes ‘skin-to-skin’ judgment of Bombay High Court||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 18Setting aside the Bombay High Court's controversial verdict acquitting a man accused under the POCSO Act for groping a minor girl, the Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that direct "skin-to-skin" contact is not essential to constituting an offence under the special law aimed to protect children from sexual abuse.A Bench led by Justice UU Lalit said that giving such a narrow meaning to physical contact and confining it to direct "skin-to-skin" contact couldn’t be accepted as it would defeat the purpose of the POCSO Act."The most important ingredient for constituting the offence of sexual assault is sexual intent and not skin-to-skin contact with the child. Construction of a rule should give effect to rule rather than destroying it. The intention of the legislature can't be given effect to unless wider interpretation is given," the Bench said.Justice Pushpa Ganediwala of the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court had on January 19 acquitted an accused, holding that groping the breasts of a minor girl over her clothes didn’t amount to “sexual assault” under Section 8 of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.The High Court had held that it only amounted to “outraging modesty of woman” under Section 354 of the IPC as there was no direct "skin-to-skin" contact. The High Court had convicted the accused and given him a two-year jail term for indecently touching the body of the minor."The act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years, in the absence of any specific detail as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hand inside top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of ‘sexual assault’. It would certainly fall within the definition of the offence under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code," the High Court had said.The top court had on January 27 stayed the High Court verdict modifying the order of a sessions court, which had sentenced the 39-year-old accused to three years of imprisonment for sexually assaulting the 12-year-old girl.The top court had on September 30 reserved its judgment on appeals against the Bombay High Court verdict which had held that no offence of sexual assault under the POCSO Act was made out if there is no direct “skin-to-skin' contact between the accused and the victim.Terming as “outrageous” the Bombay High Court’s ruling that sexual assault offences under the POCSO Act weren’t made out if there was no direct 'skin-to-skin' contact between the offender and the child, Attorney General KK Venugopal had urged the Supreme Court to reverse it."If tomorrow a person wears a pair of surgical gloves and feels the entire body of a woman, he won't be punished for sexual assault as per this judgment. This is outrageous. To say that skin-to-skin contact is required (to attract POCSO Act) would mean an accused wearing gloves getting an acquittal. The judge clearly didn't see the far-reaching consequences," Venugopal had argued.The Maharashtra government had adopted the submissions of the Attorney General.Stating that 43,000 offences were registered under POCSO in the last one year, the Attorney General had said that the Bombay High Court verdict set a bad precedent having far-reaching ramifications for the magistrates’ courts in Maharashtra.As the controversial order of the Bombay High Court acquitting the man accused of child abuse under POCSO Act created a furore, the Supreme Court had on January 27 stayed it after Venugopal made an urgent mentioning of the case and urged the top court to take suo motu cognisance of the matter. "It’s a very disturbing conclusion,” Venugopal had said.Later, the Youth Bar Association of India and the National Commission for Women had also filed separate petitions requesting the top court to reverse the Bombay High Court’s verdict.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-quashes-skin-to-skin-judgment-of-bombay-high-court-339770
19-11-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||India with respect for individual rights is best partner for other democracies, Modi says at Sydney Dialogue||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 18Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday flagged the downside of critical technologies saying India with its strong democratic credentials, with an accent on individual rights, was the best partner for other democracies.Modi was delivering the keynote address at the Sydney Dialogue where Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had listed 63 critical technologies that would enable the Quad and AUKUS groupings to match China’s advances in technologies that could enable global economic and security dominance.Pointing out that “we” face new risks and conflicts, the PM pointed out that technology had already become a major instrument of global change and the key to shaping international order. Along with data, technology is becoming a new weapon.“While a few vested interests cannot be allowed to misuse openness, as a democracy, India is ready to work with partners for fair prosperity and security,” he said. In the area of crypto-currency or bitcoin, it is important that all democratic nations work together and ensure it “does not end up in wrong hands which can spoil our youth”.Though one of the PM's targets was rogue actors and those who use critical infrastructure to “manipulate public opinion”, he indirectly indicated the other target. “We are at a historic moment of choice: whether all the wonderful powers of technology will be an instrument of cooperation or conflict, coercion or choice, domination or development, opposition or opportunity,’’ he observed in this respect.India has unmatched experience in using digital technology in a democratic framework with strong guarantees for individual rights and the use of technology linked to values and vision, he said.While investing in developing indigenous capability in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, India is taking care that it is human- centred and used ethically. As the highest per capita user of data, India has also created a robust framework of data protection, privacy and security. “The use of technology is linked to values and vision. It is essential for democracies to invest in future technology,” he observed.The PM said the government had set up a joint task force with the industry to make India a global hub of cyber security. “We have benefits of scale and global trust,” he said. India is now focusing on hardware and is preparing a package of incentives to become the key manufacturer of semiconductors.  The PM began his address by pointing out that the time of change “happens once in an era” saying the invitation to him to speak at the Sydney Dialogue organised by a think-tank was “recognition of india’s central role in the Indo-Pacific region and in the emerging digital world”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-with-respect-for-individual-rights-is-best-partner-for-other-democracies-modi-says-at-sydney-dialogue-339757
