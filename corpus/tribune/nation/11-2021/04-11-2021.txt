I thank Modiji for this,” Shah said in tweets in Hindi.The home minister said this “Diwali gift” by the prime minister to the country would not only bring relief to the common man but also reduce inflation.The Centre on Wednesday cut excise duty on petrol by Rs 5 per litre and that on diesel by Rs 10 a litre to give reprieve to consumers battered by record high retail fuel prices.Several BJP-ruled states and Bihar, where the BJP is part of the ruling coalition, also reduced VAT rates, giving further relief to consumers. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/excise-duty-cut-on-petrol-diesel-sensitive-decision-will-give-common-man-relief-amit-shah-334203

Observers say the results from the hill state reflected farmers’ anger, the apple growers protesting against the plummeting price of the fruit in the wholesale market.Central leaders say yesterday’s results will have no bearing on assembly elections early next year and that Himachal results, in particular, are a “reflection on CM Jai Ram Thakur” a year before the state polls. However, this is not good news for the BJP ahead of elections to five states three of which are in North and agrarian in nature - UP, Uttarakhand and Punjab. Amid the growing buzz that “HP may follow the pattern of change seen in Uttarakhand a couple of months back”, sources say the Central leaders “will hold discussions (on what went wrong)”. “The results have just come. Discussions and analysis of results are an essential part of the BJP’s functioning,” they added.Incidentally apart from Himachal, West Bengal too came as a major embarrassment for the BJP which lost two seats it won in recent elections to the TMC. The Congress, meanwhile, claimed that the results of byelections held to various state Assembly and Parliament seats were a “clear indication” that the “BJP is losing its momentum especially in Hindi heartland” due to its “anti-people policies”. People voted against price rise: PilotJodhpur: Former Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Wednesday said policies of the BJP led to its defeat in the bypolls to two Assembly seats in the state, with people voting on issues of price rise and apathy towards farmers. “The height of anger against the BJP can be gauged from the fact that in both constituencies, BJP candidates were nowhere in the race, securing third and fourth place,” Pilot said.

The national commission relied on its larger bench decision in Manu Solanki and Others versus Vinayaka Mission University (2020) and the Supreme Court’s verdicts on the issue.In Solanki case, the national consumer commission had held that institutions offering education, including vocational courses and other activities undertaken during the process of pre-admission as well as post-admission and also imparting excursion tours, picnics, extra co-curricular activities, swimming, sport, etc, except coaching institutions, were not covered under the Consumer Protection Act.However, since the top court has given divergent verdicts on the issue in various cases, its verdict in cases under consideration is likely to spell out the legal position.Ensure only green crackers used in festivals: HCKolkata: The Calcutta HC on Wednesday directed that all necessary efforts must be made by the West Bengal Government to ensure that only green crackers are used during Diwali-Kali puja and other ensuing festivals, observing that the sincerity of the state would be reflected in enforcement mechanism.

In the PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion.Intakes by new services firms increased at the sharpest rate since July 2011.For the third straight month, the services sector witnessed an expansion in output. During this period, GST collection also remained above the Rs 1 lakh-crore mark with Rs 1.3 lakh crore in October being the second highest since the launch of this composite nationwide tax.The strong growth in the services sector, however, is powered only by domestic demand while overseas orders still remain weak. “The latest data continued to point to weak international demand for Indian services.

As a result, inflationary pressures has built up leading to price rise.The reduction in the excise duty will also boost consumption and keep inflation low, thus helping the poor and middle classes.Soon after the excise duty cut, the BJP-ruled states took a cue announcing further reduction in VAT on fuel cutting additional costs.The Chief Ministers of Assam, Tripura, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttarakhand and Goa made late Wednesday night announcements of “Diwali gift to people.”Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma took the lead by announcing: “Heartening to learn about the Centre’s decision to reduce the excise duty on petrol and diesel. In consonance with the decision of PM Modi, I am pleased to announce that Assam Government will also reduce VAT on petrol and diesel each by Rs 7 with immediate effect.”Tripura CM Biplab Deb tweeted, saying PM’s decision on reduction of excise duty on fuel was a welcome move. The Tripura Government has also decided to reduce petrol & diesel cost by Rs 7 from tomorrow.Goa CM Pramod Sawant also said in addition to the Centre’s decision, the government of Goa would reduce an additional Rs 7 on petrol and Rs 7 on diesel, thereby reducing the price of diesel by Rs 17 per litre and petrol by Rs 12 per litre.Karnataka CM Basvaraj Bommai said the state government had decided to reduce the price of diesel and petrol by Rs 7 per litre. “An estimated Rs 2,100 crore of state tax will be lost to the Treasury.

At the end of the assessment process, the WHO submits its findings to an external technical advisory group consisting of experts from six different countries. That group met today and recommended that the WHO should proceed with the emergency use listing of Covaxin. So Covaxin is now listed,” Simao said.Asked what it means for a vaccine to be so listed, the WHO expert said the EUL facilitates international procurement of a listed jab.The EUL means people inoculated with Covaxin will now find it easier to travel across the world with several nations, including the EU, accepting vaccines approved by the WHO. The EUL procedure basically assesses the suitability of novel health products during public health emergencies.With validation from the WHO, countries can now expedite their regulatory approval processes to import and administer Covaxin.This could be key to ramping up global vaccination coverage, especially with improved access to Covaxin in lower middle income and low income countries.Krishna Ella, chairman, Bharat Biotech, said, “Validation by the WHO is a very significant step towards ensuring global access to India’s widely administered, safe, and efficacious Covaxin.” Bharat Biotech had submitted additional information to the World Health Organisation in September and October.Biotech Jab shelf life extended to a yearHow it got there||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/booster-for-india-indigenous-covaxin-finally-gets-who-nod-333955

Prices of petrol and diesel will thus come down accordingly," an official statement said. Farmers have, through their hard work, kept the economic growth momentum going even during the lockdown phase and the massive reduction in excise on diesel will come as a boost to them during the upcoming Rabi season, it added. In recent months, crude oil prices have witnessed a global upsurge. Consequently, domestic prices of petrol and diesel had increased in recent weeks, exerting inflationary pressure, it said.

Both projects were developed with India’s assistance.“Following the Indian approval for Nepal to export its electricity, power trade between the two countries has entered a new phase,” the report cited Nepal’s ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation as saying.Gokarna Raj Pantha, joint spokesperson for the ministry, told the Post that the Nepal Electricity Authority would now be able to participate in an auction in the Indian Energy Exchange everyday to sell power.The NEA will start exporting the power through 400- kV Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur inter-country transmission line from midnight, The Himalayan Times reported.This transmission has until now been used just to import power as Nepal had already received permission for purchasing and importing power in the Indian Energy Exchange.The NEA has been importing power through Indian Energy Exchange at competitive rate since last April 30 as per need. After obtaining the approval, the power trade between Nepal and India has entered a new phase, the report said.According to Madhu Bhetuwal, spokesperson for the Energy Ministry, the Indian authority has also been studying Nepal’s proposal to sell the electricity generated by two other power projects, including the 456MW Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project, The Kathmandu Post reported.Nepal became an energy surplus country ever since the 456MW Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project came into full operation in August, the report said.According to the NEA, Nepal now has surplus power even during peak hours, usually between 7 and 8 pm. The peak hour demand stands at 1,500MW. The country is currently producing 2,000MW of electricity, of which 1,900MW is generated from hydropower projects, it said.Speaking about the development, Rohit Bajaj, Head and Senior Vice President – Business Development, Indian Energy Exchange Limited, said IEX commenced trade in cross-border electricity transactions in April. Under the CERC Regulations, grid connected neighbouring countries can buy-sell electricity though the day-ahead electricity market on the Exchange.“Nepal was the first country which commenced transactions at IEX platform and has been buying electricity regularly in the day-ahead market,” Bajaj said.As yet another key milestone in strengthening cross border ties, two hydro generators from Nepal – Trishuli and Devighat Hydro have sold electricity to India through Exchange platform for the first time, he said.“We are also working closely with stakeholders in Bhutan and Bangladesh and going forward expect these two countries also to commence trade at IEX platform.“The Exchange day-ahead market opens for trade from 10 am to 12 pm on a daily basis. The market follows double sided closed anonymous auction to discover most competitive power price for the electricity to be delivered on the next day,” he said.

This can be done by forming a team of 20-25 people depending on the region. Try competition in the teams that you have formed. You will have to do your best to take your districts nearer the national average,” he said.The Prime Minister touched upon the issue of rumours and misunderstanding about vaccination and suggested awareness as the only solution.The Prime Minister noted that religious leaders are very enthusiastic about the vaccination campaign.Recalling his meeting with Pope Francis at the Vatican a few days ago, he said faith leaders were helping vaccinations.He urged special emphasis on taking the message of religious leaders on vaccines to the public.The Prime Minister also asked the officials to change gears from arrangements made for taking people to the vaccination centre and for safe vaccination to administering vaccines from door to door.He asked health workers to reach every house with passion ‘har ghar tika, ghar ghar tika’: vaccine at every doorstep, and gave a call for ‘har ghar dastak’—knocking on every doorstep to ensure full vaccination.“Now we are preparing to take the vaccination campaign to each household. With the mantra of  ‘har ghar sastak’, knock on every door, every household lacking the security net of a double dose of vaccine will be approached,” he said.The Prime Minister cautioned that while knocking on every house, equal attention needed to be paid to the second dose as well as the first dose.“Whenever the cases of infection start decreasing, sometimes the feeling of urgency decreases. The urgency in administering the vaccines comes down among the people. You will have to contact those people who have not taken the second dose despite the stipulated time on a priority basis...ignoring this has created problems for many countries in the world,” the PM alerted.Out of 48 low vaccination districts 28 are in the northeast.Haryana’s Nuh is also among these 48 low performers with just 25 per cent first dose coverage as against the national average of 77 per cent.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-urges-door-to-door-visits-for-full-covid-vaccination-har-ghar-dastak-the-new-mantra-333792
