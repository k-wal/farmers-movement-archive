13-11-2021||New Delhi||Suit filed in Delhi court against publication, sale of Salman Khurshid’s book||An injunction suit has been filed before a Delhi court seeking to stop the publication, circulation, and sale of ex-Union minister Salman Khurshid’s book for allegedly hurting the sentiments of a large section of society, the lawyer of the complainant said on Saturday.The suit was filed by right-wing group Hindu Sena’s president Vishnu Gupta.Senior Congress leader Khurshid has sparked controversy by reportedly comparing a “robust version” of Hindutva to the jihadist Islam of terror groups such as ISIS and Boko Haram in his book ‘Sunrise Over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Times’.Gupta’s counsel Akshay Aggarwal and Sushant Prakash claimed that the book’s launch event before the assembly election in Uttar Pradesh, slated for early next year, was aimed at polarising and gaining the votes of the minorities.The petition seeks prohibitory injunction against the publication, distribution, circulation and sale of the book and also ban it “in the larger interest of the society and country”.The Hindu Sena on Friday demanded a ban on the book, alleging that Khurshid’s statement harms social integrity and hurts the religious sentiments of Hindus.In a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Hindu Sena president Vishnu Gupta said the comparison made in the book is an attempt to demonise the Hindu religion.Khurshid’s comments in his book have sparked a row with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday maintained that Hinduism and Hindutva are “different things” and slammed the ideology of the BJP-RSS alleging it has spread hatred in India, drawing a sharp retort from the BJP which claimed that the Congress leadership nurses a “pathological hatred” for Hinduism.Khurshid, who stood by his remarks made in his new book on the Ayodhya verdict, had come under attack on Thursday from the BJP as well as his party colleague Ghulam Nabi Azad.

It was his grand-father who inspired Viplav to don the army uniform, his maternal uncle (‘mama’) Rajesh Patnaik told PTI here.Colonel Tripathi, the Commanding Officer of Khuga Battalion of Assam Rifles, his wife Anuja (36) and son Abir (5) besides four personnel of the paramilitary force were killed in an ambush by militants in the north-eastern state.The Tripathi family hails from Raigarh in Chhattisgarh.“Viplav joined the Indian Army with the goal of serving the nation, taking inspiration from his grandfather, a great freedom fighter. His father, a senior journalist, and his mother, a social activist, also encouraged him. He has sacrificed his life while serving for the country. We are proud of him,” Patnaik said.Viplav was attached to Kishori Mohan, and had even visited the Rashtrapati Bhavan with him when Giani Zail Singh was President, he said.Born on May 30, 1980, Viplav went to the Sainik School Rewa (Madhya Pradesh) after passing class V at a school in Raigarh town. His father, Subhash Tripathi (76) is a senior journalist and editor of the local Hindi daily ‘Dainik Bayar’ and mother Asha Tripathi is a retired librarian.After schooling, Viplav got admission to the National Defence Academy (NDA), Khadakwasla and then joined the Indian Military Academy (IMA), Dehradun, Patnaik said.In 2001, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Kumaon Regiment in Ranikhet. He later passed a command course from the Defence Service Staff College (DSSC) Wellington.Viplav’s younger brother Anay Tripathi, who also studied at the Sainik School Rewa, is also an army officer, now posted as lieutenant colonel in Shillong, Patnaik said.“Anay, who had arrived in Raigarh on Friday night, got the shocking news about his brother through his army colleagues around 12:30 pm today,” an inconsolable Patnaik said.“The entire family had celebrated Diwali this year in Manipur, where Viplav was posted. His parents returned to Raigarh on November 6,” he said.Anay has left for the Eastern Command headquarters of the army in Kolkata, and mortal remains of Viplav, his wife and son would be brought to Raigarh on Sunday, Patnaik said.A pall of gloom descended on Raigarh town when the news reached, with locals rushing to his house to express their condolences.

After the health department reported that the virus could be dangerous among children and the elderly, health minister Veena George on Friday had chaired a meeting of doctors and health department officials and called upon the people to be vigilant.Doctors warned that the elderly and pregnant women should take extra precautions against the disease and wash hands thoroughly before eating.The norovirus which is also known as the ‘winter vomiting bug’ is highly infectious and spreads easily among people leading to diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach ache.Health department doctors said that the disease is transmitted by direct contact with an infected person, contaminated food or touching a contaminated surface, and putting unwashed hands in the mouth.The most common symptoms of the disease according to doctors are diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and stomach pain. In certain cases there is fever, headache and body ache.The signs and symptoms are seen 12 to 48 hours after the person is exposed to norovirus and it lasts for three to four days. Fresh fruits consumed without proper washing, green vegetables including lettuce and oysters are common carriers of norovirus.The state health ministry in its guidelines said that fruits and vegetables must be washed thoroughly before consumption. Crabs and oysters should be cooked well as they could act as carriers of norovirus.The Kerala health ministry in its guidelines said that those who interact with animals should pay special attention and must use chlorinated water for drinking.The health department has directed people to stay at home if found infected with norovirus. Doctors said that lots of water should be consumed to prevent dehydration and patients must take rest at home.Dr Shyamlal Raghavan, Physician and Professor of general medicine at a medical college in Kerala told IANS, “The disease can be fatal in children, elderly and those with comorbidities. The state health department has already issued guidelines and people must abide by them and those who are handling animals must take extra care. Hands must be washed properly before eating food and water tanks and wells must be chlorinated. Take good rest if infected and drink large quantities of water to prevent dehydration”. —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kerala-on-high-alert-after-norovirus-reported-in-state-337672
13-11-2021||New Delhi||‘Jinnah-Azam -Mukhtar’ or ‘Jandhan-Aadhar-Mobile’ —take your pick: Amit Shah attacks Samajwadi Party in stronghold Azamgarh||The BJP on Saturday took on their main rival in Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party, in its bastion Azamgarh with Home Minister Amit Shah attacking its “appeasement politics” and asking people there to make a choice between “Jinnah-Azam-Mukhtar” (JAM) or “Jandhan- Aadhar- Mobile” (JAM) and Chief Minister Aditaynath even suggesting a name change for it.    “The Samajwadi Party only has ‘JAM’ of Jinnah, Azam Khan and Mukhtar Ansari on offer for Uttar Pradesh,” said Shah who was in Azamgarh with Adityanath to lay the foundation stone of a state university named after OBC icon Raja Suhel Dev–a move seen as a counter to main rival, Samajwadi chief Akhilesh Yadav, joining hands with Om Prakash Rajbhar’s party named after Raja Suhel Dev (Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party).Azamgarh is SP chief Akhilesh Yadav’s constituency.Referring to Akhilesh Yadav’s “Jinnah” remark Shah said that “Jinnah holds a special relevance for Akhilesh”.Shah said that under Samajwadi Party Azamgarh was known as a “terror sanctuary and for fundamentalist thinking”.“It was made the den of anti-national activity. But today, a ‘Maa Saraswati dham ‘(university) is being set up which will change the image of Azamgarh,” Shah said, referring to terrorism cases traced back to Azamgarh.Adityanath, meanwhile, said setting up of the state university will turn “Azamgarh into Aryamgarh”.“The new state university will ensure Azamgarh definitely becomes Aryamgarh,” he said. Hitting out at SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Akhilesh, Adityanath said Azamgarh may have given two chief ministers and also sent them to the Lok Sabha but its identity and image did not improve. “Before 2014, a person from Azamgarh had problem in even getting a hotel room anywhere in the country,” he claimed.The rally saw Shah re-endorsing Adityanath as the BJP’s CM candidate for polls next year, urging people to vote for the party and make him the Chief Minister again while praising development works and law and order during his tenure.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jinnah-azam-mukhtar-or-jandhan-aadhar-mobile-%E2%80%94take-your-pick-amit-shah-attacks-samajwadi-party-in-stronghold-azamgarh-337669
13-11-2021||New Delhi||COP26: Negotiations overshoot, countries strive hard to reach agreement on ambitions and equity||Countries continued negotiations to arrive at an agreement aimed at averting the worst impacts of climate change a day after the COP26 in Glasgow officially ended. Observers say negotiators are pouring over crucial matters related to finance, carbon markets, and loss and damage, and the final text will be made public soon.Till the filing of this report, it was not clear whether negotiations will lead to a final deal on Saturday or some more talks. The observers say that several sticking points, especially on fossil fuels and on financial help to poorer nations, remain. The new version of the agreement continues to refer to “accelerating efforts towards phase-out of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”, which environmentalists dismissed as “watered-down”. However, this is the first time that coal has been explicitly mentioned in a UN document of this type, some observers also pointed.They suggested “movement overnight on crucial elements”. The points of contention around Article 6 and carbon markets have narrowed and the US and Japan appear to have been successful on making cancellation of credits “voluntary, and not mandatory”.Article 6 is a part of the Paris Agreement.Governed by Article 6, rules around the trade in emissions reductions between countries have the potential to make or break the entire agreement. Writing the rules for Article 6 has been the central element of COP26 negotiations.Meanwhile, developing countries appear to have secured the doubling of adaptation finance, though without any detail on delivery, although the draft stressed urgency.Though tricky issues remain, for example how most vulnerable countries will cope with increasing impacts of climate with a potential to severely impact annual GDP. Apparently, America and European Union have refused to accept anything tougher than a series of ‘dialogues’ on the issues. In other words, there has not been much progress particularly on loss and damage financing.Broadly, the new draft  “urges” countries who have not landed new plans to do so by 2022, “requests” all countries to raise climate targets in line with 1.5-2C by and of 2022, talks of annual UN assessment of climate plans from 2022, signals to countries to accelerate shift off fossil fuels, coal to renewable energy, notes  with “deep regret” developed countries missing $100 billion target, urges them to “fully deliver” on the $100 billion goal  through 2025, “welcomes” the further operationalisation of the Santiago network and urges countries to provide funds of it, according to reports.Activists have urged US President Joe Biden to “even now” tell his team in Glasgow to not “block public adaptation funding and finance for loss and damage from developed nations to developing countries threatened by rising temperatures”. A number of activists and scientists have also expressed concern over “lack of near-term, verifiable and ambitious climate solutions from governments at the vital COP”.The Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was scheduled to end on Friday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cop26-negotiations-overshoot-countries-strive-hard-to-reach-agreement-on-ambitions-and-equity-337665
13-11-2021||New Delhi||SC allows Bombay, Allahabad, Punjab and Haryana HCs to transfer judges trying cases against MPs, MLAs||The Supreme Court on Saturday permitted the high courts of Bombay, Allahabad and Punjab & Haryana to transfer some special judges trying criminal cases against sitting and former MPs and MLAs to other courts in their respective states on grounds such as “administrative exigencies”, and asked them to find suitable substitutes quickly to ensure that such trials are not delayed.A bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana, hearing a 2016 PIL seeking life ban on contesting elections on lawmakers convicted of heinous crimes and speedy disposal of cases against them, had earlier directed all the high courts not to transfer special judges without its prior nod.“To ensure expeditious disposal of pending cases, it is necessary for this Court to direct the officers presiding over Special Courts or CBI Courts involving prosecution of MPs or MLAs to continue in their present posts until further orders.“This direction, barring transfer of judicial officers, will be subject to their superannuation or death. If any further necessity or emergency arises, the Registrar General of the High Courts are at liberty to make an application before us for retention or to relieve those officers,” the top court had ordered on August 10 this year.The high court registries of Bombay, Allahabad and Punjab and Haryana moved separate pleas seeking the top court’s nod to transfer some special judges to some other courts under their territorial jurisdictions.“The said application is filed seeking permission of this Court to transfer one of the specially designated Court Judge dealing with Criminal Cases involving MPs/MLAs in the State of Maharashtra, Goa and Dadra and Nagar Haveli viz. H.S. Satbhai, Judge, City Civil and Sessions Court and Additional Sessions Judge, Mumbai, Maharashtra from his current charge/posting and to further transfer the said Judicial Officer to Kelapur, District Yavatmal, Maharashtra, on account of ‘administrative exigencies’ noticed by the Committee consisting of Administrative Judges of the Bombay High Court in its meeting held on October 6,” the Bombay high court said in its plea.Similarly, the Allahabad High Court through its Registrar General has sought permission to transfer Alok Kumar Srivastava, presently posted as Presiding Officer of Special Court at Allahabad, and Pawan Kumar Rai, presently posted as Additional District & Sessions Judge in the Special Court at Lucknow, to other suitable posts on administrative grounds.The High Court of Punjab and Haryana also filed a plea seeking similar nod.The top court bench, also having justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant, took into consideration the averments made in the pleas and allowed them subject to the condition that the “High Court/State shall provide suitable substitute” immediately so as to ensure expeditious disposal of the cases pending against sitting and former MPs and MLAs.The bench, meanwhile, said that it would hear on Monday some other petitions, including the one filed by Abdullah Azam Khan, the politician-son of Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan, against the order which permitted additional district and sessions judges to try lawmakers in magistrate-triable small offences.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for the SP leader, said that the apex court in its judgement, passed on the PIL filed by Ashwini Upadhyay, had directed that cases against MPs and MLAs have to be tried by “designated magisterial court”.“But in the state of Uttar Pradesh, it has not been done and hence, the matter (criminal case) goes to the sessions court for trial without committal (of the case by a designated magisterial court),” Sibal argued.The top court asked advocate Sneha Kalita, who along with senior advocate Vijay Hansaria is assisting the bench as amicus curiae, to serve a copy of the 12th Status Report to Sibal and all concerned immediately.The top court, hearing a PIL filed by advocate and BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay seeking life ban on lawmakers convicted in heinous criminal cases and speedy disposal of cases against them, has been passing a slew of directions time-to-time for ensuring speedy investigation by the CBI and other agencies and conclusion of trials.It had ordered the setting up of additional special courts by the high courts.Earlier, the top court had expressed its “deep concern” over tardy probe and prosecution in CBI cases against the lawmakers and had issued a slew of directions for ensuring speedy investigation by the agency and conclusion of trials, besides setting up of additional special courts by the high courts.It had asked high courts to set up special courts wherever such additional courts are required to be constituted for expeditious disposal of pending trials and apprise it of any “non-cooperation by the Central or State Governments” on the issue.“Without going into minute details, we are deeply concerned with the current state of affairs with respect to these (CBI) cases. The Solicitor General assures us that he will take up the matter with the Director, CBI, for providing adequate manpower and infrastructure to the said agency so that pending investigations can be completed at the earliest.“The CBI shall also take necessary steps to secure the appearance of the accused and provide necessary assistance to the CBI Courts for framing charges and to proceed further to conclude the trials. The CBI shall ensure that there is no lapse on its part in producing the prosecution witnesses..,” the bench had said in the order.According to a CBI report, 121 cases were pending trial before different CBI courts involving sitting and former MPs and 112 matters pending against serving and former MLAs.

13-11-2021||New Delhi||SC terms UP officers ‘arrogant’, paves way for arrest of two including finance secretary||Terming the officers as “very arrogant”, the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal of the Uttar Pradesh government on Saturday and paved the way for the arrest of the state finance secretary and the additional chief secretary (revenue) against whom the Allahabad High Court issued bailable warrants for delayed and partial compliance of orders.The matter is related to the regularisation of service and payment of arrears to a ‘collection amin’ at Allahabad.The high court, on November 1, observed that the officials have been treating the court as “playground” and have refused to grant arrears of salary to a person who was earlier denied the rightful claim of regularisation of service.“As the respondents (officers) have deliberately mislead the (High) Court and flouted the undertaking given by the Additional Advocate General in not granting arrears of salary to the petitioner, this Court records it distress and anguish about the reprehensible conduct of the respondents, and accordingly, believes that it a fit case to issue bailable warrant against Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue) and Sanjay Kumar, the then District Magistrate currently posted as Secretary (Finance), Government of U.P., Lucknow to appear before this Court on November 15. Let bailable warrant be issued against...,” the high court had ordered.The state government, which rushed to the top court, to save the top officials from getting arrested could not get the relief as a bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana said, “You deserve all this. More than that”.         “What are you arguing here in this matter. The High Court should have ordered arrest by now...we think more severe punishment was needed to be awarded. The high court has been gentle with you. Look at your conduct, you are depriving an employee of his arrears. You did nothing to abide by the orders. The High Court has been very kind to you ...you have no respect for the court. This Additional Chief Secretary appears to be very arrogant,” observed the bench which also comprised justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli.Additional Solicitor General Aishwaya Bhati, appearing for the officials, said that the service of the petitioner, Bhuneshwar Prasad Tiwari, as ‘collection amin’ has been regularised and the juniors, who were given regular employment ahead of him, have been removed and the only issue remained was that of payment of arrears of the salary.“Your Lordships may not take this view,” the law officer urged the court saying lenient view be taken in the case.“These all are matters of record and we are not saying anything which is not part of the records. Look at this, despite the court order, this additional chief secretary says that I will not grant the age relaxation,” a visibly-irked CJI observed.                 The officials resisted compliance in every possible way and they deserve what they get and more, the bench said.“You tell all this (argument) to the high court after you are arrested and produced. Dismissed,” the bench said.The case pertains to the denial of seniority benefit and consequential regularisation of service by state government officials to Tiwari as ‘collection amin’ in 2017.Several interim orders were passed by the high courts to ensure that the fourth grade employee gets justice in the form of regularisation of service and past arrears of salary.Sanjay Kumar, currently posted as the secretary (finance), allegedly did not do the needful despite repeated court orders, the high court had noted.“It appears that state officers of the rank of Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue) have treated the court as playground which is evident from the fact that despite the undertaking given by Additional Advocate General, the respondent has refused to grant arrears of salary to the petitioner to which he is entitled too, particularly in view of the fact that it is admitted on record that the petitioner has wrongly been denied regularisation due to fault and inaction on the part of the then District Magistrate, Sanjay Kumar,” the high court had said.According to the high court Kumar had “denied the claim of the petitioner very casually on the ground that since the process of regularisation had been completed, therefore, the claim of the petitioner shall be considered whenever next process is undertaken”.Acknowledging the fact that injustice has been done to Tiwari by not regularising him, the Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue) despite passing the order of November 25 reviewed its order and granted relaxation in age, and thereafter, the benefit of regularisation was extended to him, yet the officials have refused to grant him arrears of salary despite the fact that the employee was denied regularisation illegally, it had said.“This court is astonished and pained with the awful conduct of the respondents in getting the case adjourned by giving undertaking before this court through the Additional Advocate General and yet they flouted the undertaking at will by denying the petitioner arrears of the salary,” the high court had said while issuing the bailable warrant against the officials.“Put up this case on November 15, 2021, on which date the District Magistrate, Prayagraj shall remain present and let a copy of this order be sent to the Chief Judicial Magistrate concerned for compliance,” it had ordered. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-terms-up-officers-arrogant-paves-way-for-arrest-of-two-including-finance-secretary-337648
13-11-2021||New Delhi||I am not a sophisticated speaker, don’t have good English for expressing words: CJI Ramana||Chief Justice of India N V Ramana on Saturday said he is not a sophisticated speaker and learnt English in Class 8.The comment was in response to Solicitor General Tushar Mehta’s clarification that he was not even remotely suggesting that only farmers are responsible for air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region.“Unfortunately I am not a sophisticated speaker. This is my drawback as I learnt English in Class 8. I don’t have good English for expressing words. I studied law in the English language,” the chief justice told Mehta, who was appearing for the Centre. “The language in which our response as lawyers is taken might send the wrong message which was not the intention,” Mehta had said.He said he too had learnt his English in Class 8 and studied till graduation in Gujarati medium.“We are sailing in the same boat. My law was in English medium,” Mehta said.The apex court has termed the rise in air pollution in the Delhi-NCR region an “emergency” and asked the Centre and the Delhi government to take immediate measures to improve air quality, suggesting steps such as stopping vehicles and clamping a lockdown in the national capital.“We want the pollution to decrease ultimately. Nothing else,” the chief justice said.The bench, also comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant, said there are other reasons for pollution such as vehicular emissions, firecrackers and dust, and singling out stubble burning is not the solution.“Your projection is as if farmers are responsible for this pollution. Seventy per cent. First let the Delhi people be controlled. Where is the effective mechanism to control fire crackers, vehicle pollution etc?“We understand some per cent is stubble burning. Rest is crackers, vehicular pollution, industries, dust pollution etc. You tell us how to bring AQI levels from 500 to 200 points in Delhi. Take some immediate urgent measures like a two-day lockdown,” the bench said.The observations came while hearing a plea filed by environmental activist Aditya Dubey and law student Aman Banka, who sought directions to provide stubble-removing machines to small and marginal farmers for free.

13-11-2021||Karachi||20 Indian fishermen released from Pak jail; to be transported till Wagah border: Official||Twenty Indian fishermen, who were released recently after languishing in Pakistan’s Landhi jail, will be transported to the Wagah border on Sunday to be handed over to the Indian authorities so that they can return home, a senior official said on Saturday.The 20 fishermen, who hail from Gujarat and are part of 350 other Indian fishers who have completed their jail terms and will be released in batches, would be transported to the Wagah-Attari border on Sunday morning, a senior jail officer said.The Edhi Trust Foundation, a non-profit social welfare organisation, has made arrangements to safely transport the 20 Indian fishermen to the Wagah border.Faisal Edhi, the son of late Abdul Sattar Edhi the award winning philanthropist and social worker, said the foundation had made arrangements to send the Indian fishermen through a bus and would also give them gifts and some cash.“They are being released from the Landhi jail in Karachi,” he said.The fishermen were arrested by the Pakistan Maritime Security Force (PMSF) and handed over to the dock police for allegedly illegally fishing in Pakistani waters.Organisations working to get the poor Indian and Pakistani fishermen lodged in jails in both countries say around 600 Indian fishermen are languishing in Pakistani jails after being arrested by the PMSF.“Yes there are dozens of these poor Indian fishermen in the Landh and Malir jails,” Faisal confirmed.The jail authority also said the other 350 Indian fishermen would be released in batches once their nationalities are confirmed through the foreign office channels of both countries.The Pakistan government last year released a number of Indian fishermen in batches as a gesture of goodwill.

Earlier courts had issued warrants in cases of extortion registered at Goregaon in Mumbai and in neighbouring Thane against him.The IPS officer was shunted out from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in March this year after assistant police inspector Sachin Waze (now dismissed) was arrested in the case of the SUV with explosives found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai house, and subsequent death of businessman Mansukh Hiran.Singh subsequently accused then state home minister Anil Deshmukh of asking police officials to collect Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants in Mumbai.Deshmukh, who denied the allegation, stepped down as minister and is facing CBI probe.

Gaikwad was also sending prospective cheating victims to Gosavi,” said Senior Inspector Ashok Kadam of Pune Cantonment police station.The 2020 case registered with Pune Cantonment police station involves the cheating of three people to the tune of Rs 4.05 lakh on the pretext of giving them jobs in Malaysia.Gosavi, currently booked in cases registered with Pune Cantonment, Wanwadi and Faraskhana police stations, was also booked in a similar case by Bhosari police here, an official informed on Saturday.A Latur resident has complained to Bhosari police that Gosavi cheated him of Rs 2.25 lakh after promising a job in Brunei in 2015, the official added.Gosavi is in custody till November 17 in connection with the case registered in Pune Cantonment police station, he said.Gosavi is a witness in the drug bust on October 2 on board a cruise ship off the coast of Mumbai, in which the accused include Aryan Khan, the son of film superstar Shah Rukh Khan.

13-11-2021||Varanasi||Hindi is friend of all Indian languages, says Home Minister Amit Shah||Hindi is a friend of all indigenous languages and India’s prosperity lies in the prosperity of all its languages, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said on Saturday.Addressing the All-India Rajbhasha conference here, Shah also said a country that cannot preserve its languages, cannot preserve its culture and organic thought process either.Thus, he said, it is very important for everyone to preserve and nurture all of India’s languages.“Hindi is the friend (sakhee) of all indigenous languages (swabhasha). India’s prosperity lies in the prosperity of our Indian languages,” he said.The home minister said a sense of inferiority complex was instilled in the minds of some children who couldn’t speak English.Shah said it is his firm belief that the time is not far when those who cannot speak their mother tongue will feel inferiority complex.The home minister said once the people of the country decide and its languages become the language of the governance, India will automatically get back the knowledge trove of Maharishi Patanjali and Panini.He said there is a need to rid youths of the inferiority complex instilled during British rule.“We need to create an environment wherein people take pride in speaking their mother tongue,” he said.The home minister also said efforts were made to create a lot of controversies around the Hindi language but that time is over now.Shah said the conversation and development of Indian languages is a central pillar of the National Education Policy and the syllabi of engineering and medical courses have been translated into eight Indian languages so far.“Today, I feel very proud to say that not even a single file is written in English in the Union Home Ministry. We have completely adopted the official language (Hindi),” he said.Terming Hindi as ‘sakhee’ (friend) of all indigenous languages, he emphasised that there cannot be any ‘antarvirodh’ (differences) among friends.“There are no differences between Hindi and our indigenous languages. Hindi is the friend of all indigenous languages and there cannot be differences among friends,” he reiterated.“This is a year for the Hindi lovers to take a pledge that by the time we complete 100 years of Independence, indigenous languages and Raj Bhasha (official language) should become so strong that we do not need to take the help of a foreign language,” he said.Shah said that Hindi has been unable to accomplish its full growth and destine status in an independent India.“This work should have been accomplished immediately after the Independence,” he said.“There are three pillars of Independence—‘swaraj’ (self-rule), ‘swadeshi’ (use of domestic products) and ‘swabhasha’ (indigenous language). We have got ‘swaraj’, but ‘swadeshi’ and ‘swabhasha’ have lagged behind,” he observed.Shah said though Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken steps to ensure the growth of ‘swadeshi’, ‘swabhasha’ has lagged behind.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the first time spoke about swadeshi through Make in India. One of our aims, which got left behind was ‘swabhasha’. We must remember it, and make it a part of our life,” he said.Shah also lauded Prime Minister Modi for promoting Hindi across the world.“No Prime Minister has got so much of global accolades as much as Narendra Modi ji. He has put forth India’s point of view in the world in Raj Bhasha (Hindi) and has enhanced the pride of the Raj Bhasha,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hindi-is-friend-of-all-indian-languages-says-home-minister-amit-shah-337633

A complaint from Muslim petitioners objected to negative stereotyping of the community in films.Iqbal Singh Lalpura, National Commission for Minorities chairperson, told The Tribune there was no provision for appointing minority community members on the censor board.“The NCM proposes that minority community leaders having knowledge of the history and philosophy of their communities be appointed to the CBFC so that they can pay due attention to sensitivities while certifying films.

Bhupender Yadav, Environment MinisterClimate activists, however, criticised “watered-down commitments to end the use of coal and other fossil fuels”, saying “we don’t believe their pledges and promises”.Officials insisted that language around fossil fuels may be “softened”, but the inclusion of a commitment in the final deal will be seen as a “landmark moment”.The final text can be expected late tonight (UK time) or tomorrow.The Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) officially concluded, but past records suggest that negotiations may spill over to Saturday.A deal must be agreed at the key summit for limiting visible effects of global warming across the world.Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav today reiterated India’s stance. “Negotiations to fight climate change at COP26 have been happening in an atmosphere of cooperation and mutual respect for each other’s ideas, strengths and constraints.“Each side has put its point across the table emphatically because clarity is critical to positive and meaningful outcomes,” he said, reiterating that “wealthy nations that reaped the benefits of early industrialisation by burning fossil fuels and growing their economies for centuries must accommodate the concerns and needs of the economies that need to make the switch to clean and green energy”.The world must start acting together on four areas — temperature, mitigation, finance and responsibility to fight climate change, the minister said.The new draft reaffirms the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levelsHowever, instead of “urging” countries to revisit the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions (as necessitated to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022), the new draft uses the word “request”, according to reports.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cop26-fresh-draft-reaffirms-1-5%C2%B0c-target-337333
13-11-2021||Washington||Spouses of H-1B visa-holders to get automatic work permits: US||In yet another immigration-friendly move that would benefit thousands of Indian-Americans, the Biden administration has agreed to provide automatic work authorisation permits to the spouses of H-1B visa-holders, most of whom are Indian IT professionals.An H-4 visa is issued by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to immediate family members (spouse and children under 21 years of age) of the H-1B visa-holders. The visa is normally issued to those who have already started the process of seeking employment-based lawful permanent resident status in the US. The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. A settlement was reached by the Department of Homeland Security in a class-action lawsuit, which was filed by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) on behalf of immigrant spouses this summer. “This (H-4 visa holders) is a group that always met the regulatory test for automatic extension of EADs (employment authorisation documents), but the agency previously prohibited them from that benefit and forced them to wait for reauthorisation. People were suffering. They were losing their jobs for absolutely no legitimate reason causing harm to them and US businesses,” Jon Wasden from AILA said. The litigation successfully achieved the reversal of the USCIS policy that prohibited H-4 spouses from benefiting from the automatic extension of their employment authorisation during the pendency of stand-alone EAD applications. — PTIIndians will Benefit||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/spouses-of-h-1b-visa-holders-to-get-automatic-work-permits-us-337338

The 15,000-km border has peculiar problems. Ajit Doval, NSAThe National Security Adviser noted India’s sovereignty stretched as far as the last police station’s jurisdiction from the coastal areas to the border areas. Incidentally, his comments came a day after the Punjab Assembly adopted a resolution opposing the Centre’s notification that extended the jurisdiction of the Border Security Force (BSF), calling it an “insult” to the state police and seeking its withdrawal.Opinion: BSF imbroglio in Punjabby Gurbachan JagatThe Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had last month amended the BSF Act and issued a notification authorising the border guarding force to undertake search, seizure and arrest within a 50-km stretch, up from the existing 15 km, from the international border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. “It’s not just policing about which you (IPS officers) have been trained, but you will be responsible for border management… (we have) 15,000-km border stretch, most parts of which have peculiar problems,” the NSA said. Noting that wars had ceased to become an effective instrument, Doval said it was the civil society that could be subverted, divided and manipulated “to hurt the interests of the nation”.“This has now become a new war frontier. If internal security fails, no country can be great. If people are not safe, they cannot rise to the potential and probably the country will never grow,” he said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amid-bsf-row-ajit-doval-pitches-for-bigger-police-role-in-border-management-337339

I have almost got it done. We are working something out,” Salve told the Bench, which also included Justice Surya Kant and Justice Hima Kohli.Accepting Salve’s request, the top court ordered the matter to be listed on Monday (November 15). Four farmers were run over by an SUV in Lakhimpur Kheri while a demonstration was being held against UP Deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit on October 3. Two BJP workers and a driver were beaten to death, allegedly by angry protesters. A local journalist was also killed in the violence.Ten persons, including Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra’s son Ashish Mishra, have been arrested in the case by an SIT set up by the UP Government. Dissatisfied with the probe into the case, the top court had on November 8 suggested that a retired judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court be appointed to monitor it till the filing of a chargesheet.Noting that it was not confident about the manner in which evidence was being recorded by the UP SIT, the Bench had said it wanted to appoint former Punjab and Haryana High Court Judge Ranjit Singh or JusticeRK Jain to oversee the manner in which statements of witnesses were being recorded.“It (probe) is not going the way we expected,” the Bench had noted while asking Salve to seek instructions from the UP Government on the issue.“The prima facie view we get is that one particular accused is being benefited by recording statements of witnesses in a particular manner...

Bench“We are holding the Army guilty of contempt of court. We are putting you on guard. Since you have not complied with our orders, you will have to face the consequences. The Army may be supreme in its own authority, but this constitutional court is also supreme in its own jurisdiction,” a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said.As the Bench was dictating the order, Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain informed it that he had got instruction that the Army was willing to grant PC to 11 officers who filed contempt petitions even as petitioners’ counsel demanded that all eligible officers be granted PC. Later, Jain clarified that the Army was willing to grant PC to all WSSCOs fulfilling the criteria set by the top court’s March 25 order, irrespective of whether they moved the court or not.The Bench directed the Army to issue orders in 10 days for the grant of PC to 11 officers who had moved the court, and in three weeks for those who didn’t approach the court. The Bench, which chose not to go ahead with the contempt proceedings against the COAS, appreciated Jain for resolving the issue. It said all individual cases would be dealt with in accordance with law. On October 22, the top court had ordered the Centre and the Army to grant PC to 39 WSSCOs within a week and directed them to submit details of 25 other such officers, explaining the reasons why they were not considered. With today’s direction, 68 of total 71 WSSCOs denied the PC would be granted the same. One woman officer had opted out, while three were found medically unfit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-agrees-to-permanent-commission-for-eligible-women-officers-after-supreme-court-rap-337341
13-11-2021||New Delhi||Air quality in Delhi-NCR on brink of 'emergency', people advised to limit outdoor activities||Authorities on Friday advised people to limit outdoor activities and told government and private offices to cut vehicle use by at least 30 per cent as air quality in Delhi-NCR inched towards the 'emergency' level amid a rise in emissions from farm fires and unfavourable meteorological conditions.Over 4,000 farm fires, accounting for 35 per cent of Delhi’s pollution on Friday, played a major role in pushing the 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) to 471 by 4 pm, the worst this season so far. It was 411 on Thursday.A sub-committee on Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) said meteorological conditions will be highly unfavourable for dispersion of pollutants till November 18 and agencies concerned must be fully ready to implement measures under ‘emergency’ category.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) said the 24-hour average concentration of lung-damaging fine particles known as PM2.5 in Delhi-NCR crossed the 300 mark around midnight and stood at 381 micrograms per cubic metre at 4 pm on Friday, over six times the safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre.The PM10 level was recorded at 577 micrograms per cubic metre, over five times the safe limit of 100 micrograms per cubic metre.According to GRAP, the air quality is considered to be in the ‘emergency’ category if the PM2.5 and PM10 levels continue to be above 300 micrograms per cubic metre and 500 micrograms per cubic metre, respectively, for 48 hours or more.After reviewing the situation, the sub-committee on GRAP said, “Government and private offices and other establishments are advised to reduce vehicle usage by at least 30 per cent (by working from home, carpooling, optimising field activities etc). People are advised to limit outdoor activities and minimise their exposure.”                “Concerned agencies must be in complete readiness for implementation of measures under ‘emergency’ category as per GRAP (Graded Response Action Plan),” an order issued by the committee read.The GRAP—a set of anti-pollution measures followed in Delhi and its vicinity according to the severity of the situation – comes into force in mid-October when air quality levels start worsening.The measures to be followed in the ‘emergency’ situation include stopping the entry of trucks in Delhi, ban on construction activities and introducing the odd-even car rationing scheme.CPCB Member Secretary Prashant Gargava observed that in view of unfavourable meteorology, stubble burning and poor dispersion resulting in accumulation of pollutants, the coming week is critical regarding Delhi-NCR’s air quality.The CPCB said an action-taken report is received daily from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana Pollution Control Boards but these are awaited from Delhi Pollution Control Committee and Rajasthan State Pollution Control Board.According to an analysis by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, people in Delhi breathe the worst air between November 1 and November 15 every year. The City has recorded severe air quality on six of the last eight days after Diwali.Faridabad (460), Ghaziabad (486), Greater Noida (478), Gurgaon (448) and Noida (488) also recorded severe air quality at 4 pm on Friday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.A layer of eye-stinging smog lingering over Delhi-NCR thickened on Friday, giving an orange tint to the sun and lowering visibility to 200 metres at several places in the region.India Meteorological Department officials said moderate fog and low temperatures in the morning—a low of 12.6 degrees Celsius on Friday—and calm winds have been trapping pollutants close to the ground.“Visibility levels at the Indira Gandhi International Airport and the Safdarjung Airport dropped to 200-500 metres due to moderate fog. It intensified on Friday due to high humidity,” an official said.Green think tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) has said the ongoing smog episode is a public health emergency and could be the longest in four years. In another report, it said vehicles accounted for more than 50 per cent of Delhi’s pollution from October 24 to November 8.According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality forecasting agency SAFAR, stubble burning has accounted for at least 25 per cent of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution for nine days on the trot, starting November 4.Gufran Beig, the founder project director of SAFAR, said stubble burning generally contributes to PM2.5 but this time its coarser particles in PM10 are also becoming a lead pollutant at several locations in Delhi.“This is a new feature in the winter. This is mainly because of the particle growth mechanism due to high humidity at night and increased humidity during the day probably due to water sprinkling which increases the holding capacity of the air. Since the flow is regular, many PM2.5 particles are growing towards PM10 (sic),” he said.The share of farm fire in Delhi’s pollution had increased to 48 per cent on Sunday, the highest since November 5, 2018, when it was 58 per cent.Last year, the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution had peaked at 42 per cent on November 5. In 2019, it accounted for 44 per cent of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution on November 1.Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Friday launched the second leg of the campaign to control dust pollution. On Thursday, he had launched a month-long campaign to prevent the open burning of waste and biomass in the city.

13-11-2021||Lucknow||Former UP Minister Gayatri Prajapati, 2 others get life term in gang-rape case||Former Uttar Pradesh Minister Gayatri Prajapati and two others were sentenced to life imprisonment by a special court here on Friday for gang-raping a woman and her minor daughter.The special court for lawmakers headed by Additional Sessions Judge P K Rai also imposed a fine of Rs 2 lakh on each convict.Prajapati and two other convicts Ashok Tiwari and Ashish Shukla were present in the court when it pronounced the quantum of sentence against them.Judge Rai had on Wednesday held Prajapati, a key figure in the previous Akhilesh Yadav government, and his accomplices guilty of gang-raping the woman and her minor daughter.It had said the prosecution has been able to prove charges against them beyond a reasonable doubt.The court had found all the three guilty of committing gang-rape under Section 376 (D) of the IPC and making “gang penetrative sexual assault on a child” under section 5 (g) read with section 6 of the POSCO Act.The Section 6 of the POCSO Act provides for the punishment for gang-raping a minor girl. The punishment ranges from at least a 10-year jail term to life imprisonment.Prajapati held transport and mining portfolios in the Akhilesh Yadav cabinet and was arrested in March 2017. He had been in jail since then.During the hearing on Friday on the quantum of sentence, the counsel for Prajapati and others earlier pleaded before the court for leniency in awarding the sentence.But the prosecution counsel opposed it vehemently, arguing that Prajapati was a minister in the government when he committed the offence along with his accomplices and “if a man on such a responsible post commits this kind of offence, misusing his power and position, the court should deal with him sternly to give a message to the society”.The three convicts now have the option of challenging their conviction and sentence in the high court.While convicting the trio on Wednesday, Judge Rai had acquitted four others—Vikas Verma, Roopeshwar, Amrendra Singh, alias Pintu, and Chandrapal—due to lack of evidence.The prosecution had produced 17 witnesses in the case.While holding the trio, the court had also directed the Lucknow police commissioner to ascertain the circumstances in which the rape victim and two other witnesses had changed their statements time and again during the trial.While deposing before the court, the victim had initially supported her allegation of gang-rape in the FIR, but during her cross-examination, she had retracted from it.The court, however, relied on her initial deposition while convicting the trio.The FIR against the minister was registered at the Gautampalli police station here on Feb 18, 2017 on the directions of the Supreme Court, which had given its order on the woman’s plea against the police inaction over her complaint.The woman had claimed that the minister and his accomplices have been raping her since October 2014 and she decided to complain against them after they targetted her minor daughter as well in July 2016.

13-11-2021||Mumbai||Opposition slams Kangana Ranaut’s comments on freedom struggle; demands withdrawal of Padma Shri||The NCP on Friday demanded the revocation of Padma Shri conferred on actor Kangana Ranaut for her controversial remarks on Independence and said she should be booked for insulting freedom fighters.Taking a dig, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said the actor is talking too much after an excess dose of “Malana cream”, a type of hashish that draws its name from Malana valley in Himachal Pradesh.“We strongly condemn this statement, which has insulted lakhs of freedom fighters, those who have sacrificed their lives. From Gandhiji to other freedom fighters who waged a long battle for freedom, all have been insulted. We demand that her Padma Shri be revoked. She should be booked for insulting freedom fighters,” Malik said.Ranaut, at a recent event, said the Independence India obtained in 1947 was “bheek” (alms) and that the country truly became free in 2014, a reference to the BJP coming to power at the Centre under Narendra Modi.Maha Vikas Aghadi allies and a Gandhi kin on Friday slammed Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut for her 'real freedom' remark and demanded that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central government arrest her and take back all state honours/awards given to her.Leaders of the Shiv Sena-Nationalist Congress Party-Congress lashed out at Ranaut—who was recently conferred the Padma Shri by President Ram Nath Kovind—"for her apparent ignorance of history and facts".Great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, Tushar A. Gandhi said that Kangana is "an agent of hate, intolerance and rabidity", so it is not surprising she feels that India got her 'real freedom' in 2014 (when the BJP government came to power)."Hatred, bigotry, sham patriotism and oppression were liberated in India in 2014 and a very poisonous and vicious ideology gained dominance, personified by Prime Minister Narendra Modi," Tushar Gandhi said without mincing words.Sena MP and Chief Spokesperson Sanjay Raut said, "Kangana has insulted the nation which is celebrating the 75th jubilee of Indian Independence this year and must apologise to the whole country"."She says that India's freedom in 1947 was a 'bheekh' (dole). So does she mean that all the freedom fighters who have been honoured with the 'Tamra Patra' and other awards are beggars? She has defamed and maligned the whole country," Raut said.NCP's National Spokesperson and Minorities Affairs Minister Nawab Malik said the actress may have been under the influence of narcotics when she made the comments -- referring to Kangana's past 'confession' that she used to be a drug addict."It seems that Kangana Ranaut took a heavy dose of Malana Cream before she spoke.. She should be immediately arrested," Malik said sarcastically, hinting at the actress' home-state Himachal Pradesh where the drug (Malana Cream) is produced.Condemning Kangana's comments, Congress General Secretary Sachin Sawant said: "This is the BJP's version of 'Jhansi Ki Rani' who dares to slander the freedom struggle and sacrifices of the martyrs by her 'Azaadi bheek me mili hai' statement now." "It's a pity that such puppets are being nurtured by the BJP deliberately. These puppets  are not the real culprits but their master is," Sawant said.Other leaders like Kishore Tiwari, Atul Londhe-Patil, Krishna Hegde and more have also attacked the actress for her remarks on a public forum and demanded a clarification from the BJP on her stand.Tushar Gandhi added that since 2014, the purveyors of hate got official sanction to freely propagate their toxic ideology."It is not surprising that such statements were made in a function attended by the PM. After all, today, the PMO has become the 'fountain of hate' that flows abundantly in India," he said.—Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-slams-kangana-ranauts-comments-on-freedom-struggle-demands-withdrawal-of-padma-shri-337243
13-11-2021||Satya Prakash||After SC warning, Army agrees to grant Permanent Commission to eligible women officers||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 12The Army on Friday agreed to grant Permanent Commission (PC) to all eligible Women Short Service Commission Officers (WSSCO) after the Supreme court threatened to initiate contempt action against Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Manoj Mukund Naravane for failure to comply with its orders.“We are holding the Army guilty of contempt of court. We are putting you on guard. Since you have not complied with our orders, you will have to face the consequences. The Army may be supreme in its own authority but this constitutional court is also supreme in its own jurisdiction, a Bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud said.As the Bench was dictating the order, Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain informed it that he had got instruction that the Army was willing to grant the PC to 11 officers who filed contempt petitions, even as petitioners’ counsel demanded that all eligible officers should be granted PC.Later, Jain clarified that the Army was willing to grant PC to all WSSCOs fulfilling the criteria set out by the top court’s March 25 order, irrespective of whether they moved the court or not. The Army authorities wanted the matter to be put to rest today itself and they did not want any more litigation on the issue, Jain added.The Bench directed the Army to issue orders in 10 days for grant of Permanent Commission to 11 officers who had moved the court and in three weeks for those who didn’t approach the court.The Bench—which chose not to go ahead with the contempt proceedings against the COAS—appreciated Jain for resolving the issue. It said all individual cases will be dealt with in accordance with law.Earlier, the top court had on October 22 ordered the Centre and the Army to grant PC to 39 WSSCOs in the Army within a week and directed them to submit details of 25 other such officers, explaining the reasons why they were not considered.With Friday’s direction, 68 out of the total 71 WSSCOs denied PC will be granted the same. One woman officer had opted out, while three were found medically unfit.In a landmark verdict, the top court had on February 17, 2020, directed that WSSCOs be granted PC. It had rejected the Centre’s stand of their physiological limitations as being based on “sex stereotypes” and “gender discrimination against women”.On March 25 this year, it had directed the Army to consider granting PC to WSSCOs subject to their obtaining 60 per cent marks in the assessment subjects, being found fit on medical criteria as per the August 1, 2020, order of the Army and having received disciplinary and vigilance clearances. It had directed that all serving SSC women officers be considered for PCs in three months, irrespective of them having crossed 14 years or, as the case may be, 20 years of service.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/after-sc-warning-army-agrees-to-grant-permanent-commission-to-eligible-women-officers-337238
13-11-2021||---||Hindutva and Hinduism are two different concepts, says Rahul Gandhi amid Khurshid row; BJP hits back||New Delhi, November 12Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday maintained that Hinduism and Hindutva are “different things” and slammed the ideology of the BJP-RSS alleging it has spread hatred in India, drawing a sharp retort from the BJP which claimed that the Congress leadership nurses a “pathological hatred” for Hinduism.Observing that his party’s ideology is alive and vibrant and is like a “beautiful jewel” with an unending power inside it, but it has been overshadowed by the BJP, Gandhi also said in today’s India, ideological fight has become very important.“Is Hinduism about beating a Sikh, or a Muslim. Hindutva, of course, is. In which book is it written? I have not seen it. I have read the Upanishads. I have not read it,” Gandhi said, as he sought to draw a distinction between Hinduism and Hindutva, a term widely used by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh(RSS).“What is the difference between Hinduism as we know it and Hindutva. Are they the same thing. Can they be the same thing. If they are the same thing, why don’t they have the same name. Why do they have a different name. Why do you use the word Hinduism, why not just use Hindutva if they are the same thing.They are obviously different things”.The remarks by Gandhi that escalated the political heat between the BJP and the Congress ahead of the assembly polls in five states including Uttar Pradesh came a day after senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid sparked a row by comparing a “robust version” of Hindutva to the jihadist Islam of terror groups such as the ISIS and Boko Haram. Khurshid, who stood by his remarks made in his new book on Ayodhya verdict, had come under attack on Thursday from the BJP as well as his party colleague Ghulam Nabi Azad.Gandhi said that if crystallized, the Congress ideology will envelope that of the BJP-RSS, and emphasised on strengthening his party’s ideas within the organisation and spreading them across the country.Gandhi was addressing online a four-day ‘AICC orientation programme’ organised at Sevagram Ashram in Wardha in Maharashtra. Congress representatives from across the states are participating in the event.“We have to accept that there are two ideologies in India - the Congress ideology and the RSS ideology. We have to accept the BJP-RSS has spread hatred in today’s India.”                “The BJP has overshadowed the loving, affectionate and nationalistic ideology of the Congress party. Our ideology is alive and vibrant, but it has been overshadowed by the BJP,” said the Lok Sabha MP from Wayanad in Kerala.“It has been overshadowed partly because of complete capture of the media and complete capture of the Indian nation. It has also been overshadowed as we have not propagated our ideology among our own people aggressively.”BJP hits back at RahulMeanwhile, the BJP hit back at Rahul over ‘Hindutva’ remarks calling him “anti-Hindu”. Rahul and the Congress have a "pathological hatred" of Hinduism, alleged BJP’s Sambit Patra amid a row over Salman Khurshid’s book on Ayodhya. The party also slammed Rahsid Alvi over his remarks, recounting all Congress leaders talking “ill” of the community. Patra said Gandhi had a history of criticising ‘Hinduism’ and its culture, and that it was in the Congress' “character to attack Hindus and spread hate in the society”. “It is in the character of the Congress and the Gandhi family to attack Hinduism at every opportunity. What they say is not a coincidence but an experiment, and the headmaster of this experimental lab is Rahul Gandhi,” he claimed. “There is a pathological hatred for Hinduism among Congress leaders... and they get traction for this from the Gandhi family,” he alleged.On Gandhi differentiating between ‘Hinduism’ and ‘Hindutva’, Patra said: “Can they talk on similar lines about other religions…of course not. They cannot talk of similar issues in any other religion. The question is why do they talk ill of Hinduism all the time,” he said, citing terms like “saffron terror”  used by senior leaders on “directions” of Rahul Gandhi. Patra also referred to a comment made public as part of WikiLeaks in which Gandhi reportedly told the then US Ambassador that extremist Hindu ideology was a bigger threat than Lashkar-e-Toiba. —with PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hindutva-and-hinduism-are-two-different-concepts-says-rahul-gandhi-amid-khurshid-row-bjp-hits-back-337233
13-11-2021||---||Supreme Court gives UP time till Monday to appoint ex-judge to supervise Lakhimpur probe||New Delhi, November 12The Supreme Court on Friday gave time till Monday to the Uttar Pradesh Government to spell out its stand on the court’s suggestion to appoint a retired judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court to monitor the probe into the Lakhimpur Kheri violence.At the outset of the hearing, senior counsel Harish Salve – representing the UP Government – requested a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana to grant time till Monday to work it out. “Would your Lordships give me time till Monday? I have almost got it done. We are working something out,” Salve told the Bench, which also included Justice Surya Kant Justice Hima Kohli.Accepting Salve’s request, the top court ordered the matter to be listed on Monday, November 15.Four farmers were mowed down by an SUV in Lakhimpur Kheri when those against farm laws were holding a demonstration against Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit on October 3. Two BJP workers and a driver were beaten to death allegedly by angry protesters. A local journalist was also killed in the violence.Ten people, including Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra's son Ashish Mishra, have been arrested in the case by an SIT set up by the Uttar Pradesh government.Dissatisfied with the probe into the case, the top court had on November 8 suggested that a retired judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court be appointed to monitor it till filing of a chargesheet.Noting that it was not confident about the manner in which evidence was being recorded by the UP SIT, the Bench had said it wanted to appoint former Punjab and Haryana High Court Judge Ranjit Singh or Justice RK Jain to oversee the manner in which statements of witnesses were being recorded. "It (probe) is not going the way we expected," the Bench had noted while asking Salve to seek instructions from the UP Government on the issue."The prima facie view we get is that one particular accused is being benefited by recording statements of witnesses in a particular manner...What will happen to the investigation then?" it had wondered.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-gives-up-time-till-monday-to-appoint-ex-judge-to-supervise-lakhimpur-probe-337189
13-11-2021||New Delhi||Madness or treason; Varun Gandhi's swipe at Kangana Ranaut; shares video of actor||Actor Kangana Ranaut kicked off a firestorm on Thursday for declaring that India attained “real freedom” in 2014, when the Modi-led government came to power, and describing the country's Independence in 1947 as “bheek”, or alms.The “Manikarnika” actor, known for provocative and often inflammatory statements, was once again the centre of debate – and ire – with politicians across the spectrum, including BJP MP Varun Gandhi, among the host of social media users and others who reacted with outrage for her comments at an event on Wednesday evening.BJP's Pilibhit MP Varun Gandhi shared a video of Ranaut's remarks on his Twitter handle. In a 24-second clip distributed widely, Ranaut says India's Independence in 1947 was not freedom but "bheek" (alms). "And we got real freedom in 2014," she said at the event organised by a news channel with some people in the audience heard clapping."It is an anti-national act and must be called out as  such. To not do so would be a betrayal of all those who shed blood so that today we may stand tall and free as a nation," Gandhi said in his tweet in Hindi.कभी महात्मा गांधी जी के त्याग और तपस्या का अपमान, कभी उनके हत्यारे का सम्मान, और अब शहीद मंगल पाण्डेय से लेकर रानी लक्ष्मीबाई, भगत सिंह, चंद्रशेखर आज़ाद, नेताजी सुभाष चंद्र बोस और लाखों स्वतंत्रता सेनानियों की कुर्बानियों का तिरस्कार। इस सोच को मैं पागलपन कहूँ या फिर देशद्रोह? pic.twitter.com/Gxb3xXMi2Z  People can never forget the infinite sacrifices of our freedom movement and the millions of lives lost and families destroyed, he added. Belittling it all in this “shameless manner” cannot be condoned simply as a careless or callous statement, he said."Sometimes an insult to the sacrifice and penance of Mahatma Gandhi, sometimes showing respect to his killer and now this disdain for the sacrifice of millions of freedom fighters from Shaheed Mangal Pandey to Rani Laxmibai, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekhar Azad, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose and others... "Should I call this kind of thinking madness or treason?"  the Lok Sabha MP asked.The ever combative Ranaut, whose Twitter account has been suspended, hit back on Instagram."Even though I clearly mentioned 1857 revolution first freedom fight which was curbed... which lead to more atrocities and cruelties from the British and almost a century later freedom was given to us in Gandhi's begging bowl... Ja aur roo ab," she said in her Insta stories.Ranaut, who was awarded a Padma Shri earlier this week, also targeted  the Congress in her remarks at the show."If we get freedom as a 'bheek', is it even freedom? What the British left behind in the name of Congress... They were the extension of the British...,” she said."This statement is an insult to our freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives for India's Independence. Shame on you Kangana!" said Congress' Salman Nizami.Salman Soz pointed out in his Twitter post that some people clapped when Ranaut said India's real independence was in 2014 because 1947 was a charity case. He also recalled the millions who “resisted the British, those who were killed or jailed, those who loved India”."Today is Malauna Azad's Birth anniversary. He gave up his whole life for India's independence. He was also Independent India's first education minister. Today is National Education Day -what a day to hear this gem from #wassap educated joker aka #KanganaRanaut," added Yasmin Kidwai, a Congress worker.Shiv Sena leader Priyanka Chaturvedi compared Ranaut's remarks to another BJP member who recently claimed that India has been given freedom as lease for 99 years.Chaturvedi said, "New Ruchi Pathak on the block. From 99 years lease to bheek main mili azaadi. All the blood, sweat and balidan (sacrifice) of our freedom fighters including Jhansi ki Rani dismissed to please the master. The WhatsApp history fans."   Aam Aadmi Party's Preeti Sharma Menon said she had submitted an application to the Mumbai Police requesting action against Ranaut for her "seditious and inflammatory statements under Sections 504, 505 and 124A". While Section 504 of the IPC deals “Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace”, Section 505 is related to statements to create "public mischief" and 124A deals with sedition. “Hope to see some action. @CPMumbai @DGPMaharashtra,” she tweeted,     Ranaut may not be on Twitter but her name was trending with many, including historian S Irfan Habib, weighing in with their views."Shamelessness is abysmal," Habib wrote.Actor Swara Bhasker, who also shared the video clip on her Twitter page, wondered about those who were heard clapping at Ranaut's comments."Who are the idiots who are clapping is what I want to know," wrote Bhasker, who has worked with Ranaut in the "Tanu Weds Manu" film series and has been a critic of the actor.Others, too, were furious, some questioning her recent Padma Shri award."Will we now start celebrating a new Independence Day?" asked filmmaker Onir Without naming the actor, badminton player Jwala Gutta wrote, "What do you call a person who only spews venom when she/he opens their mouth!!! Just curious!!"           Radio jockey Sayema admitted that Ranaut, a multiple award winning actor, was good. “Even though, she is a good actor, I will NEVER watch Kangana Ranaut's performances. Period,” she said.Lawyer Aman Wadud said it was a well thought out statement from the actor."Ground being prepared to attack the Constitution. Well-thought-out statement, don't make the mistake to read this in isolation."           A social media user said the "nonsense talk" by the Padma Shri winner was a "direct disrespect to all our freedom fighters".
