03-11-2021||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality very poor for 2nd day on trot, predicted to turn worse on Diwali||Delhi’s air quality, which remained “very poor” for the second consecutive day today, is expected to worsen over the next two days even if no firecrackers are burst on Diwali on Wednesday.The authorities say even under a zero-firecracker emission scenario, Delhi’s PM2.5 concentration may land at the upper end of the ‘very poor’ category between November 4 and November 6.However, if 50 per cent of the firecracker load of 2019, it may even degrade to the ‘severe’ category in the period.Though there appears to be some decrease in stubble burning incidents (a main contributing factor to Delhi’s pollution) as compared to last year, the Centre’s air quality forecast agency SAFAR says the wind direction is changing from Friday. Winds from the Northwest will carry smoke particles from farms of Punjab and Haryana. Meanwhile, “very calm local Delhi wind conditions with little ventilation are expected for the next three days”,  SAFAR said.Therefore, the PM 2.5 concentration runs the risk of surpassing 500 micrograms per cubic metre on November 5 as compared to the safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre.SAFAR said 3,271 farm fires accounted for 8 per cent of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution on Wednesday. It is likely to increase to 20 per cent on Thursday and further to 35-40 per cent on Friday and Saturday with the wind direction changing to Northwest. Last year, the share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution peaked at 42 per cent on November 5.In 2019, crop residue burning accounted for 44 per cent of Delhi’s PM2.5 pollution on November 1.As per the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), incidents of stubble burning have come down by over 51 per cent this season so far compared to the corresponding period last year.“Paddy residue burning events in Punjab, Haryana, NCR districts of UP and Rajasthan and Delhi have come down from 43,918 in 2020 to 21,364 in 2021 during the period from September 15 to November 2,” it saidThe reduction in fire counts is 51.35 per cent in the current year compared to the corresponding period last year. Between October 27 and November 2 this year, only 12,853 farm fires have been recorded as against 23,628 cases in the corresponding period of 2020, a reduction of 10,775 cases, Enforcement agencies have inspected 8,575 sites in Punjab, Haryana and NCR districts of Uttar Pradesh and an environmental compensation of around Rs 58 lakh has been imposed for crop residue burning, the panel added.Meanwhile, amid the ongoing controversy, Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai appealed to opposition parties not to link the bursting of firecrackers to religion and jeopardise the wellbeing of children and the elderly for political ambitions. He also appealed to the Centre to issue an advisory to Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to mandatorily stop stubble burning during the Diwali period. Rai alleged some people of opposition parties are trying to sabotage the AAP government’s fight against pollution by linking firecracker bursting to religion.“It was not a matter of religion but people’s lives,” he said.“The Arvind Kejriwal government is working to take care of the religious sentiments of people and to save children and the elderly simultaneously,” he added.AQIAccording to the Central Pollution Control Board data, Delhi recorded a 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) of 314. It was 303 on Tuesday and 281 on Monday. Neighbourhood Faridabad (337), Gurgaon (330), Ghaziabad (353) and Noida (327) also recorded very poor air quality.AQI between zero and 50 is considered ‘good’, 51 and 100 ‘satisfactory’, 101 and 200 ‘moderate’, 201 and 300 ‘poor’, 301 and 400 ‘very poor’, and 401 and 500 ‘severe’.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhis-air-quality-very-poor-for-2nd-day-on-trot-predicted-to-turn-worse-on-diwali-333848

03-11-2021||New Delhi||Centre releases 1.11 lakh tonnes of buffer onion so far to help cool down retail prices||The Centre on Wednesday said it has so far released 1.11 lakh tonnes of onion from its buffer stock in major markets across the country, which helped cool down the retail prices by Rs 5-12 per kg.The buffer onion was released in major markets such as Delhi, Kolkata, Lucknow, Patna, Ranchi, Guwahati, Bhubaneshwar, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Mumbai, Chandigarh, Kochi and Raipur.In addition, onion was disposed of in local markets in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, it added.“Onion prices are being also stabilised through buffer stock. ...Efforts of the Centre to ease onion prices is now bearing results,” the consumer affairs ministry said in a statement.Onion prices are now cheaper than last year as the average all India retail price of the key kitchen staple is ruling at Rs 40.13 per kg, while in wholesale market it is at Rs 31.15 per kg, it said.A total of 1,11,376.17 tonnes of onion from the buffer stock was in major markets till November 2, it added.As per the ministry data, the intervention has helped cool down retail prices by Rs 5-12 per kg so far.For instance in Delhi, retail onion prices have fallen to Rs 44 per kg on November 3 from the high of Rs 49 on October 20.

03-11-2021||New Delhi||Ahead of assembly polls in UP, Punjab, Uttarakhand, ‘concerned’ BJP to analyse results, contemplate action||Concerned over the election results from North, or the Hindi heartland, the BJP-led Centre appears to be contemplating actions to blunt people’s anger over issues, including rising prices of essential commodities and fuel costs. While BJP leaders are attributing setbacks in Himachal Pradesh, West Bengal, and Rajasthan to “issues related to ticket distribution, internal sabotage and infighting in local units”, observers say farmers’ agitation and prices may affect saffron prospects in polls early next year, especially in the north.Himachal results are an additional worry because it is also the home state of party president JP Nadda. Observers say the results from the hill state reflected farmers’ anger, the apple growers protesting against the plummeting price of the fruit in the wholesale markets.Central leaders say on Wednesday’s results will have no bearing on assembly elections early next year and that Himachal results, in particular, are a “reflection on Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur” a year before the state polls. However, this is not good news for the BJP ahead of elections to five states three of which are in North and agrarian in nature—Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Punjab.Amid the growing buzz that “Himachal Pradesh may follow the pattern of change seen in Uttarakhand a couple of months back”, sources say the central leaders “will hold discussions (on what went wrong)”.“The results have just come. Discussions and analysis of results are an essential part of the BJP’s functioning,” they say.Incidentally, apart from Himachal, West Bengal too came as a major embarrassment for the BJP which lost two seats it won in recent elections to TMC.  The Congress, meanwhile, claimed that the results of by-elections held to various state Assembly and Parliament seats are a “clear indication” that the “BJP is losing its momentum especially in Hindi heartland” due to its “anti-people policies”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ahead-of-assembly-polls-in-up-punjab-uttarakhand-concerned-bjp-to-analyse-results-contemplate-action-333834

In his post, Levin specifically spoke of “provocative and brutal incitement by state’’ and non-state actors. This comes against the backdrop of the police being seen with the arsonists in Tripura and firing at mobs at point blank range in Bangladesh.Zeya has served in India and was instrumental in making the assessment before the US renewed acquaintance with then Gujarat CM and BJP’s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi in February 2014.Zeya was also associated with the case in which diplomat Devyani Khobargade, posted in New York, accused of keeping an underpaid domestic worker from India, was strip searched on orders from Indian-origin attorney Preet Bharara.Zeya quit the State Department on moral grounds during the Trump presidency while protesting against racism and anti-women attitudes of that time. She was re-inducted by the Biden administration.Levin’s father and uncle were considered close to US President Joe Biden in the Democratic Party. While Biden served in the US Senate from 1973 to 2009, Levin’s father Sander Levin served in the US House of Representatives from 1983 till he retired in 2019. Levin’s uncle Carl Levin, who passed away this July, was a seven-term Senator till he retired in 2013.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uscirf-chair-briefs-state-department-official%C2%A0of-threats-to-freedom-of-religion-333813

03-11-2021||Mumbai||Don't have any more evidence to share on allegations against Anil Deshmukh: Param Bir Singh to probe panel||Former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh has submitted an affidavit before an inquiry commission probing his corruption allegations against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, saying he does not have any further evidence to share in the matter.Singh's lawyer on Wednesday confirmed that the senior IPS officer submitted the affidavit in a previous hearing of the commission.In March this year, the Maharashtra government formed the one-member commission of retired Justice Kailash Uttamchand Chandiwal to probe Singh's allegations against Deshmukh.Despite the commission issuing multiple summonses and a bailable warrant against Singh, he has not appeared before it so far.The commission had thrice imposed fines on Singh - of Rs 5,000 in June and Rs 25,000 each on two other occasions - for failing to appear before it.On the latest development, special public prosecutor in the case, Shishir Hirey, appearing for the inquiry commission, said, "Param Bir Singh has refused to give any more evidence in the matter other than the letter that he had initially forwarded to the chief minister and the home minister."  He is also not ready for a cross-examination, Hirey said.Last week, two non-bailable warrants were issued against Singh in Mumbai and neighbouring Thane district in connection with different extortion cases registered at local police stations.Days after he was shunted out as Mumbai police commissioner and transferred to the Home Guards in March this year, Singh had claimed in a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray that Deshmukh used to ask police officers to collect money from restaurant and bar owners in Mumbai.Deshmukh resigned from the post of state home minister in April this year. The NCP leader has repeatedly denied the allegations against him.The Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are probing the allegations made against Deshmukh by Singh.Deshmukh was on Monday arrested by the ED in connection with a money laundering case linked to an alleged extortion racket in the state police. He was on Tuesday remanded in the ED's custody till November 6.

The Statute confers the power of appointment on the Executive Council. Thus, clearly the appointment of Chairpersons of Centres/Special Centres by respondent no. 2 is, as is evident at this stage, prima facie, without authority,” the bench opined in its order dated October 26.“Pending decision in the writ petition, the nine (9) Chairpersons, who have been appointed.. (as stated in) Minutes of the 296th meeting of the Executive Council, will not take any major decisions, including functions relating to convening of selection committees and/or carrying out selection(s), concerning the Centres/special centres,” it added.The court clarified that the views are only prima facie and the single judge will decide the writ petition on merits, after hearing both sides.

The opposition party has accused the government of extortion in the name of taxes on petrol and diesel.It has also charged the government with "profiteering" from fuel tax and "fleecing" the common people.

He also alleged that the government was framing policies only to help the crony capitalists.He said the by-election result was a verdict against the "anti-people policies" of the Modi government, which has "declared a war on the country's farmers and ordinary citizens through anti-farmer laws and unjustly inflating the prices of essential commodities"."The government is doing nothing for the poor people of this country. The people are really fed up with this government. Every time they cannot win the elections by polarising people on religious lines. The people have started realising it," the AICC general secretary said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bypoll-results-show-that-bjp-is-losing-its-momentum-says-kc-venugopal-333784
03-11-2021||New Delhi||Ponzi scheme: ED attaches Rs 35-crore assets in Bengaluru||Assets worth Rs 35.7 crore have been attached under the anti-money laundering law in connection with a probe into a Bengaluru-based ponzi scheme under which numerous people were allegedly duped, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said on Wednesday.A provisional order has been issued under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to attach land, office spaces and residential flats in Bengaluru and bank and fixed deposits of Rs 1.49 crore held in the name of Vikram Investments and associates.The ED case of money laundering was filed on the basis of a March 2018 FIR of the Bengaluru Police.Police claimed that "partners and other associates of Vikram Investments like Raghavendra Srinath, KP Narasimhamurthy, M Prahlada, KC Nagaraj and Sutram Suresh cheated the general public by luring them to invest in Vikram Investments, promising high returns under the guise of commodity trading"."The modus operandi adopted by the company was that they were involved in collecting investments from customers under the guise of commodity trading offering huge returns to the extent of up to 30-35 per cent per annum," the ED said in a statement.The firm was not registered with any of the regulatory agencies including the Reserve Bank of India, it said."They ensured that customers would get back their first instalment as promised. This earned them trust and they lured customers to invest even more after which the company would stop paying them back money, including the principal amount," the statement said.Some "high-profile personalities also invested in this scheme in the hope of earning huge returns", it said."Initially, the company paid profits to the existing investors out of funds obtained from its new investors," the ED statement said.Probe found that the company "used" LIC agents and others who would convince their friends and family to invest, and in exchange they got heavy commission.

Which way will the wind blow in 2022?" Chidambaram said.The Congress on Tuesday had cited bypoll results to attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking him to shed arrogance, repeal the three farm laws and stop petrol and diesel "loot".Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi had said the party's victory is that of its workers and asked them to keep fighting hate without fear.The terms of the legislative assemblies of Goa, Manipur, Punjab and Uttarakhand are coming to an end in March 2022, while the term of the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly is scheduled to end in May next year.Polls are also due in Himachal Pradesh in December next year.

This touches upon human liberty of every undertrial,” said the judge who is also the chairperson of the Supreme Court e-committee.Highlighting the need for e-seva kendras, he said it had been necessitated due to the digital divide that deprived a large chunk of the Indian population from having access to technology.Aryan Khan’s release was delayed by a day after being granted bail by the Bombay High Court on Friday as certain procedural formalities could not be completed in time. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-judge-frowns-on-delay-in-communicating-bail-orders-333556

He was asked to elaborate on the discussion between the two PMs on counter-terrorism after a spurt in activity from Khalistani groups that included a recent so-called referendum.The police was deployed outside the Indian High Commission in London late last year after near-violent demonstrations took place in its vicinity and then UK High Commissioner Ruchi Ghanshyam had met British Home Secretary Priti Patel to convey India’s security and safety concerns in this regard.Shringla said while many of these groups did not gain any traction, yet by speaking on issues they had no legitimate right to speak on, they caused a “certain level of disequilibrium and concern in both our countries”.On the pending extradition of Modi and Mallya, the National Security Advisers will examine in detail “all of these issues that are important to the consular and security and other aspects of our relationship” said the Foreign Secretary.Meanwhile, PM Narendra Modi and his UK counterpart Boris Johnson jointly launched the ‘Initiative for the Resilient Island States’ (IRIS) for developing infrastructure of small island nations at the Glasgow summit. The launch gives new hope, confidence, Modi said, adding that the initiative gives the satisfaction of doing something for the most vulnerable countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-johnson-agree-to-rein-in-anti-india-fringe-groups-333542

Pakistan’s Foreign Office had earlier confirmed the invitation from India, but said a decision would be taken at an appropriate time based on the prevailing state of relationship between the two countries.India had sought to keep the momentum going after the Moscow talks that had seen Pakistan and India on the same table along with representatives of the Taliban.At the Moscow talks, the Indian diplomat had also engaged with the Taliban delegation.

03-11-2021||Vibha Sharma||COP26: PM Modi bats for ‘One Sun One World One Grid’ as solution to fossil fuel crisis||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 2A day after he pledged a new climate goal for India— Net Zero emissions by 2070 and higher NDCs based on clean fuel by 2030— Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday pitched for ‘One Sun One World One Grid’, asserting that only solar power can help re-establish the natural balance of nature damaged during the industrial revolution in the race to prosper through fossil fuels.Speaking at the session on ‘Accelerating Clean Technology Innovation and Deployment’ at COP26 in Glasgow, the Prime Minister said the creative initiative of ‘One Sun One World One Grid’ will not only reduce the carbon footprint and cost of energy, but also open a new avenue of cooperation between different regions and countries.“I am confident that the synergy of ‘One Sun One World One Grid’ and Green-Grid Initiatives will lead to the development of a cohesive and robust global grid,” he said.PM Modi and his UK counterpart Boris Johnson today launched the high-level coalition for clean energy, the Green Grids Initiative-One Sun One World One Grid that aims to generate a solar grid connecting countries in different parts of the world.Batting for “totally clean and sustainable” solar energy, PM Modi said with the help of the International Solar Alliance and the Green Grids Initiative, his many-year-old ‘parikalpana’ (vision) of ‘One Sun, One World, One Grid’ got a concrete shape today.“The only challenge is that solar energy is available during the daytime and is dependent on the weather. ‘One Sun One World One Grid’ is the solution to this problem. Through a worldwide grid, clean energy can be transmitted to anywhere and anytime. The need for storage and carbon footprint will be reduced and association between other countries will increased,” he said.The PM said space agency ISRO has also developed a ‘solar calculator’ application with which solar power potential of any place in the world can be calculated based on satellite data. “This application will be useful in deciding the location of solar projects and will also strengthen ‘One Sun One World One Grid,” he said.Reminding developed nations of the damage caused during the Industrial revolution, PM Modi said: “The industrial revolution was fuelled by fossil fuels. Many countries have prospered by the use of fossil fuels, but our earth, our environment have become poor. The race for fossil fuels also created geo-political tensions. But today technology has given us a great alternative.”Quoting from Surya Upanishad, the PM said if mankind wants to re-establish the balance with nature, the way will also come from the Sun.“In the Surya Upanishad, thousands of years ago, it was said, everything has originated from the Sun, the source of all energy is the Sun, and everything is sustained by the energy of the Sun. Ever since life originated on Earth, the life cycle of all living beings, and their routine, has been linked to the sunrise and sunset.“As long as this natural connection continued, our planet remained healthy. But in the modern era, man in the race to overtake the cycle set by the sun, disturbed the natural balance, and caused great damage to the environment.“We have to walk along with the sun again to save the future of humanity,” he said, asserting that the quantum of energy that the entire human race consumes in a year is given by the Sun in one hour to the earth.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cop26-pm-modi-bats-for-one-sun-one-world-one-grid-as-solution-to-fossil-fuel-crisis-333403
03-11-2021||Islamabad||Will not travel to India for conference on Afghanistan: Pakistan NSA||Pakistan National Security Adviser (NSA) Moeed Yusuf on Tuesday said he would not travel to India for an upcoming conference on Afghanistan on November 10 as he dismissed India’s role as a “peacemaker” in the war-torn neighbouring nation.India extended the invitation to Pakistan to attend the regional conference on Afghanistan being hosted by Indian NSA Ajit Doval.Talking to reporters here, Yusuf said he will not travel to India to attend the conference hosted by India on Afghanistan on November 10, The Express Tribune reported.In response to a question during the press conference, Yusuf said that a “spoiler” could not take on the role of a “peacemaker”, the report said.Earlier, Pakistan’s Foreign Office confirmed the invitation from India but said the decision would be taken at an appropriate time.Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi had earlier said Pakistan’s decision would be based on keeping in view the current state of relationship between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.Ties between India and Pakistan nose-dived after a terror attack on the Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 by terror groups based in the neighbouring country. Subsequent attacks, including one on an Indian Army camp in Uri, further deteriorated the relationship.The relationship dipped further after India’s war planes pounded a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp deep inside Pakistan on February 26, 2019 in response to the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.The relations deteriorated after India announced withdrawing special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcation of the state into two union territories in August, 2019.India has told Pakistan that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Islamabad in an environment free of terror, hostility and violence.Yusuf said that Pakistan, unlike the West, could not disengage with Afghanistan due to its regional proximity.“It may be a luxury for the Western world sitting 10,000 miles away (to stay away from Afghanistan) but we do not have any option to disengage from Afghanistan,” he said.He reiterated Pakistan’s stance that the world should coordinate and constructively engage with the present Afghan government to avert a humanitarian crisis.Yusuf said that engagement with Afghanistan was not a political matter for Pakistan but a “humanitarian one and a matter of our national security”.The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan on August 15, two weeks before the US was set to complete its troop withdrawal after a costly two-decade war.

Voters in Assam and West Bengal, for instance, gave a decisive thumbs up to the ruling alliances. And in Himachal Pradesh, the ruling BJP was headed for an upset with the opposition Congress looking set to gain.In the Lok Sabha by-elections, an emotional connect seemed to give an edge to candidates in Mandi in Himachal Pradesh and in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, according to trends on the Election Commission website.Opposition Congress' Pratibha Singh, late chief minister Virbhadra Singh's wife, was ahead of her nearest rival, Kargil war hero and BJP candidate Brigadier Khushal Thakur (retd) in Mandi. And Shiv Sena's Kalaben Delkar, the wife of former independent MP, the late Mohan Delkar, took a decisive lead in the Dadra and Nagar Haveli Lok Sabha seat.In the parliamentary seat of Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh, the ruling BJP's Gyaneshwar Patil was ahead of his Congress rival Rajnarayan Singh Purni.Assembly by-elections were held on five seats in Assam, four in West Bengal, three each in Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Meghalaya, two each in Bihar, Karnataka and Rajasthan and one seat each is in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Mizoram and Telangana.Of the 29, the BJP had won in around half a dozen constituencies earlier, the Congress had nine, while the rest were with regional parties.ASSAM: The ruling BJP and its allies looked set to win all five Assembly seats in the state.

03-11-2021||Mumbai||Param Bir Singh left India with Centre’s help, claims Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Tuesday claimed that IPS officer Param Bir Singh had not absconded but made to move out of the country, which he could not have done without the Centre's help.Speaking to reporters here, Raut said former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh was arrested by a central agency based on Singh's allegations, and this was "very unfortunate and unethical".Deshmukh's party NCP shares power with the Shiv Sena and Congress in Maharashtra.Param Bir Singh is facing investigation in a number of matters, including some extortion cases registered by Maharashtra Police. Recently, two non-bailable warrants were issued against him in different extortion cases in Mumbai and neighbouring Thane.Singh was shunted out from the post of Mumbai police commissioner in March this year in the aftermath of the recovery of an SUV with explosives near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's residence in south Mumbai and the arrest of dismissed police officer Sachin Waze in the case.Singh later accused the then state home minister Anil Deshmukh of corruption.The Maharashtra government recently told the Bombay High Court that it did not know of Singh's whereabouts.On Tuesday, Raut said, “When a person serving on a post equivalent to the director general of police moves out of the country, he cannot do so without the support of the Union government. He has not absconded, but made to move out of the country." “Based on his (Param Bir Singh's) allegations, the central agencies have arrested former home minister Anil Deshmukh. It is very unfortunate as his arrest is unethical,” he said.Raut said that on the basis of allegations, an investigation can be carried out, but Deshmukh was arrested on the first day of inquiry by officials of the Enforcement Directorate (ED)."I think it is a pre-planned strategy to harass, defame and indulge in mud-slinging of key leaders of the MVA government (in Maharashtra),” the Rajya Sabha member said.Deshmukh was arrested by the ED on Monday night after over 12 hours of questioning in the money laundering case linked to an alleged extortion racket in the state police establishment.

03-11-2021||November 2||Sameer Wankhede wore a Rs 70,000 shirt: Nawab Malik||Intensifying his attack on Sameer Wankhede, Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik on Tuesday accused Narcotics Control Bureau zonal director of extorting crores and using uber expensive clothes beyond the reach of an honest and an upright officer.The NCP spokesperson also hit out at former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, rubbishing the claim that he has links with the underworld.Also read: Former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh produced in court in money laundering caseDeshmukh’s arrest politically motivated, aimed at maligning MVA leaders: Nawab Malik“If that was the case, why was no probe initiated against me when you (Fadnavis) were the CM,” he added.Malik questioned Fadnavis for not acting against him despite being the chief minister of the state for five years.After Malik sought to link Fadnavis and his banker-singer wife Amruta with an alleged drug peddler, the BJP leader on Monday said he would expose his underworld links after Diwali.On Wankhede, Malik claimed the officer wore a trouser worth a lakh, a shirt costing over Rs 70,000 and watches worth Rs 25-50 lakh.“How can an honest and upright officer claim to afford such expensive clothes,” he said.“He (Wankhede) extorted crores by wrongly framing people,” Malik said, adding the NCB official had a private army to do the job. Malik claimed that Wankhede implicated people in fake cases.Malik also claimed that since the last 15 days, there are three containers with drugs lying at the JNPT. He questioned why no action has been taken by the Department of Revenue Intelligence on this. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sameer-wankhede-wore-a-rs-70-000-shirt-nawab-malik-333326
03-11-2021||Mumbai||Money laundering: Anil Deshmukh in ED custody till Nov 6; NCP, Sena slam his arrest||A Mumbai court on Tuesday remanded former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh to the Enforcement Directorate’s custody till November 6 in a multi-crore money laundering case, hours after his arrest following marathon questioning.Deshmukh (71) was arrested by the ED on late Monday night after over 12 hours of questioning here in the money laundering case linked to an alleged extortion racket in the state police establishment, an action termed as politically motivated by his party NCP, an ally in Maharashtra’s ruling coalition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA).He was produced for remand before additional sessions judge P B Jadhav, who presided over the special holiday court, a little after noon.Also read: Deshmukh’s arrest politically motivated, aimed at maligning MVA leaders: Nawab MalikSameer Wankhede wore Rs 70,000 shirt: Nawab MalikAdditional Solicitor General Anil Singh, appearing for the ED, sought 14-day custody of the NCP leader, stating his custodial interrogation was required to carry out further probe into the case, which stems from a CBI FIR, and to check the money trail.Deshmukh’s counsel Vikram Chaudhri and advocate Aniket Nikam, however, opposed the remand plea and argued the ED had no locus to investigate.The Bombay High Court had only directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe the allegations against Deshmukh. No one asked the ED to investigate, Chaudhri told the court.He further informed the court that Deshmukh is a senior citizen whose shoulder is dislocated and hence, he needs constant support.“He suffered from COVID-19 this February and is suffering from heart ailments and hypertension,” Chaudhri said.Before producing him in the court, the prosecuting agency had taken the NCP leader to the state-run J J Hospital for a regular medical check-up.After spending the night in the ED office in south Mumbai, Deshmukh was brought out at 10.15 am and taken to the hospital, an official said.After the ED arrested Deshmukh under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), agency officials had claimed the senior politician was evasive during questioning.The ED had initiated a probe against Deshmukh and his associates after the CBI filed its FIR against the NCP leader on April 21 on charges of corruption and misuse of official position.The ED’s case is that Deshmukh, while serving as home minister, misused his official position and through now dismissed cop Sachin Waze collected Rs 4.70 crore from various bars and restaurants in Mumbai.The money was allegedly laundered to Nagpur-based Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha, an education trust controlled by Deshmukh’s family.Deshmukh, who resigned from the cabinet in April this year, had refuted these allegations earlier and said the agency’s whole case was based on malicious statements made by a tainted cop (Waze).The ED has so far arrested two persons in the case—Sanjeev Palande (additional collector-rank official who was working as Deshmukh’s private secretary) and Kundan Shinde (Deshmukh’s personal assistant).The agency last month submitted its prosecution complaint (equivalent to a charge sheet) against the duo before a special court.The ED case against Deshmukh and others was made out after the CBI booked him in a corruption case related to allegations of at least Rs 100 crore bribery made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.In a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray after he was removed from the police commissioner’s post in March, Singh had alleged that Deshmukh asked Waze to extort over Rs 100 crore a month from bars and restaurants in the metropolis.Deshmukh, while denying any wrongdoing, had maintained that Singh made the allegations against him after he was removed from the post of Mumbai Police chief.The former minister had skipped multiple summonses issued by the ED in the case, but after the Bombay High Court last week refused to quash them, he appeared before the agency on Monday.Deshmukh’s arrest is politically motivated and aimed at maligning the image of MVA leaders, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said, while the Shiv Sena, which heads the ruling coalition, termed the ED move as  “unethical”.Hitting out at the Centre, Malik, a minister in the MVA government, said scaring leaders by abusing power should be stopped.“The entire action (of arresting Deshmukh) is politically motivated. It is aimed at scaring the leaders of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance),” Malik told reporters.“Law will take its course. The truth will someday come out if you implicate people,” Malik said.He said the Centre must come clean on Param Bir Singh.Singh is missing and two non-bailable warrants have been issued against him in two different cases. In the past, the MVA leaders have accused the Centre’s hand behind Singh’s disappearance.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said Deshmukh was arrested by the central agency based on Singh’s allegations, and this was “very unfortunate and unethical”.Raut said on the basis of allegations, an investigation can be carried out, but Deshmukh was arrested on the first day of inquiry by officials of the ED.“I think it is a pre-planned strategy to harass, defame and indulge in mud-slinging of key leaders of the MVA government (in Maharashtra),” the Rajya Sabha member said.Deshmukh’s arrest is being seen as a setback to the Uddhav Thackeray-led government, which will complete two years in office in November-end.Last month, NCP President Sharad Pawar had accused the Centre of using its agencies to target the MVA regime.Some leaders of Maharashtra’s ruling alliance are being probed by various central agencies. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/money-laundering-anil-deshmukh-in-ed-custody-till-nov-6-ncp-sena-slam-his-arrest-333314
