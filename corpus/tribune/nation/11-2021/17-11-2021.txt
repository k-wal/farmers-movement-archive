Today there are over 200 million doses available with states. I urge all adults to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Vaccine hesitancy is now the greatest threat in overcoming this pandemic," Poonawalla said in a tweet.Earlier in the day Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya also appealed to all eligible citizens to get vaccinated.The cumulative COVID-19 vaccines administered in the country has exceeded 113.68 crore mark. Of all the vaccine doses administered, around 90 per cent are Serum's Covishield and close to 10 percent are Bharat Biotech's Covaxin.The number of fully vaccinated individuals against COVID-19 has surpassed the partially vaccinated eligible population for the first time in India.The country has in total administered over 113.68 crore doses, according to the provisional report at 7 am.This has been achieved through 1,16,73,459 sessions. Out of which, 75,57,24,081 doses were administered as the first dose and 38,11,55,604 doses were administered as second dose.

No US Secretary of State has acted on its recommendations as far as India is concerned.Like the present US Secretary of State Antony Blinken this year, his predecessor Mike Pompeo had declined the USCIRF’s recommendation last year to list India as a CPC. Three of India’s neighbours – Pakistan, China and Myanmar are on the US State Department’s CPC list along with North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Nigeria. The USCIRF wanted the State Department to add India, Russia, Syria, and Vietnam to the list.Successive US Ambassadors for Religious Freedom have drawn a sharp distinction between India and Pakistan, though both are accused of state violence on its citizens. Some of the violence in India was carried out by the government but a “lot of the actions are by the government in Pakistan’’ and half of the world’s people that are locked up for apostasy or blasphemy are in Pakistan, the US Ambassador for Religious Freedom Senator Sam Brownback had said last year when asked why Pakistan was on CPC and India wasn’t.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/religious-freedom-us-state-department-declines-proposal-to-put-india-on-red-list-339361

17-11-2021||Toronto||Covid lockdown in India didn't cut air pollution as much as thought: Study||Air quality in India did not improve as much during the first COVID-19 lockdown as originally thought, according to a study which found that ozone levels increased even as other pollutants decreased.The researchers at York University in Canada noted that observational data shows air pollution in India decreased drastically in the first COVID-19 lockdown last year when emissions from vehicles naturally declined.However, they noted that blue skies and an absence of visible smog can be deceiving and hide pollutants that could potentially cause health issues.The study, published in the journal Environmental Science: Processes & Impacts, found that some air pollutants didn't drop nearly as much as first thought and even more surprising was that ozone levels increased even as other pollutants decreased.The air looked much cleaner, but that allowed more sunshine to get through, creating conditions for ozone (O3) to increase up to 30 per cent, according to the researchers."Our research shows the decline in local emissions had less influence on the decrease in air pollutants than first thought," said Leigh Crilley, a postdoctoral researcher at York University."To accurately quantify the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on air pollutant levels, meteorology and atmospheric chemistry needs to be considered in addition to emissions," Crilley said.The study focussed on nitrogen oxides (NOx), fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and O3, as well as meteorological factors within two cities in India -- Delhi and Hyderabad -- during the start of the first lockdown, from March 24 to April 24, 2020.Air pollution is a known health risk and India has some of the worst air pollution globally resulting in a disproportionally high level of mortality and disease, the researchers said.It is estimated that air pollution exposure, particularly PM2.5, resulted in the premature death of 1.27 million people in 2017, they said.The researchers used hourly data from air quality monitoring stations for levels of PM2.5, NOx and O3, and hourly meteorological and visibility data.They compared that data to the same dates from the previous three years to evaluate changes due to the lockdown.When only taking observational data into account, NOx and PM2.5 levels fell by up to 57 per cent and 75 per cent respectively, the researchers said.However, when meteorology was factored in, those percentages fell to less than 8 per cent for PM2.5 and between five and 30 per cent in both cities, while O3 increased, they said.The researchers found that local sources of emissions, such as vehicles and the burning of fuels, had less influence on air pollution levels than regional emissions sources, while weather events and atmospheric chemical processes contributed independently to air pollutant levels."We demonstrate that regional sources, such as rural and agriculturally based emissions, that may have been less affected by the lockdown, have a significant influence on PM2.5 levels in Delhi and Hyderabad after weather-normalisation," said Cora Young, Associate Professor at York University."This indicates that future PM2.5 mitigation strategies should focus on national-scale, as well as local sources," Young said.The study highlights the impact of emissions, meteorology and chemistry on air pollution and that all three should be considered when assessing the effects of any short-term intervention on air pollutants, the researchers said.The team also found that ozone production in Delhi is likely influenced by volatile organic compounds (VOC) and, as such, attempts to mitigate it should focus on dominant VOC sources.

Cooperation in critical technologies is also the endeavour of AUKUS and the Quad Groupings.Addressing an online meet on the same subject in Bengaluru, the Australian PM announced plans to open a consulate in the city to intensify ties with India in the area of high technology.Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne noted that Bengaluru is the world’s fourth-largest technology cluster, and home to a third of India’s unicorn companies. “Bengaluru and its vibrant business community will play a determinative role in India’s rise as a technological superpower. It is home to significant biotech, aerospace and defence industries, a thriving start-up ecosystem, India’s national space agency as well as leading education and research institutions,’’ she noted.The technologies mentioned by Morrison at Sydney included artificial intelligence, 6G, synthetic biology, and quantum technology.Australia is using this route to deepen its technology partnerships through the Quad. “Together with India, Japan and the United States, Australia is working to harness our respective nations’ capabilities to enhance the resilience of Indo-Pacific supply chains and foster an open, accessible and secure technology ecosystem,’’ he said.Morrison recalled that at the first in-person meeting of Quad leaders in Washington, it was agreed to strengthen effort in technical standards, with initial focus on advanced communications and AI; 5G deployment and diversification, and, immediate focus on supply chain security for semiconductors and their vital components.One area where India could be a partner is Quantum technology with Australia proposing strategic partnerships with “like-minded countries’’ to commercialise research in this segment.The Australian PM said the “Blueprint’’ of the 63 critical technologiesis meant to ensure that Canberra has access to critical technologies and systems that are secure, reliable, and cost-effective.“The blueprint is supported by an action plan, which outlines what Australia is doing to protect and promote critical technologies in pursuit of our national interest,’’ he said.The AUKUS too is much more than nuclear submarines. “AUKUS will see Australia, the UK and the US promote greater integration of security and defence-related science, technology, industrial bases and supply chains,” he said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/australia-lists-critical-tech-for-quad-and-aukus-to-counter-china-339329

It has also asked NCR states to close all schools, colleges and educational institutions and to hold online classes until further orders.A Bench led by CJI NV Ramana—which had on Monday asked the Centre and NCR states, including Punjab and Haryana to hold an emergency meeting to decide on the measures needed to check the deteriorating air quality—will take up a PIL filed by Aditya Dubey on the issue on Wednesday.The governments of Punjab and Haryana—where the problem of stubble burning has been a contributory factor aggravating the worsening air pollution condition—have also filed affidavits.The Punjab Government has proposed to give Rs 100 per quintal of paddy stubble to farmers who choose not to burn it.Police and fire tenders will be deployed to put out farm fires caused by stubble burning, it added.The Haryana Government informed the top court that all industries, except those running on PNG/CNG cleaner fuel, have been asked to remain closed till the end of this month.It has also decided to close down two thermal power plant units in Panipat with a total capacity of 450 MW till the end of November.Earlier, the Delhi Government had said it was ready to take steps like complete lockdown to control air pollution, but such a step would be meaningful only if implemented across the NCR areas in neighbouring states.Contrary to the top court’s observation that “stubble burning is not responsible for causing air pollution to that extent”, the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR and Adjoining Areas had earlier blamed it for about 35-40 percent of total current pollution in the NCR.“Post Diwali, there has been a spurt in the number of fire incidences owing to paddy stubble burning, particularly in the state of Punjab where about 42,285 of incidences have been reported in the last 10 days alone, out of a cumulative fire count of 62,863 till 13th November, 2021 during this season,” the Commission had recorded in its meeting held on November 14.“Likewise, the instances of paddy stubble burning in the state of Haryana have also witnessed an increase with respect to last year (with 5,400 incidences being reported so far in 2021 against a cumulative figure of 3,635 in the corresponding period in 2020),” it had noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-air-pollution-centre-against-work-from-home-suggests-carpooling-339328

Pakistan Law and Justice Minister Farogh Naseem introduced the Bill.While piloting the Bill through the Lower House on June 10, Naseem said had the Bill not been passed, India would have gone to the UN Security Council and could have moved contempt proceedings against Pakistan in the ICJ.India was not impressed by the Bill at that time, pointing out that the ICJ verdict should be complied with in letter and spirit by permitting a free conversation between Jadhav and Indian diplomats based in Pakistan. India also wants an Indian lawyer to represent which is now allowed under Pakistani law.In July last year, Indian diplomats had walked out of the meeting with Jadhav after aggressive Pakistani officials were stationed next to Jadhav and a camera had been fixed to purportedly record the meeting. India has already requested Pakistan over a dozen times for “unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional consular access’’ to Jadhav, on the death row since 2017.The Bill gives effect to the Ordinance tabled last year in 2020.The 51-year-old Kulbhushan Jadhav, a retired Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in 2017. India had then approached the ICJ against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.In a victory for India in 2019, the ICJ had ruled Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration’’ of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav which also included immediate consular access.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/paks-parliament-approves-bill-to-grant-kulbhushan-jadhav-right-to-appeal-339327
17-11-2021||Bengaluru||Chandrayaan performs evasive manoeuvre to avoid collision with NASA's orbiter||India's Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft performed an evasive manoeuvre to avoid collision with NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), according to ISRO.A very close conjunction between Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter (CH2O) and LRO of NASA was expected to occur on October 20 this year at 05:45 UTC (11:15 am IST) near the Lunar North pole, the Bengaluru-headquartered space agency said in a statement.Over a span of one week prior to the conjunction, analyses by both ISRO and JPL/NASA consistently showed that the radial separation between the two spacecraft would be less than 100 metres and the closest approach distance would be only about three km at the time of closest approach.Both the agencies deemed that the situation warranted a collision avoidance manoeuvre (CAM) to mitigate the close approach risk, and it was mutually agreed that CH2O would undergo the CAM.The manoeuvre was scheduled on October 18. It was designed to ensure a sufficiently large radial separation at the next closest conjunction between the two spacecraft.The CAM was executed nominally at 14:52 UTC (8:22 pm IST), on October 18. After orbit determination of CH2O with post-manoeuvre tracking data, it was reconfirmed that there would be no further close conjunctions with LRO in the near future with the achieved orbit, ISRO said.It may be noted that like CH2O, LRO orbits the Moon in a nearly polar orbit and hence, both the spacecraft come close to each other over the Lunar poles.It is common for satellites in Earth Orbit to undergo CAM to mitigate collision risk due to space objects including space debris and operational spacecraft.ISRO said it regularly monitors such critical close approaches and execute CAMs for its operational satellites whenever the collision risk is assessed to be critical."However, this is the first time such a critically close conjunction was experienced for a space exploration mission of ISRO which necessitated an evasive manoeuvre", the statement said.The event highlights the importance of continual assessment of close approach situations for Lunar and Martian missions, and the fact that effective mitigation of close approach risk involves close coordination and synergy among different space agencies, it was stated.

17-11-2021||New Delhi||TV debates causing more pollution than anybody, says Supreme Court||Debates on TV news channels are causing more pollution than anybody with statements made in the court being taken out of context, the Supreme Court said on Wednesday.A Bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana said everyone has their own agenda and statements are taken out of context in these debates.“You want to use some issue, make us observe and then make it controversial, and then only blame games will remain..,” observed the Bench also comprising Justices D Y Chandrachud and Surya Kant.“Debates on TV are creating more pollution than anybody. They don’t understand what is happening and what is the issue. Statements are taken out of context. Everyone has their own agenda. We can’t help and we can’t control. We are focusing on working out the solution,” it said.The apex court’s observations came while hearing a plea relating to air pollution in Delhi and adjoining areas.The oral remarks came in response to the submission of senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for the Delhi Government, that stubble burning was one of the contributors of the air pollution which needs to be addressed and referred to the Centre’s figures on the issue.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta referred to the television debates and said they claimed that he had misled the top court on the contribution of stubble burning to air pollution.“I watched some irresponsible and nasty utterances on TV media against me that I misled the court on the question of stubble burning by showing that its contribution is only 4 to 7 per cent. Let me clarify,” SG said.The top court, however, said: “We were not misled at all. You said 10 per cent but it was pointed out in the affidavit that it was 30 to 40 per cent.“This type of criticism is bound to happen when we are holding public offices. We are clear, our conscience is clear, forget about all this. These kinds of criticisms keep happening. Our conscience is clear and we work for the betterment of society,” the bench said.The plea has been filed by environmental activist Aditya Dubey and law student Aman Banka, who sought directions to provide stubble-removing machines to small and marginal farmers for free.

Only 2,432 habitations are balance out of total 1,84,444 habitations. A total of 20,950 km road length and 1,974 bridges are balance for completion out of the total sanctioned  6,45,627 km road length and 7,523 bridges.Under PMGSY-II, upgradation of 50,000 Km rural road network was envisaged. A total 49,885 km road length and 765 LSBs have been sanctioned, of which only 4,240 km road length and 254 bridges are to be completed yet.Majority of pending works under PMGSY-I and II are in the North-East and hill States due to factors such as COVID lockdown, extended rains, winters, forest issues.The states have been requesting the Central Government for extension of time to complete these crucial works related to the rural economy.Besides, the government launched PMGSY-III in 2019 for consolidation of 1,25,000 Km road length by March, 2025. Around 72,000 Km road length has so far been sanctioned under PMGSY-III, out of which, 17,750 km has been completed.The RCPLWEA was started in 2016 to improve connectivity in 44 LWE affected districts in 9 states. As many as 5,714 km road length 358 bridge works are balance for completion and another 1,887 Km road length and 40 bridges are being sanctioned. The scheme is being extended up to March, 2023 for completion of these projects, which are very critical from communication and security point of view.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cabinet-approves-continuation-of-pradhan-mantri-gram-sadak-yojana-i-and-ii-up-to-september-2022-339317

Bhutan, meanwhile, secured 62nd rank, the data showed.The TRACE's 2021 Bribery Risk Matrix, in a statement, said over the past 10 years, the business bribery risk environment worsened significantly in countries that also experienced democratic backsliding: Egypt, Venezuela, Turkey, Poland and Hungary."Over the past five years, the business bribery risk environment in the United States worsened significantly when compared with global trends. From 2020 to 2021, all of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries saw an increase in commercial bribery risk. Over the past five years, the countries that have shown the greatest trend towards improvement in the factors underlying commercial bribery risk are Uzbekistan, the Gambia, Armenia, Malaysia and Angola," it said.Vanuatu, Peru, Northare Macedonia and Montenegro also scored 44, the same as that of India, in the matrix.The TRACE Bribery Risk Matrix measures the likelihood of bribe demands in 194 jurisdictions. It was originally published in 2014 to meet a need in the business community for more reliable and nuanced information about the risks of commercial bribery worldwide.The TRACE Bribery Risk Matrix aggregates relevant data obtained from leading public interest and international organisations, including the United Nations, World Bank, V-Dem Institute at the University of Gothenburg and World Economic Forum.This data helps companies to assess the likely risk of bribe demands in each country and to design compliance and due diligence programs tailored to that risk, it said.

Violent crime, such as sexual assault, has occurred at tourist sites and in other locations.”The US State Department slotted India in Category Two or one rung below countries in the throes of civil wars. It has especially cautioned its citizens against travelling to Jammu & Kashmir, eastern Ladakh, the entire North-East, Central and Eastern India and within 10 km of the India-Pakistan border “due to the potential for armed conflict”.It said the US government had limited ability to provide emergency services to its citizens in rural areas from eastern Maharashtra and northern Telangana through western West Bengal. The US government employees have been asked to obtain special authorisation to travel to these areas.It asked its citizens to avoid all travel to J&K as sporadic violence occurs along the LoC and in tourist destinations such as Srinagar, Gulmarg, and Pahalgam.In the north-eastern states, it mentioned incidents of violence by ethnic insurgent groups occasionally.In central and east India, Maoist groups are active in “a large swath of India” and conduct frequent terrorist attacks on security forces and government officials.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-asks-travellers-to-be-alert-in-india-because-of-crime-and-terrorism-339265

The onus is on Pakistan to create such a conducive atmosphere. Till then India will continue to take firm and decisive steps to respond to cross-border terrorism,” she said.Bhat, who hails from Jammu and Kashmir, said in her remarks that UN member states are aware that Pakistan has an "established history and policy” of harbouring, aiding and actively supporting terrorists.“This is a country which has been globally recognised as one openly supporting, training, financing and arming terrorists as a matter of state policy. It holds the ignoble record of hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the UN Security Council," she said.Categorically stating India's position, Bhat said the entire Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh were, are and will always be an integral and inalienable part of India. "This includes the areas that are under the illegal occupation of Pakistan.”India called upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation.

This is shameful and totally unacceptable. Racism has no place in our country and we should all condemn it unequivocally,” Sarma said today.The reference was to Raghav Juyal, anchor of Dance Season 3 at Colors TV, using words like “momo”, “Chinese” and “chowmein” to introduce Gunjan Sinha, a child contestant from Assam.Former Tripura Congress chief Pradyot Deb Barman too weighed in on the issue wondering at the cheering crowds as the anchor used contentious references for Gunjan. “What angers me is that this comedian is not just comparing North-Eastern people to the Chinese but also the way the audience is laughing and clapping at this terrible joke! And then people question us why we feel that we are not part of the mainstream?” said Pradyot, as the issue reignited the larger debate on the “other-ness” of residents from the North-East.As the issue blew over, Juyal issued a clarification on Instagram saying itwas unfair to judge him based on a short clip from a broad show.Juyal said he was introducing the child because the child, in several recordings over the past days, had claimed that her talent was her knowledge of the Chinese language.“A short clip from my show has gone viral on the basis of which I am being called a racist. I want everyone to hear the whole show and then judge. It is not fair to judge the show on the basis of a small clip. That would not be good for my mental health. Gunjan Sinha over several recordings told us that her talent was to talk in Chinese. I introduced her in the same manner in which she used to speak on our shows. I am deeply connected with the North-East and it was not my intention to cause hurt,” Juyal said.Agitations over racism against residents of the North-East had reached a crescendo in February 2014 after the death of Arunachal Pradesh student Nido Taniam in Delhi.Incidents that shook northeast||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/racist-introduction-to-n-e-dancer-at-tv-show-draws-assam-cms-ire-339101

17-11-2021||New Delhi||CAQM emergency meeting: Delhi Environment Minister proposes work from home in NCR||A day after the Supreme court lashed out at the Centre and Delhi government for severe AQI, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in the National Capital Region and adjoining areas on Tuesday held an “emergency meeting” to discuss the dilapidating air quality of the national capital.Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai also asked the Centre to clarify the percentage of stubble burning causing air pollution so that a reliable strategy can be drawn.“In its affidavit, the Centre mentioned that contribution of stubble burning in air pollution is both four per cent and 35-40 per cent. It needs to be clarified. How can both figures be correct,” he said, urging Union Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav to provide “correct data so that a strategy to combat air pollution can be drawn”. “The strategy that will be formed on the basis of the four per cent figure will yield different results and the strategy formed seeing the 35 per cent figure will have a different outcome,” he added.Rai also cited the figures made public by the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor SAFAR, which showed the fire contribution to pollution from November 4 to 14.Implementing work from home policy in Delhi-NCR and closing down industries are some of the steps suggested by the Delhi government in a meeting, Rai said.Meanwhile, citing the SC observation, BKU leader Rakesh Tikait asked those blaming farmers and stubble burning for air pollution in Delhi to apologise. “Those labelling farmers as villains for air pollution due to stubble burning must apologise to farmers. The Supreme Court has also said it is not right to hold farmers responsible because only 10 per cent of the pollution is caused by stubble and that too for one-and-a-half to two months,” Tikait said. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday had announced various emergency measures, including the closure of schools for a week, a ban on construction activities and work from home for government employees, to deal with the pollution crisis faced by the city. The Supreme Court on Monday directed the Commission to hold a joint meeting with Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.“The other states have also put forth their views and we are waiting for an official notification from the commission,” Rai said regarding the meeting that will lead to the emergence of a joint action plan. Till the filing of this report, there was no official statement from CAQM.The official said the matter involves SC, therefore “due care has to be taken”. The CAQM on Sunday has asked Delhi and other NCR states to prepare to implement emergency measures listed under the Graded Response Action Plan.Vehicular followed by domestic, industries and construction main cause for Delhi pollutionStubble burning in adjoining farmlands is not the only contributor to Delhi’s dilapidating smog. According to a study by the Centre for Science and Environment, vehicles contributed more than 50 per cent of Delhi’s pollution between October 24 and November 8, this year, followed by household pollution (12.5 per cent-13.5 per cent), industries (9.9 per cent-13.7 per cent) and construction activities (6.7 per cent-6.9 per cent). The other contributors, in descending order, are household pollution, industries, construction sector, solid waste, and road dust, it says.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/caqm-emergency-meeting-delhi-environment-minister-proposes-work-from-home-in-ncr-338929
