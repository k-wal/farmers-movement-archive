The chargesheet thus, is incomplete for the purposes of section 167(2) of CrPC (default bail),” she said.The agency had made a mention of the pending OSA investigation for the first time while replying to the bail applications of the accused, which were dismissed on November 10 as there was “no clarity regarding the status of the case under the Official Secrets Act, the computation of time period for offences discovered later in the investigation etc.”, the judge had noted.“It was stated in the reply of the CBI that the investigation was being conducted under the Official Secrets Act, the Ministry of Defence has been requested to file a formal complaint as per law and the supplementary chargesheet would follow,” the judge noted.The defence lawyers cited a Delhi High Court judgment stating that since there is no minimum stipulated punishment under the OSA, chargesheets have to be filed within 60 days to deny default bail to the accused.The judge pointed out that the CBI had taken over the probe in respect of section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act and other sections were added as the investigation progressed.“At no point did the CBI inform the court that an investigation under the Official Secrets Act has also been taken up,” she said.The judge noted that the investigation officer informed, when inquired, that the Navy in response to a reference from the CBI had told the agency that the documents recovered were confidential in nature.The response of the Navy was received on October 14 and October 19, she pointed out.The judge said the agency filed two chargesheets on November 2 but there was no mention of the OSA investigation being carried out by the agency.It was only in response to the bail applications of the accused that the CBI said in order to initiate a probe under sections 3 and 5 of the OSA, a complaint from the defence ministry was required for which the agency had sent a proposal to the ministry, she said.Citing Supreme Court and high court judgments, the judge said it was “incumbent upon the CBI” to have filed its chargesheets within 60 days, mentioning that the investigation on its part was complete and that the reference has been made to the ministry concerned for filing a complaint under the relevant sections.The court said even if it is considered for the sake of arguments that the CBI had forwarded the application for a formal complaint and the ball was in the court of the ministry—though the argument of the prosecutor is that the investigation is also going on—the part of the CBI was not over in as much as it was expected to file a report alongside the said complaint with all the evidence collected by it.The CBI had carried out raids on retired naval officers Commodore Randeep Singh and Commander Satwinder Jeet Singh on September 2 after getting information that the latter was going to share crucial details related to a meeting in the Navy on procurement. Both were arrested on the same day.The agency is probing allegations into the leak of confidential information pertaining to procurement and maintenance of naval equipment for pecuniary benefits and bribery in a deal for a mine-laying saddle from Allen Reinforced Plastics Limited. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ex-naval-officers-get-bail-in-submarine-info-leak-case-court-terms-cbi-chargesheets-incomplete-341105
21-11-2021||Kathmandu||Yoga guru Ramdev’s launch of TV channels in Nepal faces opposition||The Nepal government will take action against yoga guru Ramdev’s two television channels if it is found that they are being operated in the country without seeking permission and or following due procedures, a senior official said on Sunday.Nepal’s Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Centre chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ jointly launched the two TV channels - Aastha Nepal TV and Patanjali Nepal TV - in the presence of Ramdev and his close aide Acharya Balkrishna on Friday.The channels are meant for broadcasting religious and yoga-related programmes.However, Director General of Nepal’s Department of Information and Broadcasting Gogan Bahadur Hamal said that two television channels have never applied for registration and did not follow any legal procedure to start them.“We will take action if we found that Patanjali Nepal and Ashtha Nepal channels belonging to India’s yoga guru Ramdev and Acharya Balakrishna have built infrastructures to broadcast the television programmes without fulfilling any legal formalities and even having registered,” Hamal told PTI.“We can’t believe the statement issued by the Patanjali Nepal. We have formed an investigation committee to find out the truth. If they have made any preparation regarding operating the television channels from Nepal without our permission and without following due procedures, we will take necessary action,” Hamal said.However, Patanjali Yogpeeth Nepal said in a statement that it has already gone through a verification process for the television channels from Company Registrar’s Office and the process has been initiated for further permission from the bodies concerned for operating the television channels.“We have not actually broadcast the television channels, we have only made technical preparation for the same. We have only inaugurated the television broadcasting office building,” it said.It said the television channels - aimed at broadcasting programmes relating to yoga, Ayurvedic education, culture, literature and spiritual philosophy - will start operating only after the due processes.Commenting on the development, Patanjali Spokesperson S K Tijarawala said that the Aastha TV has a due license for downlinking in Nepal, which is valid up to 2024.“Prime Minister Debuba inaugurated the trial run of two channels - Aastha Nepal TV and Patanjali Nepal TV - with country-specific content in the Nepali language on November 19, 2021. It has got 30 days time to get commercial approval for this trial run for full telecast,” he said.He said full broadcast will start as per the due procedure after December 19.“Information & Broadcasting Ministry of the Government of Nepal has already acknowledged the fact that this inauguration of the two channels - Aastha Nepal TV and Patanjali Nepal TV - is as per due diligence following the rules and regulations,” he added.Meanwhile, the Federation of Nepalese Journalists, an umbrella organisation of local journalists, issued a statement, saying the country’s law prevents foreign investment in the media and the launching of television channels by the Patanjali group was a violation of the law.“We want to remind the group concerned about the existing laws and rules that prevent operating TV channels under foreign investment,” it said.

She does not represent the spirit of India which is based on harmony and goodness for all. Considering the social sentiments, Padma Shri should be withdrawn from her immediately for insulting farmers, Sikhs, and freedom fighters,” he said.Sirsa said a DSGMC delegation will go to Mumbai on Monday to meet Maharashtra’s Home Minister Dilip Walse Patil and lodge a complaint against Ranaut at the Khar police station.He said he will meet the deputy commissioner of police to ensure the registration of an FIR against her.“This time it will be ensured that Kangana Ranaut does not get bail and she goes to jail for spitting venom against Sikhs time and again. She is playing the card of Hindutva for cheap publicity,” Sirsa alleged. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/withdraw-kangana-ranauts-padma-shri-delhi-sikh-body-to-president-341099

21-11-2021||Agartala||TMC leader Sayani Ghosh arrested on attempt to murder charge in Tripura||Tripura police on Sunday arrested West Bengal Trinamool Congress leader Sayani Ghosh, who allegedly threatened Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb during a meeting here on Saturday night, on the charge of attempting to murder, a police official said.Ghosh, the youth unit secretary of TMC West Bengal, was arrested after being called in for questioning in a police station in the state capital Agartala.The development took place a day before a planned visit by the TMC’s national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee to the North-eastern state.Sub-divisional Police Officer (Sadar) Ramesh Yadav said Ghosh was arrested under IPC Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 153A (promoting disharmony between two groups) for her comments against the chief minister.Yadav said some persons who were with her allegedly threw stones at a street corner meeting which was being addressed by the chief minister.A police official, who did not want to be named, said a BJP worker lodged a complaint alleging that Ghosh had reached the spot where the meeting was being held and shouted “Khela hobey” (game will happen) and claimed that there were not even 50 people in the gathering.“Khela hobey” is a slogan used by the TMC during the assembly election in West Bengal held in March-April this year.Ghosh was earlier detained for questioning in a police station and arrested later.TMC leaders alleged that their workers were also roughed up by BJP supporters outside the East Agartala Women’s police station, a charge denied by the saffron party.Abhishek Banerjee in a tweet accused the BJP government in the North-eastern state of disregarding Supreme Court orders on the rights of political parties to hold peaceful programmes.“@BjpBiplab has become so UNABASHEDLY BRAZEN that now even SUPREME COURT ORDERS DOESN’T SEEM TO BOTHER HIM.“He has repeatedly sent goons to attack our supporters & our female candidates instead of ensuring their safety! DEMOCRACY BEING MOCKED under @BJP4Tripura,” Banerjee said in the Twitter post, attaching a video of the alleged attack of Sunday morning.The Supreme Court recently directed Tripura police to ensure that no political party is prevented from exercising their rights in accordance with the law for campaigning in a peaceful manner.Police said some unidentified miscreants attacked a group of people who gathered near the police station during the questioning of Ghosh, but no one was injured.The TMC is contesting the Tripura civic polls to be held on November 25. The ruling BJP has already won 112 out of 334 seats uncontested across 20 urban local bodies including Agartala Municipal Corporation. This will be the first civic election that the BJP will face after coming to power in 2018.The Mamata Banerjee-led party is trying to gain a foothold in the state ahead of the 2023 assembly elections.TMC Rajya Sabha MP Sushmita Dev claimed that BJP sheltered goons attacked the leaders and workers of the party on the premises of the police station after Ghosh reached there.“Our candidates were beaten up; their houses vandalized and though complaints were filed, no action was taken. Police here are acting in a one-sided manner,” she told reports.The TMC has repeatedly alleged that its candidates were being prevented from campaigning by the ruling BJP supporters there.TMC West Bengal secretary Kunal Ghosh said if this is what is democracy in Tripura, “we would recommend to our leaders to do the same thing (to the BJP) in West Bengal”.Tripura BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya denied the allegation, saying the saffron party workers did not ever attack anyone of the TMC as the party does not consider it as a political opponent to reckon with.The alleged attack created ripples in West Bengal where the TMC and the BJP were engaged in a war of words.BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar claimed that the TMC is unable to even field candidates in seats for the local body elections in Tripura.“They (TMC) have to take busloads of people from West Bengal to secure attendance of 500 people in Abhishek Banerjee’s public meetings. There will be no impact of meetings by Abhishek Banerjee or Mamata Banerjee,” Majumdar said.He claimed that the only opponent of the BJP in Tripura can be the CPI(M) and not the TMC.TMC leader and senior minister Firhad Hakim claimed that that the BJP was indulging in violence in Tripura.“But we will follow the democratic path and win Tripura. Democracy does exist in BJP-ruled states,” he said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tmc-leader-sayani-ghosh-arrested-on-attempt-to-murder-charge-in-tripura-341094
21-11-2021||Junagadh||12 booked after video shows lion being lured with cow as bait for illegal ‘show’ in Gir forest||The Gujarat forest department has registered an FIR against 12 persons after a viral video showed a group of people gathered to watch an “illegal show” in which a lion is seen killing and feasting on a cow that was tied to a pole and used as a bait at a village in Gir forest of Junagath, an official said on Sunday.As per the investigation conducted into the incident so far, this illegal show was organised at a village in Devaliya range of Gir forest on November 8, he said.The Gir forest national park and wildlife sanctuary, also known as Sasan-Gir, is known as the “last abode” of Asiatic lions.“We have filed an FIR against 12 unidentified persons and three persons have been detained for questioning. The action was taken on the basis of a video which shows a group of people gathered to watch an Asiatic lion kill a cow tied to a pole. The organiser used the cow as bait to attract the lion for the illegal lion show,” Deputy Conservator of Forest (Junagadh), S K Berwal said.In the video, the lion is seen feasting on the carcass even as the people in the group watch it from a distance. Some of them are seen recording the show on mobile phones.“It is a classic case of a lion show, where someone set up a bait to attract the lion. Investigation so far has revealed that the show was organised on November 8, and we are trying to determine whether the participants were also from outside. Further investigation is underway to arrest the main accused in the case,” Berwal said.The accused persons have been booked under various sections of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, including sections pertaining to hunting (section 9), the official said.Earlier this year, a court in Gir Somnath had sentenced six people to three years in jail for harassing an Asiatic lion by organising one such show. The video showed a man luring a lioness by dangling chicken as bait.

21-11-2021||New Delhi||Lucky draw among strategies planned to improve Covid vaccine coverage||Weekly or monthly lucky draw programmes for those fully vaccinated against Covid-19 are among the strategies planned by the government to encourage people yet to take the first dose and those overdue for the second jab to get inoculated, sources said on Sunday.The Union Health Ministry has planned other initiatives also such as organising workplace vaccination and providing badges to fully vaccinated employees.States and Union Territories may soon be suggested to undertake these initiatives.The strategies also include involving influential figures in districts or villages, who themselves are vaccinated, to motivate their peer groups in getting the anti-Covid shots.Such people may be appointed as ‘ambassadors’ and oriented about the government’s ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ initiative. They can, in turn, provide sound advice to people on the importance of taking both the doses of vaccine and completing the vaccination schedule. The government has launched the month-long ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign for house-to-house Covid-19 vaccination of those who are yet to take a dose and those whose second jab is overdue.“Workplace vaccination can be organised targeting people who are due for their doses. Employees, both at private and government offices and other workplaces, may be given badges having vaccination messages such as ‘I am fully vaccinated, are you fully vaccinated too’ to encourage their colleagues to get the doses,” a source said.“Also, weekly or monthly lucky draw programmes may be organized for the fully vaccinated. Household items like kitchen appliances, ration kit, travel passes, cash prizes can be given to the winners of the lucky draw to motivate the fence-sitters to go for vaccination.”         Ideas or initiatives at the local level may further help in motivating people and mobilizing the left-out or dropped-out beneficiaries and help in ensuring that all adults are protected against Covid infection, the source said.According to officials, around 82 per cent of the eligible population in India have received the first dose of the vaccine while around 43 per cent have been fully inoculated. Over 12 crore beneficiaries are overdue for their second dose of COVID-19 vaccine after the expiry of the prescribed interval between the two doses.

With his songs of victory, Jagar Singh, 75, is back at the site, motivating the protesters to continue their struggle.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday announced a rollback of the three agri laws at the centre of protests by farmers for the past year.On his fourth visit to the Singhu border, the epicentre of farmers’ protest, Singh, a resident of Patiala district in Punjab, seems happy and in a celebratory mood.“We have won half the battle but there is still some time for us to return home triumphant. We want the government to bring in a legislation to guarantee the minimum support price (MSP),” he said.He said he has stayed at the Singhu border for a week each on his three earlier visits. A day after the Centre’s announcement of the three contentious laws, Singh reached the site on Saturday to sing songs of victory and to motivate the protesters to continue their struggle.“Playing iktara is my hobby and from the past few years, I have gradually started singing as well. This is the fourth time I have come to the Singhu border since the protest started. I have family responsibilities back home,” he said.Singh said he has also performed at the main stage at the Singhu border protest site.Malkit Singh (58), a resident of Ropar, said ‘nagar kirtan’ was organised at the border on Sunday morning.“Today, nagar kirtan was organised two days after the Gurpurb. It was started from the main stage, we did ‘sewa’ in the kirtan and sweets were distributed during the procession. We want Prime Minister Narendra Modi to fulfil our other demands also so that we would go back to our respective homes,” he said.The protesters are refusing to move from the site till their demands are met.Chad Singh (70), a resident of Patiala, said the protesters have achieved one demand, however, “there are others which have to be accepted by the government”.“Repealing of the three farm laws is one step. There are other demands of MSP guarantee etc. The government should also compensate the family members of the protesters who died here and give jobs to their kin. The farmers have spent a lot of money in the protest and the government should also waive loans of all farmers,” Chad said.Chad said he has celebrated Lohri and Diwali at the Singhu border.“I went back to my home in Patiala twice and later came here. For the first time, I celebrated Lohri and Diwali away from my home. My family has supported me a lot. They said I should be at the protest site and win the battle,” Chad said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/protest-using-strings-elderly-man-returns-to-singhu-with-his-iktara-to-motivate-farmers-341086

He said his government would give an ex gratia grant of Rs 3 lakh to each family.Telangana has set aside a sum of Rs 23 crore that would be distributed to families of farmers who died after a verification process is completed. KCR has expressed the desire to personally hand over the cheques to the victims’ families.The chief minister has again reiterated his earlier demand to ask the Union Government to settle all pending issues like MSP with the farmers immediately and draw out a list of families who lost a member during the agitation. He has demanded a sum of Rs 25 lakh be given to each such family.Not just restricting himself to a financial grant, the chief minister also sought an apology from the central government for branding agitating farmers as anti-national and Khalistan supporters. All cases against farmers should be withdrawn, and this must include the cases of sedition. The relief must also come to people in far-flung places, like Disha from Bengaluru, who supported the farmers’ movement.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telangana-cm-to-provide-rs-23-crore-relief-to-farmer-families-341085

21-11-2021||---||With concessions still suspended, 4 crore elderly forced to travel on full fare since Mar ’20||New Delhi, November 21Almost four crore senior citizens have been forced to pay full fare for their travel since the railways suspended their concessions due to the coronavirus outbreak in March 2020, a RTI has revealed.In a reply to a query filed by Madhya Pradesh-based Chandra Shekhar Gaur, the railways has stated that between March 22, 2020 and September 2021, 37,850,668 senior citizens have undertaken journeys on trains.During this period, train services remained suspended for several months due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown. The concessions, which were suspended from March 2020, have remained suspended to this day.In the case of senior citizens, while women are eligible for 50 per cent concession, men can avail 40 per cent in all classes. The minimum age limit for a woman is 58 and a man is 60.Over the last two decades, railway concessions have been a much-discussed topic with multiple committees recommending their withdrawal. As a result of this in July 2016, the railways made elderly concession optional while booking tickets.In July 2017, the railways enabled the elderly to even give up their partial or full concession through the “give it up” scheme. “The thing is that the concession given to us was significant and is a huge help for those that cannot afford it. Senior citizens in many homes are treated as an extra, with no income of their own. These concessions helped them to get around.“Those who can have given up their concessions also. With regular train services running, at least the senior citizen concessions should be restored. Most elderly cannot afford to pay full fares,” said Tapas Bhattacharya, a retired private sector employee, who is travelling to Kolkata with his wife, also a senior citizen, next week said.In a letter last month, Madurai MP Su Venkatesan appealed to the Union railway minister to restore passenger concessions for their railway journeys stating that it was necessary for the elderly in a country where 20 per cent live below the poverty line.“My parents haven’t seen their grandchildren for more than two years. This year also they didn’t come as they cannot afford the tickets without concessions. It is also too much for me to pay. They used to come every year to Delhi and spent six months here,” said Subhash Singh, a security guard working in a highrise in Noida, whose parents are both senior citizens and stay in Bihar.In fact, according to a CAG report of 2019, the response to the ‘give it up’ scheme from the senior citizen passengers was not very encouraging. The report said that out of total 4.41 crore senior citizen passengers, 7.53 lakh (1.7 per cent) passengers opted to give up 50 per cent concession and 10.9 lakh (2.47 per cent) passengers gave up 100 per cent concession.The railways, over the past ten days, have restored some of its services that it suspended in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. This includes the removal of the “special” tag from trains which brought down the prices of tickets and restarted the service of serving hot cooked meals.However, the decision on restoring concessions and providing bedrolls is still pending.

21-11-2021||Aditi Tandon||Child abuse as much evident in prosperous homes as in poor: Smriti Irani||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 21Close on the heels of the National Crimes Record Bureau’s annual report painting a dismal picture of child protection in the country, Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani on Sunday made a passionate appeal for society’s intervention to safeguard every child saying abuse is as much a reality in prosperous homes as in poor ones.“There is a presumption that abuse is restricted to poverty. But abuse is as much evident in families that are prosperous. While we look at child abuse in economically weaker families we should also look at abuse in prosperous families, powerful organisations and child care institutions,” Irani said.She was speaking at a special child protection awareness workshop the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights is hosting in capital’s Rajghat to consider loopholes in child protection plans and plug them.Chiefs of 20 State Commissions for Protection of Child Rights, child protection officers, senior police officials, including DGP Gujarat and anti- child trafficking crusaders, are attending the workshop being held under the aegis of Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav celebrations.Irani in her remarks also asked the participants to discuss ways in which society can be inspired to lead children to protection.“How many times do we watch child beggars along the streets? We feel sorry for them and then move on because we don’t have two minutes to report a begging child and lead the child to protection and safety. How can we raise social awareness about child protection among people who know the laws, who know where they can find help for a vulnerable child but who hesitate to hold the hand of that child and take him to protective spaces? That’s our challenge,” Irani said remarking that no society can be truly free until it has ensured the protection of every single child.The best test of a democracy is if we as a nation can deliver justice to all our children, the minister said, hailing new-age children who, she said, were conscientious enough to nudge parents not to litter or waste water.Irani said while the government recently amended the juvenile justice law to enhance child rights and ease adoptions, administrative capacities would need to be enhanced further and change would have to remain a constant as child protection challenges remain dynamic on account of fast changing times.Earlier, WCD secretary Indevar Pandey identified interpersonal violence at homes, schools and community in the form of bullying, corporal punishment and sexual violence, as the “most severe form of injury children have to suffer” and said crimes against children had registered an increase of 4.5 per cent between 2018 and 2019 as per NCRB statistics.“There has also been a 18.9 per cent rise in the number of cases registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act over 2018 and 2019.

This is largely due to lower female member exits during the month.Industry-wise payroll data indicates that ‘expert services’ category (consisting of manpower agencies, private security agencies and small contractors, etc) constitutes 41.22 per cent of total subscriber addition during the month.Apart from this, growing trend in net payroll additions has been noted in industries like trading-commercial establishments, engineering products, building and construction, textiles, garment making, hospitals and financing establishments.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/employees-provident-fund-organisation-adds-15-41-lakh-net-subscribers-in-september-341060

Some were crushed to death in Lakhimpur Kheri. All of them were protesting against the farm laws, he said."The government has now realised its mistake and withdrawn the farm laws. There is a demand from different parts of the country that the kin of the farmers who lost their lives should be financially compensated," Raut said.Alleging that "unaccounted money" was lying in the PM Cares Fund, Raut said this money should be used as ex-gratia for the kin of the deceased farmers."Just apology to farmers is not enough. Supporting their families is important," he said apparently referring to the speech of the prime minister.

PNB only woke up and fixed the vulnerability when CyberX9 discovered the vulnerability and notified PNB through CERT-In and NCIIPC,” CyberX9 founder and MD Himanshu Pathak told PTI.He said CyberX9 research team discovered a very critical security issue in PNB which was leading to admin access to internal servers hence exposing a massive number of banks’ systems nationwide open for cyber-attacks for the last about seven months.Pathak said that vulnerability was found in an exchange server which is interconnected with other exchanges and shares all access—including access to all email addresses which results in access to all email addresses.“The vulnerability which we discovered was leading to the highest level of admin privilege in PNB’s exchange servers. If you gain access to Domain Controller through an exchange server then the doors very easily open to make any computer accessible in the network.“These computers even include those that are being used in their branches and other departments,” Pathak said.When contacted, PNB said the server in which the vulnerability was found had no sensitive or critical data.“The server wherein the vulnerability was reported, was being used as one of the multiple Exchange Hybrid servers used to route emails from On-prim to Office 365 Cloud. There is no sensitive/critical data in this server,” PNB said.PNB denied CyberX9 claim on impact of the vulnerability on customer’s data.“The server is in a separate VLAN segment and customer data/applications are not affected due to this. Vulnerability assessments and penetration testing is done periodically by external Cert-in empanelled Information Security Auditors and the observations are complied with.Now this server has been shut down as a precautionary measure,” PNB said.According to CyberX9, the vulnerability was mitigated on November 19, and it reported the incident to Indian cyber security watchdog Cert-In and National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC). — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/vulnerability-in-pnb-server-exposed-customer-data-for-about-7-months-cyberx9-341044
21-11-2021||Lucknow||Samajwadi Party fears BJP will bring back three farm laws after assembly polls||The Samajwadi Party on Sunday expressed apprehension that the three contentious farm laws will be brought again after the 2022 assembly elections, citing the statements made by Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra and BJP MP from Unnao Sakshi Maharaj on them. Both Mishra and Maharaj told reporters on Saturday that the laws can be brought again, if needed.On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the Centre will repeal the three farm laws after the nearly year-long agitation by a section of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.Farmer leaders said the protesters will stay put at border areas of Delhi until the Centre formally repeals these laws in Parliament and indicated their stir for a statutory guarantee of MSP and withdrawal of the Electricity Amendment Bill will continue.In a tweet in Hindi, the Samajwadi Party charged, “It is absolutely clear that their heart is not clean, and after the elections, the bills will be brought again. Occupying the constitutional posts, Governor of Rajasthan Kalraj Mishra and BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj have said that the BJP government may bring the bill for farm laws”.“This is the truth of those tendering false apologies to farmers. The farmers will bring a change in 2022,” the SP said in the tweet.Mishra on Saturday said in Bhadohi that efforts were made to make the farmers understand the provisions of the farm laws, and positive aspects, but the farmers were demanding the withdrawal of the three farm laws and were protesting against them. Eventually, the government felt that the laws be withdrawn, and if there is a need to make the laws again, it will be done.“The farmers were continuously demanding that the farm laws be withdrawn, and it was done in a very civilised manner. It is a good step and appropriate decision,” Mishra said.Speaking to reporters in Unnao on Saturday, BJP MP Maharaj said: “Bills are made and repealed. They will come again, and will be made again. It hardly takes any time (Bills to bante rehte hai, bigarhte rehte hai...vaapas aajaayenge, dobaaraa ban jaayenge...koi der nahi lagtee hai). But, I would thank Modiji that he displayed a big heart, and he chose the Nation over the laws. And those whose intentions were wrong, those who had raised slogans of Pakistan zindaabaad and Khalistan zindabad, they have got a befitting reply”.     He also categorically stated that there is no connection between the announcement of repealing of the farm laws with the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections 2022.“In the UP 2022 Assembly elections, the BJP will cross the 300 mark in the (403-member) UP Legislative Assembly. In India, there is no substitute of (Prime Minister) Modi and (UP Chief Minister) Yogi Adityanath. Their magic will stay,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/samajwadi-party-fears-bjp-will-bring-back-three-farm-laws-after-assembly-polls-341043

Aryan Khan was needlessly kept in jail for 25 days at the whims and fancies of the NCB in gross abuse of law. The law should now take its course against the delinquent officers”.Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said: “High Court observations of no evidence or conspiracy in Aryan Khan case yet again highlight the need to fix accountability in form of penal consequences on agencies and the prosecution for wrongful arrests, unwarranted detention and wrongful indictment”. He said the agencies cannot use law book as a flexi tool.Delivering the detailed 14-page order, Justice Nitin Sambre of Bombay High Court said that considering the material brought on record by the NCB, the court has not found that prima facie, there was no positive evidence against the accused trio.It may be recalled that Khan, Dhamecha and Merchant were granted conditional bail by the High Court on October 28 vide a speaking order and the detailed order was made available only now.Justice Sambre further said that the NCB claim on the common intention to commit an offence under the NDPS Act, (accused) found to be in possession of commercial quantity of drugs and hatching conspiracy is “liable to be rejected”.The court said that merely because the accused trio was travelling on the cruise cannot be grounds to invoke the offence under Section 29 (criminal conspiracy) against them.“This court is required to be sensitive to the fact that there has to be presence of basic material in the form of evidence so as to substantiate the case of conspiracy against the applicants (accused),” Justice Sambre noted.He further said that no drugs were found on Khan, while the quantity recovered from Dhamecha and Merchant were ‘small’ under the NDPS Act.Under such circumstances, in order to invoke the offence of conspiracy against the accused, there has to be positive evidence about an agreement to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means, and such agreement must precede with meeting of minds, but there is no such material in this case, said the court.--- IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aryan-khan-case-ncb-should-be-made-accountable-congress-after-hc-judgment-341042

Three other trains were partially cancelled or diverted.The State Disaster Management Authority said more than two lakh cusecs of floodwater flowed out of the Somasila reservoir in SPS Nellore district, leading to the deluge.This caused breach of the National Highway-16 at Kovuru as well.Consequently, traffic on the NH-16 between Nellore and Vijayawada has been suspended, leaving hundreds of vehicles stranded for kilometres on either side.Hundreds of passengers were stuck in the Nellore RTC bus station as bus services were disrupted.Vehicular traffic coming from Srikalahasti has been stopped at Tottembedu check post and diverted via Pamuru and Darsi, officials said.In Kadapa district, a bridge on the Papagni river collapsed at Kamalapuram, cutting off road communication between Kadapa and Anantapuramu districts.Floodwater gushing out from the Veligallu reservoir led to the bridge collapse, officials said.In Kadapa city, a three-storey building collapsed in the wee hours of Sunday, but no casualties were reported as the inmates ran out to safety minutes before the incident.A mother and child, who were trapped on the second floor, were rescued by police and fire services personnel.

However, a heated argument broke out between them, following which Mishra and others allegedly attacked Saket with a sharp weapon and severed one of his hands.The accused tried to hide the severed arm nearby, which was traced later, the ASP said.Police rushed the labourer to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital where a team of doctors reattached the severed hand by surgery, he said.The condition of the victim, however, is critical due to excessive blood loss, he said, quoting doctors.Police arrested Mishra and his brothers Ratnesh Mishra and Krishna Kumar Mishra under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC and provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, an official said.

21-11-2021||Chennai||Floods, water-logging and water scarcity become cyclic woes of Chennai residents||Chennai and its adjoining areas were recently inundated in water after heavy rain in the space of a fortnight and the water, mixed with sewage and petrol, had entered several homes. This is a phenomenon Chennai has been facing year after year while in summer the city is totally devoid of water. A common scene in the city during summer is colourful pots lined up before a water tap with anxious people waiting for their turn to fill them.Sudharani, a software professional working with a MNC, told IANS: “I live in TNagar and work at OMR. It was a harrowing experience last week with water entering our homes and surrounding areas with a dirty smell and mixed with petrol and sewage. For the past several years, we are experiencing this and whoever comes to power is turning a blind eye to this problem. Poor planning and the contractor-bureaucrat-politician nexus is creating this problem and and unless this is dealt with strongly, Chennai as a city is lost”.She said that during summer the same city is languishing for water and people have to stand in long queues to get a bucket of water, either from the corporation or private suppliers.The 2015 floods were the worst for Chennaites with 400 people losing their lives. Property was destroyed, vehicles were submerged in water, and boats were used as the mode of transport. However, the rulers apparently did not learn any lesson from that. With changing weather patterns and environmental issues, depressions are a regular feature in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea leading to heavy downpours and westerly winds.Chennai, according to the available data, has 2780 km of roads but the water drains of the city are limited to 1,894 km. The Planning Commission has recommended the construction of water drains to a length of 5000 km to properly flush out water but nothing has happened.While the 1,894 km water drains would have taken the brunt of the water, these drains are filled with plastic and garbage. There seems to be no plan to clear these drains of the plastic and garbage which results in the water not getting out properly.There are two freshwater rivers, Cooum and Adyar, and both are stagnant with plastic and garbage. They are not cleaned and all the wastewater flows into them. Hence they turns filthy with stagnating water—another reason for the water not going out properly.While the Madras High Court had given a decision to convert the Pallikarani marshland into a Ramsar site, several parts of the marshy land which would have acted as a sponge to absorb water, are turning into a concrete jungle with residential colonies, buildings housing institutions, and even garbage dumping yards.Chennai had 60 large water bodies a century ago but now they have come down to just four—Redhills, Cholavaram, Poondi and Chembarambakkam. Almost all the water bodies have been converted into garbage yards and filled. These were sold to contractors with the politician-bureaucrat-contractor nexus becomes fatter at the expense of the environment and the people of Chennai.The temple tanks which used to help maintain groundwater levels have also been filled up and even the Murudeshwar temple at Tiruvanmyur that had five tanks has only one left. The rest of the tanks have been filled with soil and garbage and have made way for new gleaming concrete buildings.Groundwater levels have come down leading to a drought-like situation in summer and water-logging and inundation during the rains. Chennaites are suffering in both seasons, and lack of proper planning is quite obviously the reason for this.Sudheeshkumar, who retired as a senior engineer with an automobile major and lives at Pammal in Chennai, told IANS: “Wrong planning, greed of our bureaucrats and politicians have made our good old Chennai into a city with people having nightmares during the rains and extreme suffering during summer for lack of water. This is unique to Chennai and the reason is poor and improper planning and preparations. Floods have become an annual phenomenon and planners have to prepare for this in advance but nothing happens and the public is left to the mercy of the rain gods”. Now people are looking to Chief Minister MK Stalin for change. The first priority for almost everyone is to clear the two freshwater rivers of the city, Cooum and Adyar. Several lakes have been lost. The temple tanks have to be restored and encroachments have to be removed. The Madras High Court has always been willing to listen to the woes of the people and has delivered several landmark judgments to restore the water flow and also to prevent environmental degradation.The HR&CE department has taken welcome measures to remove encroachments. If it also takes steps to retrieve the lost temple tanks and ponds, the city will be much better off for water and to face the downpours.C. Rajeev, Director, Centre for Policy and Development Studies based out of Anna Nagar in Chennai, told IANS: “Unless the government takes a strong stand against encroachers and cracks down on the contractor-bureaucrat-politician nexus, things will not improve in Chennai. It has been a cyclic phenomenon and people are suffering. During the rains it is water-logging, inundation, water mixed with sewage entering homes, and in summer we can see long queues of women standing to get a pot of water. This is only due to the failure of the administration and the governments that have ruled the state have to answer to the public.” — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/floods-water-logging-and-water-scarcity-become-cyclic-woes-of-chennai-residents-341024

Besides, a Bihar government Minister also stated that the farming laws would be imposed again. I am not saying this but the BJP leaders and their allies are saying this." The RLD chief congratulated the farmers over the 'historic win' and said that the agitation proved that every citizen has become an 'andolanjeevi'.Chaudhary also reminded the government of the sacrifices made by the farmers during the agitation and touched upon the Lakhimpur Kheri violence deaths as well. "As many as 700 farmers died during the agitation, their families need respect. The minister, whose son is responsible for the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, is still holding his post. This needs to be answered," he said.Attacking Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the RLD chief said that he did not know how to formulate and implement policies. "How such a person can be made Chief Minister? In 2017, the state had a debt of Rs 4 lakh crores, which has now increased to Rs 6 lakh crores. The situation is such that the government is unable to pay even salaries to its employees, but Yogi Adityanath continues with his propaganda 24X7."

21-11-2021||Mumbai||No proof to show Aryan, other accused conspired: HC||The Bombay High Court, in its detailed order granting bail to actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan and two others in the drugs-on-cruise case, has said that prima facie it has not found any positive evidence against the accused to show that they had conspired to commit an offence.A single Bench of Justice NW Sambre had, on October 28, granted bail to Aryan, his friend Arbaaz Merchant and fashion model Munmun Dhamecha in the case on a personal bond of Rs one lakh each. A copy of the order was made available on Saturday.The court said that perusal of the WhatsApp chats extracted from the phone of Aryan showed that nothing objectionable was noticed to suggest that he, Merchant and Dhamecha, along with other accused, had hatched a conspiracy of committing the offence in question.It also held that the confessional statement of Aryan recorded by the NCB under Section 67 of the NDPS Act could be considered only for the investigation purpose and could not be used as a tool for drawing an inference that the accused had committed an offence under the NDPS Act.“There is hardly any positive evidence on record to convince this court that all accused persons with common intention agreed to commit unlawful acts,” the court said.The probe suggests Aryan and Merchant were travelling independently of Dhamecha and “there was no meeting of minds” on the alleged offence, the order said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-proof-to-show-aryan-other-accused-conspired-hc-340836

21-11-2021||New Delhi||Crucial farmer unions’ meet on Sunday to decide on agitation course; MSP issue in focus now||After its decision to repeal the three agri laws, the Centre is now facing pressure from agitating farmer unions and opposition parties to bring in a legislation guaranteeing Minimum Support Price, with ruling BJP MP Varun Gandhi also joining the chorus on Saturday saying the stir won’t end till this issue is resolved.The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of the agitating unions, is meeting on Sunday to decide on the next course of action, including on the MSP issue and the proposed daily tractor march to Parliament during the upcoming Winter Session, SKM core committee member Darshan Pal said.Read also:Farmer leaders said the protesters will stay put at border areas of Delhi until the Centre formally repeals these laws in Parliament after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise announcement on Friday and indicated their stir for a statutory guarantee of MSP and withdrawal of the Electricity Amendment Bill will continue.“Our call of tractor march to Parliament still stands. A final decision on the future course of the agitation and MSP issue will be taken in a meeting of the SKM at Singhu Border on Sunday,” Darshan Pal told PTI on Saturday.The SKM said its scheduled programmes would continue and urged farmers to gather in large numbers at all protest sites on the first anniversary of the agitation against the legislations on November 26.The SKM has welcomed the prime minister’s decision but said it will wait for the announcement to take effect through due parliamentary procedures.In a statement, the SKM, an umbrella body of 40 farmers’ unions, said the struggle will continue to get all demands of the protesting farmers fulfilled and all announced plans are underway.“SKM appeals to farmers in various North Indian states to reach the different morcha sites on November 26, 2021, which marks the completion of a full one year of continuous peaceful protests at Delhi’s borders,” the statement said.Thousands of farmers, particularly those from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been protesting at the borders of the national capital since November 26 last year demanding repeal of the three farm laws.While the opposition needled and mocked the government after it agreed to rollback the farm laws, BJP MP Varun Gandhi, who had deviated from the party line to speak out in favour of the protesters, wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to accept the farmers’ demand for a statutory MSP guarantee.The MP from Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh said if the decision to repeal farm had been taken earlier, “innocent lives would not have been lost”.“This movement will not end without the resolution of this (MSP) demand and there will be widespread anger amongst them, which will continue to emerge in one form or the other. Therefore, it is very important for the farmers to get the statutory guarantee of MSP for their crops,” he wrote and also demanded that Rs 1 crore compensation be given to farmers “martyred” in the movement against the laws.Like Varun Gandhi, BSP chief Mayawati also demanded a law to guarantee MSP and withdrawal of cases against the protesters.“There should be a new law to ensure the minimum support price for the produce of farmers, and barring cases of serious nature, all cases registered against farmers, who are the country’s pride, should be withdrawn. This should be ensured by the Centre, and it would then be appropriate,” she tweeted.The Congress and Left parties have also demanded that a law should be enacted on the MSP guarantee while repealing the three laws from last year.Action was also sought against Union Minister Ajay Mishra for the violence in Lakhimpur Kheri by Varun Gandhi as well as Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi, who also urged Modi not to share the stage with the minister during the conference of DGPs in Lucknow.Violence had erupted in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3 in which four agitating farmers were run over by a vehicle while four others, including a journalist and two BJP workers, were also killed.The opposition continued to take target the government over the withdrawal of the farm laws.“ ‘Mahabharata’ and ‘Ramayana’ teach us that arrogance ultimately gets crushed, but the fake Hindutvawadis seemed to have forgotten this and launched an attack on truth and justice like Ravana,” the Shive Sena said.“At least in future, the Centre should shun arrogance before bringing such laws, and take the opposition parties into confidence for the welfare of the country,” an editorial in party mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said, adding that BJP’s “defeat” in bypolls forced the Centre to take the decision.Congress leader P Chidambaram claimed Prime Minister Modi made the announcement to repeal the farm laws without holding a Cabinet meeting and alleged that it is only under the BJP that laws are made and unmade without prior Cabinet approval.Union minister General V K Singh, however, lamented the insistence of a section of farmers on a rollback of the reform legislation.“I asked a farmer leader to tell me what is black (in the farm laws). You people say this is a black law. I asked them what is black barring the ink (used). They said we endorse your view but these (laws) are still black,” the former Army chief told reporters in Basti, Uttar Pradesh.“What is the cure (for this)? There is no cure,” he said expressing his exasperation.“In farmers’ organisations, there is a fight for supremacy among themselves. These people cannot think about the benefits to small farmers,” he said.The farmer leaders said the unions were discussing the developments and will participate in the SKM meeting on Sunday.“We have decided not to leave the site till these laws are formally repealed in Parliament. Mobilisation of farmers on Delhi borders on November 26 to mark the first anniversary of the agitation will continue,” farmer leader at Tikri Border and SKM member Sudesh Goyat said.Hundreds of protesting farmers have been camping at important stretches of Delhi’s borders in Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur since November 2020, forcing people to take detours during interstate travel.It now appears that commuters will have to wait for some time for any reprieve on this front.On Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the Centre will repeal the three farm laws after the nearly year-long agitation by a section of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.The Supreme Court has stayed the implementation of the three laws in January.

A detailed copy of the order was made available on Saturday.The court said that perusal of the WhatsApp chats extracted from the phone of Aryan Khan shows that nothing objectionable was noticed to suggest that he, Merchant and Dhamecha along with other accused in the case have hatched a conspiracy of committing the offence in question.It also held that the confessional statement of Aryan Khan recorded by the NCB under section 67 of the NDPS Act can be considered only for investigation purposes and cannot be used as a tool for drawing an inference that the accused have committed an offence under the NDPS Act.“There is hardly any positive evidence on record to convince this court that all the accused persons with common intention agreed to commit unlawful acts,” the court said while rejecting the Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) argument that the case of all the accused ought to be considered together.Rather the probe carried out till date suggests that Aryan Khan and Arbaaz Merchant were travelling independently of Munmun Dhamecha and “there was no meeting of minds’ on the alleged offence, the 14-page order said.“So as to infer the case of conspiracy against the applicants also, there is absence of material on record of them having such meeting of minds with the other accused, who were named in the offence in question,” the order said.The court further noted that the trio had already suffered incarceration for almost 25 days and the prosecution had not even conducted a medical examination on them so as to determine if they had consumed drugs.Aryan Khan, Merchant and Dhamecha were arrested by the NCB on October 3 and were booked under relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act for conspiracy, possession, sale, purchase and illicit trafficking of banned substances.The court in its order noted that Aryan Khan was not found in possession of any objectionable substance and this fact has not been disputed. Merchant and Dhamecha were found to be in illegal possession of drugs, the quantity of which is considered a small quantity.“The court, in such cases, is first required to ascertain whether there is enough material on record to prima facie infer that the applicants (Aryan Khan, Merchant and Dhamecha) have hatched a conspiracy and that the prosecution was justified in invoking provisions of section 29 (criminal conspiracy) of the NDPS Act,” the order said.It added that to infer so, there has to be positive evidence about an agreement to do an unlawful act and such agreement must precede with meeting of minds. Justice Sambre further said that the court needs to be sensitive to the fact that there has to be presence of basic material in the form of evidence so as to substantiate the case of conspiracy against the accused persons.“Merely because the applicants were travelling on the cruise, that by itself cannot be termed as satisfying foundation for invoking provisions of section 29 (conspiracy) of the NDPS Act,” the court said.Justice Sambre further said that even if the case of the prosecution is considered, the maximum punishment is not more than one year for such an offence. Aryan Khan had walked out of the Arthur Road prison on October 30. As per the bail conditions imposed by the high court, he is required to appear before the NCB office in south Mumbai every Friday to mark his presence and shall not indulge in similar offences or tamper with evidence in the case.Aryan Khan, Merchant and Dhamecha have also been directed to not leave the country without permission from the trial court and to inform the NCB if they intend to leave Mumbai. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-positive-evidence-to-show-aryan-khan-2-others-conspired-to-commit-drug-related-offences-hc-340693
21-11-2021||New Delhi||Proposed tractor march to Parliament during Winter Session not withdrawn yet, say farmer leaders||The proposed daily tractor march to Parliament during the upcoming Winter Session has not been withdrawn and a final call on this as well as the future course of the agitation will be taken in a Sunday meeting, farmer leaders said on Saturday.To observe one year of the anti-farm law agitation, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of farmers’ unions, had earlier this month announced that 500 farmers will participate in peaceful tractor marches to Parliament every day during the Winter Session starting November 29.However, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday announced the Centre will repeal the three farm laws, marking a climbdown by his government to meet the unrelenting demand of farmers protesting in several states against the reform measures.SKM welcomed the prime minister’s decision but said they will wait for the announcement to take effect through due parliamentary procedures. It also indicated that its movement for a statutory guarantee of MSP and demand for the withdrawal of the Electricity Amendment Bill will continue.“Our call of tractor march to Parliament still stands. A final decision on the future course of the agitation and MSP issues will be taken in a meeting of the SKM at Singhu Border on Sunday,” farmer leader and SKM core committee member Darshan Pal told PTI on Saturday.Farmer leader and president of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan) Joginder Singh Ugrahan said at the Tikri border point that the tractor march has not yet been withdrawn.“The SKM will decide on the call for tractor trolly march to Parliament. So far, there is no call to withdraw it. A decision on this is likely to be taken on Sunday after the SKM’s core committee meeting,” he told PTI.On January 26, a tractor rally had turned violent with protesters breaking barricades, attacking security personnel and storming the Red Fort, where they hoisted a religious flag.Ugrahan reiterated that farmers will stay put here at Tikri and other borders until the Centre formally repeals these laws in Parliament. He said many farm unions are holding separate meetings to ponder over farms issues and future strategies after the prime minister’s Friday announcement.“Representatives of these farm unions will take part in the SKM meeting tomorrow,” the farmer leader said, adding the Central government should give a legal guarantee to MSP for all crops.Another farmer leader at Tikri border and SKM member, Sudesh Goyat said, “Farmers cannot trust the Centre on farm laws as earlier too they had announced to give one rank one pension (OROP) but it is yet to be done.”       “So, we have decided not to leave the site till these laws are formally repealed in Parliament. Mobilisation of farmers on Delhi borders on November 26 to mark the first anniversary of the agitation will continue,” she said.She added that so far there is no call to withdraw tractor march.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh under the aegis of various farmers unions have been protesting at the borders of the national capital since November 26 last year to demand repeal of the three farm laws. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/proposed-tractor-march-to-parliament-during-winter-session-not-withdrawn-yet-say-farmer-leaders-340688
21-11-2021||Lucknow||Priyanka Gandhi urges PM not to share stage with Union minister Ajay Mishra during DGPs’ conference||A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the repeal of the farm laws, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday urged him not to share the stage with Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra during the DGPs conference here keeping in mind farmers’ interest.She also sought the removal of Mishra from his post over the Lakhimpur Kheri violence in which his son is an accused.Priyanka Gandhi made the appeal to the prime minister through a letter that she read out in front of reporters hours before the commencement of the DGPs conference.“Yesterday, while addressing the countrymen, you had said that with true mind and pious heart and keeping in mind the interests of the farmers, an unprecedented decision to repeal the farm laws was taken. If this is true, then getting justice delivered to the families affected by the Lakhimpur Kheri violence should be your top priority,” the Congress general secretary said.“But, Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra ‘Teni’ still remains a member of your council of ministers. If you share the stage in the (DGPs) conference with the father of the accused (Ashish Mishra), then a clear message will go to the aggrieved families that you are still with those persons, who are giving patronage to the murderers”.She further said, “If today, your intention is really clear about the farmers of the country, then you should not share the stage with the Union Minister of State for Home, and remove him.”              The AICC general secretary also urged that cases registered against the farmers in the country for staging protests against the agri laws be withdrawn and financial assistance be given to the families of all those who died during the agitation.“You are the prime minister and you must be understanding well the responsibility towards the farmers of the country. Ensuring justice towards every citizen is not only the duty but also the moral responsibility of the prime minister,” she said in the letter written in Hindi.Referring to Ashish Mishra, the son of Union minister Ajay Mishra, the Congress leader said, “The entire country has been witness to the cruelty that has been meted out to the ‘annadatas’ (food providers) in Lakhimpur Kheri. You know that the son of the Union minister of state for Home is the main accused in running a vehicle over the farmers.               “Owing to political pressure, the Uttar Pradesh government has from the beginning tried to stifle the voice of justice. The Supreme Court has said that it seems the government is trying to save a special accused person,” she said.Violence had erupted in Lakhimpur Kheri on October 3 when farmers were protesting the visit of Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya’s visit to Mishra’s place. Four agitating farmers were run over by a vehicle while four others, including a journalist, two BJP workers were also killed in the violence that ensued.Priyanka Gandhi also said that she had met the family members of the deceased farmers, and they are in tremendous pain.“All the families want justice and with the Union minister of state for Home being in office, they do not have any hope of getting justice. The current situation of the probe in the Lakhimpur violence case proves that the apprehension of the families is correct. Home Minister Amit Shah and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath have shared the stage with him (Ajay Mishra),” she said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/priyanka-gandhi-urges-pm-not-to-share-stage-with-union-minister-ajay-mishra-during-dgps-conference-340678

21-11-2021||Kathmandu||Nepal won't allow third-country nationals to travel to India by rail||Nepal will not allow people from third countries to travel to India by rail via the Kurtha-Jayanagar railroad after Indian officials expressed security concerns, a senior official of the Department of Railways has said.Deepak Kumar Bhattarai, director general at the department,said: "This was agreed while finalising the Standard Operating Procedure (SPA) for cross-border railway operation," The Kathmandu Post reported.The SPA is a document outlining the procedures to be adopted while operating the railway service.Nepal and India signed the SPA in New Delhi last month.According to Bhattarai, India's security concern was one of the reasons why it took so long to finalise the SPA. With Nepal and India sharing a porous border, India has always been suspicious about the possibility of criminals and terrorists using the porous border to cause harm to India. Both sides have suffered from cross-border crimes over the last several years.According to Bhattarai, Nepal will also notify India about the passengers on board to ensure security clearance at the border point. "Based on the ticket issued, we will have to send details of the passengers travelling to India," he said.Even though the SPA was finalised, it is not clear when the railway service will resume with the Nepal government yet to introduce a law on railway service and the Nepal Railway Company yet to hire staff to operate the service.
