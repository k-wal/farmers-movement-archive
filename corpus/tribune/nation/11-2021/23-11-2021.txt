The prices further rose to Rs 80 per kg on November 23.There has been sharp rise in retail tomato prices in major cities of south India due to widespread moderate to heavy rainfalls during the northeast monsoon since the first week of November due to frequent formations of low-pressure areas in the Bay of Bengal, or cyclonic circulation in the Arabian Sea.As a result, the tomato crop has been damaged causing tight supply situation.Azadpur Tomato Association President Ashok Kaushik said, “The tomato supply to Delhi from south India has been affected because of the rains. If rains continue in the coming days, the prices in the national capital might rise from the current level.”     The tomato prices in Azadpur wholesale market fell slightly on Tuesday due to arrival of desi variety tomato from neighbouring states of Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, he said.At present, harvesting is underway in key growing states of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Tomato crop will be ready for harvest in around 2-3 months after planting and harvesting is done as per the requirement of the market.India, the world’s second largest tomato producer after China, produces around 19.75 million tonnes from an area of 7.89 lakh hectares with an average yield of 25.05 tonnes per hectare, according to National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation.

23-11-2021||New Delhi||SC-appointed panel member writes to CJI urging early release of report on farm laws||Anil Ghanwat, one of the members of the Supreme Court-appointed panel on farm laws, on Tuesday wrote to Chief Justice of India (CJI), urging him to consider releasing the report on the three agri laws in the public domain at the earliest or authorise the committee to do so. Ghanwat, also a senior leader of Shetkari Sangathan, separately in a media briefing said he will mobilise one lakh farmers to Delhi in the next couple of months demanding “badly” required agri reforms even after the repeal of the three farm laws. He also said the protesting farmers’ demand to make minimum support price (MSP) a legal guarantee and ensure procurement of all agri-crops at MSP is “not feasible and implementable.” In the letter dated November 23 written to CJI N V Ramana, Ghanwat said after the government’s decision to repeal the three farm laws in the coming Winter Session of Parliament, the panel’s report is “no longer relevant” but the recommendations are of great public interest.     It is important to ensure that while the specific laws may no longer exist, the “reform impulse” that was reflected in the three farm laws is not “diluted,” he said.“The report can also play an educational role and ease the misapprehensions of many farmers who have, in my opinion, been misguided by some leaders....,” he added. The three-member panel had submitted the report to the apex court on March 19. Since then, the report has not been made public despite Ghanwat having requested the CJI in a letter dated September 1 to release the panel’s report in the public domain saying its “recommendations will pave the way to resolve the ongoing farmers’ agitation.”              Ghanwat further said in the latest letter that the three farm laws were accepted “in-principle” by protesting farmers but were not accepted entirely because the government’s policy process was not “consultative.”    He requested the CJI to consider directing the Centre to develop and implement an exemplary and robust policy process that is followed in developed nations.     “That will ensure a fiasco of this sort is not repeated and the valuable time of the court not wasted in the government’s fruitless, unproductive endeavours which also end up causing angst and frustration in the community,” he said.For instance, with the repeal of the laws, a large number of farmers are now even further frustrated with India’s lack of attention to their needs, he added in the letter.Ghantwat suggested setting up a committee to prepare a white paper for making new farm laws.     Briefing media on this issue, Ghanwat said the current situation would not have arisen had the apex court released the report in the public domain within a few days after its submission.     “It’s been over eight months since the report has been submitted. Now the laws are going to be repealed, at least the report should be made available to the public so that people know the recommendations,” he added.     Ghanwat stressed that the reforms in the agriculture sector are “badly” required and this should not stop with the repeal of the three laws.     “We want reforms. I am going to travel across the country and make farmers understand the benefits of agri-reforms and bring one lakh farmers to Delhi in the next couple of months demanding farm reforms,” he said.     On protesting farmers’ demand to make MSP a legal guarantee, Ghanwat said he was not against the MSP system but it should be implemented in a limited way.     “Where will the government get funds for procurement of all agri-crops? Even if it procures all crops, how will those crops be stored and disposed of,” he asked.If there is demand to procure all non-perishable products, then farmers producing perishable crops will also demand procurement of crops like potato, tomato and onions, he said.     “This is not feasible and implementable. All the government’s revenue cannot be spent on MSP. If done, then the government will not have funds for development of other sectors,” he added.The solution to this problem is to liberate the agriculture sector and give marketing freedom to farmers, he added.     “We cannot go along with the existing policy of the government. There should be reforms. Those reforms were suggested in the report.”   This report should be considered by a new committee to be established as announced by the Prime Minister to study the MSP and other issues, he added.

In spite of his grievous injuries, he continued to hold his ground resolutely and laid down his life for the motherland, according to the details.Naik Deepak Singh, who too belonged to the 16 Bihar regiment and was performing duties as a nursing assistant, played a pivotal role in rendering treatment and saving the lives of more than 30 Indian soldiers.Sepoy Gurtej Singh, who was from the third battalion of the Punjab regiment, successfully spotted the enemy troops while establishing the observation post.Singh displayed raw courage and exceptional combat skills in resisting the enemy troops and kept fighting even after he was seriously injured, according to the official accounts of the clash.Several other armed forces personnel were also honoured at the ceremony held at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.Notable among them was the Shaurya Chakra awarded posthumously to Major Anuj Sood of the 21st Battalion, Rashtriya Rifles.

23-11-2021||Bhopal||Patalpani railway station in Indore to be named after tribal icon Tantya Bhil: MP CM||Continuing the tribal outreach and accusing Congress of crediting only one family for achieving Independence, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced to name Patalpani railway station in Indore and two other landmarks in that city after tribal icon Tantya Bhil.Notably, Bhopal’s Habibganj railway station was recently named after Rani Kamalapati, a tribal queen.Accusing the previous governments of ignoring the tribal history, Chouhan on Monday said that Indore’s Bhanwar Kuan intersection and MR 10 bus stand, being developed at the cost of Rs 53 crore, will also be named after Tantya Bhil.“Like Bhopal’s Rani Kamalapati station, Patalpani railway station (in Indore district) will be named after Tantya Bhil, who had sacrificed his life,” Chouhan said while addressing a tribal gathering, marking the conclusion of the week-long ‘Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas’ celebrations.On the occasion of the ‘Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas’ on November 15, which was observed on the birth anniversary of revered tribal leader and freedom fighter Birsa Munda, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken a veiled swipe at Congress saying previous governments had ignored the history and contribution of tribals.Chouhan said tribes in the country and Madhya Pradesh have a glorious past and tribal heroes played a very important role in the freedom struggle. The British had made all efforts to end the pride of our tribes. The state government will restore that pride, he added.“The history about the contribution of the Gondwana kingdom in the freedom struggle and battle against the Mughals was not taught properly. The wrong history about the freedom struggle was taught and they talked only about one family saying we got freedom because of Nehru ji (Jawaharlal Nehru) and Indira ji (Indira Gandhi). The contribution of tribal icons like Raja Shankar Shah, Raghunath Shah, Tantya Mama (Bhil), Bhima Nayak was never told,” he alleged.Chouhan said “petty and false” cases against tribals will be withdrawn. “Youngsters from tribal communities would be trained so that they can clear the competitive Army recruitment exams,” he said.The CM said a medical college will be opened in Mandla in the name of king Hirde Shah, a freedom fighter.Known as the “Indian Robin Hood” by tribals, Tantya Bhil is hailed as one of the revolutionaries who waged an armed struggle against the British rule for 12 years. It is said that Tantya used to loot the treasuries of the British government and distribute the wealth among the poor.

23-11-2021||New Delhi||Central Vista project: SC dismisses plea challenging change in land use of plot||The Supreme Court Tuesday dismissed a plea challenging the change in land use of a plot where the new official residence of the Vice-President is proposed as part of the ambitious Central Vista project in Lutyens’ Delhi.Everything can be criticised but it should be “constructive criticism”, the apex court observed and said it was a policy matter and the authority concerned has offered sufficient explanation to justify the change in land use of the plot.“We find no reason to examine the matter further and therefore put a quietus to the entire controversy by dismissing this petition,” a bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar said.The bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and C T Ravikumar, was hearing a petition challenging the change in land use of plot number one from recreational area to residential.As the petitioner’s counsel argued that the change in land use of the plot is not in public interest and they are seeking to only protect the green and open area, the bench orally asked, “Hereafter, recommendation will be taken from common citizens as to where the Vice President’s residence should be?”.“Everything can be criticised. There is no difficulty about that but the criticism should be constructive criticism,” the bench said, adding, “How the Vice-President’s residence can be shifted elsewhere.” It observed that policy makers have considered these aspects.The Central Vista revamp, announced in September 2019, envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with a seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is to be constructed by August 2022, when the country will celebrate its 75th Independence Day.The common Central Secretariat is to be built by 2024 under the project that covers a 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in the national capital.During the hearing, the counsel appearing for the petitioner said they are not on the location of the Vice-President’s residence but the change in land use is not in public interest as these are open and green areas.“It is not some private property which is being created there. It is for Vice-President’s residence as per the affidavit,” the bench observed, adding, “In Vice-President’s residence, there is bound to be green area around.”          The counsel said the petitioner cannot have any objection as far as residence of Vice-President is concerned.When he said that six acre of green area is being proposed to be taken over, the bench observed that it is a matter of policy.“Unless you are alleging mala fide, how can we go into that issue. On what ground can we interfere. The judicial review will be in respect of what?” the bench said.It said the affidavit filed by the authority give reasons as to why the change was necessitated and it also says that some other areas have been added to increase the greenery.“It is a fact that it was never used as recreational ground,” the bench observed.The apex court said even if it is assumed that the plot was used for recreational purpose in the past, is it not open to the authority to make changes which are essential for the holistic development of the area.The petitioner’s counsel said that in larger public interest, they are seeking to only protect the green and open area.He said like ‘salami slice’, a smaller portion of land is taken and then the authority says it is compensating it.The counsel argued that the affidavit filed by the authority is vague and no green area or open area is compensated in the Central Vista region.“Is it a matter of arithmetic that if 10 metre area is taken, then 10 metre area has to be provided at other place,” the bench said, adding, “After having seen the affidavit, is it possible for you to say that it was done mischievously, with mala fide.”                The counsel said they are invoking the public trust doctrine.“We are not impressed with this argument. If you have some better arguments, we will consider that,” the bench said.At the fag end of hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the bench that the apex court had considered these aspects in the first round of litigation in the matter.“There has to be end to everything,” he said.The bench noted in its order that it is not the case of the petitioner that the authorities have no power to introduce such change.“The only argument is that in the past, since the plot was shown as recreational ground, it should have been retained as such and at least the commensurate area should have been provided elsewhere for that purpose,” it noted.In January this year, the apex court, by 2:1 majority, had held that the grant of environmental clearance and the notification for change in land use for construction of new Parliament building under the project was valid.The top court’s verdict had come on several pleas, including those against various permissions given to the project by authorities including the grant of environmental clearance and the nod to change of land use.The top court had in June this year dismissed a separate plea challenging the Delhi High Court order which had rejected a petition seeking to halt Central Vista construction work in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

She is accompanied by Deputy US Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi.“The US and India have realised the necessity of diversifying their critical supply chains and both are poised to play an important role in developing a resilient supply chain. While the relationship has changed over the past few years, particularly through defence cooperation and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, it is time to take it to the next level of engagement,” the minister suggested.In her opening speech, Tai mentioned India’s unpredictable regulatory requirements and restrictive trade and digital measures that prevent the smooth flow of goods and services between the two countries. She also raised the issue of fisheries subsidies on which India has a different approach.But more important, Tai spoke of further collaboration on labour-centric policies and the need to connect trade to working people. The USTR was essentially reiterating the message she gave during her first two legs of her visit to Japan and South Korea and marks a shift in the Biden administration’s approach to trade. In Japan also, she had noted the importance of international cooperation on workers’ rights, including the importance of promoting responsible business practices in global supply chains.Tai had cleared the decks in June for more meaningful conversations on trade by suspending retaliatory sanctions on India for imposing the digital services tax.Tai and Goyal had held a virtual meeting on November 2, where they had agreed to take a comprehensive look at expanding the trade relationship. Last month, senior officials from the USTR Office, Chris Wilson, Brendan Lynch and Emily Ashby, had visited Delhi to prepare for the US-India Trade Policy Forum meeting which was agreed upon during the Modi-Biden meeting in September.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/were-a-trusted-ally-piyush-goyal-to-us-341560

TNSICMR chief Balram Bhargava said there was no current scientific evidence supporting the boosters.Bhargava also downplayed studies that earlier claimed reduction in antibodies to Covid-19 after a few months of inoculation and therefore the need for boosters.He said there was no need to measure antibodies as the immunity responses build up at various levels. On a study by one of its own regional centres in Bhubaneshwar that said Covid vaccine induced antibodies lasted from two to four months and therefore boosters could help, Bhargava said, “Booster doses of Covid vaccine are not a central theme at the moment in the scientific discussion. Getting two doses of the vaccine is a major priority. Several scientific rationale are now available to suggest that antibody levels should not be measured. You can have all kinds of immunity responses post vaccination — from cellular to mucosal immunity.

Congress chief whip in the Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh in his dissenting note to panel chairman PP Chaudhary questioned Section 35 of the Bill, saying it gave almost unbridled powers to the Centre to exempt any of its agencies from the entire Act itself.“I had suggested amendments whereby the Centre would have to get parliamentary approval for granting such exemption to its agencies. I was willing to compromise provided the JCP recommended the reasons for exemption that would be recorded in writing (as provided for in the Bill) would be tabled in both Houses but even that was not found acceptable,” Jairam said.He recalled Justice Srikrishna Committee Report 2018 on right to privacy had identified security of the state as the sole interest that should be privileged under exceptional conditions. Jairam also dissented from provisions of Section 12(a)(i) of the Bill to create exceptions for governments and its agencies from the provisions of consent while processing personal data.“I had recommended changes to make the exemption less sweeping and less automatic. The JCP’s report allows two years for private companies to migrate to the new data protection regime but the government and its agencies have no such stipulation,” Jairam said in his note. Tewari rejected the entire Bill, citing design flaws and said a Bill that sought to provide blanket exemptions to the state and its instrumentalities was ultra vires.TMC’s Derek and Moitra raised the “Orwellian nature of the Bill and improper functioning of the committee.” They opposed the proposals for the inclusion of non-personal data within the legislation.

He was awarded Vir Chakra by President Ram Nath Kovind during an investiture ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhawan.Though the award had been announced earlier, Covid protocols delayed the physical ceremony. The citation of the IAF pilot spoke about the air duel. “He pursued a retreating enemy fighter bomber aircraft and in the ensuing aerial combat, shot down an F-16 jet with his on-board missile,” it said. The citation makes it official that Vir Chakra was conferred on him for downing an F-16 jet, among other acts of bravery, including his capture after ejecting over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.US-based think tanks have in the past questioned if an F-16, made by Lockheed Martin, was shot down that day in the air duel.

But that would have meant that customers would have received a maximum of Rs 5 lakh for their deposit.The draft scheme envisages takeover of the assets and liabilities of PMC Bank, including deposits, by the USFB, which was set up with capital of Rs 1,100 crore as against regulatory requirement of Rs 200 crore for setting up of a small finance bank, with provision for further infusion of capital at a future date after amalgamation.Suggestions and objections to the draft scheme are open till December 10.The RBI has also warned that co-operative societies cannot use the words “bank”, “banker” or “banking” as part of their names following the amendment of the Banking Regulation Act, which came into force on September 29.The RBI has also said accepting deposits from non-members by some co-operative societies is tantamount to conducting banking business in violation of the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act.The RBI said such cooperative societies using the word “bank” have neither been issued any licence nor are they authorised by the RBI for doing banking business. The insurance cover from Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) is also not available for deposits placed with these societies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rbi-floats-draft-scheme-for-amalgamation-of-pmc-bank-341553

The prices further rose to Rs 80 per kg on November 23.There has been sharp rise in retail tomato prices in major cities of south India due to widespread moderate to heavy rainfalls during the northeast monsoon since the first week of November due to frequent formations of low-pressure areas in the Bay of Bengal, or cyclonic circulation in the Arabian Sea.As a result, the tomato crop has been damaged causing tight supply situation.Azadpur Tomato Association President Ashok Kaushik said, “The tomato supply to Delhi from south India has been affected because of the rains. If rains continue in the coming days, the prices in the national capital might rise from the current level.”     The tomato prices in Azadpur wholesale market fell slightly on Tuesday due to arrival of desi variety tomato from neighbouring states of Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, he said.At present, harvesting is underway in key growing states of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Tomato crop will be ready for harvest in around 2-3 months after planting and harvesting is done as per the requirement of the market.India, the world’s second largest tomato producer after China, produces around 19.75 million tonnes from an area of 7.89 lakh hectares with an average yield of 25.05 tonnes per hectare, according to National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation.

23-11-2021||New Delhi||SC-appointed panel member writes to CJI urging early release of report on farm laws||Anil Ghanwat, one of the members of the Supreme Court-appointed panel on farm laws, on Tuesday wrote to Chief Justice of India (CJI), urging him to consider releasing the report on the three agri laws in the public domain at the earliest or authorise the committee to do so. Ghanwat, also a senior leader of Shetkari Sangathan, separately in a media briefing said he will mobilise one lakh farmers to Delhi in the next couple of months demanding “badly” required agri reforms even after the repeal of the three farm laws. He also said the protesting farmers’ demand to make minimum support price (MSP) a legal guarantee and ensure procurement of all agri-crops at MSP is “not feasible and implementable.” In the letter dated November 23 written to CJI N V Ramana, Ghanwat said after the government’s decision to repeal the three farm laws in the coming Winter Session of Parliament, the panel’s report is “no longer relevant” but the recommendations are of great public interest.     It is important to ensure that while the specific laws may no longer exist, the “reform impulse” that was reflected in the three farm laws is not “diluted,” he said.“The report can also play an educational role and ease the misapprehensions of many farmers who have, in my opinion, been misguided by some leaders....,” he added. The three-member panel had submitted the report to the apex court on March 19. Since then, the report has not been made public despite Ghanwat having requested the CJI in a letter dated September 1 to release the panel’s report in the public domain saying its “recommendations will pave the way to resolve the ongoing farmers’ agitation.”              Ghanwat further said in the latest letter that the three farm laws were accepted “in-principle” by protesting farmers but were not accepted entirely because the government’s policy process was not “consultative.”    He requested the CJI to consider directing the Centre to develop and implement an exemplary and robust policy process that is followed in developed nations.     “That will ensure a fiasco of this sort is not repeated and the valuable time of the court not wasted in the government’s fruitless, unproductive endeavours which also end up causing angst and frustration in the community,” he said.For instance, with the repeal of the laws, a large number of farmers are now even further frustrated with India’s lack of attention to their needs, he added in the letter.Ghantwat suggested setting up a committee to prepare a white paper for making new farm laws.     Briefing media on this issue, Ghanwat said the current situation would not have arisen had the apex court released the report in the public domain within a few days after its submission.     “It’s been over eight months since the report has been submitted. Now the laws are going to be repealed, at least the report should be made available to the public so that people know the recommendations,” he added.     Ghanwat stressed that the reforms in the agriculture sector are “badly” required and this should not stop with the repeal of the three laws.     “We want reforms. I am going to travel across the country and make farmers understand the benefits of agri-reforms and bring one lakh farmers to Delhi in the next couple of months demanding farm reforms,” he said.     On protesting farmers’ demand to make MSP a legal guarantee, Ghanwat said he was not against the MSP system but it should be implemented in a limited way.     “Where will the government get funds for procurement of all agri-crops? Even if it procures all crops, how will those crops be stored and disposed of,” he asked.If there is demand to procure all non-perishable products, then farmers producing perishable crops will also demand procurement of crops like potato, tomato and onions, he said.     “This is not feasible and implementable. All the government’s revenue cannot be spent on MSP. If done, then the government will not have funds for development of other sectors,” he added.The solution to this problem is to liberate the agriculture sector and give marketing freedom to farmers, he added.     “We cannot go along with the existing policy of the government. There should be reforms. Those reforms were suggested in the report.”   This report should be considered by a new committee to be established as announced by the Prime Minister to study the MSP and other issues, he added.

In spite of his grievous injuries, he continued to hold his ground resolutely and laid down his life for the motherland, according to the details.Naik Deepak Singh, who too belonged to the 16 Bihar regiment and was performing duties as a nursing assistant, played a pivotal role in rendering treatment and saving the lives of more than 30 Indian soldiers.Sepoy Gurtej Singh, who was from the third battalion of the Punjab regiment, successfully spotted the enemy troops while establishing the observation post.Singh displayed raw courage and exceptional combat skills in resisting the enemy troops and kept fighting even after he was seriously injured, according to the official accounts of the clash.Several other armed forces personnel were also honoured at the ceremony held at the Rashtrapati Bhavan.Notable among them was the Shaurya Chakra awarded posthumously to Major Anuj Sood of the 21st Battalion, Rashtriya Rifles.

23-11-2021||Bhopal||Patalpani railway station in Indore to be named after tribal icon Tantya Bhil: MP CM||Continuing the tribal outreach and accusing Congress of crediting only one family for achieving Independence, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced to name Patalpani railway station in Indore and two other landmarks in that city after tribal icon Tantya Bhil.Notably, Bhopal’s Habibganj railway station was recently named after Rani Kamalapati, a tribal queen.Accusing the previous governments of ignoring the tribal history, Chouhan on Monday said that Indore’s Bhanwar Kuan intersection and MR 10 bus stand, being developed at the cost of Rs 53 crore, will also be named after Tantya Bhil.“Like Bhopal’s Rani Kamalapati station, Patalpani railway station (in Indore district) will be named after Tantya Bhil, who had sacrificed his life,” Chouhan said while addressing a tribal gathering, marking the conclusion of the week-long ‘Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas’ celebrations.On the occasion of the ‘Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas’ on November 15, which was observed on the birth anniversary of revered tribal leader and freedom fighter Birsa Munda, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had taken a veiled swipe at Congress saying previous governments had ignored the history and contribution of tribals.Chouhan said tribes in the country and Madhya Pradesh have a glorious past and tribal heroes played a very important role in the freedom struggle. The British had made all efforts to end the pride of our tribes. The state government will restore that pride, he added.“The history about the contribution of the Gondwana kingdom in the freedom struggle and battle against the Mughals was not taught properly. The wrong history about the freedom struggle was taught and they talked only about one family saying we got freedom because of Nehru ji (Jawaharlal Nehru) and Indira ji (Indira Gandhi). The contribution of tribal icons like Raja Shankar Shah, Raghunath Shah, Tantya Mama (Bhil), Bhima Nayak was never told,” he alleged.Chouhan said “petty and false” cases against tribals will be withdrawn. “Youngsters from tribal communities would be trained so that they can clear the competitive Army recruitment exams,” he said.The CM said a medical college will be opened in Mandla in the name of king Hirde Shah, a freedom fighter.Known as the “Indian Robin Hood” by tribals, Tantya Bhil is hailed as one of the revolutionaries who waged an armed struggle against the British rule for 12 years. It is said that Tantya used to loot the treasuries of the British government and distribute the wealth among the poor.

23-11-2021||New Delhi||Central Vista project: SC dismisses plea challenging change in land use of plot||The Supreme Court Tuesday dismissed a plea challenging the change in land use of a plot where the new official residence of the Vice-President is proposed as part of the ambitious Central Vista project in Lutyens’ Delhi.Everything can be criticised but it should be “constructive criticism”, the apex court observed and said it was a policy matter and the authority concerned has offered sufficient explanation to justify the change in land use of the plot.“We find no reason to examine the matter further and therefore put a quietus to the entire controversy by dismissing this petition,” a bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar said.The bench, also comprising Justices Dinesh Maheshwari and C T Ravikumar, was hearing a petition challenging the change in land use of plot number one from recreational area to residential.As the petitioner’s counsel argued that the change in land use of the plot is not in public interest and they are seeking to only protect the green and open area, the bench orally asked, “Hereafter, recommendation will be taken from common citizens as to where the Vice President’s residence should be?”.“Everything can be criticised. There is no difficulty about that but the criticism should be constructive criticism,” the bench said, adding, “How the Vice-President’s residence can be shifted elsewhere.” It observed that policy makers have considered these aspects.The Central Vista revamp, announced in September 2019, envisages a new triangular Parliament building, with a seating capacity for 900 to 1,200 MPs, that is to be constructed by August 2022, when the country will celebrate its 75th Independence Day.The common Central Secretariat is to be built by 2024 under the project that covers a 3-km stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate in the national capital.During the hearing, the counsel appearing for the petitioner said they are not on the location of the Vice-President’s residence but the change in land use is not in public interest as these are open and green areas.“It is not some private property which is being created there. It is for Vice-President’s residence as per the affidavit,” the bench observed, adding, “In Vice-President’s residence, there is bound to be green area around.”          The counsel said the petitioner cannot have any objection as far as residence of Vice-President is concerned.When he said that six acre of green area is being proposed to be taken over, the bench observed that it is a matter of policy.“Unless you are alleging mala fide, how can we go into that issue. On what ground can we interfere. The judicial review will be in respect of what?” the bench said.It said the affidavit filed by the authority give reasons as to why the change was necessitated and it also says that some other areas have been added to increase the greenery.“It is a fact that it was never used as recreational ground,” the bench observed.The apex court said even if it is assumed that the plot was used for recreational purpose in the past, is it not open to the authority to make changes which are essential for the holistic development of the area.The petitioner’s counsel said that in larger public interest, they are seeking to only protect the green and open area.He said like ‘salami slice’, a smaller portion of land is taken and then the authority says it is compensating it.The counsel argued that the affidavit filed by the authority is vague and no green area or open area is compensated in the Central Vista region.“Is it a matter of arithmetic that if 10 metre area is taken, then 10 metre area has to be provided at other place,” the bench said, adding, “After having seen the affidavit, is it possible for you to say that it was done mischievously, with mala fide.”                The counsel said they are invoking the public trust doctrine.“We are not impressed with this argument. If you have some better arguments, we will consider that,” the bench said.At the fag end of hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the bench that the apex court had considered these aspects in the first round of litigation in the matter.“There has to be end to everything,” he said.The bench noted in its order that it is not the case of the petitioner that the authorities have no power to introduce such change.“The only argument is that in the past, since the plot was shown as recreational ground, it should have been retained as such and at least the commensurate area should have been provided elsewhere for that purpose,” it noted.In January this year, the apex court, by 2:1 majority, had held that the grant of environmental clearance and the notification for change in land use for construction of new Parliament building under the project was valid.The top court’s verdict had come on several pleas, including those against various permissions given to the project by authorities including the grant of environmental clearance and the nod to change of land use.The top court had in June this year dismissed a separate plea challenging the Delhi High Court order which had rejected a petition seeking to halt Central Vista construction work in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

She is accompanied by Deputy US Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi.“The US and India have realised the necessity of diversifying their critical supply chains and both are poised to play an important role in developing a resilient supply chain. While the relationship has changed over the past few years, particularly through defence cooperation and the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, it is time to take it to the next level of engagement,” the minister suggested.In her opening speech, Tai mentioned India’s unpredictable regulatory requirements and restrictive trade and digital measures that prevent the smooth flow of goods and services between the two countries. She also raised the issue of fisheries subsidies on which India has a different approach.But more important, Tai spoke of further collaboration on labour-centric policies and the need to connect trade to working people. The USTR was essentially reiterating the message she gave during her first two legs of her visit to Japan and South Korea and marks a shift in the Biden administration’s approach to trade. In Japan also, she had noted the importance of international cooperation on workers’ rights, including the importance of promoting responsible business practices in global supply chains.Tai had cleared the decks in June for more meaningful conversations on trade by suspending retaliatory sanctions on India for imposing the digital services tax.Tai and Goyal had held a virtual meeting on November 2, where they had agreed to take a comprehensive look at expanding the trade relationship. Last month, senior officials from the USTR Office, Chris Wilson, Brendan Lynch and Emily Ashby, had visited Delhi to prepare for the US-India Trade Policy Forum meeting which was agreed upon during the Modi-Biden meeting in September.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/were-a-trusted-ally-piyush-goyal-to-us-341560

TNSICMR chief Balram Bhargava said there was no current scientific evidence supporting the boosters.Bhargava also downplayed studies that earlier claimed reduction in antibodies to Covid-19 after a few months of inoculation and therefore the need for boosters.He said there was no need to measure antibodies as the immunity responses build up at various levels. On a study by one of its own regional centres in Bhubaneshwar that said Covid vaccine induced antibodies lasted from two to four months and therefore boosters could help, Bhargava said, “Booster doses of Covid vaccine are not a central theme at the moment in the scientific discussion. Getting two doses of the vaccine is a major priority. Several scientific rationale are now available to suggest that antibody levels should not be measured. You can have all kinds of immunity responses post vaccination — from cellular to mucosal immunity.

Congress chief whip in the Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh in his dissenting note to panel chairman PP Chaudhary questioned Section 35 of the Bill, saying it gave almost unbridled powers to the Centre to exempt any of its agencies from the entire Act itself.“I had suggested amendments whereby the Centre would have to get parliamentary approval for granting such exemption to its agencies. I was willing to compromise provided the JCP recommended the reasons for exemption that would be recorded in writing (as provided for in the Bill) would be tabled in both Houses but even that was not found acceptable,” Jairam said.He recalled Justice Srikrishna Committee Report 2018 on right to privacy had identified security of the state as the sole interest that should be privileged under exceptional conditions. Jairam also dissented from provisions of Section 12(a)(i) of the Bill to create exceptions for governments and its agencies from the provisions of consent while processing personal data.“I had recommended changes to make the exemption less sweeping and less automatic. The JCP’s report allows two years for private companies to migrate to the new data protection regime but the government and its agencies have no such stipulation,” Jairam said in his note. Tewari rejected the entire Bill, citing design flaws and said a Bill that sought to provide blanket exemptions to the state and its instrumentalities was ultra vires.TMC’s Derek and Moitra raised the “Orwellian nature of the Bill and improper functioning of the committee.” They opposed the proposals for the inclusion of non-personal data within the legislation.

He was awarded Vir Chakra by President Ram Nath Kovind during an investiture ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhawan.Though the award had been announced earlier, Covid protocols delayed the physical ceremony. The citation of the IAF pilot spoke about the air duel. “He pursued a retreating enemy fighter bomber aircraft and in the ensuing aerial combat, shot down an F-16 jet with his on-board missile,” it said. The citation makes it official that Vir Chakra was conferred on him for downing an F-16 jet, among other acts of bravery, including his capture after ejecting over Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.US-based think tanks have in the past questioned if an F-16, made by Lockheed Martin, was shot down that day in the air duel. Christine Fair, a well-regarded academic, had questioned the claim of the IAF and stirred up a heated debate at the Military Literature Festival in Chandigarh in December 2019 saying, “I say this clearly with 100 per cent certitude that there was no F-16 struck down.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gp-capt-abhinandan-receives-vir-chakra-for-downing-pak-jet-341551

(USFB). The PMC Bank was placed under the RBI’s watch after fraud led to a steep deterioration in its net worth.No other viable optionThe merger is necessitated as given the PMC Bank’s financial condition and in the absence of proposals for capital infusion, it is not viable on its own. In that event, the only course of action could have been cancellation of its licence and taking it for liquidation. But that would have meant that customers would have received a maximum of Rs 5 lakh for their deposit.The draft scheme envisages takeover of the assets and liabilities of PMC Bank, including deposits, by the USFB, which was set up with capital of Rs 1,100 crore as against regulatory requirement of Rs 200 crore for setting up of a small finance bank, with provision for further infusion of capital at a future date after amalgamation.Suggestions and objections to the draft scheme are open till December 10.The RBI has also warned that co-operative societies cannot use the words “bank”, “banker” or “banking” as part of their names following the amendment of the Banking Regulation Act, which came into force on September 29.The RBI has also said accepting deposits from non-members by some co-operative societies is tantamount to conducting banking business in violation of the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act.The RBI said such cooperative societies using the word “bank” have neither been issued any licence nor are they authorised by the RBI for doing banking business. The insurance cover from Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) is also not available for deposits placed with these societies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rbi-floats-draft-scheme-for-amalgamation-of-pmc-bank-341553

It should now be made public… After the government’s decision to repeal the farm laws in the coming Winter Session of Parliament, it (report) is not relevant with regard to the three laws…But there are other suggestions on farmers’ issues,” Ghanwat told The Tribune.He said there was a meeting held on Monday and discussed in detail whether to make the report public or not. “The other two members gave me the freedom to take a call on this issue. I will decide after analysing the legal consequences, if any,” he said.       The three-member panel had submitted its report to the top court in a sealed cover on March 19 on measures to end the deadlock. The other two panel members are Pramod Kumar Joshi (Director South Asia international Food Policy), and agriculture-economist and former Chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) Ashok Gulati. The fourth member of the panel Bhartiya Kisan Union President Bhupinder Singh Mann had recused himself.He had earlier written to the Chief Justice of India to make the report public, saying its “recommendations will pave the way to resolve the ongoing farmers’ agitation.” Ghanwat, President of Shetkari Sanghatan—said he will speak to the Press on Tuesday on the issue in detail.The panel had held 12 rounds of consultations with various stakeholders, including farmers groups, farmer producers’ organisations (FPOs), procurement agencies, professionals, academicians, private as well as state agriculture marketing boards.The three central farm laws—Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act – will be repealed in the Winter Session of Parliament commencing on November 29.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/report-should-be-made-public-sc-appointed-agri-panel-member-341538

Qamar Javed Bajwa, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and NSA Moeed Yousaf, where he chaired its first apex committee meeting. Pakistan will also facilitate the return of Afghan patients who had gone to India for medical treatment and are stuck there, he announced.Pakistan will also immediately ship in-kind humanitarian assistance worth Rs 5 billion, including 50,000 tonnes of wheat and winter shelters. The Pak PM also announced in-principle tariff and sales tax reduction on key Afghan exports to Pakistan.The announcement, however, may not mean that Indian aid will start transiting through Pakistan territory immediately. Pakistani authorities have still to convey whether Indian trucks will be allowed to travel to Afghanistan or whether they will insist on the more cumbersome process of unloading the whet and loading it on Pakistani or Afghan goods carriers.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistan-to-allow-indian-aid-to-afghanistan-imran-khan-341530

The state Vidhan Sabha on Monday brought the AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions (Repeal) Bill, 2021, repealing the three capital model for the state.Andhra Pradesh had earlier proposed to separate the administrative, legislative and judicial capitals for the state. This move drew a lot of criticism as it would require people to shuttle between the Executive Capital Visakhapatnam to Legislative Capital at Amaravati and Judicial Capital to Kurnool, spread across hundreds of kilometres from north to south-west.The state is yet to develop a new proposal on where it would like to house its capital city. The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) had proposed Amravati on the bank of River Krishna, which is also a twin city of Vijayawada, as the Capital. The YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) scrapped the project, alleging a scam on coming to power.After dividing Andhra Pradesh into two in 2014, Telangana acquired Hyderabad as its state capital, but for Andhra Pradesh State Capital remains a contentious issue. Till 2019, Andhra Pradesh was sharing space with Telangana at Hyderabad, but after the YSRCP came to power, it vacated all spaces in Hyderabad, ahead of the ten years granted to it to build its capital city.The move to scrap the three capital model comes after strong protests from the main opposition TDP and several farmer organisations, acquiring lands to develop Amravati.The Chief Minister made a statement on the floor of the House saying, “Everyone knows the TDP government’s decision to set up a capital in Amaravati was controversial, and that it went against the Sivaramakrishnan committee report.”He pointed out that the state was given ten years to develop a Capital at the cost of Rupees 1 lakh crore, but the price has since risen many times. He said that his government was elected with a clear mandate to replicate a Hyderabad city for Andhra Pradesh.The TDP leaders criticised the move, saying that the YSRCP Government first scrapped the Amravati Capital Project and is now considering developing it all over again, causing a massive loss to people and the government and embarrassment to all.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhra-pradesh-scraps-controversial-three-capital-model-341516

Inconvenience caused is regretted,” the Indian Railways said in a statement.The uniforms have been changed to normal shirts and trousers and traditional headgear. The waiters will, however, wear saffron masks and gloves.“We wrote a letter to the railway minister two days ago, lodging our protest against waiters serving refreshments and food in the Ramayan Express in saffron. Donning a saffron attire with a sadhu-like headgear and wearing malas (necklaces) of rudraksha is an insult to the Hindu religion and its seers,” Ujjain Akhada Parishad’s former general secretary Avdeshpuri told PTI.He said seers would stop the train at Delhi’s Safdarjung railway station if the saffron dress code of the waiters was not changed.“We will sit on the railway tracks. This is necessary for protecting the Hindu religion,” he added.Ujjain city in Madhya Pradesh, where the Mahakaleshwar Shiva temple is located, hosts the Simhastha Kumbh Mela every 12 years.The first Ramayan circuit train chugged off on a 17-day journey from the Safdarjung railway station on November 7. It will visit 15 places associated with the life of Lord Ram. Covering a distance of more than 7,500 km, the train will take pilgrims to places such as Ayodhya, Prayag, Nandigram, Janakpur, Chitrakoot, Sitamarhi, Nasik, Hampi and Rameshwaram.The Ramayan Express train is equipped with first-class restaurants, a library and shower cubicles.

23-11-2021||Puttaparthi||Rulers need to introspect everyday, says CJI Ramana||Rulers should introspect everyday whether the decisions taken by them are good and also check if they have any bad characteristics, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said on Monday.Addressing the 40th convocation of Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning in Puttaparthi town in Anantapuramu district, Justice Ramana, quoting Mahabharata and Ramayana, said there are 14 bad qualities of rulers which they should avoid.“All the rulers in the democratic set-up, before beginning their routine work, should introspect whether they have any bad characteristics. There is need to offer just administration and it should be according to people’s needs. There are several wise men here and you are watching the developments that are taking place worldwide and countrywide,” he said.He said people are the ultimate lords in democracy and whatever decision has been taken by the dispensation should benefit them.He further said it was his desire that all the systems in the country should be independent and honest aiming to serve the people which Sathya Sai Baba also used to say the same thing.Unfortunately, the modern education system tends to focus only on the utilitarian function and such a system is not equipped to deal with the moral or spiritual function of education which builds the character of students and allows them to develop a social consciousness and a sense of responsibility, Justice Ramana said.“True education is one which imbibes moral values and virtues of humility, discipline, selflessness, compassion, tolerance, forgiveness and mutual respect,” He said.On Sathya Sai Baba, Justice Ramana said, “I had the good fortune of having Baba’s darshan. I have always carried with me his words of wisdom.” He further said: “There is no greater proponent of service, no greater mentor to follow than Baba himself. Sathya Sai means love, Sathya Sai means service, Sathya Sai means sacrifice.” “…Be it education, medical care, providing clean drinking water, relief work, Baba has showed us the righteous path. This is the concept embedded in our cultural ethos of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ (the world is one family),” he said adding Baba’s life should be an inspiration to one and all.The world has gone through unprecedented changes during the past two years and the Covid-19 pandemic has exposed and highlighted deep-rooted vulnerabilities and has increased the inequalities in society, the CJI said.“In such times, selfless service is the need of the hour. I feel so encouraged by the fact that this idea of service is still strong in the hearts and minds of the people, including students of this institution, to provide relief to those in need,” he added.

The JPC's report allows a period of two years for private companies to migrate to the new data protection regime but governments and government agencies have no such stipulation," Ramesh says.Explaining the rationale for the amendment, Jairam said any exception created in the law for the conditions under which the state can collect personal data without a citizen’s consent should be narrowly tailored.Congress MP from Anandpur Saheb Manish Tewari rejected the entire bill in his dissent note citing design flaws.“A bill that seeks to provide blanket exemptions either in perpetuity or even for a limited period to the state and its instrumentalities, in my estimation is ultra vires of the Fundamental Right to Privacy as laid down by a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court in the Puttuswamy judgment. I do not think that this bill in its present form, especially most of its exception and exemption clauses, including various carve-outs for governments both Centre and state that exempt these behemoths from the ambit of this legislation, would, therefore, stand the test of ‘vires’ in a Constitutional court of law as and when it would be so tested. I, therefore, am constrained to holistically reject the bill in its present form in entirety for this design flaw,” Tewari said.TMC MPs Derek O Brien and Mahua Moitra in a joint note said they expressed their dissent to the final report not only because of the Orwellian nature of the provisions contained in the bill but also the improper functioning of the committee itself.“We strongly oppose the bill for lack of adequate safeguards to protect the right to privacy of data principals. We oppose the recommendations of the committee for the inclusion of non-personal data within their legislation. The bill provides overboard exemptions to the government without proper safeguards in place. We had moved amendments to Clause 35 of the bill which gives power to the Centre to exempt any of its agencies from the application of the Act,” Derek and Moitra said.The much awaited parliamentary panel report on the PDP Bill, 2019, was delayed after former chairperson Meenakshi Lekhi was inducted into the Union council of ministers, necessitating reconstitution of the panel.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parliamentary-panel-adopts-data-protection-report-jairam-manish-derek-among-7-opposition-mps-who-dissent-341490
23-11-2021||Lucknow||Besides withdrawal of farm laws, many farmers’ issues need to be resolved: Rakesh Tikait||BKU leader Rakesh Tikait on Monday said that besides the repealing of the three agri laws, there are many issues of farmers that need to be resolved as a large number of them gathered here for a 'Kisan Mahapanchayat' to press their demands for a legal guarantee for MSP, among other things."It seems that after announcing repealing of the three farm laws, the government does not want to speak to the farmers. The government should make it clear that it has repealed the laws in the true sense and talk to us so that we can start moving to our villages," Tikait told PTI at the Eco Garden here, the venue for the 'mahapanchayat'.The 'mahapanchayat' has been called by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of the agitating farmer unions. It was planned months before Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday announced repealing the contentious agri laws. The SKM, at a meeting in Delhi on Sunday, decided to stick to the date.The SKM has put forth six demands before the government. Besides the legal guarantee for minimum support price, the farmers are demanding the removal of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra, whose son is an accused in the Lakhimpur Kheri violence, withdrawal of cases against farmers, building a memorial to the protesters who lost their lives during the agitation and withdrawal of the Electricity Amendment Bill.The issues of MSP, seeds, dairy and pollution needed to be resolved, Tikait said.More than 750 farmers, mostly from Punjab, died during the protest against the agri laws, he claimed.SKM leader from Uttarakhand Gurpreet Sukia said farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand had come to participate in the 'Kisan Mahapanchayat'.Shekhar Dixit, president of Rashtriya Kisan Manch, said, "The PM made the announcement about repealing of farm laws with an eye on the upcoming assembly elections in UP and other states, where the BJP is seeing power slipping away from its hands."      Despite the prime minister's surprise announcement, farmer leaders have maintained that the protesters won't budge until the three contentious laws are formally repealed in Parliament.Hundreds of protesting farmers have been camping at Delhi's Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur borders since November 2020.
