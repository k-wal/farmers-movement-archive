29-11-2021||Mumbai||HC refuses to quash order evicting singer Shweta Shetty from father’s house||Taking serious note of the harassment faced by senior citizens at the hands of their own children, the Bombay High Court refused to quash a tribunal’s order evicting singer Shweta Shetty from the south Mumbai residence of her 95-year-old father for ill-treating him.A Division Bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Madhav Jamdar, on November 25, said till the father is alive, the singer has no right to claim share in his property.“Shweta demands her share. What is her ‘share’ while he is alive? She has none. He (father) may indeed give his flat and all wealth away inter vivos. That is his choice. She cannot prevent him from doing so. So long as he is alive, Shweta has no ‘share’ in his property,” the order, which was made available on Monday, said.The court, in its order, noted that in its experience in Mumbai and particularly amongst the wealthy of this city, senior citizens and elderly parents were subjected to all kinds of harassment and deprivation in their twilight years.“In case after case, we have complaints from senior citizens that their own sons and daughters are harassing them. In every case, the harassment is an attempt to somehow grab the senior citizen’s property in his or her lifetime without a thought spared to the mental or physical health, well-being or happiness of these seniors,” the court said.The present case was no different and the petitioner’s father has repeatedly said he did not want his daughter Shweta in his house, the order further said.The court passed the order on a petition filed by Shweta Shetty challenging a November 2020 order of the Welfare Tribunal and Deputy Collector of Mumbai evicting her from her father Mahalaba Shetty’s south Mumbai flat.The eviction order was passed on a complaint filed by Shetty’s 95-year-old father claiming he does not want his daughter Shweta Shetty to remain, occupy or reside in his south Mumbai flat as she was allegedly harassing and ill-treating him.It claimed Shweta Shetty had been living with her father since 2015 and was badgering him for her share of the property.Shweta Shetty’s counsel, Pradeep Thorat, had argued the tribunal does not have the powers to issue eviction orders and can only entertain maintenance applications.Mahalaba Shetty’s advocate, Sujay Kantawala, had argued the property in question was self-acquired and, hence, the owner can deal with or dispose it of in any way he or she pleases.“Even if this person has a child, he or she has no legal right to interfere with this right of the owner,” Kantawala had said.The Bench refused to interfere with the tribunal’s order and directed Shweta Shetty to remove her personal belongings from the said flat on November 27 and prohibited her from entering the flat in future. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-refuses-to-quash-order-evicting-singer-shweta-shetty-from-fathers-house-344287

He followed all the protocols and rules during his visit. I apprised him about the history and importance of the Ashram and also showed him the Hriday Kunj, Gandhiji’s room inside the Ashram,” he said.Khan, who was visiting the Ashram for the first time, was accompanied by movie director Mahesh Manjrekar.When Khan could not produce a cotton thread properly on the charkha despite his keen interest in learning the technique, he told his instructor Pratimaben that he will come back again, without informing anyone, just to learn this technique, another instructor told reporters.In his message in the visitors’ book, Khan paid tribute to the Father of the Nation, saying he felt privileged to visit this place and hopes to “visit the Ashram again to learn more” in the future. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/entertainment/salman-khan-visits-sabarmati-ashram-tries-his-hands-on-charkha-344280
29-11-2021||New Delhi||Govt launches ‘unique’ face recognition tech for pensioners||Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh on Monday launched a “unique” face recognition technology that would act as a proof of ‘life certificate’ for pensioners and ensure ease of living for the retired and elderly citizens.All pensioners are mandated to submit their life certificate annually to continue receiving pension. The Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions has already implemented a facility of giving the certificate digitally.“The central government has been sensitive to the needs of pensioners and to ensure ease of living for them. Soon after coming to power in 2014, the government decided to introduce and implement digital life certificate for the pensioners. This unique face recognition technology will further help pensioners,” Singh said.He said this face recognition technique of giving life certificate is a historic and far reaching reform since it will touch the lives of not only 68 lakh central government pensioners but also those under the EPFO and state governments, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions.Singh thanked the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology as well as UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India) for devising this technology and making such an initiative of the Department of Pension and Pensioners’ Welfare (DoPPW) possible.The minister said the government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always sought “ease of living” for all sections of society, including the retirees and pensioners who are the nation’s assets with all their experience and long years of service rendered by them.He also reiterated that during the coronavirus pandemic too, the Department of Pension brought about several reforms for release of provisional pension/family pension.                        The minister said the Department of Pension has been extensively using technology to achieve this end, be it introduction of digital life certificate, introduction of an intelligent common software “Bhavishya” for all Government of India ministries for processing pension cases.Singh said the effort in issuing electronic PPOs and pushing the same in Digi locker is a huge step towards ease of living and transparency.He said the department has also been bringing out e-booklets for pensioner awareness and carrying out an awareness campaign on Twitter, Facebook, Youtube, and other social media platforms. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-launches-unique-face-recognition-tech-for-pensioners-344272

I am sorry some people are offended but i was happy to be roped in to this show of workplace camaraderie. That's all this is."The whole selfie thing was done (at the women MPs' initiative) in great good humour & it was they who asked me to tweet it in the same spirit. I am sorry some people are offended but i was happy to be roped in to this show of workplace camaraderie. That's all this is. https://t.co/MfpcilPmSB  Akancha Srivastava, the founder of Akancha Srivastava Foundation, a non-profit organisation that works towards imparting cyber safety knowledge, said there is a need to stop treating women as “objects” and it is high-time that this mentality goes away.“We never look at men parliamentarians and say what a handsome gathering, then why do any woman achievers have to be called women and then objectified in this manner. We need to reach gender neutrality, not equality, but neutrality,” she told PTI.“His comments could have been better worded. He has such good vocabulary, he should have put it to better use,” Srivastava added.Chhavi Methi, an activist with the the Bharatiya Samajik Jagritik Sanghatan, said the mentality that women can be just attractive or beautiful needs to change.“There is so much more to them and people need to acknowledge that and give them the respect that they deserve,” she told PTI.Reacting sharply, National Commission for Women Chairperson Rekha Sharma tweeted, “You are demeaning their contribution in parliament and politics by making them an object of attraction. Stop objectifying women in Parliament.”Karuna Nundy, a Supreme Court lawyer, said, “Incredible that someone as exposed to equality discourse as @ShashiTharoor would attempt to reduce elected political leaders to their looks, and centre himself in the comment to boot. This is 2021, folks.”Tharoor on Monday posted a selfie with the women MPs on Twitter with a caption that triggered a controversy and many netizens accused him of sexism and objectification.He later apologised for offending “some people” and said the “whole selfie thing” was done at the women MPs’ initiative in “great good humour and it was they who asked me to tweet it in the same spirit”.“Who says the Lok Sabha isn’t an attractive place to work? With six of my fellow MPs this morning,” he said and posted a picture of himself with Supriya Sule, Preneet Kaur, Thamizhachi Thangapandian, Mimi Chakraborty, Nusrat Jahan Ruhi and Jyothimani.

The relatives of the slain family members had alleged that a lingering land dispute between the victims and their neighbour, belonging to an upper caste, was behind the multiple murder.Reacting sharply over the double murder of the Dalit couple, BSP president Mayawati asked the state government to immediately check the recurrence of such incidents and take stern action against the guilty.“It’s an extremely shocking, painful and condemnable incident of the murder of a Dalit couple by the slashing of their throats in Azamgarh district within days after the Prayagraj killings. The government must immediately stop such atrocities on Dalits and take strict action against the culprits,” the BSP president said in tweet. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/govt-official-wife-found-murdered-with-their-throats-slit-open-in-azamgarh-village-police-344266

We have asked him to share her mobile phone number and her local contact,” Jabalpur Chief Medical and Health Officer Dr Ratnesh Kurariya told PTI.Efforts were on to trace the woman, named Khuno Oremeet Selyn as per the record, according to the Union Government’s health surveillance guidelines (to check the spread of COVID-19), he said.“The woman came to Jabalpur from Delhi, as per the record shared with us by the Central Government,” he said.The location of her mobile number mentioned in Jabalpur’s Dumna airport record was traced to Delhi. The police investigation suggests that the phone has not been moved out of Delhi since last one month, the official said. “The CCTV footage of the Jabalpur airport is being examined to find the woman,” he said.Information was also being gathered from hotels in Jabalpur and neighbouring districts, he said.Botswana is a landlocked country in southern Africa, where Omicron has been detected.The WHO last week described Omicron as a “variant of concern” and its detection has caused fear around the globe that it could resist vaccines and prolong the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the surveillance process, the Union government was regularly providing the list of visitors coming to Jabalpur from abroad, Dr Kurariya said.Last month, 164 people from the United Kingdom visited Jabalpur and they were contacted and asked about their health, he said.Jabalpur reported the first coronavirus case in the state on March 30 last year, when three people who returned from Dubai and Germany tested positive for the infection.

The DGCA has sought comments from stakeholders on the draft provisions by December 23.Certification of defence aerodromes for civilian operations is in line with international civil aviation requirements that were drafted and ratified by participating nations. All aerodromes operating scheduled civilian flights, whether owned by civilian or military agencies, need to be certified for operational and safety aspects.The move to certify defence aerodromes for civilian operations was initiated a few years ago, but certain technical and operational issues needed to be sorted out between the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Civil Aviation. The DGCA has also, from time to time, defined procedures and issued advisories to civilian aircraft operators on flying to and from defence aerodromes.There are 26 defence aerodromes in India which are also being used for scheduled air transport services. These aerodromes are designed and constructed by defence authorities with the establishment of civil enclave to accommodate civil aircraft and passenger facilitation but primarily to meet their own strategic requirements.“It is also a fact that the defence authorities have their own systems in place to operate these aerodromes including their own safety oversight systems. However, these systems or operating procedures at defence aerodromes are required to be in line with the DGCA requirements for licensing of these aerodromes,” the draft says.Under relevant provisions of the Aircraft Rules, 1937, a defence aerodrome shall not be used as a regular place of landing and departure by a scheduled air transport service, unless it has been certified as per the requirements specified by the DGCA. For scheduled operations at defence aerodromes, according to the draft CAR, two authorities are involved. First, the defence authorities, which shall control most part of the airside areas like runway, taxiways as well as communications, navigation and surveillance systems and associated facilities. Second is the civil authorities, which shall have control over part of the taxiways connecting the civil apron to the runway, apron management and terminal building. The responsibilities of defence and civil authorities in their respective areas shall be exclusive and absolute. An inspection of defence aerodromes shall be carried out by a team consisting of members from the DGCA and the concerned defence aerodrome authority before the issue of certificate, which would be valid for two years unless surrendered by the holder or is suspended or cancelled by the DGCA.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dgca-drafts-new-rules-for-mandatory-certification-of-defence-airfields-for-scheduled-civilian-flights-344226
29-11-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC quashes order that refused to restrain Nawab Malik from tweeting against Wankhedes||The Bombay High Court on Monday quashed and set aside the order of a single bench of the HC that had refused to restrain Maharashtra Minister Nawab Malik from making public statements against the Narcotics Control Bureau’s (NCB) zonal director Sameer Wankhede and his family.A division bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav quashed and set aside the order after Malik and Wankhede’s father Dnyandev consented that the single bench order be recalled and Dnyandev’s grievances against the Minister, raised through an interim application on his defamation suit filed against Malik, be heard afresh by the HC.On November 22, a single bench of Justice Madhav Jamdar held that though Malik’s tweets against Wankhede, particularly those pertaining to allegations of the NCB officer having submitted a false caste certificate to secure the Central Government job and having accepted illegal gratification while on duty, had stemmed out of malice, the Minister couldn’t be completely prohibited from making comments against a public officer.Dnyandev then challenged the singe bench order.While hearing the appeal last week, a division bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav held that Malik’s statements and tweets against Wankhede did seem to be a clear case of malice and logically, he should be restrained from making such comments.The bench had also asked if it behoved the Minister to make such comments without due verification and why he hadn’t first approached the caste scrutiny committee with a formal complaint against Wankhede.Malik then proposed that the single bench order be recalled.His counsel Karl Tamboly told the HC that Malik will consent to quashing of the order, he will file a detailed reply to Dnyandev’s interim application, and he will not make public statements or tweets against the Wankhedes until further hearing. He sought that Dnyandev’s application be heard afresh by the single bench.On Monday, senior counsel Birendra Saraf, who appeared for Dnyandev, told the division bench that his client had consented to the quashing of the November 22 order.“The court can say by consent of parties (quashing of the order),” Saraf said.The division bench permitted Malik to file a fresh reply affidavit to Dnyandev’s interim application that seeks, among other things, that until his suit is heard finally, the minister be restrained from making defamatory statements against him and his family.Malik will submit his reply by December 9. Dnyandev will then file his rejoinder responding to Malik’s affidavit by January 3.The single bench of Justice Madhav Jamdar will then hear the interim application afresh and complete the hearing within 13 weeks, the division bench said.Until the hearing on the interim application is complete, Malik will not make any public statements or tweets against the Wankhedes, the division bench said.“The statement by respondent (Malik on not tweeting or making public statements against the Wankhedes) shall continue pending disposal of final order on the interim application,” the bench led by Justice Kathawalla said.Malik has levelled a string of allegations against Sameer Wankhede after he led a drug bust raid on a cruise ship last month following which actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan and some other people were arrested.The minister had alleged that Wakhede was born a Muslim, but falsely claimed to belong to a designated scheduled caste to secure his central government job.Wankhede has denied the allegations.

They are directed to comply forthwith and file replies before Wednesday evening….States must implement all measures in 48 hours."The top court also asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to respond to the issue of dust pollution caused by ongoing construction of Central Vista, raised by senior advocate Vikas Singh on behalf of petitioner Aditya Dubey.“Central Vista cannot be more important than the rising levels of air pollution. I can play videos, how dust is coming up from Central Vista. It cannot be more important than Supreme Court orders,” Vikas Singh said even as Mehta said, “This is just trumpet-blowing.”Earlier, when the Solicitor General said the AQI was 405 today, the CJI corrected him and said it was 419.The Bench - which also included Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Surya Kant – expressed serious concern over increasing air pollution. "The Centre says it is taking steps, but the pollution levels are increasing. And there is a looming danger of coronavirus. What to do?" it wondered.“We can deal with the virus separately,” Mehta responded.After issuing directions and advisories, the authorities hoped that all would be good, but on the ground the result was zero, it noted. "All intentions are good and directions are given but the implementation is zero. We need strict compliance of the measures already directed to be taken,” it said.As air quality continued to be very poor or hazardous, the Supreme Court had on November 24 re-imposed the ban on construction activities in Delhi-NCR and ordered states to provide subsistence money to workers from the funds collected as labour cess during the ban period.On Monday, senior counsel AM Singhvi told the Bench on behalf of the Delhi government that there was 90 per cent compliance by it. “We have disbursed Rs 147 crore for construction workers like Rs 5,000 for three lakh workers...5,000 CNG buses have been provided to the workers to travel to central Delhi,” Singhvi submitted.During the last hearing, the court had said, "We take measures when the condition becomes severe... These measures have to be taken in anticipation...based on a scientific statistical model.” It had asked the commission to undertake a study which "must factor in seasonal variations and other relevant parameters".||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/implement-directions-to-curb-air-pollution-supreme-court-tells-delhi-punjab-haryana-and-up-344224

29-11-2021||New York||Merriam-Webster chooses vaccine as the 2021 word of the year||With an expanded definition to reflect the times, Merriam-Webster has declared an omnipresent truth as its 2021 word of the year: vaccine.“This was a word that was extremely high in our data every single day in 2021,” Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster’s editor-at-large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday’s announcement.“It really represents two different stories. One is the science story, which is this remarkable speed with which the vaccines were developed. But there’s also the debates regarding policy, politics and political affiliation. It’s one word that carries these two huge stories,” he said.The selection follows “vax” as word of the year from the folks who publish the Oxford English Dictionary. And it comes after Merriam-Webster chose “pandemic” as tops in lookups last year on its online site.“The pandemic was the gun going off and now we have the aftereffects,” Sokolowski said.At Merriam-Webster, lookups for “vaccine” increased 601 per cent over 2020, when the first U.S. shot was administered in New York in December after quick development, and months of speculation and discussion over efficacy. The world’s first jab occurred earlier that month in the UK.Compared to 2019, when there was little urgency or chatter about vaccines, Merriam-Webster logged an increase of 1,048 per cent in lookups this year. Debates over inequitable distribution, vaccine mandates and boosters kept interest high, Sokolowski said. So did vaccine hesitancy and friction over vaccine passports.The word “vaccine” wasn’t birthed in a day, or due to a single pandemic. The first known use stretches back to 1882 but references pop up earlier related to fluid from cowpox pustules used in inoculations, Sokolowski said.It was borrowed from the New Latin “vaccina,” which goes back to Latin’s feminine “vaccinus,” meaning “of or from a cow.” The Latin for cow is “vacca,” a word that might be akin to the Sanskrit “vasa,” according to Merriam-Webster.Inoculation, on the other hand, dates to 1714, in one sense referring to the act of injecting an “inoculum.”          Earlier this year, Merriam-Webster added to its online entry for “vaccine” to cover all the talk of mRNA vaccines, or messenger vaccines such as those for COVID-19 developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.While other dictionary companies choose words of the year by committee, Merriam-Webster bases its selection on lookup data, paying close attention to spikes and, more recently, year-over-year increases in searches after weeding out evergreens. The company has been declaring a word of the year since 2008. Among its runners-up in the word biography of 2021:                 INSURRECTION: Interest was driven by the deadly Jan. 6 siege on the U.S. Capitol. Arrests continue, as do congressional hearings over the attack by supporters of President Donald Trump. Some of Trump’s allies have resisted subpoenas, including Steve Bannon.Searches for the word increased by 61,000% over 2020, Sokolowksi said.INFRASTRUCTURE: President Joe Biden was able to deliver what Trump often spoke of but never achieved: A bipartisan infrastructure bill signed into law. When Biden proposed help with broadband access, eldercare and preschool, conversation changed from not only roads and bridges but “figurative infrastructure,” Sokolowski said.“Many people asked, what is infrastructure if it’s not made out of steel or concrete? Infrastructure, in Latin, means underneath the structure,” he said.PERSEVERANCE: It’s the name of NASA’s latest Mars rover. It landed Feb. 18, 2021. “Perseverance is the most sophisticated rover NASA has ever sent to the Red Planet, with a name that embodies NASA’s passion, and our nation’s capability, to take on and overcome challenges,” the space agency said.The name was thought up by Alexander Mather, a 14-year-old seventh-grader at Lake Braddock Secondary School in Burke, Virginia. He participated in an essay contest organized by NASA. He was one of 28,000 K-12 students to submit entries.NOMAD: The word had its moment with the 2020 release of the film “Nomadland.” It went on to win three Oscars in April 2021, including best picture, director (Chloé Zhao) and actress (Frances McDormand). Zhao became the first woman of color to win best director.The AP’s film writer Jake Coyle called the indie success “a plain-spoken meditation on solitude, grief and grit. He wrote that it “struck a chord in a pandemic-ravaged year. It made for an unlikely Oscar champ: A film about people who gravitate to the margins took center stage.”                 Other words in Merriam-Webster’s Top 10: Cicada (we had an invasion), guardian (the Cleveland Indians became the Cleveland Guardians), meta (the lofty new name of Facebook’s parent company), cisgender (a gender identity that corresponds to one’s sex assigned at birth), woke (charged with politics and political correctness) and murraya (a tropical tree and the word that won the 2021 Scripps National Spelling Bee for 14-year-old Zaila Avant-garde). — AP||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/world/merriam-webster-chooses-vaccine-as-the-2021-word-of-the-year-344210

TNSFlyers from ‘at risk’ nations to be testedThe government also issued fresh guidelines stating passengers from “at risk” countries would have to subject themselves to post arrival testing and additional protocols.In a letter to chief secretaries and principal secretaries of states/UTs, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said it was essential that the disease surveillance network was geared up for rigorous follow-up of travellers from all countries, mainly the ones designated “at risk”. The ministry asked the states to strictly ensure testing of foreigners from such nations upon arrival and send all positive samples for genome sequencing.With the majority of states, including Punjab, falling behind in daily testing, the government has reminded them to step up efforts. “Ample testing infrastructure needs to be operationalised to tackle any surge due to the mutated virus. It has been observed that the overall testing and the proportion of the RT-PCR tests have declined in some states,” said Bhushan after he wrote to 13 states, including Punjab, over drastic fall in test rates.Punjab reported 24,300 average daily tests in the week ending November 22, a three-fold reduction from 71,257 average daily tests in the week between May 17 and 23. The Centre asked the states to monitor hotspots closely, ensure infrastructure upgrade, prompt dispatch of samples for genome studies and regular stress on physical measures. The ministry has mentioned the UK, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel “at risk” countries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/states-told-to-upscale-testing-mha-to-review-overseas-travel-343920

Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge sought a discussion on Covid preparations, aid for kin of Covid victims, debate on Chinese aggression, inflation, unemployment and Pegasus. NDA constituent NPP demanded repeal of CAA. Kharge said the government had agreed to repeal the farm laws only after election setbacks and it “may re-enact these in some form or the other”. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not present. The meeting was chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who said the Opposition flagged important issues and discussions were “very healthy”.Bills to repeal the three farm laws, ban private cryptocurrencies and extend the tenure of CBI and ED chiefs will top the government’s legislative agenda. The session will have 19 sittings over 25 days. It will conclude on December 23.In line with PM Modi’s decision, the government will take up the Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, in the Lok Sabha on the very first day on Monday. The Bill may also be brought in the Rajya Sabha as a supplementary agenda.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said the government was ready to discuss anything “under the rules”. “We have sought Opposition’s support for smooth functioning of Parliament,” Joshi said. There was consensus among Opposition leaders on priority to repeal of farm laws and enactment of a law on MSP. The TMC raised the issue of extended BSF jurisdiction in border states and need for greater scrutiny of government Bills.AAP leaders walked out of the meeting with RS MP Sanjay Singh saying the government did not allow him to raise the issue of MSP law and compensation for families of deceased farmers.The session will see three Bills replacing the Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021; Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021; and the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021.Other major Bills listed for the session include the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2021; Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019; Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens (Amendment) Bill, 2019; and Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Bill, 2020.

Bench A Bench led by Justice LN Rao lamented that even after 75 years of Independence caste-motivated violence and honour killings were taking place in India, impeding the constitutional objective of equality.“These episodes of caste-motivated violence in the country demonstrate the fact that casteism has not been annihilated even after 75 years of Independence. According to Dr BR Ambedkar, inter-caste marriage is one remedy to get rid of casteism in order to achieve equality. His vision for ensuring justice and equality to all sections of the society, especially to the repressed segments, is well enshrined in the preamble of the Constitution. The bigotry perpetuated by such caste-based practices which are prevalent even today, impedes this objective of the Constitution of equality for all its citizens,” the Bench said.Noting that a marriage proposal by Roshni belonging to Jat community, with Vijendra — a Jatav — resulted in their deaths, the top court said, “Though the number is a tad less, honour killings have not stopped in this country and it is high time that the civil society reacts and responds with strong disapproval about the ghastly crimes committed in the name of caste.”Recalling the directions to the administrative authorities and police officials to take strong measures to prevent honour killings and the Law Commission’s report on the issue, the Bench emphasised that harsh punishment was recommended to those “brutal and feudal minded persons” who commit atrocities in the name of caste.Twenty witnesses were examined by the prosecution and four witnesses were produced by the defence. When the trial resumed in 1998, 12 out of the 20 prosecution witnesses turned hostile. The trial was stayed for six years between 1992 and 1998 due to orders passed by the Allahabad High Court.“Even if the witnesses have turned hostile, their evidence can be accepted, if they are natural and independent witnesses and have no reason to falsely implicate the accused,” it said, adding, as a protector of its citizens, the State has to ensure that during a trial a witness can safely depose the truth, without any fear of being haunted by those against whom he or she has deposed.“This unfortunate situation prevails because of the reason that the State has not undertaken any protective measures to ensure the safety of these witnesses, commonly known as ‘witness protection’,” the Bench said, referring to an earlier judgment of the top court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-rues-caste-motivated-violence-343922

He said there was a need to increase the number of successful coop models (like Amul) and bring these under one umbrella. He also suggested Amul to work out a similar model for organic farming so as to encourage more farmers to adopt the practice, as fertilisers were causing soil degradation and diseases like cancer.Shah said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recognised cooperative as the best economic model for the country while he was the Gujarat Chief Minister.“It is a difficult job to take development to all and make everyone participate in the process of development in a country with a population of 130 crore,” Shah said. Many pundits had failed to figure out which economic model would fit the requirements of this country, he said.He believes the field of cooperation had the capacity to make everyone prosper, the Home Minister said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cooperative-model-best-for-india-shah-343926

I only want to be in service. For me, this post, this prime ministership, all these things are not at all for power, they are for service,” he said when an Ayushman Bharat beneficiary wished him to remain in power.Modi spoke with two persons, who got their treatment with the help of the Ayushman Bharat scheme, which, they said changed their life for the better.Reminding the people of the forthcoming birth anniversary of BR Ambedkar, the Prime Minister urged the people to abide by their duties and responsibilities. “This will be the best way to pay tribute to Ambedkar,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mann-ki-baat-india-leading-the-world-in-start-ups-pm-343927

The team members will meet officials, journalists and members of the civil society.The party won a mindboggling 329 out of 334 seats spread over 13 urban local bodies, including the Agartala Municipal Corporation.For the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC), the first poll fought by it outside Bengal at a time when the party is making efforts to expand its base, the Tripura results came as a shock. The TMC could win only one seat.The CPM-led Left Front, the main Opposition party, won three seats. The remaining one seat was won by the TIPRA led by Tripura royal family scion Pradyot Deb Barma.Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb thanked and congratulated the voters for reposing their faith in the BJP. “People of Tripura were being trampled upon. The voters have responded to these insults,” he told the media in Agartala today.The BJP won all 51 seats in the Agartala Municipal Corporation. TMC candidates were the runners-up in 26 seats. The CPM, which had the majority in the outgoing MC, came second in the remaining 25 seats.Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee, who is the TMC in-charge in Tripura, claimed the party emerged as the principal Opposition party following the civic poll results.“It is exceptional for a party beginning with negligible presence to successfully contest municipal elections and emerge as the principal Opposition in the state with more than 20 per cent vote share,” Abhishek said in a tweet.How the TMC general secretary arrived at the figure of 20 per cent vote share was not immediately clear.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-sweeps-tripura-civic-body-elections-wins-329-of-334-seats-343928

But such comments should be viewed in the context of the functioning of legislatures marked by persistent disruptions, unruly behaviour and violent actions, which have deleterious effects.”Naidu is quoted to have said, “The best way to counter them is to ensure proper functioning of the legislatures by ensuring their dignity and decorum since such comments find resonance with the public from what they see about the functioning of the legislatures.”Around 40 leaders of various parties and ministers attended the meeting, the sources said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rs-leaders-concerned-over-sc-remarks-343929

This precipitated a warning from then US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, on “discriminatory behaviour” by India against American companies.The USTR memo, likely prepared ahead of a meeting between USTR Katherine Tai and Visa executives, said the company remained concerned about India’s policies that appear to “favour the business of National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI, which runs RuPay) over other domestic and foreign electronic payments companies”.In this respect, it referred to PM Narendra Modi’s 2018 speech asking Indians to use RuPay as a patriotic duty. “Everyone cannot go to the border to protect the country. We can use the RuPay card to serve the nation.”Visa’s grouse is a replay of Mastercard’s complaint to the US government in 2018 that PM Modi was using nationalism to promote RuPay. This precipitated a warning from then US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, on “discriminatory behaviour” by India against American companies.The RuPay payment system was established by the RBI in 2005. Today, it accounts for 63 per cent of transactions.Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has also called on banks to promote Rupay cards. Visa Inc also flagged this aspect to the USTR by referring to “not so subtle pressure on banks to issue” RuPay cards, said the report.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/visa-inc-too-complains-about-india-backing-local-rival-rupay-343930

The case was supervised by Araria women’s police station in-charge Rita Kumari.Talking to reporters, POSCO Public Prosecutor Shyamlal Yadav said, “The case in Araria was the speediest trial of a rape case in the country. It beat the record of a court in Madhya Pradesh’s Datia district that wrapped up in three days a rape trial in August 2018.”The court fast-tracked the proceedings by recording witnesses, arguments, and counter-arguments; convicting the accused, and issuing the judgement in just one day.Reacting to the verdict, the Directorate of Prosecution of Bihar government’s Home Department issued a statement saying, “This is perhaps the first case in which punishment has been given in a single day of trial in the country.”“Before it, in Datia (MP) district, a court had delivered a verdict after three days of trial on 8 August 2018. Bihar has now made a national record by conducting a trial in a single day by giving a life sentence to the convict till his last breath,” it added.

He will not perform any public show today," a senior police officer told PTI on condition of anonymity.Faruqui also shared a statement on social media confirming that his Bengaluru show that had sold "600 plus" tickets was cancelled Sunday in the wake of the "threats to venue vandalism" and said he was "done"."My name is Munawar Faruqui. And that's been my time, you guys were (a) wonderful audience. Good bye, I'm done," he said.The proceeds from the show were supposed to be donated to late Kannada star Puneeth Rajkumar's charitable organisation.In the same statement, the 29-year-comic said they initially did not want to reveal that the show was for charity."Putting me in jail for the joke I never did to cancelling my shows which has nothing problematic in it. This is unfair. This show has gained so much love from people in India irrespective of their religion. This is unfair (sic)" he added in his Twitter statement.Here's Munawar's social media post:A post shared by Munawar Faruqui (@munawar.faruqui)  Nafrat jeet hai, Artist haar gaya. Im done! Goodbye! INJUSTICE pic.twitter.com/la4xmaeQ0CFaruqui claimed that his 12 shows were called off in the last two months because of the threats to the venue and audiences.The comedian also claimed they have a "censor certificate of the show", which proves there was "nothing problematic" in the stand-up act.Faruqui, however, found support in actors Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub and Swara Bhasker.Ayyub urged the comic to not lose hope."And WE Failed once again as a society…. looking forward to see you back on stage.." he tweeted.And WE Failed once again as a society….but @munawar0018 brother, don’t loose hope…looking forward to see you back on stage..🤗🤗 https://t.co/qKAaO4OOLuBhasker described the turn of events as "heartbreaking and shameful" and apologised to Faruqui."A project of hate & bigotry will always hate an articulate, rational, educated, charming, talented & funny ‘Other' who connects beyond identity with a heterogeneous public.. make no mistake Munawwar, Umar Khalid & other such articulate Muslims are a huge threat to Hindutva," she wrote on the microblogging site."Also.. it's heartbreaking & shameful how we as a society have allowed bullying and gaslighting to become normalised.

I’m sorry Munawwar! 💔 https://t.co/lC3fcMHusEAccording to reports, Faruqui had planned a performance 'Dongri To Nowhere' on Sunday evening. The show was organised in Bengaluru by Vishal Dhuria and Siddharth Das of New Delhi-based Curtain Calls Event.However, various right wing organisations including Sriram Sena and Hindu Janajagruti Samiti, had lodged a complaint with the Bengaluru city police commissioner against the comedian charging him of hurting the religious sentiments of Hindus by allegedly insulting Hindu Gods.The inspector of the Ashokanagar police station in the city under whose jurisdiction the Good Shepherd Auditorium falls wrote a letter to the organisers on Saturday to call off the event as the comedian is a controversial figure."It is learnt that Munawar Faruqui is a controversial figure..... Many states have banned his comedy shows. It is learnt that a case has been registered against him in the Tukoji police station in Indore of Madhya Pradesh," the inspector said in his letter.He also stated that many organisations are opposing his show, which may cause chaos, disturb peace and harmony and create a law and order problem."Therefore, it is suggested that you should cancel Faruqui's stand-up comedy show," the letter said.Earlier this year, Faruqui was arrested by the Indore Police in a case for allegedly hurting religious sentiments and was in jail for almost a month. The comic, who has alleged heavy trolling against him on social media in the past, was released from the Indore central jail on February 7 after the Supreme Court granted him bail in the case.Faruqui and four others were arrested on January 1 following a complaint by a BJP MLA's son that objectionable remarks about Hindu deities and Union Home Minister Amit Shah were passed during a comedy show at a cafe in Indore on New Year's day.The Apex court also stayed the production warrant issued against Faruqui by a court in Prayagraj in connection with an FIR lodged there.

It is a tradition of Parliament and the Congress goes by tradition.It is our duty to call the opposition parties to discuss the issues before Parliament, but if someone feels that by joining hands with us they would be seen as opposing the government, they need not do so. Those who do not want to fight the government, they may not come,” Adhir said.With the TMC deciding to stay away from opposition meet tomorrow the winter session is starting on a dissonant note for the unity of non-BJP parties.The TMC has of late poached several top Congress leaders, including former Goa CM Luizinho Faleiro, former Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev, former Haryana Congress chief Ashok Tanwar and former Delhi Congress leader Kirti Azad.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/those-who-dont-want-to-fight-govt-may-not-come-to-opposition-meet-congress-on-tmc-343831

Important issues were flagged by the opposition which raised the need for greater discussion in Parliament. We also want a healthy discussion in both houses,” Rajnath Singh said after the meeting with parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi assuring that the government was ready to discuss any issue within rules and procedures.“We sought opposition support for smooth functioning of Parliament,” said Joshi after the monsoon session was washed out over a deadlock on the Pegasus snooping issue.Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not attend the meeting today with the opposition leaders voicing disappointment at the PM’s absence.The government however clarified that the PM had prior engagements which kept him away.At the meeting attended by 30 parties, leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge demanded discussion on Covid preparations, Rs 4 lakh compensation for each family that has lost a ward to Covid, debate on Chinese aggression, inflation and fuel prices rise, unemployment, Women’s reservation bill and Pegasus snooping.There was consensus among opposition leaders on priority repeal of farm laws and legal MSP apart from a discussion on inflation, joblessness, Covid management, Pegasus, with the TMC also flagging the issue or extended BSF jurisdiction in border states and the need for greater scrutiny of government bills.“The government listened to us and said the business advisory committee of the two houses will prioritise the agenda. We had expected the PM to be present but he did not come. The opposition raised 15 to 20 demands, with farm law repeal and legal MSP our joint priority,” Kharge said.The Aam Aadmi Party walked out of the meeting with Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh saying the government did not allow him to speak.“I wanted to raise the issue of MSP law and compensation for families of 700 farmers who have died but I was not allowed to speak,” Singh said.Thirty parties present in the meeting besides the BJP were INC, DMK, AITC, YSRCP, JD(U), BJD, BSP, TRS, SS, LJSP, NCP, SP, CPI(M), IUML, TDP, Apna Dal, CPI, NPF, SAD, AAP, AIADMK, KC(M), MNF, RSP, RPI(A), RJD, NPP, MDMK, JKNC, TMC( M).The day saw a series of meetings of NDA floor leaders followed by a meeting of house leaders called by Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu and another called by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla.The government has for its part listed 36 bills for the session.These include bills replacing the following three ordinances promulgated during inter-session period — the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021, The Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021, and The Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021.

29-11-2021||New Delhi||Tomato prices may stay high for another 2 months: Crisil||Prices of staple vegetable tomato are likely to stay elevated for two more months, CRISIL said.Tomatoes account for 10 per cent of the total vegetable production in India.“With standing crops damaged by excess rains in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, which are key suppliers of tomato during October-December, supply is down materially,” the rating agency said.Ground surveys indicate that the situation is so grim in Karnataka that tomatoes are being sent from Maharashtra’s Nashik, it added.“Not surprisingly, prices of tomatoes have increased 142 per cent on-year as on November 25 and are expected to remain elevated for the next 45-50 days till the harvest from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan reach markets across the country beginning January.” In addition, prices of onion are expected to decline in the next 10-15 days when newly harvested produce reaches markets in northern India, it added.“Transplanting was delayed in the key growing regions of Maharashtra because of deficit rains in August. That delayed arrivals in October, leading to a 65 per cent increase in onion prices compared with September,” the agency said.On the contrary, potato prices are likely to rise in the next couple of months as heavy rains may affect sowing and subsequently the yield, the agency said.Tomato, onion, and potato are the three major vegetables consumed in the country.

29-11-2021||New Delhi||Omicron reportedly has 30+ mutations in spike protein region, may bypass vaccines: AIIMS chief||The new Omicron variant of coronavirus has reportedly got over 30 mutations in the spike protein region giving it the potential to develop a immunoescape mechanism, and thus the efficacy of vaccines against it needs to be evaluated critically, AIIMS chief Dr Randeep Guelria has said.The presence of spike protein facilitates a virus’ entry into the host cell and is responsible for making it transmissible and causing infection.Read also:Govt to review decision on restarting international flights, SOP for incoming passengers amid Omicron concerns'Increase testing, monitor hotspots': Centre alerts states over new Covid variant“The new variant of coronavirus reportedly has got more than 30 mutations in the spike protein region and therefore has the potential of developing immunoescape mechanisms. As most vaccines (work by) forming antibodies against the spike protein, so many mutations at the spike protein region may lead to a decreased efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines,” AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guelria told PTI.In such a scenario, the efficacy of vaccines, including those in use in India, needs to be evaluated “critically”, he said.The future course of action will depend on what more data on its transmissibility, virulence and immunoescpae shows, he said.The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia INSACOG is closely tracking the new variant of COVID-19 called B.1.1.529 and its presence has not been detected yet in the country, officials have said.Dr Guleria emphasised the need to be very vigilant and having aggressive surveillance both for international travellers and in the region where there is a sudden increase in the number of cases.“Also, we must ask everyone to religiously follow Coivd-appropriate behaviour and not let their guards down. Also, it has to be ensured that people get both the doses of vaccine and those who have not yet taken the jab are encouraged to come forward to take it,” he said.The new, and potentially more contagious variant, was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from South Africa on November 24. It has since been identified in Botswana, Belgium, Hong Kong and Israel among other countries.On Friday, it was designated a ‘Variant of Concern’ by the WHO, which named it Omicron. A ‘Variant of Concern’ is the WHO’s top category of worrying Covid-19 strain.The Centre on Thursday asked all states and union territories to conduct rigorous screening and testing of all international travellers coming from or transiting through South Africa, Hong Kong and Botswana.In a letter to the additional chief secretary/principal secretary/secretary (Health) of all states and union territories, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan asked them to ensure that samples of travellers turning positive are sent to the designated genome sequencing laboratories promptly.

Of this, 16 arrests were made in Prayagraj,” it said.Those arrested in Prayagraj include Satya Prakash Singh, an assistant teacher at a primary school in the city’s Shankargarh area.When searched, he was found to have the solved question paper in his WhatsApp.Rajendra Patel — the alleged mastermind of the whole operation — and Chaturbhuj Singh, one of the key players, were also among those arrested from Prayagraj, according to the statement.     Besides them, police arrested other members of the gang, including one Sunny Singh, who was instrumental in sourcing solvers from Bihar, the statement said.Four persons were arrested from Lucknow district, and one each from Kaushambi, Ayodhya, and Ambedkarnagar district.Three persons were arrested from Shamli district. These three had procured 10 copies of the question paper for Rs 5 lakh, and had taken Rs 50,000 from 50-60 candidates each to give them access to the papers for reading and memorising.Search is on for the rest of the members of the gang, the government said.UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the culprits will be booked under the National Security Act and Gangster Act.He also ordered reconvening of the exam within a month.“A question paper was leaked. I issued an order to cancel the examination and arrest the entire racket. Instructions were also given to conduct the exam within a month, and that no candidate should be charged additional fee,” he said addressing a function in Deoria district on Sunday. He said orders were given to transport the students back to their home towns in UPSRTC buses free of cost on the basis of their admit cards.“Those who have committed this act should listen that cases will be registered against them under the Gangster Act and the National Security Act,” he said.Later in a tweet in Hindi, the CM said properties will be seized by the government of those involved in the leak.Close to 20 lakh candidates were to appear for the Uttar Pradesh Teachers Eligibility Test (UPTET) on Sunday.Additional Director General (ADG) Law and Order Prashant Kumar earlier in the day said the matter will be probed by the UP STF, and people or organisations involved in the leak will not be spared.The situation at centres was under control and announcements were made there to urge the candidates to go back to their homes, added the officer.Adityanath in a tweet said, “The state government is standing with the candidates of UPTET, and a re-exam will be held in a transparent manner within one month.”             “Those who have played with the future of our young brothers and sisters will not be spared.

Your government is committed to conduct the exams in a fair and transparent manner,” he said in another tweet.UP’s Basic Education minister Satish Dwivedi said the exam — in both shifts—was cancelled immediately after the leak came to surface and promised strict action against the culprits.Leader from the opposition parties criticised the BJP government for the paper leak and accused it of abetting corruption in the state.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said such incidents have become a norm under its rule.“Cancellation of the UPTET examination due to the leak of the question paper is like playing with the future of nearly 20 lakh aspirants. Paper leaks, cancellation of the examination is common in the BJP government,” he said in a Hindi tweet.“Corruption in education in UP is at an all-time high. The unemployed will usher in a revolution, and there will be a change in 2022,” he said.Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra too alleged that corruption in education and recruitment has become common under the BJP. BSP chief Mayawati in a tweet in Hindi criticised the BJP and also the previous SP government for such incidents and asked for a high-level probe in the matter from the current government.“The UP Government must take this incident very seriously, get a high-level probe done, ensure that the guilty are punished, and make concrete arrangement to reconduct this examination. This is the demand of the BSP,” she said.The Uttar Pradesh Basic Education Board (UPBEB) will conduct the UPTET exam again after one month. The government will bear the entire expenditure on the re-examination, said additional chief secretary Basic Education department, Deepak Kumar.The UPBEB has further notified that candidates will not have to pay any fees again for the exam.

29-11-2021||Agartala||Ruling BJP sweeps civic body elections in Tripura||The ruling BJP on Sunday swept the civic body elections in Tripura, having won all the seats of the 51-member Agartala Municipal Corporation (AMC) and clinching several other urban local bodies.The opposition TMC and CPI(M) failed to open their account in the AMC.The saffron party secured all the wards in the 15-member Khowai Municipal Council, 17-seat Belonia Municipal Council, 15-member Kumarghat Municipal Council and nine-member Sabroom Nagar Panchayat, state election commission officials said.The party made a clean sweep in the 25-ward Dharmanagar Municipal Council, 15-seat Teliamura Municipal Council and 13-member Amarpur Nagar Panchayat, they said.Sonamura Nagar Panchayat and Melaghar Nagar Panchayat became opposition less with the BJP having won all the 13 seats each. It also bagged the 11-member Jirania Nagar Panchayat.The party secured 12 seats of Ambassa Municipal Council, while the TMC and the CPI-M won one seat each and another went to an independent candidate.The BJP also won 16 seats of Kailashahar Municipal Council and the CPI(M) got one.In Panisagar Nagar Panchayat, the BJP emerged victorious in 12 seats, and the CPI (M) bagged one.The saffron party had fielded candidates for all the 334 seats of Agartala Municipal Corporation, 13 municipal bodies and six Nagar Panchayats in the state where its nominees won in 112 places uncontested. Elections to 222 seats were held on November 25.The ruling BJP is locked in a battle with the Trinamool Congress, which is foraying into the North east and elsewhere to establish itself as a national party, and with the CPI(M), which the saffron camp had dethroned from power in the state some years ago.The TMC, which alleged vote-rigging and intimidation in the elections, had demanded countermanding of the entire polls. The CPI(M) had sought fresh elections in five municipal bodies, including the AMC.Both parties had claimed that the authorities remained silent spectators as BJP supporters attacked political rivals and rigged the elections. The saffron camp, however, stoutly denied the charges.Reacting to the impressive performance by his party in the elections, BJP vice president Dilip Ghosh said in Kolkata that the results of Tripura civic polls have exposed the “hollowness” of TMC’s claims of having made inroads into the northeastern state. He said people there have faith in the saffron party.Describing TMC workers campaigning in Tripura as “hired people”, Ghosh told reporters his party shares a “strong bond” with the residents of that state.“The civic poll results are on expected lines. The TMC did not have any chance to open its account in Tripura, they only made noises. This verdict shows hired people from West Bengal cannot help a party create a base in a state, which has faith in the BJP,” Ghosh added.
