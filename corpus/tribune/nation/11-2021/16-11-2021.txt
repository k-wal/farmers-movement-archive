16-11-2021||New Delhi||2002 Gujarat Riots: Politicians, bureaucrats—they all collaborated, alleges Sibal||Alleging that VHP men were appointed as prosecutors to try cases relating to the 2002 Gujarat riots, senior counsel Kapil Sibal, representing slain Congress MP Ehsan Jafri’s widow Zakia Jafri, told the Supreme Court that there was a “stark collaboration” between politicians, bureaucrats, investigators, and others.This is the second time that Sibal has alleged that the SIT probe was a collaborative exercise. Earlier, questioning the clean chit to then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi in the 2002 Gujarat Riots by the SIT, Sibal had on November 11 said that those who ‘collaborated’—including SIT chief RK Raghavan—got ‘rehabilitated’.On Tuesday, he told a Bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar that the SIT didn’t investigate these aspects. “There was collaboration in the violence. No court, no democracy can countenance it. Otherwise, a message will go that we can do anything and nothing will happen to us,” said Sibal who will continue with his arguments on Wednesday.“The expression ‘collaboration’ is a very strong term for an SIT constituted by this court…How can you attribute motives to the SIT? It is the same SIT which filed charge sheets and people were convicted. No such grievance was made in such cases and you appreciated the work done by the SIT in those cases,” the Bench asked Sibal.”There are glaring instances of collaboration that are borne out from the records. The bureaucracy, political class, VHP, RSS and others became collaborators. There was stark collaboration,” Sibal said, adding that VHP men were appointed as prosecutors.The SIT had the knowledge of a sting operation, which was used in another riot case in which the accused were convicted, but they did not probe those people, Sibal said as he wondered if the SIT was saving those persons.Zakia had moved the top court in 2018 challenging the Gujarat High Court’s October 5, 2017, order rejecting her plea against the decision of the SIT set up by the top court. She has demanded an investigation into her husband’s killing during the riots.Ehsan Jafri was among the 68 people killed at Gulbarg Society on February 28, 2002, a day after the S-6 Coach of the Sabarmati Express was burnt at Godhra killing 59 people and triggering riots in Gujarat.On February 8, 2012, the SIT filed a closure report giving a clean chit to the then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and 63 others, including senior government officials, saying there was “no prosecutable evidence” against them.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/2002-gujarat-riots-politicians-bureaucrats%E2%80%94they-all-collaborated-alleges-sibal-338928
16-11-2021||New Delhi||Lawyers, activists welcome Collegium’s recommendation to appoint first gay judge||Better late than never. Four years after he was first considered for elevation to the Bench, the Supreme Court Collegium has finally recommended senior advocate Saurabh Kirpal—an openly gay man— for appointment as a judge of the Delhi High Court.The November 11 decision of the Collegium headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, if implemented, will create history as the country will get its first gay judge.Welcoming the Collegium’s decision, Supreme Court Bar Association President Vikas Singh said: “Someone’s sexual preference or orientation should not be used to discriminate against him or her in judicial appointments, particularly after the Supreme Court’s verdict decriminalizing homosexuality in India. The fact that the decision on Kirpal’s elevation was deferred several times indicates that conservative elements dominated the Collegium”.Supreme Court advocate and activist Prashant Bhushan said: “Someone being gay can’t be a ground to stall his or her elevation to the Bench. It should have been done much earlier”.Terming it a progressive step towards an inclusive judiciary, Bhushan, however, said: “One spring doesn’t make a summer. Much more needs to be done”.Senior advocate and former Delhi High Court Bar Association President AS Chandhiok said, “It’s a step in the right direction”. He, however, said “It should have been done much before. After the historic Supreme Court verdict on Section 377 IPC, there is no point in holding one’s sexual orientation against him.”Before Saurabh Kirpal—son of former Chief Justice of India BN Kirpal—becomes the first gay judge, the Ministry of Law and Justice has to clear his name for appointment. According to the law laid down by the Supreme Court on judicial appointments, the Government can return a name recommended for judgeship once and if the same name is reiterated by the Collegium, it becomes binding on the government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lawyers-activists-welcome-collegiums-recommendation-to-appoint-first-gay-judge-338926

16-11-2021||New Delhi||Community kitchen scheme: SC says state's first responsibility is to provide food to people dying of hunger, unhappy over Centre's reply||Asserting that a welfare state's first responsibility is to provide food to people "dying due to hunger", the Supreme Court on Tuesday expressed strong displeasure over the Centre's response on framing a pan-India policy to implement the Community Kitchen Scheme and granted it three weeks to hold a meeting with states.A bench comprising Chief Justice NV Ramana and Justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli was also irked with the Centre's affidavit as it was filed by an official of the level of an Under Secretary and did not divulge details about the proposed scheme and its roll out as sought, and gave a "final warning" to the government.The top court was hearing a PIL seeking directions to the Centre, states and Union Territories (UTs) to formulate a scheme for community kitchens to combat hunger and malnutrition."See if you want to take care of hunger, no Constitution or law will say no... This is the first principle: Every welfare state's first responsibility is to provide food to people dying due to hunger." The court said the Centre's affidavit does not indicate anywhere that it was considering framing a scheme."You are extracting information. It does not say what fund you have collected and what you are doing etc. We wanted a uniform model from the Centre. You have to ask the states... Not to collect information like police,” the bench said at the outset."You cannot ask for information which is already available. Do you conclude your affidavit saying you will consider the scheme now? There is not a whisper in your 17-page affidavit,” it added.The top court then expressed anguish over the filing of the affidavit by an Under Secretary of the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Administration."This is the last warning I am going to give to the Government of India. Your Under Secretary files this affidavit. Why cannot a secretary-level officer file the affidavit? You have to respect the institutions. We say something and you write something. This has been told several times earlier,” the CJI said.Initially, the matter was being argued by Additional Solicitor General Madhvi Divan and later Attorney General KK Venugopal stepped in and assured the bench that a meeting would be held by the Centre and a decision taken on the issue and sought four weeks time from the bench.The top law officer said that something can be worked out within the framework of the National Food Security Act."The question is simple, on the last occasion we made it clear unless and until states are involved the Centre cannot do anything. So we directed the Centre to call the meeting and frame the policy. The issue is now, make a comprehensive scheme, identify areas where there's an immediate need, so it can be uniformly implemented," the CJI said.In its order, the bench also recorded that it was not happy with the Centre's affidavit filed by the Under Secretary.“We direct that here afterwards some responsible secretary has to file the affidavit. Still it appears from the affidavit and the submissions by the Centre that they are still obtaining suggestions and views. In view of that, we finally grant three weeks time to come up with some scheme which can be agreeable by states also." "Otherwise if states have any objection we will consider it on the next date of hearing. We direct all states to attend a meeting called by the Government of India in coming up with a scheme," the bench ordered.The bench had last month asked the Centre to come out with some policy decisions concerning the implementation of the Community Kitchen Scheme by taking into consideration similar schemes which are operational in different states.It had also taken note of incidents of alleged hunger deaths and malnutrition of children in some states and asked them to file short replies by identifying the Districts/Talukas/Villages where such incidents have taken place or taking place."We are of the considered view that until and unless the State Governments are involved with regard to implementation of the Scheme, it would be difficult to implement the same."Under the circumstances, it would be appropriate that the Union of India should come out with some policy decision with regard to implementation of the Community Kitchen Scheme by taking into consideration the other similar Schemes relating to the community kitchen which are already in operation in different States," the bench had said.The apex court, on February 17 last year, had imposed an additional cost of Rs 5 lakh each on six states for not complying with its directions to file their affidavits on the PIL, which sought formulation of the scheme to set up community kitchens for the poor.The additional cost of Rs 5 lakh each was imposed on Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Odisha, Goa, and Delhi.Advocate Ashima Mandla, appearing for the PIL petitioners, was asked by the bench to prepare a chart of all the states who have filed their replies to the petition.She had said 69 per cent of children under the age of five have lost their lives due to malnutrition and it is high time that states take steps to set up community kitchens.The apex court had on October 18, 2019, favoured setting up of community kitchens, saying the country needs this kind of a system to tackle the problem of hunger.It had issued notices to the Centre and all states asking for their responses on a PIL seeking directions to all the states and UTs to formulate the community kitchens.The plea claimed that many children under the age of five die every day due to hunger and malnutrition and this condition was violative of various fundamental rights, including the right to food and the life of citizens.The PIL, filed by social activists Anun Dhawan, Ishann Dhawan, and Kunjana Singh, had also sought a direction to the Centre for creating a national food grid for people falling outside the purview of the public distribution scheme.It had also sought the issuance of an order to the National Legal Services Authority (NLSA) for formulating a scheme to mitigate hunger-related deaths.The plea referred to the state-funded community kitchens being run in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Odisha, Jharkhand and Delhi that serve meals at subsidised rates in hygienic conditions.The plea also referred to the concepts of the soup kitchen, meal centre, food kitchen, or community kitchen in other countries where food is offered to the hungry usually for free or sometimes at below-market price rates. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/community-kitchen-scheme-sc-says-states-first-responsibility-is-to-provide-food-to-people-dying-of-hunger-unhappy-over-centres-reply-338921
16-11-2021||New Delhi||PIL in SC challenges Centre’s ordinances on powers to extend tenure of Directors of CBI, ED||A PIL in the Supreme Court on Tuesday challenged the Constitutional validity of two ordinances promulgated by the Centre on November 14 under which the tenure of the Directors of the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate can now be extended by up to three years after the mandated term of two years.The PIL alleged that the Central Vigilance Commission (Amendment) Ordinance and the Delhi Special Police Establishment (Amendment) Ordinance are “unconstitutional, arbitrary and ultra-vires” to the Constitution and urged their quashing.The PIL, filed by lawyer M L Sharma in his personal capacity, said that the central government has misused its power under Article 123 of the Constitution which deals with the Power of the President to promulgate Ordinances during recess of Parliament.It alleged that the ordinances are aimed at circumventing the apex court’s directive in the verdict on a PIL that had challenged the retrospective change in the 2018 appointment order of Sanjay Kumar Mishra as ED Director leading to extension of his tenure.“By giving the government the power to extend the tenure of the heads of the two agencies to a maximum of five years, from two years, currently, the two ordinances carry the potential of further chipping away the independence of these agencies,” the PIL said.“To issue writ of mandamus quashing impugned ordinances...dated November 14, 2021 being unconstitutional, illegal and ultra vires to the Constitution of India in the interest of justice,” it said.As per the ordinances, the tenure of the Directors of the CBI and the ED can now be extended by up to three years after the mandated term of two years.In both cases, an extension of a year each for three years can be given to the Directors after clearance by the committees constituted for their appointments, according to the ordinances.The apex court on September 8 had dismissed a plea challenging retrospective change in the 2018 appointment order of Sanjay Kumar Mishra as director of the ED, saying that a reasonable period of extension can be granted to facilitate completion of ongoing investigations.The top court had made it clear however that extension of tenure of officers who have attained the age of superannuation should be done in rare and exceptional cases.It had also made clear that no further extension can be given to Mishra as the ED Director.

He was also battling chronic diabetes.” Malakar said the elderly man had taken both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, but his life could not be saved during treatment.Before this, the last Covid-19 fatality in Indore was reported on June 29, he said.Indore has been the most affected district in the state, but very few new cases of coronavirus are being reported here these days.Officials said one new coronavirus patient was found in Indore in the last 24 hours, pushing the number of cases to 1,53,278, including 1,392 fatalities. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/fully-vaccinated-elderly-man-dies-of-covid-19-in-indore-338918
16-11-2021||New Delhi||Health Minister suggests stickers be given to notify fully vaccinated status of families||Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday suggested that stickers for houses to notify completion of both doses of Covid-19 vaccines should be given to fully vaccinated families to encourage uptake of vaccine among the population.The minister made the suggestion during a meeting on Tuesday with non-government organisations, civil society outfits and development partners to take the “Har Ghar Dastak” Covid vaccination campaign across the length and breadth of the country, according to a Union Health Ministry statement.Mandaviya noted that ‘Jan-Bhagidari’ (people’s participation) is essential for such a mammoth exercise like India’s vaccination programme.“India stood tall in Covid-19 crisis because of the initiative of non-government organisations and civil society organisations which supplemented the efforts of the government to ensure that nobody went to sleep on an empty stomach during the Covid lockdown,” he stated.The minister also noted their contribution in ensuring that 80 per cent of the population and 40 per cent of the population received their first and second dose of the vaccine respectively, according to the statement.Involvement of all stakeholders working according to their expertise and capacity to achieve a collective goal is the very essence of democracy,” Mandaviya said as he interacted with representatives of various stakeholders helping the government in furthering the reach and coverage of vaccination.Giving the example of developed countries whose health system and healthcare delivery have been exhausted with multiple waves of COVID-19, the Union Health Minister stressed for the completion of the COVID-19 vaccination drive with 100 per cent administration of both the doses as an immediate necessity to end the pandemic in India, the statement stated.“We have to all ensure that everybody is vaccinated,” he stated.The partners at the meeting were exhorted to work towards generating community awareness and transforming the vaccination exercise into a ‘Jan Andolan’ (public movement).The importance of second dose in protecting from serious illness and hospitalisation was flagged as an essential component of communication, the ministry said in the statement.Mandaviya suggested the partners to identify an area according to their capacity and saturate vaccination among all the inhabitants there.He also suggested that stickers notifying completion of both doses of vaccines be given to families to encourage uptake of vaccine among the population, the statement said.The partners were asked to disseminate information on the campaign through NGO/CSO social media channels, use of audio-visual content for posting and amplifying positive messages, invigorating advocacy with leading medical professionals at national, state or district level for positive messaging around Covid-19 vaccination, it said.The partners were also asked to dispel myths, misconceptions and doubts related to Covid-19 vaccine, support on-site mobilization of beneficiaries, participate in state, district and block level task forces for overall support in planning and implementation of Covid-19 vaccination drive, the statement said.Non government organisations and civil society outfits also shared innovative steps being taken to ensure saturation of vaccination, especially in low-performing localities.The cumulative Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the country has crossed 113 crore.

A child who has witnessed his mother being touched inappropriately under the garb of frisking, when she returns from the field, can never be patriotic, no matter how many times you chant ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ in front of him. These incidents give birth to anti-social elements,” he said on the floor of the House.A senior BSF officer said the paramilitary organisation was a professional force that “has always performed the mandated duties by adhering to the rules and regulations”.“BSF ‘mahila praharis’ (women personnel) are the ones who do frisking of females,” he said.He said the “allegations of BSF personnel inappropriately touching women are utterly baseless”.The BSF frontiers based in West Bengal, south Bengal located in Kolkata and north Bengal located in Siliguri, may issued a detailed statement on the controversy, another officer of the force said.The BSF is extensively deployed in the border areas of West Bengal as part of its primary mandate to guard the 4,096 km-long India-Bangladesh international border.

Nobody knows. Today the Constitution and democracy are in danger. The situation is very serious. Every person will have to think,” the chief minister added.Gehlot made the remarks while addressing a state-level teacher award ceremony at Birla Auditorium here.The chief minister also targeted the Centre over the rising prices of petrol and diesel.He said when the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government was at the Centre, it did not allow the fuel prices to rise and kept its prices under check despite high crude oil prices in the international market.But under the current NDA government, the prices of oil and diesel have increased rapidly despite crude oil prices falling heavily in the international market.And for the state’s reluctance to cut down the VAT on fuels despite the Centre slashing excise on diesel and petrol by Rs 10 and Rs 5 respectively, he cited the fall in the state’s share of revenue due to the Centre’s cutting down the fuel prices.“Now when the Centre has reduced the petrol and diesel by Rs 5 and Rs 10, the revenue of the state government has automatically reduced by Rs 1,800 crore in the same proportion,” said Gehlot.“Now we have demanded from the Centre that if inflation is to be reduced, you should reduce fuel prices by Rs 10 and Rs 15 more. They are making states compete amongst themselves,” he added.“So far, about one lakh government jobs have been given in Rajasthan and the process of giving about 80,000 jobs is going on,” Gehlot added.

The Supreme Court has also said it is not right to hold farmers responsible because only 10 per cent of the pollution is caused by stubble and that too for one-and-a-half to two months,” Tikait tweeted in Hindi. Tikait’s BKU is part of farmers’ collective Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which is spearheading the protests against three central farm laws at Delhi’s borders since November 2020, demanding their withdrawal and a legal guarantee on minimum support price for crops.          Air quality in parts of north India, particularly Delhi NCR, deteriorates to levels that impact human health.

And now, the same government is opposing BSF activities. Under this new rule (jurisdiction extension), there is no question of conflict between the state police and the BSF,” Adhikari stated.The resolution was passed with 112 voting in favour of it and 63 opposing it.The BJP-led central government had amended the BSF Act to authorise the force to undertake search, seizure and arrest within a larger 50 km stretch, instead of 15 km, from the international border in Punjab, West Bengal and Assam. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/west-bengal-assembly-passes-resolution-against-centres-move-to-extend-bsf-jurisdiction-338881

But in the 21st century, data is information and in coming times our history will be looked through and understood using data. In the future, data will be dictating history," he said.He went on to list reforms such as contactless customs, automatic renewals, faceless assessments and online applications for service delivery, that have ended unnecessary government interventions."When transparency is brought in the system, results are visible," he said, adding that India is the world's third-largest ecosystem for startups and already has 50 unicorns.He said documents, data and files sought by the national auditor, CAG, should be provided by government departments.Strong, scientific audits will make the system strong and transparent, he said, adding his government has taken CAG's concerns on fiscal deficit and state expenditure in the right spirit.Appreciating CAG's new practice of sharing preliminary findings with government departments before the beginning of field audits, he said the combination of the two would give better results.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison will give the opening address.The first in-person Quad summit hosted by US resident Joe Biden in Washington on September 24 had committed to the development of critical and emerging technology by coordinating their approaches to technological design, development, governance and usage. Besides, technology is a key element in the ongoing push by both countries to deepen trade and investment ties.The Sydney Dialogue proceeds with the assumption that conversations about technology are currently taking place in silos. These include areas such as artificial intelligence, the use of surveillance technologies, quantum, space and biotechnology, disinformation and cyber-enabled interference, supply chain resilience and the future of cyberspace.The Sydney Dialogue intends to provide a forum to anticipate and respond to the challenges and opportunities presented by increasingly complex advances in technology. It will have an Indo-Pacific focus and bring together business, government and technology leaders with strategic thinkers to work towards common understandings of the challenges posed by new technologies, said the Dialogue organisers.The Quad summit had also felt that technology should not be misused or abused for malicious activities such as authoritarian surveillance and oppression, for terrorist purposes, or to disseminate disinformation. However, both leaders have patchy records on this account, as per civil society organisations. India has new internet rules that include restrictions on content and insist on traceability of information. The government is also accused of using the military-grade spyware Pegasus for snooping on journalists, opponents and civil society activists. Australia, too, has laws that give sweeping rights to security agencies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/modi-australian-pm-to-address-meeting-on-cutting-edge-technologies-338838

CJI-led BenchIt ordered the Principal Secretaries concerned of the states of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi to attend the meeting and make their submissions before the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas.The Bench, which also included Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Surya Kant, directed the Centre and NCR states to allow their officials to work from home, as done by the Delhi Government to minimise vehicular pollution. “Decide what industries are to be stopped, which vehicles can be prevented from plying, which power plants can be stopped and how you can provide alternative power by then”, it said, asking them to submit an action plan by Wednesday, the next date of hearing.After perusing the affidavits filed by the Centre, Delhi Government and others, the Bench, which had earlier taken exception to farmer-bashing, said, “We find that the major contributors of air pollution in National Capital Region are construction activities, running of non¬essential industries, transport and running of power plants on coal etc.”“As far as the air pollution caused by stubble burning is concerned, the affidavits filed in the matter do indicate that stubble burning is not responsible for causing air pollution to that extent except for the two months of October and November. However, we find that there is a rise in stubble burning incidents in the states of Punjab and Haryana,” it noted.The top court directed the state governments to persuade farmers to stop stubble burning at least for a period of two weeks.As Solicitor General Tushar Mehta quoted statistics to say that stubble burning contributed to less than 10 per cent of the air pollution in Delhi, the Bench said the hue and cry over stubble burning was without scientific or legal basis.Senior counsel Vikas Singh, representing petitioner Aditya Dubey, said the Centre’s affidavit made it clear that bulk of air pollution during this season was mainly caused by stubble burning.The top court expressed unhappiness over the outcome of the commission’s meeting on Sunday, saying most of its decisions were in the nature of “long-term measures”, and not emergency steps even as it appreciated some of the steps taken by it. After going through the actual exercise undertaken at the ground level, it said the authorities had not yet indicated the broader steps they intended to take to control the factors responsible for poor air quality.As the Delhi Government’s affidavit blamed farmers and stubble burning in neighbouring states for air pollution in the NCR, the Bench pulled it up for giving “lame excuses”, passing the buck to municipal corporations.To the court’s query about steps taken for cleaning of roads, senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing Delhi Government, said the municipal corporations may be asked to file an affidavit on this point.“Such kind of lame excuses will force us to hold an audit of the revenue you are earning and spend on popularity slogans, instead of looking after people,” the Bench told Mehra, who later submitted that 69 mechanical road sweeper machines were being used and that the government would work on a war-footing.As air pollution in Delhi-NCR reaches alarming proportions, the top court had on Saturday asked the government to take immediate steps, including a lockdown, to deal with the “emergency” situation.Pulls up Delhi Govt for shifting blameCong seeks ‘white paper’ from govtUP, Pb, Hry to attend||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/supreme-court-asks-centre-to-hold-emergency-meeting-on-containing-air-pollution-338464
16-11-2021||New Delhi||India resumes quarantine-free entry of foreign travellers from 99 countries||India on Monday resumed quarantine-free entry for foreign travellers from 99 countries, which have agreed to a mutual recognition of COVID-19 vaccination certificates with it, almost 20 months after restrictions were imposed due to COVID-19.Travellers from these 99 countries, including the US, the UK, France, Germany, Australia, the Netherlands and Russia, which have been listed under "Category A", have to submit a self-declaration form on the Air Suvidha portal (newdelhiairport.in) before the scheduled travel, apart from uploading a negative COVID-19 RT-PCR report, according to the revised Guidelines for International Arrivals released by the Union health ministry on November 11.The RT-PCR test should be conducted within 72 hours prior to undertaking the journey.Each passenger shall also submit a declaration with respect to the authenticity of the report and will be liable for criminal prosecution, if found otherwise.There are countries that have agreements with India on a mutual recognition of vaccination certificates of nationally-recognised or World Health Organization-recognised vaccines.Similarly, there are countries that do not have such an agreement with India, but they exempt the Indian citizens who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 with nationally-recognised or WHO-recognised vaccines, the guidelines stated.On the basis of reciprocity, the travellers from all such countries that provide quarantine-free entry to Indians ("Category A" countries) are allowed certain relaxations on arrival, the guidelines read.Some of the countries currently considered to be "at risk" by India, which means the travellers from where would need to follow additional measures on arrival including testing, are the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe and Singapore."As India opened its doors to fully-vaccinated international tourists from all over the world beginning Monday, India tourism Mumbai accorded a warm welcome to the first set of international tourists who landed at Mumbai International Airport by Air France flight AF218," the Union Ministry of Tourism said in a tweet.According to the guidelines, if fully-vaccinated travellers are coming from a country with which India has reciprocal arrangements for mutual acceptance of WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccines, they shall be allowed to leave the airport and need not undergo home quarantine.They shall self-monitor their health for 14 days post arrival.If partially or not vaccinated, the travellers need to undertake measures, including submission of samples for post-arrival Covid test at the point of arrival, after which they will be allowed to leave the airport, home quarantined for seven days, a re-test would be conducted on the eighth day of arrival and if the results are negative, they have to further self-monitor their health for seven days."Fifteen days must have elapsed since completion of COVID-19 vaccination schedule," the guidelines said.Travellers from countries excluding those "at risk" will be allowed to leave the airport and they shall self-monitor their health for 14 days post arrival. This is applicable to travellers from all countries, including those with which reciprocal arrangements for mutual acceptance of WHO-approved vaccines exist.

16-11-2021||New Delhi||Days after his Ayodhya book launch, Salman Khurshid posts photos of arson at Nainital home||Former minister and Congress leader Salman Khurshid on Monday posted pictures of arson at his Nainital home on his Facebook page asking if he was still wrong to say Hinduism was not about violence.The arson came days after Khurshid triggered a controversy by drawing similarities between Hindutva and the ideologies of radical jihadi groups like ISIS and Boko Haram.Khurshid was attacked by the ruling BJP for making the comparisons. His own party colleague Ghulam Nabi Azad disagreed saying: “The comparison is factually incorrect and an exaggeration”.Posting the stark pictures including one of fire at the entry to his home, Khurshid said on Facebook on Monday: “So such is the debate now. Shame is too ineffective a word. Besides I still hope that we can reason together one day and agree to disagree if not more.I hoped to open these doors to my friends who have left this calling card. Am I still wrong to say this cannot be Hinduism?”Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also later said that Hinduism and Hindutva were distinct.Addressing a party workers’ training programme at Wardha on November 12, Gandhi said: “Can these be the same thing? Why do you use the word Hinduism, why not just use Hindutva, if they are the same thing?”“They are obviously different things and so these are the types of things that we have to start to explore and understand and develop a group of people, hundred, five hundred, thousands of people, who deeply understand these differences, who can apply these differences to issues, to behavior, to action. Is Hinduism about beating a Sikh or a Muslim? Hindutva, of course. But, Is Hinduism about killing Akhlaq? In which book is it written? I have not seen it,” said Gandhi.He said he had read the Upanishad but not seen references of violence or victimisation of others.“I am unable to find in any Hindu scripture or even in Islamic scripture or in Sikh scripture that anyone can kill an innocent man. I can see it in Hindutva,” said Gandhi urging workers to understand and propagate the difference.Only last week, Khurshid’s new book ‘Sunrise over Ayodhya’ was launched in Delhi.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/days-after-his-ayodhya-book-launch-salman-khurshid-posts-photos-of-arson-at-nainital-home-338412
16-11-2021||New Delhi||Centre allows post-mortem to be performed after sunset in hospitals with proper infrastructure||The Centre on Monday allowed conducting post-mortem after sunset in hospitals with adequate infrastructure, except in cases of homicide, suicide, rape, decomposed bodies and suspected foul play.Referring to the development, Union Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya in a tweet in Hindi said, “An end to the system put in place by the British! Post-mortem can be conducted round-the-clock. In furtherance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s idea of good governance, the health ministry has decided that post-mortem can be conducted even after sunset in hospitals which have the facility to carry out the procedure at night.”“In response to the multiple references received by the Union Health Ministry from various sources and in line with the government’s commitment to promote ease of living by reducing burden imposed due to compliance to government processes, changes have been made in the post-mortem protocols to allow for the procedure to be conducted after sunset effective from today,” the health ministry said.“Apart from friends and relatives of the deceased, this new procedure also promotes organ donation and transplant as organs can be harvested in the stipulated time window after the procedure,” it said.The multiple representations to the ministry in this regard were examined by a technical committee in the Directorate General of Health Services, Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare.It was ascertained that some institutes are already performing night-time post-mortem. In view of the rapid advancement and improvement in technology, especially availability of required lighting and infrastructure required for post-mortem, performing night time post-mortem in hospitals is now feasible, the ministry said.The protocol stipulates that post-mortem for organ donation be taken up on priority and conducted even after sunset at the hospitals which have the infrastructure for conducting such post-mortem on a regular basis, it said.The health ministry further said the fitness and adequacy of infrastructure, among others, shall be assessed by the hospital-in-charge to ensure that there is no dilution of evidentiary value.“It is also to be ensured by the facility that video recording of post-mortem shall be done for all post-mortem conducted in the night, to rule out any suspicion and preserved for future reference for legal purposes,” it underlined.However, cases under categories such as homicide, suicide, rape, decomposed bodies and suspected foul play should not be subjected for post-mortem during night time unless there is a law and order situation, the ministry added.
