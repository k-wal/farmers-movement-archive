His relatives charged the police with fabricating a false case against him and said he does not know driving.However, Wayanad Superintendent of Police Aravind Sukumar rejected the allegations and told PTI that the accused used a duplicate key to break into the car and drove it some distance before he was caught by the locals.“He was trying to steal the car from Bathery. His fingerprints matched in a burglary case, where gold and a mobile phone were stolen from a house. There was another instance in Meenangadi where he stole a scooter,” the SP said, adding that, a detailed probe was being done by the Bathery Deputy Superintendent of Police.Acting on a complaint by Deepu’s mother, K Baijunath, a Judicial member of the State Human Rights Commission had on Wednesday last ordered the District  Superintendent of Police to conduct an enquiry in the issue. The SHRC will hear the case on December 14.Congress leader and MLA, I C Balakrishnan told the media that the police action amounted to “gross injustice” to Dalit communities and that the Congress will extend legal support to the victim. —  PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tribal-man-says-he-was-tortured-in-custody-forced-to-confess-to-theft-343503

27-11-2021||---||President Kovind asks judges to exercise ‘utmost discretion’ while making comments in courts||New Delhi, November 27President Ram Nath Kovind asked judges to exercise "utmost discretion" in their courtroom utterances, saying “indiscreet remarks, even if made with good intention, could potentially be used against the judiciary.Addressing the valedictory function of Constitution Day, Kovind said the Indian judiciary has been adhering to highest standards and there was no doubt that judges have set for a high bar for themselves. “Hence, it is also incumbent upon the judges to exercise utmost discretion in their utterances in the courtrooms. Indiscreet remarks, even if made with good intention, give space for dubious interpretations to run down the judiciary,” Kovind said.Underling that judges in India were seen as a model of rectitude, he said, “We have a rich history of legions of such judges known for their utterances full of sagacity and conduct beyond reproach, which have become hallmarks for the future generations”.The president suggested creation of an All India Judicial Service for selection of judges. “I am of the view that the Independence of the judiciary is non-negotiable. Without diluting it to the slightest degree, can a better way be found to select judges for the higher judiciary? For instance, there can be an all-India Judicial Service which can select, nurture and promote the right talent, right from the lower levels to the higher levels,” he said.He further added, “This idea is not new and has been around for half a century without being tested. I am sure there can be better ways of reforming the system. Ultimately, the aim should be to strengthen the justice delivery mechanism.”On the issue of increasing attacks on judges highlighted by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana, the President said he was pained to note that of late some disparaging remarks had been made against the judiciary on social media.“These platforms have worked wonderfully to democratise information, yet they have a dark side too. The anonymity granted by them is exploited by some miscreants. I hope this is an aberration and it will be short-lived,” the President noted.CJI NV Ramana complained that the legislature did not conduct judicial impact assessment of laws, leading to increase in pendency.Giving the example of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the CJI said the already burdened magistrates’ courts were further burdened by a huge number of cheque bounce cases.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/president-kovind-asks-judges-to-exercise-utmost-discretion-while-making-comments-in-courts-343490

In this context, I would like to inform that the Government has already approved the continuation of the centrally sponsored scheme for development of infrastructural facilities for the judiciary at a cost of Rs 9000 crore rupees,” the Law Minister said in his address at the valedictory function of Constitution Day Celebrations at Vigyan Bhawan here.Noting that various sections of society were concerned about the huge pendency of cases, Rijiju said judicial infrastructure was essential for the reduction of backlog of cases.The government was sensitive to the needs of strengthening the judicial infrastructure and committed to investing maximum resources for developing next generation infrastructure, he added.Chief Justice of India NV Ramana thanked the Law Minister for approving Rs 9,000 crore for development of judicial infrastructure even as he said the problem was not about funds but their under-utilisation.The CJI reiterated his demand for a Special Purpose Vehicle in the form of Judicial Infrastructure Authority to ensure proper utilization of the funds meant for the judiciary.”I thank the Hon’ble Law Minster for mentioning that the Government of India has granted around Rs 9000 crore for infrastructure. I request the Law Minister to create a special purpose vehicle. Yesterday, I mentioned the reason. Money is not the issue. Funds are not the issue. Ultimately the money or the functions sanctioned by the Government of India under the central scheme has to reach and it has to be spent,” Justice Ramana said.He complained that some states were not contributing their share towards this purpose. “Unfortunately, some of the states are not giving their share of money as a contributing share. So, no infrastructure schemes are taking off. This is the reason why I am strongly advocating the creation of a National Judicial Infrastructure Corporation. I request once again, please consider this,” the CJI said. “I must acknowledge that the Union Government has been making reasonable budgetary allocation through its Centrally Sponsored Scheme for this purpose. But, due to non-availability of matching grants by some States, the budget allocated remains underutilized. I feel the situation calls for the creation of special purpose vehicles, namely National and State Judicial Infrastructure Authorities in the lines of NALSA and SLSAs”, the CJI had said on Friday.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-approves-rs-9000-crore-for-judicial-infrastructure-343484

27-11-2021||New Delhi||Uphaar cinema fire: Court reserves order on suspending jail terms to Ansals in evidence tampering case||A Delhi court on Saturday reserved for December 3 its order on whether to suspend the seven-year jail terms awarded to real estate barons Sushil and Gopal Ansal for tampering with evidence in the 1997 case of Uphaar cinema fire, which had claimed 59 lives.Additional Sessions Judge Anil Antil reserved the order on appeals filed by the Ansals against their conviction and jail terms by a magisterial court.Besides challenging their conviction and punishment, the Ansals had urged the sessions court to suspend their jail terms till the appeal is decided.The court heard the arguments of the accused as well as the victim and police, and reserved the order.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, appearing for the Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT), had opposed the appeals and told the court that the offence of tampering with evidence is extremely serious in nature as it affects the entire criminal justice system.The Delhi Police had also opposed the appeals filed by the Ansals and told the court that suspending the jail terms of the convicts would trigger the mental trauma and agony of the victims.The police had told the court that the punishment provided a solace to the victims of the tragedy and reinforced their faith in the justice delivery system, that too after 24 years.If the jail terms awarded to the convicts are suspended within a month of incrimination, it will further erode the faith of the country’s common citizens in the criminal justice system, Additional Public Prosecutor A T Ansari had told the court.The case is related to tampering with evidence in the main fire tragedy case, in which the Ansals were convicted and sentenced to a two-year jail term by the Supreme Court.The apex court had, however, released the Ansals, taking into account the prison time they had done, on the condition that they pay a fine of Rs 30 crore each, to be used for building a trauma centre in the national capital.The magisterial court had also sentenced former court staff Dinesh Chand Sharma and two others—P P Batra and Anoop Singh—to seven years in jail and slapped a fine of Rs 3 lakh each on them.It had imposed a fine of Rs 2.25 crore each on the Ansals.The tampering was detected for the first time on July 20, 2002 and a departmental enquiry was initiated against Sharma, who was suspended subsequently.Later, he was terminated from services on June 25, 2004.The prosecution said after the termination of his services, the Ansal brothers helped Sharma get employment on a monthly salary of Rs 15,000.When the case was registered, the documents of the company where Sharma was employed were further tampered with by its chairperson Anoop Singh.According to the chargesheet, the documents alleged to have been tampered with included a police memorandum giving details of recoveries immediately after the incident, Delhi Fire Services records pertaining to the repair of a transformer installed inside the Uphaar cinema hall, minutes of the managing director’s meetings and four cheques.Of the six sets of documents, a cheque for Rs 50 lakh, issued by Sushil Ansal to himself, and minutes of the MD’s meetings, proved beyond doubt that the two brothers were handling the day-to-day affairs of the theatre at the relevant time, the chargesheet had said.The fire had broken out at the Uphaar cinema hall during the screening of Hindi film “Border” on June 13, 1997, claiming 59 lives.The case was lodged on the direction of the Delhi High Court, which was hearing a petition filed by AVUT chairperson Neelam Krishnamoorthy.

A team of geologists led by Pradeep Kumar was sent by the district administration to the village for a survey following her complaint.“The families living in endangered houses need to be immediately shifted to safe places as a calamity might occur any moment,” she warned.Dharchula SDM A K Shukla said further action will be taken after he receives the survey report from the team of geologists and studies it in detail. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/houses-in-uttarakhand-village-sliding-backwards-risk-for-human-habitation-experts-343453

We have to immediately take precautionary measures to control it, so I have called a meeting of health, disaster management officials, also Covid advisers and experts. We will also discuss about the new strain." Bommai said.Speaking to reporters here, he said, "Not only medical precautions, the measures that need to be taken publicly will be important, they should be taken immediately." The number of positive cases in Dharwad's SDM College of Medical Sciences and Hospital has increased to 281, official sources said.According to official sources, most of the infected are asymptomatic, while very few have mild symptoms, and they have all been kept in isolation.As a precautionary measure, Dharwad district administration has declared holiday for schools and colleges within the 500-metre radius of the medical college and hospital; also OPD services there have been shut down for three days.Meanwhile, 12 Kerala students of a nursing college in Anekal on the outskirts of Bengaluru tested positive for Covid, and 33 students and a staff member tested positive for infection at a private unaided (boarding) school in Dommasandra near Sarjapura on Thursday.Officials said all precautionary measures had been taken at both these institutes.Noting that samples of students who had tested positive at Dharwad's SDM Medical College had been sent for genomic sequencing, Health Minister K Sudhakar said, "So far, 281 people there have tested positive; some samples have been sent for genomic sequencing and the reports are expected by December first week, so that we will get to know about the variant." Observing that for the past one week in four to five countries like Botswana, South Africa, Hong Kong and Israel, the new variant has been found, he said, "For the past nine months delta variant was spreading across the world and the two doses of vaccine we have been administering had the power to prevent its spread, but the information is that this new variant B.1.1.529 or Omicron is spreading very rapidly." "There seems to be some worry about it (new variant), but I want to tell people that there is no need to worry as of now. We have already held a meeting and have given guidelines for airports stating that those travelling from these countries to Bengaluru have to undergo a test despite having Covid test report, and they will be allowed outside the airport only after testing negative," he said."Even after testing negative they will have to remain at home and after seven days they will have to undergo a test once again, and after getting the negative report, one can go out," he added.

The event is being organised by Mata Sundri College for Women here.The former Governor praised the college for organising the conference, which also had participants from Pakistan. He asked Principal Harpreet Kaur and conference convener Veenakshi Sharma to involve the Sahitya Akademi for translating Punjabi literature into other languages and to get the National Book Trust publish these works at affordable rates.“There is a great amount of Punjabi literature that needs to be translated,” he stressed, delivering a part of his speech in Punjabi and lamenting how those in Delhi-NCR had stopped speaking Punjabi.He called for documenting Partition stories, saying: “In a few years, the pre-Partition generation will be gone.

27-11-2021||---||CBI gets nod to prosecute retd Allahabad High Court Judge||New Delhi, November 26The CBI has got the sanction from the Central Government to prosecute retired Allahabad High Court Judge Justice SN Shukla in a corruption case for allegedly favouring a private medical college in his orders, sources in the agency said.The sources said the CBI had applied for a go-ahead from the Central Government to prosecute Justice Shukla on April 16 under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The CBI will now proceed with a chargesheet against the retired judge.Besides Justice Shukla of the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad HC, the agency has also named in the FIR retired Chhattisgarh HC Judge IM Quddusi and Bhagwan Prasad Yadav and Palash Yadav of Prasad Education Trust, the trust itself and private persons Bhavna Pandey and Sudhir Giri, the sources said. It is alleged that the Prasad Institute of Medical Sciences was debarred along with 46 other medical colleges by the Centre from admitting students due to substandard facilities and non-fulfilment of the required criteria in May 2017. The Centre’s decision was challenged by the trust before the SC through a writ petition. On a later date, a conspiracy was hatched by those named in the FIR and the petition was withdrawn with the permission of the court, which endorsed the Centre’s order. Subsequently, another writ petition was filed before the Lucknow Bench of the high court on August 24, 2017, the sources said.It is further alleged in the FIR that the petition was heard on August 25, 2017, by a Division Bench comprising Justice Shukla and a favourable order was passed the same day, the sources said.Justice Shukla allegedly defied the orders passed by the CJI-led Supreme Court Bench, allowing Prasad Institute of Medical Sciences to admit students for the 2017-18 academic sessions.CJI Dipak Misra had then taken note and constituted a three-member in-house committee to look into the allegations. The CBI booked Justice Shukla and other accused in December 2019 under Section 120B of the IPC and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act. After filing the FIR, the CBI had conducted searches at multiple locations in Lucknow, Meerut and Delhi, the sources said. The CBI did not need permission to prosecute Justice Quddusi as he was a retired judge at the time of the alleged offence and acting in the capacity of a private person.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cbi-gets-nod-to-prosecute-retd-allahabad-high-court-judge-343195

Till then, a little over 184 LMT of paddy had been purchased against the targeted 169 LMT.As the realpolitik in the state continued to sway in favour of the farmers, the state government asked its officials tocontinue buying whatever paddy was arriving in the mandis. In order to ensure that the government agencies were not sold paddy from outside the state, Punjab even set up committees headed by deputy commissioners to monitor the purchase.“On an average, 10,000-20,000 MT of paddy is still arriving daily in some mandis, and we have been asked to have it procured subject to a verification report by the deputy commissioner concerned,” a senior official in the department of food and supplies said, adding that the government had promised to purchase all paddy arriving in the mandis at a meeting with Kisan unions earlier this month. Till today, 187.23 LMT of paddy has been purchased in the state. The state food supplies department has now shot off a letter to the Centre, urging it to enhance the purchase target to 187.5 LMT.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/raise-procurement-target-state-to-centre-343196

No action was taken despite the Punjab and Haryana High Court directing the government to dispose of the desecration case within six months, he said.Who’s stalling action?Who is stalling the police and law to take action against the guilty? The issue of drug is ravaging the state. —Navjot Singh Sidhu, PCC presidentHe questioned the government’s failure in curb the drug menace. Citing High Court judgments in different cases, he pointed towards connivance of government officials. “The HC while hearing a smuggling case observed drug suppliers are enjoying political patronage and escape punishment and only small-time couriers are caught,” he said. In the 12 lakh Tramadole seizure case, Sidhu cited the HC order, saying: “Punjab state functionaries, for reasons best known to them, are intentionally protecting drug offenders.” He said the NDPS bureau in its report had stated Punjab topped in drug-related crimes.Similarly, on the directions of the HC, the Enforcement Directorate report was handed over to the STF in February 2018. There were clear instructions of the HC to take action against the accused as per law. “Who is stalling the police and law to take action against the guilty?” said Sidhu.Asked whether there was lack of coordination between the party and government, Sidhu brushed aside the allegation, saying it was the result of coordination that power tariff and rates of sand were reduced. The reason for taking up the issue was that “the government was acting slowly and casually”. The issue of drug was ravaging the state, he added.Showering praise on farmers, he hailed as social revolution their success in getting the three laws withdrawn. He said the agitation had left an indelible mark in the history of independent India. He said successive governments failed to give a roadmap to turn farming profitable. “Farmers are grappling with constant rise in the input cost, low productivity and quoting of insufficient prices”.Zira MLA Kulbir Singh Zira on Friday said though the issues flagged by Sidhu were right, the manner in which he was raising these wasn’t.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sidhu-again-attacks-govt-over-sacrilege-drugs-343197

People flocked to the prayer site from Mohammadpur Jharsa, Khandsa, Narsinghpur, and Khatola villages and held a havan they proclaimed was for the “martyrs of 26/11” on the 13th anniversary of the Mumbai attacks.The group also chanted “Jai Shri Ram”—a slogan that several fringe Hindu organisations are seen using increasingly as a weapon of intimidation—even as police stood nearby in large numbers to prevent escalation.The prayer site is one of several designated by the Gurugram administration for Muslims to offer the “jumma” prayers.  Public protests led the Gurugram administration to withdraw eight sites from their list of 37 sanctioned for Friday prayers.Meanwhile, some Sikhs protested the gurdwara committee’s decision to offer Gurudwara Singh Sabha, located near the sabzi mandi, for namaz.“Gurudwara is meant only for Gurbani and is not a rental place for mass religious gatherings,” said Sardar Ravi Ranjan of Gurmat Prachar Jatha Panth Khalsa. “We’re surprised that how the head of the gurudwara committee offered it to Muslims for Namaz.

27-11-2021||New Delhi||Tomato prices may soften from December with arrival of fresh crop from northern states: Centre||All India average retail tomato price, which has shot up by 63 per cent to Rs 67 per kg over the last year due to unseasonal rains, are likely to soften from December with the arrival of fresh crop from northern states, the government said on Friday.In the case of onions, retail prices have substantially subsided below to the level that prevailed in 2020 and also 2019, it said.“Tomato arrivals from north Indian states will start from the beginning of December itself, which will add to availability and lead to fall in prices. In December, arrival is expected to be at par with last year,” the Food and Consumer Affairs Ministry said in a statement.Arrivals in November this year were only 19.62 lakh tonne compared to 21.32 lakh tonne in the year-ago period, it said.Explaining the reasons for the spike in tomato prices, the ministry said retail tomato prices have risen from September-end due to unseasonal rains in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, which led to crop damage and delay in arrival from these states.Delayed arrivals from north Indian states was followed by heavy rains in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka, which disrupted the supply and also resulted in crop damage, it said in a statement.Stating that tomato price is highly volatile, the ministry said any slight disruptions in supply chain or damage due to heavy rains results in spurt in prices.Conversely, bulk arrival and logistics problems have the potential of creating a situation of glut in the market and resultant dip in retail prices, it said.As on November 25, the all-India average price of tomato was Rs 67 per kg which is 63 per cent higher than that of last year.As per the Agriculture Ministry, kharif (summer) production of tomato in the current year is at 69.52 lakh tonne as against 70.12 lakh tonne produced last year, it added.However, in case of onions, the ministry said prices have substantially subsided and the level is below that of the retail prices in 2020 and also 2019.On November 25, all-India average retail price of onion was Rs 39 per kg which is 32 per cent lower than that of the last year.The ministry said it released buffer onion stock of 2.08 lakh tonne built under the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) in a calibrated and targeted manner to states and cities where prices were increasing over the previous month and also to such markets like Lasalgaon and Pimpalgaon to augment the availability.Further, states have been offered onion at Rs 21 per kg ex-storage locations. Nagaland and Andhra Pradesh have taken onion from the buffer.The government’s Mother Dairy Safal units have also been supplied onion at Rs 26 per kg inclusive of transportation cost.“The aggressive releases of onion from the buffer have contributed to stability in prices,” the ministry said.The kharif and late kharif production of onion is estimated at a robust 69 lakh tonne. Kharif onion has already started arriving in the market.Retail tomato price on Friday shot up to Rs 75 per kilogram in the national capital while the rates in some parts of South India softened but were still high, according to government data.In Chennai, retail tomato price declined to Rs 63 per kg on Friday from the peak of Rs 100 per kg on November 22. Similarly, in Thiruvananthapuram, the price dropped to Rs 80 per kg from Rs 103 per kg in the same period, the data maintained by the Consumer Affairs Ministry showed.On Friday, in Puducherry, tomato price declined to Rs 45 per kg from Rs 100 per kg on November 22. However, in Hyderabad, the price softened to Rs 72 per kg from Rs 90 per kg that prevailed during two days.In Bengaluru, tomato price in retail markets continued to rule high at Rs 88 per kg. At Port Blair, the price jumped to Rs 143 per kg on Friday from Rs 113 per kg on November 22.According to the data, the retail tomato price in the national capital increased to Rs 75 per kg on Friday from Rs 63 per kg on November 22.However, retail prices of onion and potato in Delhi showed signs of softening.

However, special passenger flights have been operating since July last year under air bubble arrangements with around 28 countries.The Civil Aviation Ministry wrote a letter to aviation regulator DGCA asking it to take “further necessary action” for the resumption of scheduled international flights.“The matter of resumption of scheduled commercial international passenger services to and from India has been examined in consultation with the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and it has been decided that scheduled commercial international passenger services to and from India may be resumed from December 15, 2021.“Resumption of commercial international passenger services would imply reversion to bilaterally agreed capacity entitlements and termination of air bubble arrangements,” the Civil Aviation Ministry said.If a country wants to operate scheduled passenger flights to another nation, a bilateral air services agreement has to be negotiated to decide how many airlines, ports of entries and total flights (or seats) weekly can be allowed between the two.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) issued a formal notification about the resumption of scheduled international passenger flights after the receipt of the Aviation Ministry’s letter.The countries that the Health Ministry has identified as not “at-risk” of COVID-19 will get “full capacity entitlements according to the bilateral air service agreements”, the Aviation Ministry noted.In a circular on Friday, the Health Ministry has put countries in Europe, including the United Kingdom, and South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, Botswana, China, Mauritius, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel under the  ‘at-risk’ category.The Aviation Ministry said if a country has been identified to be “at-risk” of COVID-19 and has an air bubble agreement with India, then “75 per cent of pre-COVID scheduled international flight operations of Indian or foreign carrier whichever is higher or a minimum of seven frequencies per week subject to availability of entitlements under bilateral agreements will be permitted”.For a country that has been identified to be “at-risk” of COVID-19 and does not have an air-bubble agreement with India, then only “50 per cent of bilateral capacity entitlements or 50 per cent of pre-COVID operations of Indian or foreign carrier, whichever is higher”, will be permitted.Under an air bubble agreement between the two nations, airlines of both countries can operate special flights between their territories with certain restrictions.The Aviation Ministry said on Friday: “The seats under air bubble arrangement which have already been sold by airlines, which are more than the capacity entitlements under bilateral air service agreements available with the airlines, will be allowed to be operated till December 14, 2021”. “Such airlines will restrict their operations to capacity entitlements enter bilateral air service agreements available with airlines with effect from December 15, 2021,” it added.All scheduled international flights will have to strictly adhere to the Union health ministry’s protocols for international travel issued on November 11 this year, it mentioned. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-to-resume-scheduled-international-flights-from-december-15-343075
27-11-2021||New Delhi||India asks Pakistan to expedite trial in 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks case||India on Friday summoned a senior diplomat of the Pakistani High Commission on the 13th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, and pressed for an expeditious trial in the case, saying the families of 166 victims from 15 countries are still awaiting closure.In a note verbale handed over to the diplomat, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) also asked Pakistan to abide by its commitment not to allow territories under its control for terrorism against India."A note verbale reiterating India's call for an expeditious trial in the Mumbai terror attacks case, and calling on the Government of Pakistan to abide by its commitment not to allow territories under its control for terrorism against India was handed over to him," the MEA said."It is a matter of deep anguish that even after 13 years of this heinous terror attack, the families of 166 victims from 15 countries across the globe still await closure, with Pakistan showing little sincerity in bringing the perpetrators to justice," it said in a statement.The MEA asserted that the terror attack was planned, executed and launched from Pakistani territory."We once again call on the Government of Pakistan to give up double standards and to expeditiously bring the perpetrators of the horrific attack to justice," it said."This is not just a matter of Pakistan's accountability to the families of the innocent victims who fell to terrorists, but also an international obligation," the MEA said.It said India would continue to make every effort to seek justice for the families of the "victims and the martyrs" of the attack."On the 13th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai terrorist attacks, the government and people of India somberly remember the victims of this dastardly attack and the valiant security personnel who laid down their lives to protect ours," the MEA said.On November 26, 2008, 10 Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists from Pakistan arrived by sea route and opened fire, killing 166 people, including 18 security personnel, and injuring several others during the 60-hour siege in Mumbai.India and 14 other countries lost their nationals in the attack."Indian Missions in these countries are organising memorial events remembering the victims, both national and foreign, reminding the world of the continuing global threat of terrorism," the MEA said.Senior government representatives from the host governments, family members of victims and survivors would participate in these solemn events, it said.

27-11-2021||Ghaziabad||Farmers in hundreds descend on Delhi-UP border on protest anniversary||Hundreds of farmers in tractors started arriving at Ghazipur on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border as Friday marked one year of the ongoing farmers' protest against the central laws.Many of them brought along vegetables, sacks of flour and lentils, spices and cooking oil on their tractor-trollies, saying they had come prepared for a long haul.Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), an influential farmers' union from western Uttar Pradesh, has been leading the charge at the Ghazipur border since November last year.The BKU is part of the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a farmers' collective, which is spearheading the protest for withdrawal of three contentious farm laws and for legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP) of crops.“It has been a year of unmatched struggle mixed with happiness and sadness. We are fighting and winning. We will fight and win. MSP law is farmers' right,” BKU national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait tweeted in Hindi.The outfit's office-bearers claimed the police had been strengthening the barricading at Ghazipur border - both on the Delhi-Meerut elevated highway patch and at the UP Gate down below it - since Thursday, even as they said the crowd would swell at the protest site by Friday evening.“We have a meeting of the SKM on Saturday and the future course of our action will be decided only after that.“We have planned a march towards Delhi on November 29, but the SKM will take a call about it on Saturday,” BKU spokesperson Saurabh Upadhyay said.He said, “Supporters in large numbers started reaching the border on Friday morning and by evening we are expecting over 50,000 people at Ghazipur alone.”A BKU supporter who reached Ghazipur in the morning from Muzaffarnagar on a tractor in a group said they had come to the protest with arrangements for food and accommodation.“It has been a year, the farmers can continue the protest for their rights for several years,” the villager, draped in a shawl and a muffler, said.Modi had last week announced his government's decision to withdraw the contentious laws.
