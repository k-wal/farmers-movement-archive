06-11-2021||Auraiya/Lucknow (UP)||Jinnah remark: Adityanath attacks Akhilesh, calls him ‘cultureless’||Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday targeted Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav over his Jinnah remark, saying that someone who is “cultureless” cannot be expected to know the difference between a national hero and a traitor.He was attacking Yadav for his remarks in which he appeared to have equated Pakistan’s founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.Without naming the SP chief directly, Adityanath said a leader of a party had recently spoke of Sardar Patel and Jinnah in the same breath as leaders who fought for India’s independence.During a public meeting in Hardoi on October 31, Yadav had put together names of Mahatma Gandhi and other freedom fighters with Jinnah’s.“Sardar Patel, Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Jinnah studied in the same institute and became barristers. They helped (India) get freedom and never backed away from any struggle,” he had said.    During a programme launching online transfer of money in the accounts of parents of 1.80 crore students studying under Basic Shiksha Parishad at his official residence in Lucknow, Adityanath said, “Remember, if education is incomplete, culture is lacking, etiquette is lost, then you cannot expect that person to feel the difference between a national hero and a traitor.”  “If such a situation arises today, then it may also be a reason for the lack of interest of the child’s parents in their education. And, so all this needed to be told in the morning assembly,” he said.“Often this disorientation starts only when the person does not know who is the friend of the country and who is the enemy of the country. When we start weighing the national hero and the anti-national in the same scale, then naturally it raises a question mark on the person’s ability,” the chief minister said.In Auraiya, earlier in the day, Adityanath warned people against political parties which equate Sardar Patel with Jinnah.Referring to his government’s achievements in the field of basic education, he said when his government was formed in 2017, the condition of basic education was very bad, but today it is better and a lot of improvement has taken place.“Today, the attitude about the Basic Education Council has changed. When the School Chalo campaign was launched in July 2017, there were 1 crore 30 lakh children in the council schools, but the number of children increased by 50 lakh in three years. Today, the Basic Education Council’s schools look different, their colours, different furnishings and the uniforms of the children studying are visible,” he said.The chief minister also called for promoting technology and said that transfer of money online into the accounts of parents will help avoid charges of corruption in the education department.At the foundation stone laying of a government medical college in Auraiya and inaugurating other projects, Adityanath said, “A leader of a party had a few days back in a speech attempted to equate Sardar Vallabhbai Patel, the man who symbolised the unity of India, with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who divided the country. The entire state should reject such shameful and condemnable remarks.”“Sardar Patel, who symbolised India’s integrity, united over 563 kingdoms with India (at the time of Independence). We have to understand the mindset of the elements, who are trying to equate Sardar Patel with Jinnah. Sardar Patel united the country, while Jinnah divided the country, both cannot be contemporaries (‘samkaksh’). Sardar Patel was a ‘rashtranayak’ (national hero), but Jinnah was the one to break the unity of India. We have to remain alert of people who are trying to equate them,” he said. Speaking on the law and order front, Adityanath said that the image of the state is changing.  “Earlier, professional criminals and mafia had made the lives of the poor, traders and women miserable. Earlier, there was a race to embrace the mafia elements, and derive political mileage. But, today everybody knows that bulldozers are running over the mafia, and it can also run over those who give refuge to the mafia,” he said.The Uttar Pradesh chief minister added that every person knows that there is zero tolerance towards criminals.

She complained that several others from her village also faced problems in commuting.“Ever since my father passed away in the middle of the first wave of Covid-19, my mother has been taking care of us. We are forced to spend Rs 150 to go to school and college which are 6 km and 18 km away from our village respectively. Several students and other residents of our village are also facing similar difficulties,” Vaishnavi wrote in Telugu to the CJI, seeking his intervention for the resumption of school bus services to her village.Taking note of the difficulties faced by Vaishnavi, her siblings, and other students, CJI Ramana asked the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation to resume bus services to enable the students to reach their school/college on time and to ensure that the Right to Education of the children was honoured.Justice Ramana responded to her letter and informed her that the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation has restarted school bus services to her village. Telangana State Road Transport Corporation Managing Director VC Sajjanar tweeted to thank the CJI for alerting the corporation about the problems faced by students.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cji-intervenes-to-get-bus-service-resumed-after-a-telangana-girl-writes-to-him-334775

06-11-2021||New Delhi||Population control: Fresh plea in SC seeks to make states, UTs as parties||A fresh plea has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking to make states and Union Territories as parties in a PIL that has sought certain steps, including a two-child norm, to control the country’s growing population.The plea filed by lawyer Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay said population explosion is the root cause of many problems, including the excessive burden on natural resources of the country.Upadhyay had filed the PIL challenging a Delhi High Court order that dismissed a plea seeking certain steps, including two-child norm, to control the country’s growing population.The Centre has earlier told the SC that India was unequivocally against forcing family planning on its people and any coercion to have a certain number of children was counterproductive and leads to demographic distortions.In an affidavit filed in the top court, the Centre had told the apex court that the family welfare programme in the country was voluntary in nature, which enabled couples to decide the size of their family and adopt family planning methods best suited to them, according to their choice and without any compulsion.The PIL said the high court failed to appreciate that the right to clean air, drinking water, health, peaceful sleep, shelter, livelihood, and education guaranteed under Articles 21 and 21A of the Constitution could not be secured to all citizens without controlling the population explosion.The plea in the high court had claimed that the population of India had marched ahead of China, as about 20 per cent of Indians did not have Aadhaar and therefore, were not accounted for, and there were also crores of Rohingyas and Bangladeshis living illegally in the country.It claimed that population explosion was also the root cause of corruption, apart from being a contributory factor behind heinous crimes such as rape and domestic violence.It also held population explosion responsible for pollution and the dearth of resources and jobs. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/population-control-fresh-plea-in-sc-seeks-to-make-states-uts-as-parties-334764

The Union government should consider lowering the prices of other things, like gas (LPG cylinder), too to provide relief to the people,” she said during a programme in her constituency.The BJP MP made the request days after the centre slashed the excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 5 and Rs 10, respectively, followed by various BJP-ruled states too lowering the VAT on the two fuels in significant relief to the common man.While participating in her party’s membership drive programme in the Dehli Bazar township of Isauli assembly segment, Gandhi said, “Our efforts will be to win Isauli. Wherever I will go, I will keep making members. There will be 100 programmes in 100 days but it does not matter much until we don’t make up our minds.”   “We have to win the election. We had lakhs of members earlier also, but not a single seat came in the Zila Parishad. If only our BJP office-bearers had voted, we would have won. If the booth president, his family, his relatives had voted, we would have won,” she said referring to the Panchayat elections.

06-11-2021||Lucknow||Jinnah row: Read books again, Akhilesh to detractors||Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday sought to defend his Muhammad Ali Jinnah remark as he hit out at his detractors, asking them to read history books again.On Sunday, Yadav courted controversy when he named Jinnah, along with Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and Mahatma Gandhi, saying they had helped India achieve independence and never shied away from any struggle. He had also said the three leaders studied at the same institute for their barristership.Asked by reporters here on Saturday at the inauguration of the office of ally Janvadi Party Socialist about that row, Yadav shot back, “Why should I say the context? I would say read the books again.”His comments drew a sharp response from Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh, who in a Hindi tweet said, “The love for Jinnah still remains intact. Akhilesh Yadav ji please tell which history books have to be read—the Indian or the Pakistani.” Singh had earlier said that glorifying Jinnah will prove costly to Yadav, as the country still considers Jinnah a “villain”.On Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s comment that he is ready to contest polls from anywhere in the state, the SP chief said he should not do so as he is going out of power.“Now, ‘Baba Mukhyamantri’ should not contest the elections. He is going (out). Now, what has to be done with a person who is going out,” he said.Asked whether he will be contesting the upcoming Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, Yadav said the decision is for the party to make but indicated he is not averse to the idea.“When we are in the election arena, then how can we move back?”      He added that if he answers the question, the next question will be “which constituency?”                Asked the purpose of a recent meeting between Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and RLD’s Jayant Chaudhary at the Lucknow airport, Yadav downplayed the matter saying there was nothing more to it than bumping into someone at a restaurant.The SP leader chose to sidestep the question of any possible poll alliance between his party and Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD).“Why should I tell? You are a friend, but the problem is that through you, the BJP will come to know about it. For this very reason, it has not been disclosed now,” he said.On speculation about SBSP chief O P Rajbhar giving a ticket to mafia don-turned politician Mukhtar Ansari (currently lodged in Banda jail), he said it was not based on facts.“O P Rajbhar is our ally, and as of now you do not have the information about tickets,” Yadav said.When reminded of a recent comment by Adityanath, where he said those who fired upon ‘karsevaks’ will be made to stand in line for ‘karseva’, Yadav said the chief minister should see the temple the previous government (his) built at the chief minister’s official residence.“Next time you meet the chief minister, please request him to show you the most beautiful temple constructed at his residence by the previous government, so that you can have a glimpse also.“If the chief minister has seen a better temple than it, then he should tell all of us. And this temple was made without a map,” he said.Adityanath was apparently referring to an incident from 1990, when the then Mulayam Singh Yadav’s government ordered to open fire against ‘karsevaks’ who had gathered in Ayodhya to march to Babri Masjid.Yadav trained his guns at Adityanath also for present law-and-order situation in the state.“Law and order was never so bad in Uttar Pradesh as it is today. The custodial deaths are highest in Uttar Pradesh. NHRC has sent the maximum notices to Uttar Pradesh. There is no police modernisation,” he said.“And when a chief minister withdraws cases lodged against himself then how can he be expected to improve the police. He likes that the police are doing injustice. Deputy chief minister also withdrew cases lodged against himself,” he added.On Adityanath inaugurating a jail in Etawah, Yadav said the act was just one of the many done in the recent past to appropriate previous government’s achievements and renaming things.He said if the SP is voted to power it will erect a statue of king Prithviraj Chauhan in Kannauj, and another on the Purvanchal “Samajwadi” Expressway. It will also build a museum, he said. “We will work to spread information about Prithviraj Chauhan, and also work to restore his lost pride,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jinnah-row-read-books-again-akhilesh-to-detractors-334755

Most of the patients were senior citizens, and many of them were on ventilator or oxygen, which made the rescue operation more tricky. Amid panic, cries and chaotic scenes, fire brigade personnel broke the window panes and began dousing the flames using water cannons, said a civic fire official whose team was the first to reach the spot after the blaze started around 11 am.About 20 coronavirus patients were undergoing treatment in the ICU, he said.There were 15 patients on ventilator or oxygen. “Saving them was the priority. But due to their critical condition, to remove the oxygen support and bring them out was a tough decision,” he said.“After discussion, we decided to bring them out anyhow and later put them back on oxygen or other support systems,” he added.There was smoke everywhere, and a senior fire brigade official said rather than flames, the smoke might have proven more lethal.Most of those who died were aged between 65 to 83, according to hospital officials.After a devastating blaze at a Covid-19 hospital in Nashik earlier this year, a fire audit had been carried out at this hospital.Shankar Misal, Chief Fire officer of Ahmednagar municipal corporation, said they rushed two fire tankers immediately when the call came.“The fire was not that big, but there was smoke all over the place. The patients who died in the incident possibly suffocated due to the smoke and heat inside the ICU,” he said.After the recent fire audit, the hospital had been asked to install an effective fire-fighting system including a pipeline and sprinkler system, he said.But the work was incomplete due to “want of funds”, though the hospital had fire extinguishers, he said.

06-11-2021||New Delhi||Pentagon report: Congress asks PM Modi to ‘withdraw clean chit’ to China, apologise||The Congress on Saturday sought an apology from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and asked him to “withdraw” his “clean chit” to China that no one has entered into Indian territory while citing a Pentagon report that claims China has entered 4.5 km into Arunachal Pradesh.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said the prime minister must give answers and give deadlines on when there will be status quo ante as on April 2020 on all our borders with China.The demand came after the Congress cited the Pentagon report.Khera said the Chinese intrusion has now been confirmed by the Pentagon to the US Congress in its annual report. The villages across the border are of dual-use that have not only civilian population but act as cantonment for the Chinese army.He said in June 2020, BJP MP in Arunachal Pradesh Tapir Gao had written to the prime minister and the home minister warning them of the transgressions made by China into Indian territory.Khera said the prime minister and the home minister denied the transgressions and it has been 17 months since Modi gave a “clean chit” to China.“That clean chit is a dark chapter in our history because it was used by China across the world. China was emboldened by this clean chit, not just in Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh but also in Uttarakhand, where PLA entered and destroyed our infrastructure,” he told reporters.“This is a very serious issue. The prime minister must withdraw his clean chit given to China and give a deadline to the nation and tell when the status-quo ante of April 2020 be restored across all our borders with China, whether it is Depsang, Gogra Hot Springs, Daulat Beg Oldie or Arunachal Pradesh,” he said.Khera said, “We need answers, we need deadlines, we need dates and we need an apology for misleading the world that China has not entered our territory.” Indian and Chinese troops have been in an eyeball-to-eyeball situation in eastern Ladakh since April 2020 and even entered into a bloody clash in which many soldiers were killed.

But the party did everything for people like you.”  Roy, when contacted, maintained that he would not want to attach much importance to what Ghosh said.BJP state president Sukanta Majumder, however, steered clear of the controversy and underlined that it was the “prerogative of the central leadership” to take a call on the comment made by Tathagata Roy.Roy had told reporters last month that he was “ashamed of some top-level leaders like Vijayvargiya as, ahead of the Bengal assembly polls, they were swayed by the glamour factor while inducting people into the BJP and did not take experience and chances of winning into consideration”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dilip-ghosh-asks-tathagata-roy-to-leave-bjp-if-he-was-upset-with-its-style-of-functioning-334746

It has held a slew of conclaves and conferences of the Brahmin community across the state.However, the party has also kept an eye on other upper castes, including Bhumihar and Vaishya communities.The BSP's social engineering experiment in 2009 Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh had been a raging success helping the party to come to power on its own.There will be four-cornered contests in UP among the ruling BJP and its allies, the Samajwadi Party and its allies, the BSP, and the Congress.The BSP leadership has taken note of the Congress activism, which is also aimed at its core Dalit vote bank. The BJP has also made a dent among Most Backward Castes and some sections of the Scheduled Castes.The Samajwadi Party is also making efforts to corner the Muslim votes, among which the BSP also had influence in the past.BSP insiders say the coming Assembly election in Uttar Pradesh is politically crucial for Mayawati and the legacy of Bahujan movement started by the party founder, late Kanshi Ram.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mayawati-in-favour-of-giving-tickets-in-up-to-around-40-candidates-from-upper-castes-334703
06-11-2021||New Delhi||Higher wind speed after Diwali flushes out pollution in Delhi||The air quality in the national capital improved slightly on Saturday due to higher wind speed, which is expected to flush out pollutants further over the next two days, weather experts said.According to Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) Sameer app, the city's air quality index (AQI) stood at 449 in the “severe” category at 8 am on Saturday. It was 462 on Friday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.Due to rampant bursting of crackers on Diwali on Thursday despite restrictions in place, the air quality in Delhi was the poorest in five years post the festival with rise in incidents of stubble-burning in neighbouring states.The city's AQI slipped to the 'severe' category on Thursday night and continued its upward trend to reach 462 at noon on Friday.The weather office has predicted strong surface winds that will help clear out pollutants in the city's air on Saturday.Experts said the air quality degraded to severe in Delhi-NCR due to unfavourable weather conditions – calm winds, low temperature and low mixing height – and a poisonous cocktail of emissions from firecrackers, stubble-burning and local sources.The Ministry of Earth Sciences' air quality forecast agency, SAFAR, stated that stubble-burning accounted for 36 per cent of Delhi's PM2.5 on Friday, the highest in this season so far.Delhi witnessed a cold morning on Saturday as the minimum temperature in the city was recorded at 14.7 degrees Celsius, normal for this time of the season.“The city will witness a partly cloudy sky with shallow to moderate fog in the morning and strong surface winds during the day,” the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Saturday.The maximum temperature is likely to hover around 28 degrees Celsius, it said. Humidity at 8.30 am was 78 per cent, the IMD said. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/higher-wind-speed-after-diwali-flushes-out-pollution-in-delhi-334699

India airlifted 100 tonnes of nano nitrogen liquid fertiliser on Diwali after the devastation of Sri Lanka’s crop allegedly due to harmful bacteria caused by China-supplied bio-fertilisers.The Sri Lankan High Commissioner here met Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this week as Colombo also seeks to avert a financial crisis by seeking a $500 million loan.While Indian Air Force planes delivered fertilisers on Diwali in response to an SOS from Sri Lanka, the Union Finance and External Affairs Ministries are engaged in framing a financial relief package that intersects with New Delhi’s interests.Sri Lanka’s economic crisis began when it had decided in April to completely shift to organic fertilisers, some of it domestic, instead of depending entirely on imported chemical fertilisers in order to save $400 million. Lanka President Gotabaya Rajapkasa now claims that the problem was caused by Chinese bio-fertilisers, which contained bacteria that destroyed the crop. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/strain-in-lanka-china-ties-india-steps-in-delivers-nano-fertiliser-334484

They said as per the report the insurgent leaders involved in the syndicate have been using the Indo-Bangladesh border in their recent trade.With Assam being the focal point of drug peddlers to push narcotics, sources say the report suggests that a number of China and Pakistan-based agencies too are allegedly part of the syndicate. Incidentally, several kilometres of the Indo-Myanmar border are still open and international drug dealers based in Myanmar take advantage of this area to sneak narcotics into India, officials in the government said.“Through this open border, drugs worth several hundred crores are smuggled on a regular basis from Myanmar, and from there NSCN (IM) pushes the trade across Assam and India,” a senior security official said, adding that the insurgent group receives huge funds from other countries for spreading the drug menace in India.Many drug lords based in Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata have reportedly invested huge funds in the operations through the “Golden Triangle”.“Golden Triangle” represents the region coinciding with Myanmar, Laos and Thailand, known as one of the oldest and most notorious routes for narcotics supply to Europe and other parts of the world.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/n-e-insurgents-helping-peddlers-spread-narco-terrorism-intel-334485

It will define how future wars are fought as battle field awareness, quantum computing and speed of data collection and dissemination will be the major factors.The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has now formed a technology innovation group on 6G. Telecom Secretary K Rajaraman heads the group tasked with creating a roadmap for research and development (R&D) and also an action plan for the path-breaking technology.The Tribune was among the first publications in India to point to the need for India to adopt 6G technology in an opinion piece written by founder trustee of the Pune International Centre Lt Gen SS Mehta (retd) in July 2020.“6G is a great step, it’s a sign that we want to lead in telecom — the oil of tomorrow. Defence services in India have the wherewithal and capacities to seed, nurture and field pilot projects for 6G, and then integrate them in their doctrines,” said General Mehta while speaking to The Tribune today.India’s move comes at a time when the US House Committee on Energy and Commerce passed a Bill that requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish a “6G Task Force” to investigate how to design and deploy 6G technologies.In April, a US and Japan joint statement spoke of a $4.5 billion effort to develop 6G.In China, its new five-year plan adopted at the National People’s Congress in March included the development of 6G. In the past, India has followed other “technology leaders” when technologies changed in wireless communication from 2G to 3G and then 4G.General Mehta, former Western Army Commander, referred to what PM Narendra Modi said during a visit to the Line of Control (LoC) in J&K. “The PM has said the right thing — warfare will change with technology,” said General Mehta.“Today, information domination, technology and hybrid tactics have to be in tandem and in coordination... Future wars will be standoff battles with a strategy,” Modi had said. “From the Himalayas to the Indo-Pacific, 6G will enable a secure connectivity matrix befitting our size. A strategic asset for our national security,” General Mehta said.A national 6G mission places India in the league of high-tech pioneers and to occupy a place at the global high-table, he added. The DoT innovation group on 6G has 22-members, including those from academia, industry and government.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-changes-gear-to-be-in-line-with-global-powers-on-6g-tech-334479

Media reports from Mumbai quoted him saying that "the move is about coordination between NCB teams of Mumbai and Delhi".Sources in the NCB said a Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been formed to probe these transferred cases. Apart from the Aryan Khan case, the one involving Bollywood actor Armaan Kohli, who was arrested by the NCB on August 28 after he was allegedly found in possession of 1.3 gm of cocaine, has also been transferred to the SIT.Now, the probe will be handled by Senior IPS officer Sanjay Singh, who is the Deputy Director-General (Operations), sources said, adding that his team of investigators is likely to reach Mumbai on Saturday to take over the probe.The NCB had arrested actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan and at least 19 others in the drugs on cruise case on the intervening night of October 2-3.Maharashtra Minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik has been making a series of allegations against Wankhede, from forging documents to get a government job to lying about his religion to carrying out “bogus” drug raids. The IRS officer has so far denied all these allegations.The NCB has ordered a vigilance inquiry into allegations made by a witness in the case of an extortion bid of Rs 25 crore by some agency officials, including Wankhede, and others for letting Khan off the case. The departmental vigilance probe is being conducted by NCB Deputy Director-General (northern region) Gyaneshwar Singh.Stepping up his attack on Wankhede, Malik had also accused him of extorting crores and wearing “expensive” clothes beyond the reach of an honest and upright officer. Malik claimed the officer wore a trouser worth Rs 1 lakh, a shirt costing over Rs 70,000 and watches worth Rs 25 lakh to 50 lakh.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sameer-wankhede-removed-from-aryan-khan-drugs-case-probe-334329

However, aided by weather conditions and anthropogenic activities, including burning of stubble with emissions from farm fires peaking at “36 per cent”, most cities across the Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP) are recording air pollution levels in ‘very poor’ and ‘hazardous’ categoriesAccording to data compiled by ‘Climate Trends’, delayed monsoon withdrawal and the La Nina factor have combined to impact meteorological conditions favourable for poor air quality across the Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP), and result in a possible “record-breaking cold” in December and January.As La Nina makes an appearance for the second time in a row, meteorologists say many parts of North can expect to see prolonged spells of pollution in coming months. A lower number of crop residue-burning incidents and widespread rain and snow in October kept pollution under check until recently, but the situation is changing.While changing weather pattern have the imprint of anthropogenic activities, experts warn that the La Nina factor is all “set to bring record-breaking low temperatures during December and January”.“Haryana has already surpassed the fire counts registered last year for crop residue burning, followed by Uttar Pradesh which is catching up fast with the count in 2020.  Seeing the trend in other states, Punjab is expected to pick up pace in the coming days as well”, they say“This winter chill is likely to aggravate air pollution across IGP, which will be further aggravated by seasonal spikes like the delayed peak of stubble-burning season due to extended stay of Monsoon 2021, and firecrackers on Diwali”, they add.“There is a large probability of La Nina that may result in extreme cold from December 2021-February 2022. The factor is expected to peak during the said period. Although there is no rule book, with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) getting colder than earlier estimates, the confidence in this forecast is increasing. However, winter forecast is affected by many other factors,” says G P Sharma, President Meteorology and Climate Change, Skymet Weather.In those terms, next two weeks will be crucial as stubble-burning may peak. Warning people to exercise extra caution, they say that “with dipping temperatures, the threat of a vicious smog circle looms large for north-western plains”"With temperature dropping and meteorological factors like wind speed slowing down, wind direction, haze setting in  pollution levels are again in ‘very poor’ and ‘hazardous’ categories in most cities across the IGP"Delhi’s post-Diwali air quality poorest in 5 years: CPCB dataMeanwhile, Delhi recorded its poorest post-Diwali air quality in five years on Friday with a deadly cocktail of noxious fumes from firecrackers and stubble burning pushing the 24-average AQI to 462, according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).The 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) the day after Diwali was 435 last year, 368 in 2019; 390 in 2018; 403 in 2017 and 445 in 2016.

The huge rock had rolled down the mountains during the June 2013 deluge and stopped right behind the temple, and is credited for protecting it from the disaster.Work on the Shankaracharya statue, weighing around 35 tonnes, had begun in 2019. Its unveiling was streamed live at 12 jyotirlingas, four mutts or monasteries established by the eighth-century seer, his birthplace and a number of prominent temples across the country.The prime minister sat in meditation at the foot of the statue for a while before taking a walk around Kedarpuri to review the reconstruction work carried out over the last few years.Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami and Governor Lt Gen Gurmit Singh (retd) were also in Kedarnath along with the PM, whose visit came a day ahead of the Himalayan temple's closure for winter on Saturday.Modi was received at the Dehradun airport in the morning by the governor and the chief minister and his cabinet colleagues Subodh Uniyal and Ganesh Joshi, besides Assembly Speaker Premchand Aggarwal.Kedarpuri reconstruction is considered the prime minister's dream project whose progress is reviewed personally by him at regular intervals.
