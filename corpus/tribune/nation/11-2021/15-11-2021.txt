In addition, travellers from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will be able to enter Singapore from December 6, in a further expansion of the VTL scheme.Travellers under the VTLs are not subject to stay-home notice on arrival. Instead, they will be required to produce a negative pre-departure test taken within two days prior to departure and undergo an on-arrival PCR test, it said.Addressing a Covid-19 multi-ministry task force press conference on Monday, Transport Minister S Iswaran said Singapore and India have been discussing the mutual recognition of vaccination certificates.Since November 12, India has started recognising vaccination certificates issued by Singapore.“This means that fully vaccinated travellers from Singapore entering India will no longer need to undergo post-arrival tests home quarantine, they will just need to self monitor for 14 days upon arrival,” Iswaran said.“Our discussions with India are progressing well. And we aim to resume two daily VTL flights each to Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai by Nov 29. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will provide more details once finalised,” the CNA report quoted Iswaran as saying.The health ministry has also updated its public health assessment and will upgrade India to Category 2 from November 19. The Category 2 classification means that a country either has similar or lower Covid-19 incidence rates than Singapore and other VTL countries.“We are in discussions on the resumption of scheduled commercial passenger services (with India). As today the only flights from Singapore allowed to carry passengers to India are government charter relief flights under the Vande Bharat mission,” Iswaran said.“Following discussions between PMs @NarendraModi and @LeeHsienLoong, will be launching a Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) for fully-vac travellers frm w valid entry approvals - starting 29 Nov - pending resumption of commercial passenger. More on VTL (sic),” Singapore’s mission in India said on Twitter.Applications for short-term visitors and long-term pass holders will start on November 22 for travellers from India and Indonesia, while travellers from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and UAE will be able to apply from November 29.Returning Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who are fully vaccinated will not need to apply if they are travelling via the VTL.In a press release, the CAAS said the step-by-step extension of the VTL allows it to “revive air travel safely without compromising public health” and will also help to “reclaim and rebuild” Singapore’s status as an international aviation hub with global connectivity.In 2019, India accounted for about 7 per cent of passenger arrivals at the Changi Airport here.

15-11-2021||New Delhi||Govt may introduce Bill on crypto currencies in Parliament’s winter session||The government is likely to introduce a bill on crypto currencies during the winter session of Parliament beginning November 29, amid concerns over such currencies being allegedly used for luring investors with misleading claims and for funding terror activities, sources said on Monday.Currently, there are no particular regulations or any ban on use of crypto currencies in the country. Against this backdrop, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Saturday, held a meeting on the crypto currencies with senior officials and indications are that strong regulatory steps could be taken to deal with the issue.The sources said the proposed bill would focus on investor protection as crypto currencies come under a complex asset class category.Once cleared by the Union Cabinet, the government plans to introduce the bill on crypto currencies in the first week of the winter session.In August, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said she was awaiting an approval from the Cabinet on the crypto currency bill.Both the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have raised concerns about crypto currencies in recent months.The three-week long winter session is scheduled to be held from November 29 to December 23.On Monday, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance discussed the pros and cons of crypto finance with various stakeholders, and several members were in favour of regulating crypto currency exchanges rather than an outright ban on such currencies, according to sources.At the meeting convened by the prime minister on Saturday, it was strongly felt that attempts to mislead the youth through over-promising and non-transparent advertising of crypto currencies should be stopped, sources had said.An inter-ministerial panel on crypto currency under the Chairmanship of Secretary (Economic Affairs) had recommended that all currencies except those issued by the state should be banned.Earlier, RBI had said that unregulated growth of crypto currencies poses threat to the macroeconomic and financial stability of the country.Last week, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das reiterated his views against allowing crypto currencies saying they are a serious threat to any financial system since they are unregulated by central banks.The central bank has also plans to introduce an official digital currency.On March 4, 2020, Supreme Court set aside an RBI circular of April 6, 2018, prohibiting banks and entities regulated by it from providing services in relation to virtual currencies.

15-11-2021||Itanagar||Three militants shot dead by security forces in Arunachal, two abductees rescued||Two days after five Assam Rifles personnel, including a colonel-rank officer, were killed in an ambush in Manipur, soldiers of the paramilitary force along with the local police on Monday shot dead three militants of the NSCN(K)’s Yung Aung faction in Arunachal Pradesh’s Longding district,  senior officials said.Two locals, who were abducted by the militants, were rescued during the operation, the deputy commissioner of Longding, Bani Lego, told PTI.A group of five to six armed rebels of the banned outfit had on November 14 kidnapped Ranwang Lowang, the chief of Lahu village in Tirap district, along with former anchal samiti member Sunwang Hakun, and sought to extort Rs 7 lakh from locals.Lego said the rebels were taking the abductees to Myanmar, bordering the Longding district, when the operation was launched by security forces in Khogla village and the duo rescued.According to Superintendent of Police V H Meena, the Assam Rifles (AR) and the Longding police, on learning about the abductions, launched a joint raid in various places, including Khogla village in Wakka circle of the district, around 8 am, and intercepted members of the insurgent group, asking them to surrender.“The insurgents, however, opened fire on the security personnel, injuring one jawan. The soldiers and police personnel then retaliated, killing three members of the NSCN(K) Yung Aung faction on spot,” the SP explained.Three automatic assault rifles and other ammunition were recovered during the raid, Meena said, further stating that a search for the insurgents who fled during the operation is underway.“This is one of the biggest achievements by security forces in the recent times. The Assam Rifles and the local police have successfully foiled an abduction plan by the banned outfit, bring much-needed relief to the villagers,” the SP added.National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang) and all outfits associated with it have been banned by the Union government under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.

15-11-2021||Beijing||China defends joining with India on coal ‘phase down’ instead of ‘phase out’ at COP26||China on Monday asked developed countries to stop using the coal first and provide financial aid to developing countries to adopt green technologies as it defended its move to join hands with India in calling for “phase down” instead of “phase out” of coal in the final text of the COP26 conference declaration.Negotiators from nearly 200 countries accepted a new climate agreement after the COP26 summit in Glasgow concluded on Saturday with a deal, which recognises India’s intervention for the world to “phase down” rather than “phase out” fossil fuels.“Green and low-carbon transition is the overwhelming trend that all countries should work together for. China attaches high importance to energy transition,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here.He was responding to a question on COP26 Chairman Alok Sharma’s reported comments that China and India need to explain to developing nations why they watered down the language on efforts to phase out coal at the conference and rejected calls for “phasing out” coal firepower instead opted to “phasing down”.Zhao said: “To optimise energy structure and reduce the proportion of coal consumption is an incremental process. The varying national conditions, development stage and resources endowment of different countries should be respected”.“In many developing countries, not everyone has access to electricity and energy supply is not adequate. Before asking all countries to stop using coal, consideration should be given to the energy shortfall in these countries to ensure their energy security,” Zhao said.“We encourage developed countries to take the lead in stopping the use of coal while providing ample funding, technological and capacity-building support for developing countries’ energy transition. We need concrete actions more than slogans,” he said.Chinese official media has criticised the Western media for targeting China and India for pressing “phase down” use of coal power instead of “phase out” in the final text adopted by 197 countries at the COP26 conference which concluded last week.Climate scientists hailed the “unprecedented determination of tackling global warming” demonstrated by summit participants, especially developing countries including China and India, as not only underscoring the urgency of the climate issue but also a stimulus for developed countries to match their promises with actions, state-run Global Times reported on Monday.All participants of COP26, especially developing countries, have demonstrated unprecedented ambition and determination to tackle climate change, Pan Jiahua, director of the Institute for Urban and Environmental Studies, told the Global Times.He praised India for its pledge to target net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2070.“It’s almost a mission impossible for India, which relies on coal for 75 per cent of its electricity,” said Pan, praising India for showing “valuable determination”.In his reply, Zhao said China has made tremendous efforts in controlling coal consumption and coal-fired projects and played an important role in building international consensus on relevant issues.He said that since the beginning of this year President Xi Jinping has announced a host of policy measures China has adopted, including strictly controlling coal-fired power generation projects, to strictly limit the increase in coal consumption over the 14th Five-Year Plan period and phase it down in the 15th Five-Year Plan period, to vigorously support developing countries’ green and low-carbon energy development, and to stop building new coal-fired power projects abroad”.“The international community has spoken highly of this. The recently-released China-US Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s reiterated relevant content,” he said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-defends-joining-with-india-on-coal-phase-down-instead-of-phase-out-at-cop26-338431
15-11-2021||---||Now, get audited, certified veg meals on board trains to religious sites||New Delhi, November 15The IRCTC on Monday tied up with the Sattvik Council of India to get certified in the process of cooking, transportation and storage of vegetarian food specially on board trains to religious sites with the Railways’ catering arm inviting a third party audit of its base kitchens where such food is cooked to ensure a vegetarian environment.Officials said the move was to ensure pure vegetarian food is not only served to those passengers who want it, but also to ensure that the process of preparing the meals is “sattvik”.“Sattvik certification is simply a process certification of vegetarian meal preparation, as per laid down standards indicated by SCI under third party audit of Bureau Veritas. There were passengers who demanded vegetarian meals prepared in a vegetarian environment which includes area, equipment etc. It is expected to help passengers gain confidence in the vegetarian meals for its preparation and service,” said IRCTC spokesperson Anand Jha.“This essentially does not mean that there is any restriction in preparation and service of non-veg meal. This certification is only a step ahead towards certification of the existing standards where vegetarian food is prepared and served,” Jha added.A press statement issued by the SCI said the NGO launched the sattvik certification scheme and the world’s first and one of its kind Passenger-Locomotive Continuous Audit Module (PL-CAM) with the Railways’ catering arm at the IRCTC executive lounge at the New Delhi Railway Station.It also said that starting with the Vande Bharat Express which runs from Delhi to Katra and eventually 18 others, the certification is mainly targeted for the trains travelling to religious destinations.“The certification ensures a truly vegetarian, and by extension, a vegan experience by not just ensuring the food is pure vegetarian, but by also making sure that the utensils and any utility that enters the kitchen has been washed with products that have been certified vegetarian,” it said.“Often, ‘veg’ food is not truly vegetarian due to multiple factors, so to ensure the purity of the food, there will be no non-veg prepared alongside in the kitchen, which means there will be no mix-ups,” it added.Furthermore, in order to ensure that vegetarians are comfortable and to promote their cause, the IRCTC and the SCI have jointly developed a handbook (operations manual) on all the vegetarian destinations and kitchens in association with its Global Audit Partner – Bureau Veritas.The sattvik certification is not just limited to trains and base kitchens, but also to IRCTC executive lounges, budget hotels, food plazas, travel and tour packages, Rail Neer plants and so on in order to ensure “vegetarian friendly travel”.“Vegetarians/vegans increasingly represent an influential consumer segment in tourism and is the fastest growing in the global travel industry. Vegetarian food and environment is what they look for while travelling. Therefore, it is essential to develop certified vegetarian food in restaurants,” said Abhishek Biswas, Founder of SCI.

On the day of the incident, a mob had allegedly caused damage to public and private properties in which the petitioner’s involvement is not established”, he said.He said that the petitioner is a simple man from a weaver community who has helped many people during the nationwide lockdown with food and medical help.The Bench said that it is issuing notice on the plea which has challenged the Allahabad High Court order of May 10. In his plea, Sarfraz said that a nationwide protest against the new Citizenship Amendment Act passed on December 11, 2019, granting citizenship to minorities excluding Muslims, facing persecution from neighbhouring countries, was launched on December 16, 2019.He said that the peaceful protest was organised as a part of a national protest against the new law in Mau city in which nearly a thousand people participated.“The petitioner was issued a notice by the Additional District Magistrate, Mau on February 4, 2020…stating that on December 16, 2019, an unlawful assembly caused damaged to property of Nagar Palika, police department and other public and private property”, the petition said adding that it was alleged that petitioner was prima facie responsible for the damages to the property.The plea said that the petitioner in his reply to the notice contended that he has neither participated in any illegal assembly nor has he caused any damage to the public or private property or supported or encouraged any movement or procession.“The petitioner has never participated in any procession or illegal assembly on the alleged date of occurrence for which the several FIRs have been lodged against the petitioner. Additionally, the CCTV camera that is installed in the police station Dakshin Tola, district Mau does not contain any footage of the petitioner at the time of the alleged offence,” it said.The plea said that the Additional District Magistrate on February 22, passed an ex-parte order on the report of SHO, Dakshin Tola for the recovery of damages caused during the mob that broke out on December 16, 2019. Sarfraz sought an ex-parte stay of the High Court order saying that the judge of the High Court without applying his mind and the changed circumstances imposed ten per cent of the estimated amount as damages without going to the merits of the case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anti-caa-protest-sc-agrees-to-hear-plea-of-alleged-protester-against-hc-order-on-damages-338427
15-11-2021||Bhopal||Ignored by Congress, tribals now partners in India’s development: PM Modi||Reaching out to tribals, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday lauded their contribution to Indian culture through the ages and said Lord Ram drew inspiration from them during his exile as he slammed the Congress for “neglecting” adivasis during its previous rules.Tribals were now partners in the country’s development and benefitting from various welfare schemes launched by the BJP-led government, he said.The PM also announced that henceforth Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas, the birth anniversary of revered tribal icon Birsa Munda, will be celebrated like Gandhi Jayanti, Sardar Patel Jayanti and Ambedkar Jayanti.“When we talk about tribesmen’s contribution some people get worried. They don’t believe in the immense contribution of tribals to Indian culture. Their contribution had not been explained to the countrymen. People were kept in the dark,” Modi said, addressing a mega tribal meet organised on Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas here.“Those who ran governments in the past did not give priority to them. The country’s 10 per cent (tribal) population was neglected,” he said, attacking the Congress without naming the party.“Tribals were not given their dues by the earlier governments and were deprived of basic facilities,” he said.Drawing on history and referring to the Ramayana period, the PM said Lord Ram drew inspiration from life of tribals when he was in exile and stayed inside forests.“The time spent with tribals made a huge impact and turned a prince into the most perfect man. Lord Ram drew inspiration from every aspect of forest dwellers’ life,” Modi said.Development is now taking place in 100 aspirational districts which remained backward during the earlier (Congress) regimes, Modi said.Modi said India is celebrating the first Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas after Independence, adding the tribals’ art and culture, and their contribution to the freedom struggle and nation-building is being remembered with pride.The country cannot forget the bravery of Gond queen Durgawati or the sacrifice of Rani Kamlapati, he said.“The previous regimes have committed a crime by ignoring the tribal icons and their contribution. The contribution of the tribal society was either not told to the country and even if told, very limited information was given,” Modi said.The PM said he was moved when the recipients of Padma Shri working for tribals came barefoot to the award ceremony in New Delhi.“The indigenous community never lacked talents, but unfortunately the previous governments did not give them opportunity,” he said.Modi said now the tribals, along with the rest of India, were reaping the benefits of different welfare schemes.They are partners in the country’s development and their welfare is a top priority for the government, he said.The Prime Minister praised the tribals for their large-scale participation in the vaccination drive against COVID-19 and asked others to learn for them.Modi lauded Birsa Munda, Rani Kamalapati and other tribal heroes.The Prime Minister recalled how people of the Bhil tribe helped Rajput king Maharana Pratap.The struggle of Veer Maharana Pratap cannot be imagined without the brave Bhil tribe who fought shoulder to shoulder and made sacrifices, Modi said.“We owe a lot to the tribal people,” he added.He said without the participation of adivasis, India’s development was not possible and maintained forest laws have been tweaked to benefit tribals.The PM said products made by people were being marketed online to make them economically strong.“These products were being sold in the international market now,” he said and listed the schemes being run for the tribal uplift.On the occasion, Modi launched multiple initiatives for the welfare of the janjatiya community, including the ‘Ration Aapke Gram’ scheme in Madhya Pradesh.The scheme is aimed at delivering the monthly quota of PDS ration to beneficiaries from janjatiya community in their own villages every month, so that they don’t have to travel to the Fair Price Shop to collect their ration.Modi also handed over genetic counselling cards to beneficiaries, marking the launch of the Madhya Pradesh Sickle Cell (Hemoglobinopathy) Mission.The Mission has been developed to screen and manage patients suffering from sickle cell anaemia, thalassemia and other hemoglobinopathies and to increase public awareness about these diseases, whose impact is seen to be more profound on the janjatiya community of Madhya Pradesh.The PM also laid the foundation stone of 50 Eklavya Model Residential Schools across various states and UTs, including Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Tripura and Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu.At the event, Modi paid rich tributes to noted historian and Padma Vibhushan awardee Balwant Moreshwar Purandare, popularly known as Babasaheb Purandare, who died at a Pune hospital on Monday after a brief illness.“Historians of the country will remember Babasaheb Purandare for long. He has left us...Babasaheb’s contribution of delivering the history of Chhatrapati Shivraji to commoners was priceless. The Madhya Pradesh government had given him the Kalidas Samman,” Modi said.

15-11-2021||New Delhi||Opposition steps up attack on CBI-ED ordinances, vows to corner government in Parliament||Opposition parties on Monday vowed to counter the government’s move of extending the tenures to the CBI and ED chiefs in Parliament, alleging it was bypassing the House, distorting the Constitution, and resorting to “Ordinance Raj” to “misuse” the agencies.Introducing the ordinances just two weeks ahead of the Parliament session is an attempt at sabotaging and skirting the institution of Parliament, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi alleged.The opposition parties also accused the government of trying to bypass the Supreme Court’s direction that any extension of tenure has to be for a short period and “only in rare and exceptional circumstances” to facilitate an ongoing investigation.Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’ Brien said the opposition parties will do all it takes to stop India from “turning into an elected autocracy”.The party has given two notices in Rajya Sabha for statutory resolutions opposing the two ordinances promulgated on Sunday which state that after the fixed two-year term of an Enforcement Directorate (ED) or Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) chief ends, the Union government may extend the tenure by a year for three consecutive years.The BJP government was sidestepping Parliament and violating the Supreme Court’s orders only to “misuse” the investigative agencies for protecting itself and its friends while targeting the opposition, Singhvi alleged at a press conference.Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, however, hit back at the Congress for its criticism, saying those who do such “negative and destructive politics” only harm themselves.The Left parties demanded that the ordinances be rescinded immediately.“The Polit Bureau of the CPI (M) denounces the promulgation of two ordinances allowing the central government to extend the tenures of the directors of CBI and ED from two to five years.”“It is reprehensible that these ordinances have been promulgated on the eve of the winter session of parliament that is to commence from November 29. The BJP’s regular resort to the route of ‘ordinance raj’ is anti-democratic,” the CPIM said on Monday.The party further alleged that both the CBI and ED have been “functioning as the political arm of the ruling party to advance its agenda”. “Leaders of opposition parties are regularly targeted. This step is meant to further subvert the autonomy of these agencies and to make the key officers more pliable.“The Polit Bureau of the CPI (M) demands that these ordinances be rescinded. CPI (M) MPs will oppose the move to convert these ordinances into law in parliament,” it said in a statement.The CPI too said that it was contemplating moving statutory resolutions against the ordinances.“On a polluted Sunday, the government has embarked on ordinance route to protect their caged parrots. Disapproval motion will be moved in Parliament against this ordinance raj. Distorting constitution Modi is in a hurry to make India a banana republic,” CPI MP B Viswam tweeted.  — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/opposition-steps-up-attack-on-cbi-ed-ordinances-vows-to-corner-government-in-parliament-338410

If the issue is same, it will be heard together.”The top court granted liberty to the petitioners to serve an advance copy of the plea to the respondents, including the standing counsel for the CBSE.The bench also heard a separate petition which has raised the issue related to the results in improvement examination conducted by the CBSE.The court asked the counsel appearing for the petitioners to serve the advance copy of the plea to the standing counsel for the CBSE as well as the central agency and posted the matter for hearing on November 22.The plea, seeking a hybrid option in the ensuing board examination, has claimed that the entire exercise of the boards in conducting the term one or semester one examinations in offline mode only is “patently unreasonable”.As per the date sheet announced by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), the term one board exams would commence from November 16.Semester one of the board examination of the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) would commence from November 22.The plea, filed through advocate Sumanth Nookala, said that the ensuing exams be conducted in hybrid mode with an option to choose between offline and online examinations.“Consent assumes significance as exams directly relate to the mental health of the petitioners requiring a conducive and voluntary atmosphere to ensure a fair assessment. It is common knowledge that the third wave of Covid pandemic is predicted,” it said.The petition claimed that the proposed current system of offline examination is “fraught with bad planning and lack of application of mind” which will further adversely prejudice the students.“Even if the respondents (boards and others) wanted to conduct the examinations on the said dates, it had sufficient time and resources to plan it carefully and consider the concerns raised in the present petition,” it said.

15-11-2021||New Delhi||Australia Prime Minister condemns desecration of Gandhi statue unveiled by him a day back||An attempt was made to desecrate the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Melbourne a day after it was unveiled by the Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison.Morrison said in a statement on Sunday that he was “devastated to hear that the statue of Mahatma Gandhi at the Australia Indian Community Centre in Rowville, Victoria has been vandalised after it was unveiled on Friday”.The Australian PM was trenchant in his criticism. “Australia is the most successful multicultural and immigration nation in the world and attacks on cultural monuments will not be tolerated. It is disgraceful and extremely disappointing to see this level of disrespect. Whoever is responsible for this has shown great disrespect to the Australian-Indian community and should be ashamed,” he told the local South Asia Times.This is the first statue of Gandhi in Victoria and was donated by the Government of India.India’s Consulate General in Melbourne Raj Kumar has also condemned the act. “When I saw the pictures I was really shocked. I could not believe this could happen here in Australia. Whoever has done this is not of sound mind,’’ he told SA Times.Condemning the vandalisation, Deepak Joshi of The Humanist Project in Australia wanted the incident thoroughly investigated and the culprits brought to justice. The Federation of Indian Associations of Victoria (FIAV), Australia South Asia Society (ASAS), and many other organisations have also condemned the vandalisation. About three lakh Indians live in Victoria.“The vandalised statue was inspected by the local police on Saturday evening but they couldn’t get any fingerprints because it was heavily raining throughout the day,” it quoted the Chairperson of Australian Indian Community Charitable Trust Vasan Srinivasan as saying.The police said they would be inspecting the CCTV footage in the area but Neeraj Nanda, Editor of SA Times, said the statue is too far from the building to be covered by their CCTV.“They were trying to cut the head off by grinding around it,” said Srinivasan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/australia-prime-minister-condemns-desecration-of-gandhi-statue-unveiled-by-him-a-day-back-338398

Three persons were arrested in this connection," the DGP said.The consignment was sent by one Zahid Bashir Baloch, a resident of Pakistan who is a wanted absconder in the earlier seizure of 227 kg heroin by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) in 2019, he said.It was intended to be transported to an African country, the senior police official said.The heroin was delivered to the apprehended accused, identified as Mukhtar Hussein and Samsuddin Hussainmiyan Saiyyed, at the sea in the last week of October at the given coordinates shared by Baloch with Mukhtar Hussein's brother Isa Rav, he said.The conspiracy for the contraband delivery was hatched in the United Arab Emirates, like in most cases in the past, the official said.The drug consignment was to be handed over to the Indian smugglers to be transported to an African country, in accordance with the normal modus operandi of narcotic smugglers from Pakistan and Iran to use Indian counterparts for transporting drugs to the conduit, he said."In the present case, the accused persons, apprehended by the Gujarat ATS, decided to divert the consignment, intended for Africa, to India and misappropriate it and sell it to various buyers," he said.The under-construction house from where the drug consignment was seized belonged to a third accused person, identified as Gulam Hussein Umar Bhagad, he said."Smugglers opt for the Indian route because it is cheap, short distance, and they can easily hide their illegal activities because detection is not easy among around 25,000 fishing boats plying in the area," he said.Bhatia said the Gujarat coast is being used as a transit point to transport drugs being sent along the Indo-Pak international boundary line by Pakistani and Iranian heroin smugglers."However, Gujarat Police have been successful in neutralising all such attempts and all the consignments sent by these cartels have been successfully seized and the accused persons arrested," he said.Minister of State for Home Harsh Sanghavi lauded Gujarat Police for their efforts to tackle the drug menace."Another achievement of Gujarat Police. Gujarat Police is leading from the front to eliminate the drugs. Gujarat ATS has nabbed around 120 kilo drugs," he tweeted in the morning.

However, such a step would be meaningful if it is implemented across the NCR areas in neighbouring states. Given Delhi's compact size, a lockdown would have limited impact on the air quality regime."This issue would need to be addressed at the level of airshed involving NCR areas. In view of the above, we are ready to consider this step if the same is mandated for the entire NCR areas by the Government of India or by the Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and adjoining areas," an affidavit filed by the Delhi government said.The affidavit was submitted in response to a plea filed by environmental activist Aditya Dubey and law student Aman Banka, who sought directions to provide stubble-removing machines to small and marginal farmers for free.Terming the rise in air pollution in Delhi-NCR an "emergency" situation, the apex court on Saturday suggested clamping a lockdown in the national capital as it asked the Centre and the Delhi government to take immediate measures to improve the air quality.The court had said the situation of pollution is so bad that people are wearing masks inside their houses.It had said there are other reasons for pollution such as vehicular emissions, firecrackers and dust, and singling out stubble burning is not the solution.The apex court had also expressed concern that schools in the city had opened and children were being exposed to severe pollution conditions.

15-11-2021||Vibha Sharma||World leaders agree to ‘phase down’ instead of ‘phase out’ coal||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 14International climate conference COP26 concluded late Saturday with a “compromised” Glasgow Climate Pact calling for “phase down” of coal and asking countries to strengthen their 2030 climate action plans, or NDCs (nationally-determined contributions), by next year .India and China ensured the last-minute change from “phase out” of unabated coal power in the draft cover to “phase down” in the final text, even as countries like Switzerland and EU objected and ultimately conceded.The initial language had called on parties to accelerate phase out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies Despite the dilution, the inclusion of language on reduction of coal power is being seen as an important movement forward.Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav, who disagreed with the language on fossil fuel, said, “Developing countries are entitled to use fossil fuels. Instead of agreeing to phase out, he read out the new version of the paragraph that used the phrase phase down”.In a statement later, he called the climate summit a “success” from India’s standpoint, terming as “troublesome” the “lack of commitment on climate finance” by developed nations.The conference agreed to further boost 2030 climate targets by next year and double adaptation finance by 2025, “keeping alive” the 1.5 °C goal, but it failed to deliver on loss and damage facility for the most vulnerable and paying the cost of emissions and historic responsibility of climate change created by developed countries.The final text acknowledges the needs of developing countries for climate finance and asked developed countries to double the collective share of adaptation finance within the $100 billion annual target for 2021-2025 and to reach the $100 billion goal as soon as possible.In other words, developed countries slipped back to a commitment of $100 billion a year, in place since 2009 and as yet undelivered.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the outcome a “compromise” and urged action towards keeping global temperature rise within 1.5 °C.UK COP26 President Alok Sharma said he was “deeply sorry” for the way the process had unfolded. Later he told mediapersons that “China and India will have to explain themselves to the most climate vulnerable countries in the world”.To boost 2030 targetThe Glasgow conference agreed to further boost 2030 climate targets by next year and double adaptation finance by 2025Glasgow Summit a successThe summit proved to be a success from India’s standpoint because we articulated and put across the concerns and ideas of the developing world quite succinctly and unequivocally.

15-11-2021||Aditi Tandon||Tenure of CBI, ED heads increased up to 5 years||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 14The government today issued two ordinances to increase the tenure of CBI and Enforcement Directorate chiefs from two years to up to five years.The ordinances, signed by President Ram Nath Kovind, say the CBI and ED directors can be granted extension every year up to five years after they complete their initial years of appointment (two years). The Delhi Special Police Establishment Amendment Ordinance, 2021, amends Section 4B of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act to insert the following portion: “Provided that the period for which the (CBI) Director holds the office on his initial appointment may, in public interest, on the recommendation of the committee under subsection 1 of Section 4A, for reasons to be recorded in writing, be extended up to one year at a time. Provided that no suchextension shall be granted after the completion of a period of five years in total.”The Central Vigilance Commission Amendment Ordinance, 2021, similarly inserts a provision in Section 25 of the original Act making it possible to extend the tenure of the ED Director up to five years by way of annual extensions after they complete two years of service.The ordinances read further: “Whereas Parliament is not in session and the President is satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary for him to take immediate action.”The ordinances come ahead of ED Director Sanjay Kumar Mishra’s retirement on November 17.Earlier, NGO Common Cause had moved the SC against the government’s November 2020 order extending Mishra’s tenure by a year.On September 8, the SC had upheld the Centre’s decision to extend the tenure of ED Director, but said he can’t be given any further extension. “We do not intend to interfere with the extension of tenure of the second respondent (Mishra) for the reason that his tenure is coming to an end in November, 2021,” a Bench led by Justice L Nageswara Rao had said.Ordinances issuedKey cases being probed by central agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tenure-of-cbi-ed-heads-increased-up-to-5-years-338220
15-11-2021||New Delhi||Defence Ministry formally lifts ban on Italian firms Leonardo SpA, AgustaWestland||The defence ministry has formally lifted a ban on Italian firm Leonardo SpA and its subsidiary AgustaWestland as their names have not figured in an updated list of companies debarred and suspended from business dealings with it, officials familiar with the developments said on Sunday.Leonardo SpA, which was earlier known as Finmeccanica, and AgustaWestland were banned in 2014 in the wake of allegations of corruption in a Rs 3,500-crore VVIP helicopters deal.     The ministry issued a new notification dated November 12 updating the list of firms debarred/put on hold/suspended from doing business with it. The two Italian firms do not figure in the list.   India had scrapped the contract with AgustaWestland for supplying the 12 AW-101 VVIP choppers over alleged breach of contractual obligations and charges of kickbacks paid by the firm for securing the deal.Sources said Leonardo SpA has given a letter withdrawing its claims of 350 million euros on the cancelled order of the VVIP helicopters.It is learnt that though the defence ministry has lifted the ban on the two Italian firms, the probe by the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) into the VVIP chopper deal will continue. The sources said the lifting of the ban will now allow Leonardo SpA to participate in the heavy-weight torpedo programme under the Indian Navy's Project 75.Six Scorpene submarines are being built under Project-75 by state-run Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL) under technology transfer from the Naval Group of France. The Navy is likely to soon float tenders for naval radars and naval turrets for the submarines under Project 75. The MDL has already delivered four of the six submarines.The updated list figured six companies as "debarred firms" while 15 companies have been put under the category of "put on hold/suspended".The list also mentions two firms as "restricted" for procurement.   Following reports of the lifting of the ban on Leonardo SpA, the opposition Congress had questioned the decision.

Russia and India signed a contract on the delivery of S-400s in October 2018.In August, the head of Russia’s state arms exporter Rosoboronexport, Alexander Mikheev had said negotiations on the supply of S-400 air defence systems were underway with seven countries in the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region and Africa.Though the US threatens to impose sanctions on countries that buy major defence systems from Russia, South Block here is not flustered. Two years back when this issue came up during External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s US visit, the Ministers had said, “I am reasonably convinced of the powers of my persuasion. It would be my hope that people understand why this transaction is important for us.”The announcement by the Russian official comes as a surprise because Moscow had so far indicated that the supplies would begin next month, around the time Russian President Valdimir Putin visits India.On December 6, the day Putin meets PM Modi, Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoigu and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will hold a joint 2+2 conversation with their counterparts, Rajnath Singh and Jaishankar.Russian NSA Gen Nikolai Patrushev has already visited twice, first in September and then last week for the Regional Security Dialogue on Afghanistan.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/moscow-says-delivery-of-s-400-missile-systems-to-india-has-started-338048

What echoes through the verdant hills is the cry of an indomitable boy---"zindagi to bas apne dum pe jee jati hai".

15-11-2021||New Delhi||Climate deal struck at COP26; India, China force amendment on coal reference||The COP26 climate summit that ended with the Glasgow Climate Pact called for coal “phase down”, basically encouraging nations to accelerate away from polluting energy.Developing nations India and China raised the last-minute change of fossil fuel language in the pact, toning it from a “phase out” to a “phase down” of coal. After initial objections, opposing countries ultimately conceded.Earlier, Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav, who had disagreed with the language on fossil fuel, said developing countries are “entitled” to use fossil fuels.Glasgow also failed to deliver on the loss and damage facility for the most vulnerable and on paying the cost of emissions and historic responsibility of climate change created by developed countries. In other words, there was not much progress on issues related to finance and loss and damage financing.Despite progress on future emissions reductions, COP26 failed those most impacted by the climate crisis now. The EU and US refused to create a fund that the poorest countries could draw on for crisis response, outraging small islands and vulnerable nations, observers said.Environmentalists termed the text “meek and weak” saying that the 1.5C goal is “barely just alive, but that a signal has been sent in the era of coal”.An unprecedented fossil fuels phase-out pledge that was weakened by China, the US, the EU, and India is still there. The change in language was condemned by small island states, Switzerland, Mexico, and ironically the EU, which decided to support the shift despite slamming it as a “bad economic choice”, they said.Supporters, however, argued that the text “has sought to narrow the gap to the 1.5C goal and put in place processes for it to continue to narrow, and narrow faster in future”.Despite the watered-down phrase on coal, the cause of the climate crisis has for the first time since the Kyoto Protocol been called out by the 198 signatories of the Paris Agreement.The first-ever mention of coal phase down in an international climate agreement is an important indication of the energy transformation underway. India, with its RE expansion is well placed to deliver on the scale of change needed, they said.   In his emotional address, UK COP26 President Alok Sharma said he was “deeply sorry” for the way the process had unfolded. “I understand the deep disappointment. It’s also vital we protect this package,” Sharma was quoted as saying.The EU and the US also failed to deliver the promised $100 billion or nail down to $600 billion in climate finance between 2021-25. In other words, developed countries have slipped back to a commitment of $100 billion a year, now in place since 2009 and as yet undelivered, but remains urgent and central to ambitious climate action. “There is nothing much. There is no real commitment on part of developed countries to move ahead with serious and urgent domestic action, let alone in terms of global collaboration and truly significant climate finance for tackling climate change,” says Manjeev Puri, from Teri.The EU and US blocked the establishment of even a modest fund to help vulnerable communities around the world with the massive loss and damage they are experiencing at the hands of the climate crisis. As with COVID, those with the least resources have been left to fend for themselves.The closure of the Paris rules on carbon markets is a move forward, but loopholes still need to be addressed, observers said, adding that “COP26 is real progress, but much more is still to be done”.This COP was about keeping 1.5 degrees alive. It has, to an extent, reflected the findings of the IPCC SR1.5 and IEA net zero report, mandating an acceleration in action and new plans by 2022 in the context of the voluntary, non-binding UN regime. All major emitters will be compelled to return in 12 months and explain at the UN how their economy-wide policies and plans are aligned to the Paris temperature goals, they said.However, the test of COP26 will be the delivery of promises. The next 18 months are crucial in determining whether countries take action aligned to 1.5C—that means cutting emissions by 45% by 2030.Ulka Kelkar, Climate Programme Director, WRI India said now that COP-26 has finalised the rules of carbon trading, India will be able to sell more than a million carbon credits from previous years, and can also create a domestic market for carbon trading.“India will be affected by COP26 asking countries to phase out polluting coal power and withdraw inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. India will also have to join other countries to escalate emission reduction actions more frequently. This will not be easy for a lower- and middle-income country that is trying to lift millions of people out of poverty.“India’s battle against climate change will be led by scaling up renewable energy, which will be the foundation of our net zero future; by industry, who will fight to stay competitive in the global economy; and by states and cities, who will need to urbanize with respect for nature,” Kelkar added.Progress*Closing the Paris rulebook means that by 2024 all countries will have to report detailed data on emissions forming the baseline from which future reductions can be assessed*Agreement on new carbon market rules closes down some of the outrageous loopholes that had been considered and creates a structured trading regime between countries, but language isn’t clear enough to stop companies from manipulating the system.*Agreement on 2025 as the date by when developed countries need to double their collective funds for adaptation, based on 2019 pledges*Sector-specific agreements on forests, coal, cars, methane Undelivered*Developing countries demand a loss and damage funding facility. This did not happen and the focus will shift to Egypt next year to deliver this*Loopholes in Article 6||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/climate-deal-struck-at-cop26-india-china-force-amendment-on-coal-reference-337967
