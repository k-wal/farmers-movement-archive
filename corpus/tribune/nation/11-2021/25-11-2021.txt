25-11-2021||Hyderabad||Customs officials discover gold in perfume bottles in Hyderabad||The cat and mouse game continues between passengers arriving from international flights and the local custom officials, who discover new ways of smuggling almost on a daily basis.On each passing day, people think of innovative methods of bringing in gold and other restricted items, keeping the officials on their toes.A man was apprehended on Thursday while trying to smuggle in gold in toys and perfume bottles.According to a statement released by the Hyderabad Customs, a passenger from Dubai was stopped at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport when he was trying to move out with gold concealed in perfume bottles and toys in his checked-in luggage.The incident took place on Wednesday, while the information was released today after investigation.The officials said he had arrived on an Air India flight (AI 952) from Dubai. It is rare that passengers check in valuables like gold in checked-in luggage as the luggage and the passenger part ways till the luggage is collected on arrival.In the past customs have apprehended people with gold concealed in clothing and even in torchlights, etc. But this is perhaps very rare to find gold in deodorant bottles and toy cars.A case for smuggling of gold has been registered against the person, whose identity has not been revealed so far, perhaps due to investigation to determine more people involved in similar activity. The recovery includes 320 gm of gold valued at Rs 15.75 lakh, which has been seized.This is the second case of gold smuggling in the past few days. On Sunday, a woman who had arrived from Dubai was apprehended carrying gold biscuits weighing 350 gms. The gold was found concealed in her hand baggage.Also on Sunday, the custom officials confiscated nine iPhone 13s, valued at Rs 8.37 lakh from a man who had come from Sharjah. The phones were concealed in carry over luggage.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/customs-officials-discover-gold-in-perfume-bottles-in-hyderabad-342692
25-11-2021||---||Anaemia programme not working, needs a hard relook: Health Ministry||New Delhi, November 25With the incidence of anaemia rising significantly across all age groups over the last five years, the health ministry on Thursday said the anaemia prevention programme was not working and there was a need to take a hard relook at it.“The programme is not working and we need to review it, take a hard relook at it as to why it is faltering,” a top health ministry official said a day after National Family Health Survey 5 showed that the proportion of anaemic children age 6 to 59 months had gone up from 58.6 pc in NFHS 4 to 67.1 pc in NFHS 5; the percentage of 15 to 49 year old anemic women had risen from 53.2 pc to 57.2 pc over the two surveys and the percentage of anemic men (age 15 to 49) had risen from 22.7 pc to 25 pc between NFHS 4 and 5.“Anaemia-free Bharat campaign was launched in 2019. We expected the anemia burden to reduce or at least stay static. But the incidence has risen. We will have to redesign the plan and see whether to give iron supplements or go in for iron fortification. We also need to look at diet plans and advisories,” health ministry said.Although India has not officially raised the matter with the WHO, officials point to the standard definition of anaemia (hemoglobin levels less than 12) for all races - Caucasian, Mongoloid and South Asian.The ministry has in informal meetings called for anemia definitions to be based on racial characteristics but there is no official suggestion to this effect.Experts say that Caucasians with the highest muscle mass among races require more oxygen to carry blood to organs and tissues as compared to South Asians who have the lowest muscle mass.Anaemia burden in India continues to grow despite the launch of the National Nutritional Anaemia Prophylaxis Programme for mothers 51 years ago.Modified later to include children aged one to 12 years, the plan hinges on expectations that women will consume 100 tablets of iron and folic acid over a period of three months during pregnancy. Experts say anaemia is often misconstrued as iron deficiency alone whereas it also includes deficiency of micro nutrients and Vitamin B 12.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/anaemia-programme-not-working-needs-a-hard-relook-health-ministry-342688
25-11-2021||Jaipur||Studying in a hut, son of daily wager to become first doctor in his Rajasthan village||If you are committed and determined to do something, then no one can stop you from achieving success.One such story of unshakable determination is of Dudharam, a resident of Kamthai village of Sindhari tehsil in Barmer who achieved 626 marks out of 720 and will now become the first doctor in Kamthai Samdari village of Barmer.Dudharam’s father and brother work as labourers, his mother works under MNREGA. All he had was a hut to study in, but Dudharam dreamed of becoming a doctor and studied day and night to fulfil that dream. He did not let any difficulty come in the way of his dream.Today, all his hard work has paid off as Dudharam will be the first child of Kamthai village to do MBBS and become a doctor.Despite the family’s financial condition being weak, Dudharam did not deviate from his goal, did not let his self-confidence weaken, and achieved an All India Rank of 9375 by securing 626 marks out of 720 in the Medical Entrance Examination NEET (UG) 2021 in the fourth consecutive attempt.Dudharam’s family consists of five members, including parents and siblings. The family owns 10-12 bighas of land, but it being in a dry area, only one millet crop can be grown in a year, which can only feed the family.There is no other source of income. Dudharam’s father Pooraram and younger brother Khemaram Kamtha work at construction sites. Sometimes mother Lehro Devi also goes to work under MNREGA. Younger brother Khemaram is doing his BA from Kota Open University along with working for wages, while younger sister Hario is studying in Class 10.Dudharam said that there are about 250 houses in Samdari tehsil, where electricity comes only for 5 to 6 hours. The village also faces a water shortage, so they have to bring water in a tanker from a tubewell 10 km away which they store near the house. Dudharam’s parents are illiterate.He passed the 10th class from the village government school with 67.67 percent marks and studied in the government school at Barmer till the 12th and secured 82 percent marks. His school teacher Rajendra Singh Singhad inspired him to become a doctor. After this, he took admission in a coaching centre to prepare for NEET which gave him a 50 percent concession in fee.Dudharam said, “I was determined to become a doctor, and for me, nothing less than MBBS was acceptable. I made the first attempt in 2018, doing self-study and secured 440 marks. The second attempt was in 2019 again by self-study. That year, I got 558 marks. Then I decided to come to Kota to prepare for the third attempt and took admission in Allen Career Institute; then, I got All India Rank 23082 with 593 marks in NEET 2020. I could not get into a government college, but I took admission in BAMS at the Institute of Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Jamnagar. I continued studying online at coaching with my BAMS.“I worked hard and got All India Rank 9375 in 2021. I haven’t thought about what to do next in PG or have decided about my career after MBBS. But one thing I am pretty sure, that after doing MBBS, I will make other students like me more aware about competitive exams. I will help them make better decisions and will help them flourish in their careers.” —IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/studying-in-a-hut-son-of-daily-wager-to-become-first-doctor-in-his-rajasthan-village-342687
25-11-2021||New Delhi||Expert panel to re-examine error in Hindi version of Physics paper in NEET-UG exam: NTA to SC||The National Testing Agency (NTA) on Thursday told the Supreme Court that to allay the apprehensions of students who appeared for the NEET (UG) 2021 exam, it will appoint a committee of three experts to evaluate again the answers to an alleged error in Hindi version of Physics paper.NEET-PG admissions: Centre tells SC it will revisit Rs 8 lakh annual income limit for EWS; counselling put off for 4 weeksA bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, Surya Kant, and Vikram Nath was told by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for NTA, that the questions will be evaluated again by a committee of three experts. The bench recorded his submission that after the process is done the testing agency would file an affidavit before this court giving details of evaluation done by the panel of experts.“During the course of the hearing, Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General, has submitted that in order to allay the apprehensions of students who appeared for the NEET (UG) 2021 with Hindi as the medium, the solutions to both the Hindi and the English versions of Question No 2 of Section-A in the Physics Paper (Code P2) shall be evaluated again by a committee consisting of three experts,” the bench said.It noted, “After this process is done, it has been submitted that an affidavit would be filed before this Court setting out the result of the evaluation of the solutions.The bench posted the matter for further hearing on November 30.The top court was hearing a plea filed by Wajda Tabassum and 21 others NEET candidates alleging discrepancy and patent error in question number 2 of the Hindi version of Physics paper in which the word ‘amplitude of the current’ has been omitted.During the hearing, Mehta said that the issue was examined by neutral experts and they have opined that the answer would be the same irrespective of the alleged discrepancy or omission of words in the Hindi translation of the question paper.Advocate Archana Pathak Dave, appearing for the petitioners, said that due to the omission of the words, another answer in the Hindi version is correct.She said that out of over 15 lakh students, who appeared for the NEET-UG examination, nearly two lakh students have opted for the Hindi version and they would be at a disadvantageous position as there was negative marking for wrong answers.The bench then told Mehta that though the judges on the bench are not experts in Physics and the contention of petitioners is that both the answers are correct in Hindi and English versions, it would be better if the answers are re-examined by the panel of experts in the field.Mehta agreed to the suggestion after which the court recorded his submission. The plea has claimed that due to the alleged omission of the words in the Hindi version, candidates who have attempted the question have arrived at a different answer than their English counterparts.It has been said that both the incorrect and the correct answers were provided as options to the multiple-choice questions and the students, alleging omission of the words, have sought deletion of the said question. They have also sought to declare the NEET-UG, 2021 examination as erroneous and faulty as the NTA without taking cognisance of the error has released the answer key based on the answer to the English translation and has put the Hindi version candidates at the disadvantageous position.The National Eligibility and Entrance Test-Under Graduate (NEET-UG) examination was held on September 12, 2021, for MBBS and BDS courses in which over 15 lakh students have appeared. It was conducted by the NTA and results were declared on November 1.

25-11-2021||New Delhi||HC seeks Centre’s stand on administering booster shots against Covid-19||The Delhi High Court on Thursday directed the Centre to clarify its stand on administering a booster dose to those who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, saying it does not want a second-wave-like situation on account of being conservative.A Bench headed by Justice Vipin Sanghi observed that while the western countries are advocating the administration of a booster dose, Indian experts were of the view that there was no medical evidence to support it.“We need to know from experts. It should not be based on economics. It is an expensive proposition (since vaccines are largely free). (But) We don’t want to land up in a situation where we are overly conservative and we land up in a situation like we were in the second wave. We may lose the advantage,” said the Bench also comprising Justice Jasmeet Singh.“This is a very serious thing. We are not experts. But how is it that the West is encouraging booster and we are not permitting even those who want to,” said the Bench and also observed that the level of antibodies in a vaccinated person comes down after some time which is making old people and those with co-morbidities “anxious”. “What is it that the ICMR is saying, what is their stand? If not, there must be some basis. If required, what is the way forward?” questioned the Bench which was hearing a batch of petitions filed during the spread of Covid-19 in the national capital.The court also asked why should vaccines which are set to expire not be given as booster shots to those fully vaccinated.“Let the Union of India file an affidavit… (on) administration of booster doses of vaccine and the timeline within which it is proposed to be rolled out (if considered necessary)”, the court ordered.Before listing the case for further hearing on December 14, the court also asked the Centre to bring on record its stand on vaccination of children.Central government standing counsel Anurag Ahluwalia told the court that this issue is already pending before the Chief Justice’s court where the Centre has filed an affidavit informing that vaccination for children has already received in-principle approval and trials are ongoing.“Place it here too,” said the Bench.Amicus Curiae and senior advocate Raj Shekhar Rao submitted that the efficiency of a booster shot was a matter of expert opinion and it is for the Centre to come up with a policy.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, emphasised that the right things ought to be done at the right time and stated that most countries in Europe and the United States of America have already started administering booster shots. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hc-seeks-centres-stand-on-administering-booster-shots-against-covid-19-342674
25-11-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to reopen schools for Classes 1 to 4 from Dec 1||The Maharashtra cabinet on Thursday decided to reopen schools for students of Classes 1 to 4 in rural areas and Classes 1 to 7 in urban areas from December 1.In-person classes at primary schools in the state have remained closed since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.“After discussing the issue with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, the cabinet and the paediatric task force, we have decided to reopen schools for Classes 1 to 4 in rural areas and Classes 1 to 7 in urban areas from December 1,” School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad said in a statement.“We are committed to safe resumption of schools. In the next six days, the emphasis will be on acclimatising schools, parents and children towards a safe transition to physical classes, as classrooms have been shut for nearly two years. We will be holding consultations with school management committees and parents,” she added.She will also hold deliberations with the pediatric task force on the need to update Standard Operating Procedure for reopening schools for these children, some of whom will be attending physical classes for the first time, Gaikwad said.The task force was appointed earlier this year when experts feared that children might be affected by a possible third wave.The education minister thanked schools, especially teachers, for ensuring a safe environment for classes that have resumed so far.Schools reopened for Classes 5 to 12 in rural areas on October 4, while those in urban areas resumed for Classes 8 to 12.Maharashtra on Wednesday recorded 960 new COVID-19 cases and 41 fatalities that raised the tally of infections to 66,32,257 and death toll to 1,40,807.

25-11-2021||Mumbai||Shakti Mills gangrape case: HC commutes death penalty of three convicts to life imprisonment||The Bombay High Court on Thursday commuted to life sentence the death penalty awarded to three convicts in the gangrape of a 22-year-old photojournalist inside the defunct Shakti Mills compound in central Mumbai in 2013, saying that they “deserve imprisonment for life to repent the offence committed by them as death puts an end to the concept of repentance”.Terming rape as a “serious blow to the supreme honour and dignity of a woman”, the court said the convicts “do not deserve to assimilate with the society, as it would be difficult to survive in a society of such men who look upon women with derision, depravity, contempt and objects of desire”.A Division Bench of Justices Sadhana Jadhav and Prithviraj Chavan refused to confirm the death penalty awarded to Vijay Jadhav, Mohammad Qasim Bengali Shaikh and Mohammad Ansari, and commuted their sentence to life imprisonment for the remainder of their lives.The judgment comes seven years after a trial court in Mumbai awarded the death sentence to them.The high court noted that although the offence was “barbaric and heinous”, it cannot be said at the threshold that the convicts deserve only death penalty and nothing less than that.“A sentence of death is irrevocable and therefore, the basic principle in sentencing policy would be life imprisonment as a rule and death penalty as an exception,” the court said.The Bench in its order noted that as a constitutional court it would not be proper on its part to “eliminate or extinguish the flame of the life of the convicts without following due procedure established by law”.“We cannot allow our emotions to outweigh the principles of criminal jurisprudence and the procedural mandate of the statute...We are of the opinion that the convicts deserve the punishment of rigorous imprisonment for life that is the whole of the remainder of their natural life in order to repent for the offence committed by them,” the judgment said.“The accused do not deserve any leniency, empathy or sympathy. Every day the rising sun would remind them of the barbaric acts committed by them and the night would lay them with a heavy heart filled with guilty and remorse,” the judgment said.The court said that the convicts shall not be entitled for remission, furlough or parole as they cannot be allowed to assimilate in the society and as there is no scope for reformation.“The convicts do not deserve to assimilate with the society, as it would be difficult to survive in a society of such men who look upon women with derision, depravity, contempt and objects of desire,” the court said.At the time of the incident in 2013, Jadhav was 19 years old, Qasim Shaikh was 21 and Ansari was 28.“Every case of rape is a heinous offence. The damage done to the victim far outweighs the public conscience. A rape victim does not suffer just physical injury but what is affected is her mental health and stability in life,” the court said.Rape is tantamount to a serious blow to the supreme honour and dignity of a woman and is a violation of human rights, it added.The court, however, noted that a constitutional court cannot award punishment by taking into consideration only the public outcry.It added that courts have a duty to consider cases dispassionately and cannot ignore the procedure laid down by the law. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/shakti-mills-gangrape-case-hc-commutes-death-penalty-of-three-convicts-to-life-imprisonment-342668

They also have an advanced Permanent Magnetic Synchronous (PERMASYN) motor as its propulsion motor.The delivery of Vela is yet another affirmation of the impetus being given by the Indian Navy towards consolidating its position as a ‘Builder’s Navy’ as also indicative of MDL’s capabilities as a premier ship and submarine building yard.INS Vela would form part of the Western Naval Command’s Submarine fleet and would be another potent part of its arsenal.The INS Vela is a name that has been revived of decommissioned submarine of the same name operated by the Navy earlier.The crew of the erstwhile ‘Vela’, a Russian-origin Foxtrot Class Submarine, which was decommissioned in 2009, was also present among the guests on this occasion.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/navy-commissions-submarine-ins-vela-342619

So far, substantial amounts announced are 50 million barrels by the US and 5 million barrels by India.South Korea has not announced the volume but if the last experience during the Libyan crisis in 2011 is an indication, it could release about 3.5 million barrels. Japan’s law on strategic reserves does not allow withdrawals to lower oil prices. Hence, it may release just over 4 million barrels by other means. The UK may contribute 1.5 million barrels if privately held reserves heed the call of 10 Downing Street.Hopes, therefore, rest on China. Experts say it needs to release 15 million tonnes, but the signals were ambiguous. The Chinese MEA said Beijing is maintaining “close communication with relevant parties, including oil consuming and producing countries” and had “noted” recent actions by some countries on strategic reserves.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-remains-vague-on-emergency-crude-release-342478

A Chinese company has already been entrusted with Colombo South Container Terminal and Hambantota Port.With Sri Lanka in deep financial trouble and having sought a $500 million emergency loan, it signed an agreement in September this year with the Adani Group for the Colombo Port’s West Container Terminal (WCT) in partnership with local conglomerate John Keells and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority as a minority partner.

A second crypto investor said the value of his portfolio fell to about Rs 22,000 from Rs 34,000 on Tuesday as a result of heavy selling. “I am contemplating selling because the future appears so uncertain,” said the investor.Also read: What will happen if cryptocurrencies are banned in India?

WazirX, one of India’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, said that it was investigating reports that users were facing delays on its app and website. It later claimed the issue had been resolved.India has 15 cryptocurrency exchange platforms, including CoinSwitch Kuber, Zebpay, WazirX, UnoCoin and CoinDCX.The industry, meanwhile, has urged the government to take a nuanced approach towards regulating crypto assets and asked investors to remain calm and not arrive at a rushed conclusion.According to legislative agenda released on Tuesday for the winter session of Parliament commencing on November 29, the government will allow only certain cryptocurrencies to promote the underlying technology and its uses. The Bill, if passed, will effectively ban citizens in India from transacting in most cryptocurrencies.Though there is no official data available on cyrptocurrency holdings and the user base, industry estimates suggest there are 1.5 crore to 2 crore investors in India. Private firm BrokerChooser had recently put the user base count at over 10 crore. The crypto investments in the country are said to have increased from Rs 6,876 crore in April last year to a whopping over Rs 40,000 crore in May this year.A few exchanges have welcomed the move to regulate cryptocurrency, claiming that it would pave the way for transparency and accountability in the industry. They also demanded that the government should protect the interests of the large number of crypto investors in the country.“The proposed Bill allows certain exceptions and its usage to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency. We will have to wait and watch,” said Sathvik Vishwanath, co-founder and CEO, Unocoin.Some others feel that it was impossible to ban cryptocurrency. “While it’s clear that there will be some restrictions, the latest draft of the Bill has not been made public yet. There have been explicit references to “exceptions” in the Bill. Even if there is a total ban in India, the firms will immediately offshore their operations.

Because of its reopening at short notice immediately before Gurpurb (November 19), it was not possible to honour the 10-day period for advance sharing of data. So, we had requested them to exempt it till operations normalise.”The authorities in Pakistan “readily agreed” to India’s request, the official said. “For an average of 500 persons per day, they hardly need a few hours to check for people blacklisted there. In fact, I had objected to this 10-day rider during negotiations. My original proposal was 48 hours advanced sharing. So, they haven’t done any favour by waiving this,” the official said.Noting that it was Pakistan, and not India, that had been promoting terror, the official said a pilgrim (in Pakistan) was confined to a 4-km insulated passage and in the gurdwara compound. “No pilgrim can move beyond the fixed passage. They can’t meet anyone unnoticed. So, where’s the threat and why do they need the 10-day advance data,” the official said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pakistans-kartarpur-sahib-move-no-big-favour-officials-342438

A major takeaway of the survey is – all states have achieved replacement level of fertility (2.1) except MP, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and UP, where too the fertility rates have declined over the past six years.“The trends were expected as contraception improves and unmet need for family planning declines.

SAGE is continuously reviewing the literature and has reached out to vaccine manufacturers, researchers and Member States to obtain the most complete and recent data on the issue,” said the WHO today.It noted how some countries including the US and India had approved vaccines for use in children.Pfizer and Moderna’s Covid-19 shots have been approved for use in 12 to 17 year olds. India has given approval to ZycovD, a novel DNA vaccine, for ages 12-17 years but this vaccine has not yet received WHO EUL. “Several Covid-19 vaccines are undergoing trials in younger age groups (including as young as 6 months), but results have not yet been published,” WHO said, effectively asking countries to put child Covid vaccinations on hold till the majority world had been vaccinated with the available stocks.The world body said the greatest burden of severe disease and deaths remains among older persons and those with comorbidities and the global vaccination strategy targets remain the same – 40 per cent of each country’s population by end of 2021, and 70 per cent by mid-2022.The WHO cited evidence to say that children were at low risk of severe disease.“Age-disaggregated cases reported to WHO from 30 December 2019 to 25 October 2021 show that children under five represent 2 per cent (18,90,756) of reported global cases and 0.1 per cent (1,797) of reported global deaths. Older children and younger adolescents (5 to 14 years) account for 7 per cent (70,58,748) of reported global cases and 0.1 per cent (1,328) of reported global deaths while older adolescents and young adults (15 to 24 years) represent 15 per cent (1,48,19,320) of reported global cases and 0.4 per cent (7,023) of reported global deaths,” WHO said.It said deaths for all ages less than 25 years represented less than 0.5 per cent of reported global deaths.“Children and adolescents usually demonstrate fewer and milder symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to adults and are less likely than adults to experience severe Covid-19,” the WHO interim statement said.India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization will meet in November end to take a call on whether to expand the national Covid inoculation drive to cover children.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/who-issues-advice-on-child-covid-vaccination-asks-nations-to-help-cover-low-vax-regions-first-342457
25-11-2021||Sandeep Dikshit||For Democracy Summit, Biden invites India, Pakistan||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 24India and Pakistan are among the countries from South Asia invited by US President Joe Biden for his “Democracy Summit”, which is topped by the surprise inclusion of Taiwan.South and Central Asia scored just four invites; the other two are for the Maldives and Nepal.US think-tanks that enthusiastically backed the Biden move have, however, severely critiqued the invitation to Pakistan but the criticism towards India has been milder.“The current mix of invitees includes liberal democracies, weaker democracies, and several states with authoritarian characteristics (such as Congo and Pakistan). Rather than limit participation to a core group of committed democracies, Biden’s team opted for a big tent approach,’’ noted the Carnegie Endowment about the summit on December 9 and 10. As per the Freedom House’s latest report, 27 invitees rank as fully democratic, 31 as “partly free” and three “not free”. It said eight invitees, including Pakistan, fall exceptionally low on democracy rankings, raising troubling questions about their invitations.India is mentioned in a group of four that includes Brazil, the Philippines, and Poland. There have been “serious backsliding concerns due to heightened levels of autocratisation or big declines in freedom of expression over the past 10 years,” said the Carnegie Endowment.In regional representation, Europe leads with 39 invitees, followed closely by the Americas with 27 invites. The Asia Pacific and Sub-Saharan Africa have 21 and 17 invitees, respectively. But from the Middle East, only Iraq and Israel have been invited.The think-tanks also said Pakistan along with Philippines and Ukraine were flawed democracies with endemic corruption and rule of law abuses. “Yet, they are important partners of the US — whether to counterbalance China influence (Philippines), withstand Russian encroachment (Ukraine), or assist with counter-terrorism (Pakistan),” it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/for-democracy-summit-biden-invites-india-pakistan-342461
25-11-2021||New Delhi||Court orders FIR against Sambit Patra for posting Kejriwal’s doctored video||A Delhi court has directed the police to register an FIR against BJP leader Sambit Patra for allegedly posting a doctored video of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal supporting the farm laws, saying it may have resulted in rioting like situation across the nation.Metropolitan Magistrate Rishabh Kapoor directed the Delhi Police to register the FIR under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and conduct a thorough investigation against the BJP Spokesperson while allowing the application of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Atishi.Atishi had moved the court seeking registration of FIR against Patra claiming that the video contained statements that were diametrically opposite to the stand taken by the Delhi CM and the Aam Aadmi Party concerning the farm laws and caused discontent and dissatisfaction in the minds of farmers.The judge noted, “The fact that the video was published on the Twitter handle of proposed accused with the caption ‘teeno farm bills ke laabh ginate hue (Counting the benefits of the three farm bills) Sir ji’..., prima facie proves that same was circulated with no intention but to cause the farmers to believe that Kejriwal is supporting the farm laws, which may have perpetuated the state of outrage with the protesting farmers and may have resulted in rioting like situation across the nation.”The court said that a “thorough investigation” was required to be conducted considering the seriousness of the allegations and directed the SHO to register the FIR against Patra and initiate the probe.The judge noted that in the original video, Kejriwal was seen replying to a question asked by a journalist by quoting that in the speeches given by leaders of BJP in support of farm laws, it was stated that due to the operation of said laws, the farmers will not lose their lands, the minimum support price assured to them will not be lost, the mandi system will not overturn.“In this video itself, at the end of each sentence itself, Kejriwal can be seen saying that the above-quoted benefits of the farm laws were already in existence even prior to the operation of said laws,” the judge said.The chief minister was also seen responding to the questions regarding the solutions proposed by the farmers and in this context and he spoke in support of MSP measures, the judge said.The court also noted that Kejriwal was seen saying that if MSP comes into operation, it would be the most revolutionary law made in the past 70 years.“In the impugned video clip running in 18 seconds, it was seen that the stances quoted by the Delhi CM in the original video were placed and doctored in such a way to give them colour as if he was speaking in support of farm laws,” the magistrate noted in an eight-page order.The court further said that the findings in the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report reflected that the video was opined to have been altered.Atishi had claimed that she gave a formal complaint to the station house officer (SHO) of IP Estate police station and DCP Darya Ganj in February 2021 and was assured that the FIR will be registered.“To her surprise, nothing has happened,” she stated in the plea.The magistrate, in an order dated November 23, said that if the video was within the category of “manipulated media” marked by Twitter, the circumstances under which Patra published it on his handle were not probed into by the police.“Besides, the police has also not conducted any probe to find out whether the impugned video clip was already available in the public domain by associating twitter during the inquiry, so as to rule out the fabrication/alteration of the same at the behest of proposed accused,” the judge said.Patra, through his counsel, however, denied addition or deletion in the video or mimicking or dubbing and stated that the video was already available in the public domain as the same was tweeted by many persons before the tweet in question.Advocate Mohd Irshad, appearing for Atishi, said that “the publication of the video caused discontent and dissatisfaction in the minds of farmers across the country who are protesting against farm laws and will give them a provocation against Kejriwal and Aam Aadmi Party, which may also result in rioting like situation.”             She had approached the court seeking direction to the police to register the FIR under section 153 (giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 417 (cheating), 465 (forgery), 469 (forgery for purpose of harming reputation) of IPC.She also sought it to be registered under 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) read with 120B (common intention) of IPC and various sections of the Information Technology Act.The AAP leader said that non-registration of FIR by the police is in grave contravention of the settled proposition of law and should be curbed immediately to keep the faith of the general public in the law enforcement agencies. —

25-11-2021||New Delhi||Union Cabinet approves bill to repeal farm laws||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a bill to repeal the three farm laws, which triggered protests at Delhi borders by thousands of farmers, and will be tabled in Parliament during the upcoming winter session for passage.Read also:Govt extends 5-kg free foodgrains scheme till March 2022; to cost exchequer Rs 53,344 croreOn November 19, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation had announced the withdrawal of the three farm laws, saying the government could not convince protesting farmers about the benefits of the agriculture sector reforms. He had also urged them to end the protest and return home.The Cabinet has approved the Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021 to rollback the three laws passed by Parliament in September last year, with an objective to bring reforms in the agriculture sector, especially marketing of farm produce.The three laws to be repealed are: Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act; The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act; and The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.The Cabinet has completed the formalities to repeal the three farm laws, I&B Minister Anurag Thakur told reporters.“In the upcoming session of Parliament, it will be our priority to take back these three laws,” he said.The winter session will begin on November 29, and conclude on December 23.The Farm Laws Repeal Bill, 2021, has been approved days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement to repeal the three central farm laws. Besides this, Parliament is scheduled to take 25 other bills, including one on crypto currencies.The repeal of the three farm legislations has been one of the key demands of around 40 farmer unions protesting against these reforms for nearly a year now.These laws, which are under suspension following a Supreme Court order in January this year, had triggered widespread protests by thousands of farmers mainly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh at Delhi borders.The protest started at the very end of November 2020, and is still ongoing.On November 21, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM)—joint body of farmer unions leading the current protests—had written to the Prime Minister to immediately resume talks on the farmers’ six demands including legal guarantee for the procurement of crops at minimum support price (MSP).The other demands were sacking and arrest of Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra in connection with the Lakhimpur Kheri incident, withdrawal of cases against farmers and building of a memorial for those who lost their lives during the agitation.They also sought removal of penal provisions on farmers in the “Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Act 2021” and withdrawal of the draft “Electricity Amendments Bill, 2020/2021” proposed by the government.SKM had said it would continue its planned protests, including the march to Parliament on November 29, to observe one year of anti-farm law protests. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-cabinet-approves-bill-to-repeal-farm-laws-342275
