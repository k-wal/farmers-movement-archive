He is spreading all rumours, he lacks knowledge and he should find out correct information about things." The NCB Zonal Director said he is not obliged to reply to Malik."Who is he that I should reply to him every time. I am a government servant, I will reply to my government," he said.Hitting back at the minister, Yasmeen Wankhede, a lawyer by profession, said Malik's son-in-law moves around in expensive vehicles like Jaguar, a luxury car brand, but no one asks any question about his lifestyle.Taking to media persons, she said items used by her brother were gifted to him by her late mother."My mummy has gifted him all these watches and to me also... these were purchased around 17 years back. My brother saves money the whole year to do shopping one day...he wears these cloths for entire year. He makes a list of what he wants and then goes for shopping," she said.Yasmeen Wankhede said the minister should explain the lifestyle of his son-in-law."I have seen pictures of Nawab Malik's son-in-law, but no one is asking him about his heavy lifestyle. He is seen in expensive vehicles like Jaguar...from where he get such kind of money?" she asked."Women who give him answers with all justification he calls them 'lady don'... he is mentally unstable and has no work. He has nothing to do with social work, he should take a break and get his mental health checked," Yasmeen Wankhede said.Sameer Wankhede's wife Kranti Redkar also came out in support of her husband.Sharing information about her husband's property, Redkar tweeted, “ Sameer's entire property belongs to her mother and it not about 50 to 100 crore. Sameer has such properties when he was just 15 years old." Redkar said the 2008-batch IRS officer has been sharing details of his properties with the government as per service rules."As per rule Sameer is showing his entire documents to government. Sameer's property is not disproportionate," she said.Redkar, an actress, used a Hindi proverb to take potshots at Malik without naming him.“Sawan Ke Andhe Ko Haryali Dikhti Hai (used for people who fail to see reality)," she quipped.Malik has been making a series of allegations against Sameer Wankhede, from forging documents to get a government job to lying about his religion to carrying out "bogus" drug raids. The IRS officer has denied all the allegations. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nawab-malik-spreading-rumours-says-wankhede-after-expensive-clothes-jibe-333406

They also chanted Krishna bhajans and danced there.Thousands of widows, mostly from West Bengal, live in Vrindavan for several decades and for long were not allowed to take part in rituals, till NGO Sulabh International extended them a helping hand, said Vinita Verma, vice-president of the organisation.One of the widows, Manu Ghosh said, "Motivated by the series of revolutionary initiatives, widows are now happy and enjoying their stay in Vrindavan." With an aim to bring a ray of happiness and counter the tradition of widowhood, Pathak came up with the unique idea to organise the festival of lights, especially for the widows.His organisation looks after hundreds of widows living in various ashrams in Vrindavan and Varanasi since 2012.On a routine basis, Sulabh International provides them medical facilities and vocational training besides meeting their day-to-day needs so that they do not feel left out during the twilight years of their lives, says Verma.

02-11-2021||Kolkata/Guwahati||Bypolls: Mamata demolishes BJP in Bengal; Himanta, Nitish and NDA allies salvage reputation elsewhere||The TMC and the BJP-led NDA on Tuesday swept the assembly bypolls in West Bengal and Assam, steamrollering the Opposition that crumbled before the ruling parties powered by redoubtable Mamata Banerjee and Himanta Biswa Sarma.Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress got a ringing endorsement by the electors as it won all the four seats, including two that it wrested from the BJP, which surrendered rather meekly after a creditable performance in the March-April assembly elections when it won 77 of the 292 seats where polling was held.TMC candidates not only polled more than one lakh votes each in Dinhata, Gosaba, Khardaha and Santipur, but also the party’s vote share stood at a staggering 75.02 per cent against BJP’s measly 14.48 per cent.Udayan Guha, who wrested Dinhata seat vacated by Union Minister of State for Home, Sports and Youth Affairs Nisith Pramanik by a margin of over 1.64 lakh votes, polled 84 per cent votes against his BJP rival Ashok Mondal’s 11.31 per cent.TMC’s Subrata Mondal trounced his BJP rival Palash Rana by over 1.43 lakh votes in Gosaba, clinching 87.19 per cent votes against a paltry 9.95 per cent polled by the saffron party candidate. TMC’s Braja Kishor Goswami wrested Santipur from the BJP, defeating Niranjan Biswas by 64,675 votes. Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, a Mamata Banerjee confidant who had vacated the Bhabanipur seat for her to contest in a by-poll earlier, won from Khardaha defeating his BJP rival Joy Sinha by 93,832 votes.The TMC’s triumph not only added more insult to injury the BJP faced in the general election but also buttressed Banerjeee’s already strong claim to lead a broadbased anti-BJP opposition alliance, if at all it is formed ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.“My heartiest congratulations to all the four winning candidates! This victory is people’s victory, as it shows how Bengal will always choose development and unity over propaganda and hate politics. With people’s blessings, we promise to continue taking Bengal to greater heights!” Mamata Banerjee said in a twitter post.Taking a dig at BJP’s defeat, her nephew and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee tweeted, “A cracker free Diwali in true sense. Wishing folks at @BJP4India a very Happy Diwali!”West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar blamed the defeat on the “reign of terror” unleashed by the TMC.“Margin of more than one lakh in by-polls is unimaginable. We can very well understand the kind of terror that was unleashed by the ruling party to stop people from voting freely and fairly,” he said.The resounding victory is expected to add more lusture to Banerjee’s personal charisma and public appeal as the TMC tries to expand beyond West Bengal to new territories like Goa and Tripura in the run up to the 2024 parliamentary elections.Though Banerjee struck a heavy blow to the BJP in West Bengal, a charismatic Himanta Biswa Sarma led the NDA to a power-packed performance in neighbouring Assam, clinching all the five seats along with its ally UPPL.The BJP won Bhabanipur, Mariani and Thowra seats, while the UPPL bagged Gossaigaon and Tamulpur in the Bodoland Territorial region. All NDA candidates won with impressive margins. The BJP had fielded Phanidhar Talukdar, who had left the AIUDF after getting elected to the assembly in the general election, from Bhabanipur and Congress defectors Rupjyoti Kurmi and Sushanta Borgohain from Mariani and Thowra.In a reflection of the uncanny political sense of Sarma, who has emerged as the BJP’s pointsman for the entire northeast, all the three won.The BJP and ally UPPL bagged around 54 per cent of votes polled."Today's victory is both humbling & reassuring and we promise to continue path of Vikas as per vision of Hon PM Sri @narendramodi. My gratitude to people & our karyakarta.“@TheUPPLOfficial is NDA’s valued partner & the win today highlights enormous faith of people in vision of Hon PM @narendramodi who is resolute in his commitment to take Assam to glorious heights,” Sarma wrote in a series of tweets.Barring its abject defeat in West Bengal, the BJP and its allies were on song elsewhere in the east and the northeast where bypolls were held on October 30.In Bihar, where Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) was locked in a prestige fight with Lalu Prasad’s RJD, the ruling party retained both the seats. It won Kusheshwar Asthan by a margin of over 12,000 votes and bagged Tarapur by more than 3,000 votes after a see-saw that lasted till the dying moments of counting.The National People’s Party-led Meghalaya Democratic Alliance won all the three seats in the state. The NPP of Chief Minister Conrad Sangma, a BJP ally, wrested Rajbala and Mawryngkneng seats from the Congress, while its alliance partner in MDA government United Democratic Party won Mawphlang.The ruling Mizo National Front (MNF), also an NDA partner, won the bypoll to the Tuirial assembly seat in Mizoram, wresting it from the opposition Zoram People’s Front.

02-11-2021||New Delhi||COP26: Narendra Modi, Boris Johnson launch Infrastructure for the Resilient Island States initiative||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his UK counterpart Boris Johnson jointly launched the ‘Initiative for the Resilient Island States’ (IRIS) on Tuesday for developing infrastructure of small island nations at the ongoing climate summit COP26 in Glasgow. Stating that small island developing states faced the biggest threat from climate change, Modi said for him the CDRI or IRIS is not just a matter of infrastructure, but a “part of the most sensitive responsibility of human welfare”.“It is the collective responsibility of all of us towards mankind,” Modi said.  “It is, in a way, a common atonement for our sins.” He said that IRIS gives new hope, new confidence and satisfaction of doing something for the most vulnerable countries in the world. The launch event was attended by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and leaders of Small Island States.Modi said although small island countries have lived in harmony with nature for centuries, and they know how to adapt to the natural cycles, “due to the selfish behaviour shown in the past several decades, the unnatural form of nature has come to the fore, the result of which innocent Small Island States are facing today”.The IRIS initiative is a part of the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), which was also initiated by India. It will focus on building capacity, having pilot projects, especially in small island developing states. India’s space agency ISRO will build a special data window for them to provide them timely information about cyclones, coral-reef monitoring, coast-line monitoring etc. through satellite.“Through IRIS, it will be easier and faster for SIDS to mobilise technology, finance, and necessary information. Promotion of quality infrastructure in Small Island States will benefit both lives and livelihoods there,” Modi said.Modi also said that the past few decades have proved that no one is untouched by the wrath of climate change.“Whether they are developed countries or countries rich in natural resources, this is a big threat to everyone,” he added.British Prime Minister Johnson said it was incredibly cruel that vulnerable, small island states are right in the frontline of loss and damage that is caused by global warming. “They have done virtually nothing to cause the problem, they didn’t produce the huge volumes of CO2 to be pumped into the atmosphere,” he was quoted as saying.Speaking at the launch of ‘Infrastructure for Resilient Island States’ initiative. https://t.co/WMLYr56R0M  The UK is contributing financially to the initiative IRIS.Australia too is a partner in this effort.Speaking at the event, the Australian Prime Minister thanked India and the UK for their leadership of the CDRI. “I acknowledge the Quad support, including the US and Japan support for India’s CDRI,” he said.Leaders of small-island states, including the Prime Minister of Jamaica, and the Prime Minister of Mauritius, spoke at the event.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cop26-narendra-modi-boris-johnson-launch-infrastructure-for-the-resilient-island-states-initiative-333378
02-11-2021||Hyderabad||BJP wins Huzurabad by-poll||The Bharatiya Janata Party has taken a massive lead from the Telangana Rastra Samithi (TRS) party in the Huzurabad assembly by-election, forcing the TRS to concede defeat.In the final round, the BJP’s Etela Rajender was leading by nearly 24,000 votes. Etela was the state Health Minister until he was dropped from the Cabinet by Chief Minister K Chandra Shekhar Rao (KCR) on “land grabbing” charges.Infuriated at the allegation, Etela quit the TRS and joined the BJP while resigning as MLA from Huzurabad. This necessitated the by-poll. With his victory, Etela has again won the seat that he had left earlier this year.The Huzurabad election was considered significant as this was probably the last assembly election before the state’s General Elections due in 2023. The Chief Minister deliberately stayed away from the campaigning, lest it is considered his defeat as he was aware of Etela’s popularity in the constituency.The TRS, in an official communication, has accepted the defeat and thanked party leaders and workers for working hard to contest the election. The BJP has secured 55.4 per cent of the total polled votes, with the TRS at number two. The Congress candidate has lost his deposit.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-wins-huzurabad-by-poll-333374

02-11-2021||New Delhi||India saw 125 extremely heavy rainfall events this September, October—highest in 5 years: IMD||India recorded 125 extremely heavy rainfall events during September and October of 2021, the highest in five years, owing to the late withdrawal of the southwest monsoon and higher-than-normal low-pressure systems, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Tuesday.The country recorded 89 extremely heavy rainfall events this September against 61 in the same month last year, 59 in 2019; 44 in 2018 and 29 in 2017.Also, 36 such events were witnessed in October this year compared to 10 in the corresponding period of 2020; 16 in 2019; 17 in 2018, and 12 in 2017, according to IMD data.The meteorological department said the causes of disastrous weather episodes included the late withdrawal of the monsoon, a higher-than-normal number of low-pressure systems during the period, and the interaction of active western disturbances with low-pressure systems in October.Nine low-pressure systems, including two cyclones, one deep depression and six lows, affected the country during the period.Unprecedented extremely heavy rain in Uttarakhand on October 18 and 19 claimed 79 lives. The Himalayan state received 203.2 mm rainfall against the normal of 35.3 mm in October.Heavy to extremely heavy rain during October 17-19 due to interaction of a low-pressure area and an intense western disturbance caused flash floods and landslides in Uttarakhand and riverine flooding in west Uttar Pradesh.Rainfall recorded below 15 mm is considered light, between 15 and 64.5 mm moderate, between 64.5 mm and 115.5 mm heavy, between 115.6 and 204.4 is very heavy. Anything above 204.4 mm is considered extremely heavy rainfall.The southwest monsoon withdrew from the entire country on October 25 against the normal date of October 15, making it the seventh-most delayed retreat since 1975.The country received "normal" rainfall during the four-month southwest monsoon season from June to September—87 cm against the Long Period Average (LPA) of 88 cm of 1961-2010 (99 per cent of its LPA).This is the third consecutive year that the country recorded rainfall in the normal or above-normal category. Rainfall was above normal in 2019 and 2020. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-saw-125-extremely-heavy-rainfall-events-this-september-october%E2%80%94highest-in-5-years-imd-333361
02-11-2021||New Delhi||Delhi riots: ‘Anti-CAA protest secular, charge sheet communal’, Khalid tells court in conspiracy case||The anti-CAA protest was secular but the charge sheet in the Delhi riots conspiracy case was communal and the police fabricated a story to suit its narrative, former JNU student leader Umar Khalid told a court here on Tuesday calling it a “naked form of false implication”.Senior advocate Trideep Pais, appearing for Khalid, made the remarks during a hearing on Khalid’s bail plea in a case related to the communal violence that had broken out in north-east Delhi on February 24, 2020, after clashes between the Citizenship Amendment Act supporters and its protesters spiralled out of control.Khalid and several others have been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), a stringent anti-terror law, accused of being the “masterminds” of the riots which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured.Arguing his bail plea before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat, Pais said the charge sheet was a fertile imagination of the police, calling the investigating officer (IO) a scriptwriter who “literally wrote a novel”.“No recovery, not present in Delhi, no violence attributed to me, no traces of funding,” Pais told the court while opposing Delhi Police’s allegations levelled against Khalid.The police had earlier said that Khalid’s bail plea had no merit and, referring to the charge sheet, asserted it would demonstrate the prima facie case against him before the court.During the hearing, Pais told the court: “Much after the riots happened, they registered the case, cooked up statements, or simply matched CDR location and if it matched with the co-accused, they arrested me”.Referring to the anti-CAA protest, he further said: “Not a single witness spoke that women were exploited, that there was a secular cover, etc. In fact, you will see a number of personalities who are educated, working in different fields, associated with CAA. Luckily they are not accused”.“In fact, the shoe is on the other side. The protest was secular, the charge sheet is communal.”                Pais further said that if Delhi Police was a fair investigating agency, it would not have attributed ‘Tukde Tukde’ phrase from some other case’s charge sheet to the present one.“You have a political person who speaks against the state and you want to frame him. It is a naked form of false implication. You have fabricated a story to suit your narrative. This man is innocent. He has not done anything,” he added.On allegations that Khalid directed JNU student Sharjeel Imam and others to block the roads at Shaheen Bagh and Muslim-dominated areas, Pais submitted that while the prosecution claimed that chakka jam was equal to a terror act, it is not an offence and has been used by students, farmers, and others while participating in various agitations.On the police’s claims that women were paid money to sit at the protest site, he submitted, “Has any of the women come before you [police] to say that money was given to them? First of all, I take offense to this. Don’t they have their own say to sit there and protest?”              In the last hearing, Khalid on October 12, Khalid through his lawyer, said that the investigating officer wrote fanciful stories in the chargesheet and asked if organizing chakka jaam is an offence or does it invite the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).“Your [prosecution] wish to paint every accused with one brush as if it was one conspiracy crumbles when you look at the charge sheet. Where do you get it from? You got it from your mind. Half of it is a fertile imagination. None of this is supported by any statement,” Pais had said.Besides him, JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain and several others have been booked under the stringent anti-terror law in the case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-riots-anti-caa-protest-secular-charge-sheet-communal-khalid-tells-court-in-conspiracy-case-333355

02-11-2021||Bhopal||Over 30 tigers left MP’s Panna reserve in recent years to find new territory: Official||More than 30 tigers moved out of the Panna Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh in recent years to find a new territory, a senior forest official on Tuesday said, adding that it was a regular and natural process.According to the 2018 tiger census, Madhya Pradesh was home to highest number of tigers in the country, an official earlier said.The state has a number of tiger reserves, including Kanha, Bandhavgarh, Pench, Satpura and Panna.The Panna Tiger Reserve (PTR), located around 330 km from the state capital Bhopal, was left with no tigers about a decade back following which a tiger reintroduction project was started there.On Sunday, the decomposed carcass of a tiger, which had moved out of the Panna Tiger Reserve (PTR), was found in Satna district and a preliminary probe suggested the animal was killed by poachers, an official said.“About 30 to 35 tigers have moved out of the PTR during the recent years. At present, there are 45 to 50 adult tigers in the PTR and 20 to 25 cubs (below the age of one year). Overall, 70 big cats are there in the PTR,” the reserve’s field director Uttam Kumar Sharma told PTI.He said the “dispersal” is a natural behaviour of the big cats.“As the number of tigers grows, they go out to find a new territory. Tigers from the PTR went to Chitrakoot and Bandhavgarh. All the tigers in Satna’s forest and Nauradehi sanctuary are from the PTR. The forest of PTR is connected through corridors with these areas. This is a regular and natural process,” the official said.Sharma further said the radio-collared tiger found dead in neighbouring Satna district on Sunday was identified as P234-31, also named as ‘Heera’. The feline was born to tigress P-234 two years ago along with a male sibling ‘Panna’ and a female sibling.“The female sibling died on Diwali last year after being run over by a vehicle, while ‘Panna’ is now left alone. Heera (the dead tiger) had moved out of the PTR in July this year. Since the tiger was radio-collared, we came to know that it moved out of the PTR in July and was roaming in Satna district,” he said. Meanwhile, a forest department statement said three persons were arrested in connection with the poaching of tiger ‘Heera’ in Satna.A case was registered against the three poachers, identified as Ramprakash Bagri, Krishna Kol and Munna, under provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act and further legal steps were being taken, the statement said.The All-India Tiger Estimation Report 2018 had revealed that Madhya Pradesh was home to 526 tigers, the highest in any state in the country. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/over-30-tigers-left-mps-panna-reserve-in-recent-years-to-find-new-territory-official-333334

It is aimed at scaring the leaders of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance),” Malik told reporters.Deshmukh was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) late Monday night after over 12 hours of questioning in a money-laundering case linked to an alleged extortion racket in the state police establishment.“Law will take its course. The truth will someday come out if you implicate people,” Malik said. He said the Centre must come clean on former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who had accused Deshmukh of corruption.Singh is missing and two non-bailable warrants have been issued against him in two different cases. In the past, the MVA leaders have accused the Centre’s hand behind Singh’s disappearance.Deshmukh’s arrest is seen as a setback to the Uddhav Thackeray-led government in the state.

02-11-2021||New Delhi||Disastrous weather events rose 3.5 times this October over last year: Govt to parliamentary panel||Disastrous weather events have been rising sharply with September and October 2021 witnessing the highest frequency of extremely heavy rainfall spells over the past five years.There was a 3.5 time increase in the disastrous weather events this October compared to 2020.In a presentation to the parliamentary committee on environment chaired by Congress veteran Jairam Ramesh on Monday, the Ministry of Earth Sciences said extremely heavy rainfall events in September rose from 29 in 2017 to 44 in 2018; 59 in 2019; 61 in 2020 and 89 in 2021.Likewise in October, the number of extremely heavy rain spells rose 3.5 times since the last year from 10 in 2020 to 36 in 2021.The presentation came as world leaders gathered at Glasgow to discuss climate change.Extremely heavy rain events in October were 12 in 2017; 17 in 2019 and 16 in 2020, the ministry said.Extremely heavy rainfall is defined as rainfall above 205.4 mm as against very heavy rainfall which is measured between 115.6 mm and 204.5 mm.Active western disturbance and its interaction with low pressure systems in October besides late withdrawal of southwest monsoon from the country are among the main reasons the government cited for disastrous weather conditions.The ministry said the southwest monsoon set over Kerala on June 3 against the normal date of June 1 and covered the entire country by July 8 against the normal date of July 13.Monsoon withdrawal commenced from October 6 against the normal date of September 17 and withdrew from the entire country on October 25 against the normal date of October 15.“The duration of the monsoon was longer by about three weeks over northwest India and almost normal over south India,” the ministry said, as the world leaders gathered in Glasgow for COP26 climate change conference.The disastrous weather events this year caused flash floods over Odisha, Saurashtra, coastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Gujarat in the months of September 2021.In October extremely heavy rainfall events occurred in Kerala, Uttarakhand and western UP besides Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Vidarbha and south Madhya Pradesh.“Extremely heavy rain over sub Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim and Bihar also led to flash floods and landslides,” the government told the committee.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/disastrous-weather-events-rose-3-5-times-this-october-over-last-year-govt-to-parliamentary-panel-333319

02-11-2021||Chandigarh||Death while reserving railway ticket during leave is attributable to service, rules AFT||Providing relief to the widow of a soldier who had died during casual leave after meeting with an accident while reserving his railway ticket, the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) has held that she is entitled to ‘special family pension’ by treating the death as ‘attributable to military service’.Rifleman Sandeep Kumar of the Rajputana Rifles, who belonged to Bhiwani district in Haryana, was on casual leave in July 2016. On July 3, he had gone to undertake some chores and to get his railway ticket booked for the next day to proceed back to his unit. He died in a road accident while returning home. However, the Court of Inquiry conducted by the Army simply declared the death as ‘neither attributable to, nor aggravated by military service’ although the booked railway ticket was available on record.The AFT’s Chandigarh Bench comprising Justice Mohammad Tahir and Vice Admiral HCS Bisht ruled that such a death would very much fall within the scope of attributability to service since it has a causal connection with the military in terms of Rule 12(f) of Entitlement Rules, which provides that any death which is linked with any obligation, nature or incidence of service even when the person is not on duty, is to be taken as connected with military service.Legal experts say that although the rules are very clear and liberal, many a time military authorities omit mentioning full facts to bring out a connection between the death or disability and military service, thereby leading to denial of benefits to disabled soldiers and widows.  The Supreme Court in the past has held that injuries and death during leave period are to be taken as ‘attributable to service’ even if there is a remote connection between the death or disability and service conditions. In fact, the Supreme Court has also upheld injuries while proceeding to the military canteen during leave as ‘attributable to service’. The Punjab and Haryana High Court, while giving relief to a soldier denied disability pension by the AFT, had earlier overturned the decision of the AFT and had held that an accident while going to the civil market for getting uniform stitched would also be held as connected with service with admissibility of disability pension.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/death-while-reserving-railway-ticket-during-leave-is-attributable-to-service-rules-aft-333316
02-11-2021||New Delhi||Experts welcome Modi’s net-zero emissions commitment by 2070||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday pledged a new climate goal for India — net-zero emissions by 2070.He also committed to generating 50 per cent of all electricity consumed by India from renewable energy sources, reducing emissions intensity by close to 45 per cent and reducing 1 billion tonne carbon emissions by 2030.The pledges have been welcomed by experts and environmentalists who not just called them “transformative steps” but also ones that speak of “India’s leadership and commitment to climate action”.“India has clearly put the ball in the court of the developed world,” Arunabha Ghosh, CEO, Council for Energy, Environment and Water said, calling it “real climate action”.“India has clearly put the ball in the court of the developed world. This is real climate action. Now India demands $1 trillion in climate finance as soon as possible, and will monitor not just climate action but also climate finance. Most importantly, India has called once again for a change in lifestyle. If we cannot fix how we live, we can’t fix how we live on this planet,” Ghosh said.According to Dr Ajay Mathur, Director General, International Solar Alliance, “PM Modi cut through the rhetoric and delivered a big promise of climate action. They speak of India’s leadership and commitment to climate action and the bold announcements have led India from the front at the onset of the Glasgow meeting.”Chandra Bhushan, CEO, iForest called the announcement a big step for climate collaboration, “one that will go a long way in greening the Indian economy and solving the climate crisis”.RR Rashmi from TERI called it a tremendous leadership gesture and commitment to act now and fix the road to 2030.“It also sets the stage for carbon markets. In a way this means absolute emission reductions and this also means that India has set itself to commit to a peak in emissions without saying so explicitly,” as per Rashmi.Some experts also said that coal consumption needs to end one, two or even three decades before the net zero dates laid out by the world.Dave Jones, Global Lead, Ember, said: “The world’s top 10 coal power countries have now all committed to net-zero, as India announces a net-zero pledge at COP26. But coal will need to end one, two or even three decades before the net-zero dates that have been laid out. These net-zero ambitions now need to transform into near-term action on coal. Failing to act on coal will undermine the credibility of net-zero pledges.”Several analysts suggested that with 500GW of non-fossil fuel capacity in the electricity system, India’s thermal assets which are suffering from low efficiency, vagaries of import prices, and demise of global investment in coal, will languish even further.The current installed electricity capacity in India is close to 380GW. The target of 500GW will make the installed renewable energy capacity in next eight years far exceed the total installed as on date.“This shift will be major on several counts. This effectively would also increase India’s installed non-fossil capacity from 40% by 2030 target to >60% by 2030. A target of 500GW non-fossil fuel capacity will mean India will not need to build any new coal power plant,” they said.PM’s five-pronged commitment1.            2030- 500GW of installed non-fossil capacity2.            2030- 50% energy from RE3.            By 2030- carbon emissions reduced by 1bn tonnes4.            2030- 45% emissions intensity reduced5.            2070- Net-ZeroClimate finance: 1tn dollar, pressure on those not meeting finance commitments||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/experts-welcome-modis-net-zero-emissions-commitment-by-2070-333315
02-11-2021||Glasgow||Boris Johnson, Modi agreed on need to rein in fringe anti-India extremist groups: Shringla||Counter-terrorism and the need to rein in extremist activities by certain fringe separatist outfits were among the issues covered during the “short” bilateral exchange between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his British counterpart, Boris Johnson, on the margins of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.In a media briefing at the close of day one of the World Leaders' Summit of the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on Monday night, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla was asked if anti-Indian activities by separatist groups who organise pro-Khalistani activities in the UK were among the issues raised during the talks between the two leaders.“The meeting was short, but it did allow short exchanges on concerns that both our countries have on increasing radicalism,” Shringla said in response.“In many senses, the extremism that we are seeing in certain fringe groups seem to be speaking out on issues that they have no legitimate right to do so and without traction of any kind. But nonetheless, it's causing a certain level of disequilibrium and concern in both our countries,” he said.“Prime Minister Johnson felt fully that some of these groups need to be reined in and that clearly, steps have to be taken to see how such activity, which under no means is democratic or constitutional, could be addressed,” he added.During the media event, the Foreign Secretary reviewed the developments of the World Leaders' Summit, during which the Prime Minister made a “seminal statement” on India's contribution towards climate action by unveiling its National Determined Contributions (NBC) of setting a “realistic, responsible and ambitious” goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2070.“As the Prime Minister has said, climate change for him is an article of faith and India is more than fulfilling its commitments,” said Shringla.He also revealed that while the subject of the extradition of high-profile economic offenders such as Vijay Mallya and Nirav Modi, wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering, was not specifically discussed at length during the short bilateral meeting, the National Security Advisers (NSAs) of both countries are due to deliberate on the issue at length at an upcoming meeting on Wednesday.

02-11-2021||Vibha Sharma||PM Modi sets 2070 net-zero target, demands $1 trillion climate finance||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 1In a major announcement, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today committed to ‘net-zero’ emissions by India by 2070 at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.“India will be net zero by 2070,” the Prime Minister told the world at the high-level segment of COP26 World Leaders’ Summit, upscaling India’s nationally determined contributions (NDCs) which are at the heart of the Paris Agreement.At the same time, however, he also urged developed nations to make $1 trillion climate finance “available at the earliest”, reminding them of climate justice and past “hollow” promises on climate technology and finance. The PM said he was speaking on behalf of all developing countries.“Today, it is important to track climate finance, just like we track the progress of climate mitigation.“It will be an appropriate justice to create pressure on the nations that don’t meet their own promises on climate finance,” he told developed nations, some of whom have been trying to pressurise developing nations to commit net-zero emissions by 2050. The PM’s announcement came as part of the five ‘amrit tatva’ or ‘panchamrit’ from India, as he called them. He said India would increase its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 GW and fulfil 50% of its energy requirement through renewable energy by 2030.“When India took the ambitious pledge of achieving 450 GW installed capacity by 2030 through non-fossil fuel sources, it was seen as overambitious. Now, India is not only on track to achieve this target, but has also decided to further raise it to 500 GW. India has also pledged to fulfil 50% of its energy requirements from renewables by 2030,” he said.Modi said India would also cut down its net projected carbon emission by 1 billion tonnes till 2030. Urging the developed nations to fulfil their long-held promises of technology and finance transfer to developing nations, the PM said just like India had raised its ambition in setting its targets, they also needed to raise their ambitions in climate finance and transfer.“India constitutes 17% of the global population and its contribution to the emission has only been 5%. But today, the entire world admits that India is the only major economy which has delivered on Paris commitments in letter and spirit,” he said“Despite being a developing country, India has shown the way when it comes to safeguarding planet earth. For me, the Paris climate event wasn’t a summit but a sentiment, a commitment. India was not making promises to the world, instead 125 crore Indians were making promises to themselves. I am happy that a developing country like India is working to pull crores of people out of poverty.”Reminding the developed nations of “the reality” of “hollow promises” made so far over climate finance, he said: “When we are taking forward our ambition regarding climate action, the ambitions of world over climate finance cannot keep standing at the point where they were at the time of Paris Agreement.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-modi-sets-2070-net-zero-target-demands-1-trillion-climate-finance-333027

With the state government releasing only 50 per cent of the fertiliser to the Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS) and the remaining to the private sector, those buying from private outlets are being forced to shell out Rs 1,400-Rs 1,500 per bag, Rs 200-Rs 300 higher than the market price. In Haryana, the shortage over the past few days has led to road blockades, loot of the fertiliser from private outlets and its distribution from police stations. Long queues have been witnessed at government and private outlets.Denouncing the claims on shortage, Mandaviya said he had reviewed with officials the production targets of fertilisers for November. “The production will surpass the demand raised by states and UTs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/queues-for-dap-in-punjab-haryana-belie-govts-claims-333034

The Calcutta High Court should have called upon the parties to explain the issue before passing such an "extreme order", it noted.The top court pointed out that its own July 2021 and October 2021 orders banned the use of barium salts in firecrackers but allowed the manufacture, sale, and use of green crackers. However, it gave liberty to the PIL petitioners or any other persons to move the high court again with adequate materials, including those related to ground realities and problems faced by authorities implementing the top court's order.Acting on two PILs highlighting the issue of pollution during the upcoming Diwali, Kali Puja, and other festivals, the Calcutta High Court had on Thursday ordered a total ban on the sale and use of firecrackers on Kali Puja to curb pollution amid the Covid-19 pandemic.The high court had ordered a blanket ban on firecrackers on the ground that it was practically impossible for the executive to identify and take action against violators since there was no mechanism in place to distinguish between ‘crackers’ and ‘green crackers’. Clarifying that its orders applied uniformly to all states, the top court said West Bengal can’t be an exception. Noting that it's not a new issue and the top court and NGT have already put in place proper mechanisms to deal with the manufacture, sale, and use of green crackers, the Bench said, "All the states are following it. Only West Bengal has problems”.As one of the advocates said even Orissa has imposed a total ban on firecrackers, it said, "Let someone challenge it. We will see".‘Poschim Bango Atosbazi Unnayan Samity’—an association of firecracker makers—has demanded compensation of Rs 2 lakh for each licensed fireworks dealer, numbering over 53,000, contending that the livelihood of around four lakh people in the state was at stake. A complete ban on fireworks will raise the possibility of illegal firecrackers flooding the market and flouting the existing noise cap of 90 decibels, it said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-sets-aside-calcutta-hc-order-imposing-total-ban-on-firecrackers-in-west-bengal-332857

It set no domestic phase-out targets, thus allowing major coal-dependent countries like India to carry on with other financing options.“In a very strong message under the health section, it agreed that Covid immunity is a global public good and vaccines deemed to be safe should be mutually accepted,’’ said India’s G20 Sherpa Piyush Goyal. Recognising the spike in energy prices, the G20 agreed to facilitate a dialogue between producers and consumers to bring about stability in energy markets. The G20 also put its seal of approval on an extension of debt relief of $12.7 billion, which will help 50 countries. “In some sense, a lot of the agenda in which India took a leadership role on behalf of the developing countries has been brought into the text,’’ said Goyal.The Indian Sherpa hinted at the cleavage between developed and developing countries that led to the Rome Declaration failing to mention the year by which “net zero” in emissions will be reached.“There is no available technology to enable the grid to absorb large amounts of green energy and yet maintain grid stability. Therefore, we have to look at technology and innovation playing an important role before we identify a year,” he said. Goyal said developed countries should try to achieve “negative net zero” so that they should release some carbon space for developing countries to pursue their development agenda.The G20 declaration merely said it would “pursue efforts to limit temperature to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It also “reaffirmed” the commitment by developed countries to mobilise $100 billion annually till 2025. The declaration also supported a new IMF quota formula within two years. Before leaving Rome for Glasgow on Sunday, PM Narendra Modi met his Spanish counterpart Pedro Sanchez Castejon to deepen ties in areas such as trade, energy and innovation. Late on Saturday, PM Modi met the French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Indonesian President Joe Wikodo and Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong. The PM and US President Joe Biden had also exchanged pleasantries. “I took part in various sessions, participated in bilateral meetings and also met several leaders. It is important nations work together to further global good,” the PM said before departing for Glasgow.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar also held several bilaterals in Rome, main being with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during which they discussed efforts to strengthen Indo-Pacific cooperation through Quad.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/g20-to-stop-funding-coal-plants-mild-pledge-on-climate-change-332584
