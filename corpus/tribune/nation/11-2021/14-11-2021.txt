However, in the last seven years, the BJP government has let the guard down, which has allowed the prices to shoot upwards of Rs 100 per litre.

Our ability to uphold the Constitution sustains our impeccable character. There is no other way to live up to the faith of our people.” the CJI said.“Without robust justice delivery system at the grassroot level, we cannot imagine a healthy judiciary. Therefore, nothing is more important than to preserve, protect and promote the independence and integrity of the judiciary at all levels,” he said addressing the valedictory ceremony of the National Legal Services Authority’s (NALSA) pan-India legal awareness and outreach campaign.“Together, we have been handling the responsibilities entrusted to us by the Constitution with utmost sincerity and commitment. The immense trust reposed by the public at large upon the judiciary, as a last resort of hope, stands testimony to this fact. The Supreme Court and the High Courts are hugely conscious of the Constitutional scheme, which is honoured in letter and spirit by all of us,” Justice Ramana said.He said, “Since our decisions have a huge social impact, they should be easily comprehensible and must be written in a simple and clear language.”“The mind of the Indian judiciary can be known to millions largely through the actions of the Trial Court and the District judiciary. For an overwhelming majority of litigants, what is real and existing is only the district judiciary,” he said.The valedictory ceremony of NALSA’s pan-India legal awareness and outreach campaign – which coincided with the birth anniversary of India’s first Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru – was also addressed by Woman and Child Development Minister Smriti Zubin Irani, NALSA Executive Chairman Justice UU Lalit and Justice AM Khanwilkar.The CJI also announced a cash reward of Rs 11,000 each for disabled children who performed at the function.Justice Ramana said, "The stark divide between haves and have nots is still a reality. No matter how many cherished declarations we successfully arrive at, in the face of poverty, inequity and deprivations, it will all seem pointless."“Despite our being a part of a welfare state, benefits are not trickling down to the intended beneficiaries at the desired levels. People’s aspirations about leading a dignified life are often met with challenges. One of them, primarily, being poverty,” he said.Quoting Pandit Nehru on the impact of poverty, he said, “There could be no real freedom without economic freedom” and that “to call a starving man free, is but to mock him”.The CJI said such people care little for “well-dressed, erudite lawyers or colossal court buildings. All they want is to be relieved of their pain quickly, without exhausting all their resources.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cji-ramana-advocates-absolute-independence-and-boldness-in-the-face-of-adversity-338058

With each passing day, every child who misses out on learning falls further behind in their development and many may never return to school. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable are paying the heaviest price of school closures and many have forgotten to read or write," Kimura said."The future of an entire generation is at stake. We urge parents to come together with school administrations and the government to support safe reopening of schools and learning recovery programmes to reach and benefit all children. Each of us has a role to play in improving learning recovery and opportunities for children in India," he added.

14-11-2021||Nagpur||100 ultras had opened fire from modern weapons on commandos, security personnel in Gadchiroli: Police||As many as 100 Naxals fired indiscriminately at C-60 commandos and jawans of the Special Action Team (SAT) from their sophisticated weapons in the Mardintola forest in Gadchiroli district of Maharashtra when the gun battle broke out on Saturday morning, a senior police officer said on Sunday.   When the fierce encounter ended around 3:30 pm on Saturday after almost 10 hours, senior cadre Milind Teltumbade and 25 ultras had been killed. Addressing a press conference, Gadchiroli SP Ankit Goyal said the police had received intelligence inputs about two days before the Saturday operation about the presence of a Naxal camp in the Mardintola forest in the Gyarapatti area of the Korchi tehsil. DIG (Gadchiroli range) Sandip Patil and other senior police officers were present at the press conference. “A team of 300 police personnel, including C-60 commandos and SAT, along with additional SP Soumya Munde launched the anti-Naxal operation. They started conducting a search operation on Thursday night in the Mardintola forest. Around 6 am on Saturday, over 100 ultras opened a heavy firing with their sophisticated weapons and ammunition on C-60 commandos and Special Action Team (SAT) personnel,” he said.The encounter left 26 ultras dead and four security personnel injured, he added. Goyal said 16 bodies have been identified so far with the help of the ultras who have surrendered. He said many of the slain Naxals carried huge rewards on their heads, including top Maoist leader Milind Teltumbde who carried a bounty of Rs 50 lakh. “Killing of Milind Teltumbde will affect the Naxal movement very badly not only in Maharashtra but across India,” Goyal added. Teltumbde was a wanted accused in the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, a senior police official said earlier in the day.

This desperate hurry smacks of something fishy,” CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said in a tweet.The directors of the CBI and the ED enjoy a fixed tenure of two years from the date of their appointment in the wake of the directives of the Supreme Court in the famous Vineet Narain case.TMC Rajya Sabha MP Derek O’Brien said the ordnances were brought to “mock” Parliament.“How Modi-Shah’s BJP mock #Parliament and shamelessly use Ordinances. Same stunt repeated today to keep their pet parrots in ED and CBI,” he said in a tweet, also posting a chart of previous such ordinances brought in by the government ostensibly to bypass Parliament.

We all know that our nation got its Independence from British rule through ultimate sacrifices and martyrdom of our great freedom fighters," she wrote.Highlighting that Ranaut's statements have hurt the sentiments of millions of Indians and are "seditious" in nature, she urged the president to "kindly take cognizance of the matter and withdraw the Padma Shri honour bestowed upon Ms Ranaut"."I also request you to kindly ensure that an FIR is registered against her on charges of sedition. I hope that you will uphold the sentiments of crores of Indians and do the needful in the matter," Maliwal stressed.The DCW chief said Ranaut, "through her insensitive and thoughtless lies", had demeaned and belittled "the sacrifices of millions of Indians who participated" in various movements such as the revolt of 1857, the Champaran Satyagrah, the Khilafat Movement, the Quit India Movement, the Dandi March and the Non Cooperation Movement among several others."How can we forget the thousands who had assembled at the Jallianwala Bagh to protest against British rule and the massacre that followed? Are these chapters in our history a 'bheek'?" Maliwal sought to know.She also pointed out that it was not a stray incident by the actor and that "Ranaut appears to not be of sound mind"."She habitually spews venom against people of her own country and has repeatedly used vile language to attack those she does not agree with. Her behaviour is in no way befitting of the recipient of the highest award in the country and is also an insult to the stalwarts who received the award with and before her," Maliwal added.Ranaut was recently awarded the Padma Shri.

India presented the way for a constructive debate and equitable and just solutions at the forum,” he said.Yadav, while noting India’s efforts, including on solar energy, said there has been a lot of talk about and around Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), “the lack of commitment on climate finance is troublesome”.“There is a wide mismatch between climate finance and mitigation efforts. The record on means of implementation support to developing countries has been dismal so far. India looks forward to a change in finance and technology support to developing countries going forward,” he said.At the plenary earlier, instead of agreeing to “phase-out” of coal power in the final text, Yadav read out a new version of the paragraph that used “phase-down”, ensuring a last-minute change of language on fossil fuel in the Glasgow Climate Pact at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that concluded last night.In a statement, he said developing countries have a right to their fair share of the global carbon budget and are entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels within this scope. “Fossil fuels and their use have enabled parts of the world to attain high levels of growth. Even now, developed countries have not completely phased out coal. The UNFCCC refers to mitigation of GHG emissions from all sources. UNFCCC is not directed at any particular source. Developing countries have a right to their fair share of the global carbon budget and are entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels within this scope,” he said.“India has maintained that the current climate crisis has been precipitated by unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns mainly in the developed countries. The world needs to awaken to this reality,” he said.Speaking of the “new mantra for sustainable development” given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the climate summit, Yadav said ‘LIFE’ (Lifestyle for Environment) can be the foundation for the same.“When facing challenges of a planetary scale, such as climate change, the message of ‘vasudhaivkutumbakam’ or the ‘world as one family’ needs to be amplified more than ever. India’s message to the world is that it needs to shift towards lifestyles that value moderation over excess,” he said.India’s goals include non-fossil energy capacity to reach 500 GW by 2030 and meeting 50 per cent of its energy requirements with renewable energy by the year India will reduce its total projected carbon emissions by one billion tonnes from now and reduce the carbon intensity of its economy to less than 45 per cent by 2030. By 2070, India will achieve the target of net zero emissions.“India achieved some remarkable results in terms of climate finance issues, including a work programme on new collective quantified goal, support for enhanced transparency framework for developing countries, Article 6 rule book, adaptation, common timeframe, at the COP26 negotiations,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bhupender-yadav-calls-cop26-success-from-indias-standpoint-338036
14-11-2021||New Delhi||IMA pushes for Covid-19 vaccine for all diabetes patients||Noticing their vulnerabilities, IMA on Sunday demanded Covid-19 vaccination for all diabetes patients, including a third dose, if needed.The IMA on Sunday launched a campaign for early detection and mitigation of diabetes complications with organising of walkathon, marathon, screening camps, and a social media drive.The campaign also included research paper promotion among young doctors and an “intense” personal intervention at hospitals.The campaign, launched on the occasion of world Diabetes Day, will run for 10 days and will aim to reach one billion people, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) said in a statement.As part of the campaign, the IMA has joined hands with the association of Physicians of India, RSSDI, Endocrine Society, and many other niche organisations.As per the data from the 10th Edition of the IDF Diabetes Atlas, diabetes caused 6.7 million deaths in 2021, with 537 million adults (aged 20 to 79 years) around the world currently living with the condition.Their number is predicted to rise to 643 million by 2030 and 784 million by 2045, the statement said.In India, more than 77 million adults are living with diabetes and researchers predict that this will increase to 134 million by 2045.World Diabetes Day became an official United Nations Day in 2006 with the passage of United Nation Resolution 61/225.It is held every year on November 14 to mark the birthday of Sir Frederick Banting, who co-discovered insulin along with Charles Best in 1922.The theme for World Diabetes Day 2021-23 is access to diabetes care.Even after 100 years of the discovery of insulin, millions of people with diabetes around the world do not have access to the kind of care they need, the doctors’ body said.Its patients require continuous care and support to manage their condition and avoid complications, they said.To make insulin accessible, IMA’s state and local branches will set up special centres to help people get insulin therapy at appropriate times, the statement said.The World Diabetes Day logo—a blue circle—will be depicted by blue light and blue balloon during the campaign at all IMA branches.Also, special sessions will be organised during the week at ‘blue corners’ to make people aware about diabetes and complications caused by it, the statement said.According to a 2021 review, people who live in cities and metropolitan areas in India are more likely to develop diabetes than ever before.This is due in part to a city lifestyle that is marked by sedentariness, stress, junk food, smoking, and liquor consumption.All these factors lead to an increase in a person’s body mass index (BMI) - a major risk factor in causing diabetes, the statement said.Overall, women have a higher risk of developing diabetes than males, but as both groups get older, the risk decreases, it said.Although diabetes figures are high, researchers estimate that 57 per cent of cases remain undiagnosed. This is particularly concerning, as the risk of serious complications increases when people do not take medication to control their blood sugar, it added.The IMA campaign includes holding programmes in both urban and rural areas to promote detection of these hidden and Pre-diabetes cases.It also spoke about the diabetic foot, terming it a dreaded complication, and saying that 80 per cent of amputations of leg In India are due to this condition.The association said such complications are preventable if proper care is given.To improve dietary habits of the patients, IMA has also joined hands with the Food Safety department of government of India and propagate an ‘Eat Right campaign’.Under it, IMA is organising a one-day training programme to teach the trainers in each state with the help of FSSAI, so that they can coach people on their diet further in their respective states.

14-11-2021||New Delhi||Please spare me your sympathy: Narasimha Rao told Cabinet colleagues after Babri demolition||The morning after the Babri mosque was demolished on December 6, 1992, the Union Council of Ministers met and when they tried to convey how they all felt for the then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, he retorted: “Please spare me your sympathy”.This anecdote finds mention in senior Congress leader Salman Khurshid’s new book “Sunrise over Ayodhya: Nationhood in Our Times”.Khurshid says the immediate shock of the “unthinkable happening” gradually settled down to a kind of numbness.The demolition happened on a Sunday and on the morning of December 7, the Council of Ministers gathered in a crowded ground-floor room at Parliament House, he says.The mood was sombre, and a pall of gloom hung on the gathering.“Understandably, most were at a loss for words, but Madhavrao Scindia broke the ice to say how we all felt for Prime Minister Narasimha Rao. The reaction of the embattled PM took us by surprise when he retorted, ‘Please spare me your sympathy’,” Khurshid recalls.He also says after Rao’s “curt response”, there was no further opportunity for discussing the subject again and the meeting ended.The Uttar Pradesh government of Kalyan Singh was dismissed on December 6 itself and a week thereafter, the BJP governments in Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh were dismissed by the President, as advised by the cabinet, he says.Khurshid also writes that on the night of December 6, he and some other young ministers, “gathered at the residence of Rajesh Pilot to take stock, and then proceeded together to CK Jaffer Sharief—thus two bold voices in the government were roused”.He says calls were “made to Principal Secretary AN Verma, who suggested that we speak to the PM. We got through to the PM and suggested to him that Rajesh Pilot be included in the group that was flying to Faizabad”.Rao “in turn asked us to speak to AN Verma again, and thus the chase continued for a while, until we were told that the PM would not be available, having turned in for the night. The urgency was for a senior functionary of the government to intervene before the idols, which had been shifted during the demolition of the mosque, were reinstalled on the site”, he writes.The reinstallation was eventually done, but when it appeared the next morning that a roof would be placed above the idols, the government moved to disperse the conspicuously reduced crowd of karsevaks, he adds.According to Khurshid, the politics shaped by the temple-mosque contest drove the Congress to an existential crisis in Uttar Pradesh and, after temporary empowerment of the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samajwadi Party, gave the BJP a springboard for dominance in the state and in Centre.“The Ayodhya saga was undoubtedly related to certain organised groups among Hindus and Muslims trying to secure leadership of their respective communities by tilting the scales in favour of a mandir and a mosque, respectively,” he says.The Supreme Court, Khurshid claims, has “put its stamp on history and in a sense turned the last page. It has, in the process, written itself into the history” of Ayodhya.If that has laid the foundation of a grand reconciliation or perpetuated the stress of majoritarian might versus right, or a mixture of the two, only time will tell, he adds.Khurshid feels the greatest opportunity the judgment offers is for a reaffirmation of India as a secular society.“It is a decision that refutes the idea of Hindu Rashtra and amplifies the practical handling of sensitive religious concerns in a secular system. Upholding the purpose and effect of the Places of Worship Act, among other matters, is a clear indication that the secular edifice of India and the commitment of its highest court to the Constitutional principles we cherish have not only remained undisturbed but have indeed been fortified,” he writes.Khurshid says his book, published by Penguin Random House, is an “attempt to see hope in what might be a judicious decision, even if some people think it was not entirely fair. When people begin to disagree about what is fair, there are cracks that need attention beyond all sentiments natural to human beings”. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/please-spare-me-your-sympathy-narasimha-rao-told-cabinet-colleagues-after-babri-demolition-338021
14-11-2021||New Delhi||Over 400 per cent rise in cyber crime cases committed against children in 2020: NCRB||More than 400 per cent increase in cyber crime cases committed against children was reported in 2020 in comparison to 2019, with most of them relating to publishing or transmitting of materials depicting children in sexually explicit act, according to the latest NCRB data.Top five states reporting cyber crimes against children are: Uttar Pradesh (170), Karnataka (144), Maharashtra (137), Kerala (107) and Odisha (71), the National Crimes Record Bureau data stated.Among the 842 cases of online offences, 738 cases were about publishing or transmitting materials depicting children in sexually explicit act.As the NCRB 2020 data reveals, there is a sharp rise (over 400 per cent) in cyber crimes (registered under the Information Technology Act) committed against children in comparison to the last year.In 2019, 164 cases of cyber crimes against children were reported while in 2018, 117 cases of cyber crimes were committed against children and 79 such cases were registered in 2017.Even though the number of cyber crime cases committed against children in 2020 remain small, its rise from 2019 is alarming.Puja Marwaha, CEO, CRY-Child Rights and You, said while spending more time on internet for accessing education and other communication purposes, children have also become more vulnerable to multiple risks, particularly in the contexts of online sexual abuse, grooming or sexual solicitation, sexting, exposure to pornography, production and circulation of child sexual abuse material, cyber-bullying, online harassment and cyber-victimisation, and many other privacy-related risks."While there is little evidence to ascertain the scale of the impact of the epidemic containment measures on online abuse and exploitation of children, closure of schools and children's increased exposure to the online space may have had serious implications on the increased online risks experienced by them," she added.During the Covid pandemic, measures taken to contain the spread of the pandemic have resulted in closure of schools and movement to virtual learning environments. Children also spent more time online for entertainment, social and educational purposes, whilst not necessarily being aware of any associated risks.According to the UNICEF report (2020), 13 per cent of children and people aged 25 years or less in South Asia accessed the internet at home. The report also states that in lower-middle income countries only 14 per cent school-age children (3-17 years) have internet access at home.However, there is no conclusive data available in the public domain to ascertain the numbers of children accessing the internet for education and other purposes across India, especially during the pandemic.The UNICEF (2020) report, however, estimated that during the Covid pandemic around 37.6 million children across 16 states in India continued education through various remote learning initiatives such as online classrooms and radio programmes.Marwaha said due to lockdown and closure of schools, limited opportunity for socialisation has also affected the psycho-social well-being of children."This may lead to increased loneliness, mood to conduct disorders, substance abuse or anxiety disorders. And, they may be predisposed to using the internet compulsively, accessing objectionable content or simply be more vulnerable to getting bullied or abused," she said.Marwaha called for a need for cohesion between forums for internet governance policy and child protection on the existing discourse on children's digital rights."The Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD) has a crucial role in facilitating this discourse. This will help in addressing the gaps in legislative and policy measures on several cyber safety issues such as criminalisation of cyberbullying and sexting among peers and categorisation of self-generated images as Child Sexual Abuse Material," she said."There is limited understanding among caregivers, educators and society regarding children's experiences with ICTs and perceived risks that they face online. There is a need to help caregivers, educators and parents to understand what children should know so as to be able appropriately and responsibly and be able to guide them. The existing awareness building programmes lack common content focus, are fragmented and have limited outreach," Marwaha added.She also stressed on the need for a coordinated approach for equipping children, caregivers, teachers and the public with skills for safeguarding against online threats and being responsible digital citizens.

14-11-2021||Karachi||20 Indian fishermen released from Pakistan jail; transported to Wagah border for handover on Monday: Official||Landhi jail Superintendent Irshad Shah said the fishermen, mostly belonging to Gujarat, were released as a goodwill gesture after the Indian authorities confirmed their nationalities."They had served four years in jail and have been released today as a goodwill gesture by our government,” Shah said.The Edhi Trust Foundation, a non-profit social welfare organisation, made arrangements to transport the fishermen to the Wagah border in Lahore from where they will be handed over to the Indian authorities on Monday."We have handed them over to the Edhi Foundation which is taking care of all their travel and other expenses. They will travel to Lahore by Allama Iqbal Express train,” Shah said.The officer said there were 588 more Indian nationals, the majority of them fishermen, who are still languishing in Landhi jail.“We release them once we get approval from the Sindh Home Department as we got yesterday to release these 20 Indian fishermen,” he added.The fishermen were arrested by the Pakistan Maritime Security Force (PMSF) and handed over to the dock police for allegedly fishing illegally in Pakistani waters.The Pakistan government had also released 20 Indian fishermen early last year and another batch of 100 Indian fishermen in April 2019 as a goodwill gesture.Fishermen from Pakistan and India usually end up in jails after they are arrested for fishing illegally in each other's territorial waters.A senior official of the NGO Pakistan Fishermen Forum said that due to the absence of a clear demarcation line in the coastal area of the Arabian Sea between the two countries, these fishermen who do not possess the modern-day navigation equipment mistakenly cross the red lines and ended up in jails. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/20-indian-fishermen-released-from-pakistan-jail-transported-to-wagah-border-for-handover-on-monday-official-338006
14-11-2021||Lucknow||BJP stands for arrogance, lies, says Akhilesh Yadav||Responding to Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s jibe against his party, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday attacked the BJP saying it stands for arrogance, lies, and inflation.Akhilesh’s response came a day after Shah’s speech in Azamgarh, in which he termed the SP as a party that stands for “Jinnah, Azam Khan and Mukhtar (Ansari)”, giving it the acronym ‘JAM’.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in past used ‘JAM’ as a shorthand to publicise his vision of getting a ‘Jan Dhan Bank account, Aadhaar, and Mobile phone’ to every person in the country.On Sunday, Akhilesh used the same acronym to attack the BJP.“For BJP, ‘J’ stands for ‘Jhooth’ (lie), ‘A’ stands for ‘Ahankaar(arrogance), and ‘M’ stands for ‘Mahangaai’ (inflation),” he said addressing a press conference in Kushinagar.In his address, Akhilesh criticized the BJP for rising prices of petrol and diesel across the country.He alleged the BJP is pandering to the poor only because election is around the corner in Uttar Pradesh.“If the BJP stays in power, it (fuel price) will touch Rs 150. They are not increasing the price as election is round the corner,” he said.“The poor are being given food grains only till the elections. They (BJP) are saying that it has been extended from Holi to Diwali,” he said, adding that if his party comes to power, food will be available round the year. Addressing a rally in the SP bastion of Azamgarh on Saturday, Shah had said that Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has rid the Purvanchal region of “mosquitoes and mafia”.He claimed that while Modi strived to give a “corruption-free” government, SP was inducting in its fold people like Mukhtar Ansari, a don-turned-politician. “You should tell me whether you want BJP’s JAM or SP’s JAM. These people can never work for the welfare of Uttar Pradesh. They indulge in dividing people on the basis of caste, causing riots, appeasement, and vote-bank politics,” Shah had said.He attacked the SP chief yet again for naming Muhammad Ali Jinnah—the founder of Pakistan—among other freedom fighters. “There are so many people from the minority community here. Is there anyone here who sees greatness in Jinnah,” Shah had said.In an address in Hardoi on October 31, Akhilesh kicked up a controversy when he said Jinnah got his barristership from the same place as did Mahatma Gandhi, Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel, and Jawaharlal Nehru, people who got India freedom. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-stands-for-arrogance-lies-says-akhilesh-yadav-338003

Concrete remedial action must be taken immediately to arrest the savings or excess to an optimum level,” the memorandum states.Besides, the same type of explanation or reasons are given for the savings or excess incurred year after year without even addressing the basic issue involved for such recurrences, which shows that no sincere efforts have been made to ensure optimum utilization of the allocated funds, the memorandum pointed out.India’s total defence budget, including miscellaneous provisions and pensions, was reported to be Rs 4,78,195.62 crore for the 2021-22 fiscal, which is 13.73 per cent of the total Central Government expenditure and 2.15 per cent of GDP for the year 2021-22. India’s defence spending in terms of total government expenditure for 2021-22 was the lowest in past six years.The Union Budget, of which defence estimates form a part, is presented on February 1, and the preparation process commences a few months earlier. Data compilation and its scrutiny is an extremely important aspect and all pertinent financial figures and estimates are provided by ground-level officials.The Finance Wing has stressed upon utmost caution and accuracy to be ensured while estimating requirement of funds for Revised Estimates 2021-22 and Budgetary Estimates 2022-23, after taking into account all the instructions issued by the Ministry of Finance and adherence to expenditure control measures during current as well as the ensuing financial year.The MoD has also directed that in order to ensure budgetary projections are made after an accurate and realistic assessment of the requirements as well as visualisation of the actual and anticipated expenditure, detailed reasons in respect of each component where there is an increase or decrease by 10 per cent or move over the previous year should be recorded.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mod-raps-officials-for-weak-control-and-mundane-approach-in-budget-exercise-337990

Noting that at times cows, buffaloes and bulls suffer from various diseases, the Chief Minister said, “We have thought that like ‘108’ (an ambulance service for citizens), ‘109’ ambulance services should be started for animals.”   The animals will not need to be transported, which is a difficult task, to the hospital and a veterinary doctor will reach the spot for their treatment, he said.Chouhan also said the state government has developed cow sanctuaries and shelters, but they require the participation of society for better functioning.

14-11-2021||New Delhi||Airports Authority of India likely to procure two counter-drone systems||The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is likely to procure two counter-drone systems worth Rs 9.9 crore in 2022-23, according to an official document.“The counter-drone system should provide a multi-sensor based complete and comprehensive solution with regards to drone detection, tracking, identification and neutralisation,” said the document issued by airport systems directorate of the AAI.The document—which has been accessed by PTI—stated that the AAI is projected to purchase two counter drone systems with an estimated value of procurement of Rs 9.9 crore in financial year 2022-23.In June this year, rogue drones had dropped two bombs at the Indian Air Force station at Jammu airport, injuring two of its personnel.Reacting to the Jammu attack, Smit Shah, director - Partnerships, Drone Federation of India (DFI), in June had said that India needs to invest more in counter-drone research and technology and procure them in a planned manner to address the security concerns arising from rogue operations, the unmanned aerial vehicles.India has a few companies doing indigenous research and a few companies partnering with foreign vendors but more focus needs to be brought in this domain of counter-drone technology, he had noted.Counter-drone technology uses radars, radio-frequency devices, electro-optical methods, acoustic mechanisms or combined sensors technology to stop the unmanned aerial vehicles.In October 2019, the Civil Aviation ministry had issued a policy document primarily to deal with possible security challenges from rogue drones to key installations like nuclear power plants and military bases.Titled ‘National Counter Rogue Drones Guidelines’, the document said it was a matter of concern that small drones were proliferating at a rate that has alarmed battlefield commanders and planners alike.“The utilisation of armed drones by extremist groups to carry out reconnaissance and targeting strategic Israeli installations during Israel-Lebanon war is an example of escalation of terrorist and insurgent drone capabilities,” according to the document.The policy document said multiple incidents of sightings of drones in the vicinity of commercial airliners and major airports like New Delhi and Mumbai have raised flight safety concerns.“Further, the upsurge in drone use has also increased the threat quotient for VVIPs who can be targeted through rogue drones,” it said.There is no official data about the number of civilian drones operating in India. However, it is estimated that there are about 4-6 lakh drones in the country. A significant number of parts—which are used in manufacturing drones—are imported from China and many other countries.

He was in Azamgarh with CM Yogi Adityanath to lay the foundation stone of a state university named after OBC icon Raja Suhel Dev.Referring to Akhilesh’s “Jinnah” remark, Shah said “Jinnah holds a special relevance for Akhilesh”. Under the SP, Azamgarh was known as a “terror sanctuary and for fundamentalist thinking”, he said.“It was made a den of anti-national activities. But today, a ‘Maa Saraswati dham’ (university) is being set up, which will change the image of Azamgarh,” Shah said, referring to terrorism cases traced back to Azamgarh.Yogi said setting up of the university would turn “Azamgarh into Aryamgarh”. Hitting out at SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and Akhilesh, he said Azamgarh might have given two CMs and also sent them to the Lok Sabha, but its identity and image did not improve. “Before 2014, a person from Azamgarh had problem in even getting a hotel room anywhere in the country,” he claimed, talking of demand to rename it as “Aryamgarh”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amit-shah-accuses-akhilesh-of-appeasement-politics-337802

In the first survey on the physical health of children, forced to stay at home during a raging pandemic, Delhi’s Ganga Ram Hospital experts reached a sample of 1,309 children from across the national capital.36.8% respondents reported sedentary life as a major cause of weight gain27.55% said sleeping late was a triggering factor22.4% blamed it on overeatingObesity epidemicWe need to act now and stop youth from becoming diabetic and hypertensive. We have to stop making them prone to disorders. ResearchersSudhir Kalhan, chairman, Institute of Minimal Access, Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery at the hospital, said today, “We conducted a survey on 1,309 children who were forced to sit at home during the Covid crisis. We found a shocking response as there was an over 10 per cent weight gain among 60 per cent of the respondents, which is 785 children.”The survey detected that 36.8 per cent of the respondents reported sedentary life as a major cause of weight gain, whereas 27.55 per cent reported sleeping late as the triggering factor. The experts found 22.4 per cent children reporting overeating as the cause of weight gain.“With no schools, no physical activity, lots of uncertainty, deaths around them and abnormal sleep cycles, children are now facing multiple physical, behavioural and lifestyle disorders, which need immediate medical attention on a larger scale,” Kalhan said, releasing his findings.Experts warn against a rising epidemic of child obesity and call for policy action, considering 60 per cent of the population is less than 35 years. “Eight per cent GDP growth is encouraging, but we need to act now to stop the young population from becoming diabetic, suffering from mental disorders or becoming hypertensive. All economic growth would have to be diverted towards public health spending if obesity epidemic is not contained now,” the researchers said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/three-in-5-kids-gained-10-weight-in-pandemic-survey-337803

Developing countries are “entitled” to use fossil fuels, he said after draft text encouraged nations to accelerate away from polluting energy. He said developing nations had the right to use the remainder of the “global carbon budget”. What has emerged finally was that while rich countries agreed to accelerate climate action with fossil-fuel phaseout pledge, they refused crisis support for poorest.Earlier in the day, observers said several sticking points, especially financial help to poor nations, remained. The new version of the agreement continues to refer to “accelerating efforts towards phasing out unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”, which environmentalists dismissed as “watered-down”. However, this is the first time that coal has been explicitly mentioned in a UN document of this type.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cop26-concludes-with-glasgow-climate-pact-337810

The IED attack on a hill road shattered the tenuous peace as the Assam Rifles personnel engaged the militants in a do-or-die fight.The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of Manipur has taken responsibility for the attack. In a statement, it said, “The PLA and the Manipur Naga People’s Front attacked the convoy of 46 Assam Rifles in which their Commanding Officer and six other personnel were killed.” The statement said the cadres did not know that CO’s (Colonel Tripathi’s) family was also in the convoy. In the “disturbed area”, family and kids should not be accompanied, the PLA said.Sources said PLA’s recruits had trained in big numbers in China and at insurgent camps in Myanmar.

In a meeting with a visiting Taliban delegation, the Pakistan PM said Islamabad would “favourably” consider its request for transporting wheat as a humanitarian gesture.Pakistan has also anno-unced that it will release 20 fishermen from custody on Monday. “The PM conveyed that within the present context, Pakistan would favourably consider the request by Afghan brothers for transportation of wheat provided by India for humanitarian functions as per modalities to be worked out,” said the official Twitter handle of the Pakistan PM. In October, UN’s World Meals Programme (WFP) director in Afghanistan Mary Ellen had said they were in talks with India for wheat donation to Afghanistan. India had also separately announced a 50,000-tonne wheat aid to Afghanistan, but said the condition of unimpeded access was not being met.India has already sent a note verbale to Pakistan stating its intention to send trucks carrying 50,000 tonnes of wheat to Afghanistan and seeking Islamabad’s transit permission.Pakistan’s explanation for keeping trucks waiting at the Wagah-Attari ICP was that it needed time to plan out such a large number of trucks crossing its territory. It is not yet clear whether Pakistan will insist that the wheat be unloaded from Indian trucks and transported by Pakistani goods carriers. Pakistan also announced the release of 20 fishermen, which is a miniscule proportion of the over 500 fishermen in its custody.Sources here see this gesture as an attempt to dial down maritime tensions and avoid retribution after its coast guard shot and killed an Indian fisherman and critically injured another for allegedly crossing the maritime boundary.Before the killing of the fishermen, Pakistan was obdurate on two occasions.

Chouhan hailed Rani Kamalapati as pride of the Gond community and “the last Hindu queen of Bhopal”.Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to dedicate to the country the railway station which has been redeveloped and provided with airport-like amenities on November 15.Modi will be visiting the Madhya Pradesh capital to address a tribal convention to mark ‘Janjatiya Gaurav Diwas’ in remembrance of the tribal icon and freedom fighter Birsa Munda.“People of Madhya Pradesh are thankful to the Prime Minister for renaming the Habibganj railway station after Rani Kamalapati, the Gond queen of Bhopal,” Chouhan said in a statement.The prime minister enhanced the glory of tribals by renaming this “most-modern railway station of the country” after the Gond queen, he said.“Rani Kamalapati is the pride of the Gond community and last Hindu queen of Bhopal. Her kingdom was usurped by Afghan commander Dost Mohammed by deceit through a conspiracy. When she saw that victory was not possible, she committed ‘Jal Jauhar’ (ritual suicide) to save her honour,” Chouhan said.Her son Naval Shah was killed at Lalghati, a part of today’s Bhopal, he noted.On Friday, the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh had written to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, seeking renaming of the redeveloped Habibganj railway station after Rani Kamalapati, stating that it will honour the legacy and bravery of the widow of the Gond ruler Nizam Shah.Chouhan, in a tweet on Saturday, reiterated that she was “the last Hindu queen of Bhopal.” “Habibganj railway station has been named ‘Rani Kamalapati’ after her. It is a matter of great satisfaction and joy for me. Prime minister Narendra Modi I thank you from my heart,” the chief minister added.The gazette notification said the “Government of India has no objection to changing the name of Habibganj Railway Station as Rani Kamalapati Railway Station.” The work of changing old name boards at the railway station, located in the new Bhopal area, also started.Congress MLA from Bhopal Central Arif Masood said the land on which the railway station stands was donated by Habibullah Khan, therefore it was named after him.“It would have been better if they had paid attention to development than engaging in the politics of name change. A lot of money is spent on name change. Instead, this money should be given to the families of pandemic victims and for providing free ration,” he said.The state’s Public Relations Department shared a news clip on Twitter, saying that the station was built in 1905 and then it was known as Shahpur. It was named Habibganj station in 1979 when it was expanded.The Gond community is the largest tribal group of India with more than 1.2 crore population.On Thursday, BJP MP from Bhopal Pragya Singh Thakur had demanded that the Habibganj station be renamed after former prime minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee.The station comes under the jurisdiction of the West Central Railway.The Kamlapati Palace overlooking the Upper and Lower Lakes of Bhopal is named after the Gond queen.

14-11-2021||New Delhi||I’m a farmer, I know poor farmers can’t afford machinery for stubble management: SC judge||Supreme Court judge Justice Surya Kant on Saturday said he is a farmer and Chief Justice NV Ramana hails from a farmer family and they know that poor and marginalised farmers in northern states cannot afford to buy machinery for stubble management.“You are saying two lakh machines are available, but the poor farmers cannot afford these machines. After the agrarian laws, the landholding in UP, Punjab and Haryana is less than 3 acres. We can’t expect those farmers to purchase those machines,” Justice Kant told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.“Why can’t the Centre and the state governments provide the machines? Take away the stubble for use in paper mills and various other purposes. In winters the stubble can be used for fodder for goats, etc. in Rajasthan,” he said.The apex court was hearing a plea filed by environmental activist Aditya Dubey and law student Aman Banka, who sought directions to provide stubble-removing machines to small and marginal farmers for free.Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the top court that these machines are being made available at 80 per cent subsidised rate.The top court judge asked Mehta, appearing for the Centre, could the officials assisting him point out the actual price after subsidy.“Can the farmer afford it? I am a farmer and I know it, the CJI is also from a farmer family he also knows it and my brother (judge) also knows it,” Justice Kant, who was sitting as part of a special bench headed by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana and also having Justice DY Chandrachud, said.Justice Kant also said it has become a fashion to blame the farmers for air pollution.Justice Kant also demanded whether other measures such as firecracker ban and vehicular emission control were implemented.“Be the petitioners, the Delhi government or anybody else—it has become a fashion to blame the farmers. Have you seen how crackers are being burnt in Delhi for the last seven days? What was the Delhi police doing?” he asked.The observations came after senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, mentioned the issue of stubble burning.The apex court has asked the Centre to hold a meeting with stakeholders and revert on Monday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/im-a-farmer-i-know-poor-farmers-cant-afford-machinery-for-stubble-management-sc-judge-337645
14-11-2021||Amravati/Mumbai||Curfew in Amravati as fresh violence erupts; Raut says ploy to destabilise state govt||A curfew was imposed in Maharashtra's Amravati city on Saturday after a mob hurled stones on shops during a bandh allegedly organised by BJP in protest against rallies taken out by members of a minority community the day before against the purported communal violence in Tripura, police said.  Police resorted to lathicharge to control the situation, an Amravati Police official said.On Saturday morning, hundreds of people, many of them holding saffron flags in their hands and raising slogans, came out on streets in Rajkamal Chowk area of this east Maharashtra city, located around 670 km from the state capital.Some members of the mob hurled stones at the shops and damaged them in the Rajkamal Chowk and some other places, the official said, adding that the police lathicharged the protesters to bring the situation under control.Against the backdrop of back to back incidents of stone-pelting on Friday and Saturday, officiating police commissioner Sandip Patil issued orders imposing a curfew in the city limits of Amravati under sections 144(1), (2), (3) of the CrPc to avoid any untoward incidents.  Except for medical emergencies, people are not allowed to come out of their houses. Similarly, a gathering of more than five people is not allowed, as per the order. The curfew will remain in force till further notice. On Friday, various cities in Maharashtra had witnessed stone-pelting during rallies taken out by some Muslim organisations protesting against the purported communal violence in Tripura. These incidents were reported from Amravati, Nanded, Malegaon, Washim and Yavatmal districts. Police have so far arrested 20 people and detained four others by registering 20 FIRs under various charges, including rioting, in connection with Friday's incidents. In Amravati, over 8,000 people had gathered outside the district collector's office on Friday to submit a memorandum demanding that atrocities against the minority community be stopped.  When people were leaving after submitting the memorandum, stone-pelting took place at three places between Chitra Chowk and Cotton Market under the limits of the Kotwali police station. Meanwhile, launching a veiled attack on opposition BJP, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Saturday said the violence in Amravati and other places is aimed at destabilising the MVA government.  Speaking to reporters in Aurangabad, Raut said the state government is firm in the saddle and that the real faces of the perpetrators of violence will be exposed soon. "The violence that is taking place in Maharashtra is aimed at destabilising the MVA government. Raising the bogey of violence, they (Opposition) will meet the state governor and write letters to the Union home ministry claiming that the (law and order) situation in Maharashtra is deteriorating. This will happen in future too. But the state government is firm in the saddle," Raut said.  He said the "real faces" behind this violence will be exposed in the inquiry of the state Home ministry.  The Shiv Sena, NCP, and Congress are the constituents of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.  A day after the bandh was observed by Muslim organisations, Amravati district guardian minister Yashomati Thakur said some anti-social elements are trying to vitiate the atmosphere by throwing stones on shops."The state government will take necessary action. However, some people are using this for political gains," she said and appealed to people to not believe in rumours.AIMIM MP Imtiaz Jaleel has also condemned the violence in Amravati."I want to question those leaders in the state who came to power by taking the votes of Muslims and why they didn't condemn the violence in Tripura. If this violence in Maharashtra is a 'tit for tat' by any political party then this is the example of irresponsibility," he said.Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis said it was wrong to organise rallies in the state for an incident that "never occurred" in Tripura and appealed to people to exercise restraint.“The Tripura government and local police have clarified that no religious place of a minority community was burned down. They have issued pictures of the same as well. I appeal to both the communities to observe restrain,” the former chief minister told reporters in Mumbai.The senior BJP leader also said that political parties in the state government should not give inflammatory statements."It is absolutely wrong to hold rallies here in Maharashtra for an incident that has not even taken place in Tripura state. It is wrong to attack shops of a particular community,” he said.

He confessed that he had become a drug addict and had started selling narcotics to make money. Since he found the drug trade lucrative, he decided to manufacture methamphetamine and had set up a mini laboratory in his office," the official said. A police team raided Savani's office in Rajvir Complex in Sarthana and seized glass beakers, stove and glass connectors, and some raw materials such as liquid methanol, he said. Savani had claimed that he had learnt some techniques of drug making by watching YouTube videos and drug dealers from Rajasthan had also provided him guidance, the official said. As the accused had just started his experiments in the laboratory, he had not been successful in making the contraband as yet, Tomar said, adding that Savani had bought the raw material online through an e-commerce platform.

14-11-2021||New Delhi||Air pollution in Delhi-NCR: Take urgent steps to deal with emergency situation, SC tells Govt||As air pollution in Delhi-NCR reaches alarming proportions, the Supreme Court on Saturday asked the Government to take immediate steps, including a possible lockdown, to deal with the “emergency” situation. “Take some immediate control measures. If required, think of two days’ lockdown or something… how will people live?” a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.Describing it as a problem “beyond politics”, the Bench—which also included Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Surya Kant—asked Mehta to call for a meeting and take some emergency measures.“It’s a common problem. I can’t blame the states. It’s a collective problem… colour of the political party doesn’t matter… but implementation has to be at the state level,” Mehta told the Bench. “Let me be clear…We have nothing to do with which government does it… The question is how to control the burning situation…emergency measures, short term plan on how to control this…,” the CJI said during the hearing on a PIL on air pollution in Delhi-NCR.As the CJI said it appeared from news reports that stubble burning had increased a lot, the Solicitor General said, “Our prediction is that till 18th (November) we’ll have to take stern measures to ensure we don’t go ahead from very severe.” “First control Delhi, then we’ll see others. call a meeting... take a decision. We want something to happen, so two-three days we’re in a position to feel better…”Why don’t you ask Punjab and Haryana Chief secretaries to cease stubble burning for a few days?” asked the CJI. As Mehta said they were a part of a joint emergency meeting being held today, the Bench asked him to inform it about the decisions taken and posted the matter for further hearing on Monday when it will consider the measures taken/suggested in the meeting.The Bench said the air pollution situation was so bad that people were wearing masks inside their homes.As Mehta talked about stubble-burning in Punjab, Justice Surya Kant shot back, “Now it has become a fashion to bash farmers whether it’s Delhi govt or someone else. In Delhi, there was a ban imposed on firecrackers. Have you seen how crackers are being burnt in Delhi for the last seven days? What is Delhi Police doing? It’s an emergency situation, multiple measures are needed to be taken on the ground level.”I am a farmer, The CJI is also from a farmer family, we know it,” Justice Kant added.Mehta clarified that he was not even remotely suggesting that only farmers were responsible for air pollution. Delhi Government counsel Rahul Mehra said that on September 30 AQI was 84. After a month, AQI has gone up to 471. While this court will look into many other factors, it’s probably due to stubble burning, he added. Noting that stubble burning contributed some percentage of pollution, the Bench said the rest of the pollution in Delhi was particularly due to crackers, industries and dust. Justice Chandrachud expressed concern about the reopening of schools after the pandemic, saying, “You’re exposing them to this pollution. This isn’t the Centre’s jurisdiction, this is under the Delhi Government…Like Dr Gulleria (of AIIMS) said, there’s pandemic and there’s pollution…” “We are in an alarming situation, it’s like consuming 20 cigarettes a day even when we don’t smoke,” Mehra said, adding he will convey the point to the government and get back to the court. Justice Chandrachud also talked about stubble management by incentivising farmers who have a 15-day window for sowing between two crop seasons.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/air-pollution-in-delhi-ncr-take-urgent-steps-to-deal-with-emergency-situation-sc-tells-govt-337593
14-11-2021||New Delhi||Enforcement Directorate attaches 'benami' entities in Unitech group PMLA case||Assets worth Rs 18.14 crore belonging to alleged benami entities of the Unitech group have been attached under the anti-money laundering law, the Enforcement Directorate said.The attached properties include a Gurugram-located multiplex, six commercial properties in Gurugram and Lucknow and two dozen bank accounts and fixed deposits.The book value of these assets is Rs 18.14 crore, it said."These assets are in the name of Enova Facility Management Services Private Limited and FNM Property Services Private Limited which are benami entities of the Chandras (Unitech promoters Ajay Chandra and Sanjay Chandra)," the agency said in a statement.It alleged that these two benami entities were "managed by Chandras through their close confidants and the assets attached were acquired/created from the proceeds of crime diverted from the Unitech group".A benami transaction is an arrangement in which a property (movable or immovable) is transferred to or held in the name of one person (benamidar), but is actually owned and enjoyed by another person (beneficial owner).This money laundering case is based on a number of Delhi Police Economic Offences Wing (EOW) and CBI FIRs filed by homebuyers against the Unitech Group and its promoters.The ED filed a criminal case under various sections of the PMLA early this year against the Unitech group and its promoters over allegations that the owners -- Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra -- illegally diverted over Rs 2,000 crore to Cyprus and the Cayman Islands.The total attachment of properties in this case now has reached Rs 690.66 crore.Last month, the ED had arrested Unitech founder Ramesh Chandra, his daughter-in-law Preeti Chandra and another executive of a company in this case.
