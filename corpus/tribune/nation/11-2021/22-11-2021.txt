Trusted individuals and community leaders may be identified and appointed as ambassadors for vaccine drive. They may be oriented about the ongoing Har Ghar dastak drive to provide sound advice on the importance of taking both the doses and completing the schedule,” Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a letter to chief secretaries and principal secretaries, health of all states.The Health Ministry also said that referral codes on the CoWIN platform may be assigned for each ambassador and every individual they get vaccinated should be added to their tally through CoWIN.“Certificates for those ambassadors who ensure full coverage and their facilitation should be done at panchayat level,” Bhushan said.He also asked states to record vaccine schedule reminder messages in the voice of ambassadors and make calls to eligible people whose doses are due.Further the Centre asked states to organise workplace vaccination and provide badges to fully vaccinated employees.Earlier today, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya reviewed vaccine coverage with Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Puducherry.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/appoint-covid-vax-ambassadors-centre-to-states-341539
22-11-2021||---||BCI suspends 28 advocates for filing ‘fake’ motor accident claims||New Delhi, November 22The Bar Council of India (BCI) has suspended 28 lawyers from Uttar Pradesh named in FIRs or chargesheets for allegedly filing fake claims under the Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal (MACT) and under the Workmen Compensation Act.The BCI – which regulates the legal profession in India—also directed the Uttar Pradesh Bar Council to initiate disciplinary proceedings against them and asked to conclude all inquiries in three months.The decision was taken in a BCI meeting held on November 19, BCI Chairman Manan K Mishra said on Monday.Earlier, a Bench headed by Justice MR Shah had directed the BCI to take action against advocates from Uttar Pradesh who allegedly filed fake motor accident claims after the UP state bar council failed to take appropriate action in the matter.“It appears that the Bar Council of State is not interested in taking action and, therefore, now the Bar Council of India has to step in and take appropriate action against the erring advocates, who are found to have indulged in filing of such fake claims. Such Report shall be filed by the SIT in a sealed cover before this Court on or before November 15, 2021,” the Bench had said last month.Pulling up the Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh for failing to act against the advocates filing fake claims under Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and Workmen Compensation Act, the top court had termed its inaction in such a serious matter as “very unfortunate”.“It shows the callousness and insensitiveness on the part of the Bar Council of UP Shri Manan Kumar Mishra, learned senior counsel and Chairman Bar Council of India to look into the same,” the Bench said in its October 5 order.The UP Government told the court that the SIT had been set up following the Allahabad High Court’s October 7, 2015 order in this regard.The top court directed the SIT to forward the name of the advocates against whom prima facie cases of cognisable offences were disclosed in a sealed cover by November 15 for being handed over to the BCI for further action.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bci-suspends-28-advocates-for-filing-fake-motor-accident-claims-341537
22-11-2021||Bhopal||Farm laws repeal shows BJP workers’ failure to explain their benefits: Uma Bharti||BJP leader Uma Bharti on Monday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s sudden announcement to repeal the three controversial farm laws left her speechless as the move reflected failure of party workers to communicate properly benefits of the legislations to cultivators.The former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister, who took to Twitter to react to the dramatic announcement made late last week, said the farmers of India have never been satisfied with any of the government’s measures so far.“I have been at the banks of Ganga in Varanasi for the past four days. I was left speechless following the PM’s announcement on November 19 about repealing farm laws, so I responded three days late,” Bharti tweeted.The former Union minister said what the PM said while making the announcement to roll-back the three agri-marketing laws left people like her feeling distressed.She said, “It was the inadequacy of us BJP workers if the Prime Minister @narendramodi ji could not explain the importance of agricultural laws to the farmers. Why we could not communicate (the importance of laws) properly to the farmers?” The BJP leader the PM is a deep thinker who goes to the root of a problem to solve it.“We could not face the constant propaganda of the opposition regarding the agricultural laws. That’s why I was getting very upset by the address of the Prime Minister on that day,” she said in another tweet.While terming Modi as her leader, Bharti said the PM’s style of functioning which is characterised by mutual coordination is unprecedented in world’s political and democratic history.In another set of tweets, Bharti, while pointing to her family’s agricultural background, said, “The farmers of India have not been satisfied with any government effort till date. I am from a farmer family. My two elder brothers are still dependent on agriculture. I have constant communication with them. I have a lively connection with my native village.”She said getting fertilisers, seeds and electricity on time and opportunity to sell foodgrains on their own terms can bring happiness to farmers.

22-11-2021||New Delhi||ISRO espionage case: ‘Larger conspiracy’ at behest of foreign hands likely, CBI tells SC||The CBI on Monday told the Supreme Court there may be a “larger conspiracy” involving foreign hands in the 1994 ISRO espionage case in which scientist Nambi Narayanan was allegedly framed by the Kerala police due to which the technology to develop the cryogenic engine was “hit” and the country’s space programme went back by at least one or two decades.The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) made the submission even as the top court agreed to hear its plea challenging the Kerala High Court order granting anticipatory bail to four persons, including a former Director-General of Police (DGP), in connection with the ISRO espionage case.The CBI’s petition came up for hearing before a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar which issued notice and posted it for hearing on November 29.The high court on August 13 granted anticipatory bail to four accused—a former Gujarat DGP R B Sreekumar, two former Kerala police officers S Vijayan and Thampi S Durga Dutt, and a retired intelligence official P S Jayaprakash.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S V Raju, appearing for the CBI, told the apex court that grant of anticipatory bail might derail the investigation in the case.Raju said the CBI has found in its probe that some scientists were allegedly tortured and framed in the case due to which the development of the cryogenic engine was hit and this led to India’s space programme going back by almost one or two decades.“We (CBI) are proceeding on the line that the technology for the cryogenic engine was deliberately tried to be stalled by arresting the scientists, who were involved in the development of the engine, as a result of which our space programme went back by at least one or two decades,” Raju told the bench.He said this is a “very serious matter” and there may be a larger conspiracy at the behest of foreign hands which is being investigated.“We are issuing notice,” the bench said.As the bench said it was issuing notice on the plea, the ASG said, “May I request a stay of the order.”“Where is the question of stay? We are issuing notice and taking it on November 29,” the bench observed.The investigating agency had earlier alleged that there was a clear indication that the accused were part of a team, which had ulterior motives to torpedo the attempts of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) for manufacturing the cryogenic engine.While granting anticipatory bail to these persons, the high court had said, “There is not even a scintilla of evidence regarding the petitioners being influenced by any foreign power so as to induce them to hatch a conspiracy to falsely implicate the scientists of the ISRO with the intention to stall the activities of the ISRO with regard to the development of the cryogenic engine.”It had said unless there are specific materials regarding their involvement, prima facie, it cannot be said that they were acting against the interests of the country.The CBI has registered a case against 18 persons for various alleged offences, including criminal conspiracy, in connection with the arrest and detention of Narayanan, a former ISRO scientist, in the espionage case.The case, which had hit the headlines in 1994, pertained to allegations of transfer of certain confidential documents on India’s space programme to foreign countries by two scientists and four others, including two Maldivian women.Narayanan, who was given a clean chit by the CBI, had earlier said the Kerala police had “fabricated” the case and the technology he was accused to have stolen and sold in the 1994 case did not even exist at that time.The CBI, in its probe, had claimed that the then top police officials in Kerala were responsible for Narayanan’s illegal arrest.The apex court had on September 14, 2018 appointed a three-member committee while directing the Kerala government to cough up Rs 50 lakh compensation for compelling Narayanan to undergo “immense humiliation”.Terming the police action against the ex-scientist of the ISRO as a “psycho-pathological treatment”, the apex court had in September 2018 said that his “liberty and dignity”, basic to his human rights, were jeopardised as he was taken into custody and, eventually, despite all the glory of the past, was compelled to face “cynical abhorrence”.

I will appeal to the higher judiciary to act against his government as per law,” she said.The Tripura Police on Sunday arrested actor-turned TMC leader Sayani Ghosh on the charge of attempt to murder after she allegedly disrupted a meeting of Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb by shouting “Khela hobe” (we will play) on Saturday night.Ghosh was arrested after being called in for questioning in a police station in Agartala, a police official had said.The Supreme Court recently directed the Tripura Police to ensure that no political party is prevented from exercising its rights in accordance with the law for campaigning in a peaceful manner.The TMC has repeatedly alleged that its candidates were being prevented from campaigning by the ruling BJP supporters there.

22-11-2021||Mumbai||Nawab Malik’s tweets against NCB officer Wankhede stem from malice but no blanket gag order: HC||The Bombay High Court on Monday refused to pass any interim orders to restrain Maharashtra cabinet minister Nawab Malik from making statements or posting content on social media against NCB Zonal Director Sameer Wankhede or his family, but noted prima facie his tweets targetting the IRS officer in the recent past had actuated out of malice.A single bench presided over by Justice Madhav Jamdar said the court did not believe at the present stage that the allegations made by Malik against Wankhede were “prima facie, totally false.” Besides, Wankhede was a government officer and some of the allegations made against him by Malik were related to the discharge of his public duty, the HC noted.The court, however, questioned the timing of Malik’s tweets against Wankhede.It said that Malik had started making allegations against Wankhede on Twitter from October 14, days after his own son-in-law, arrested by the NCB in a drugs  case, was granted bail.Therefore, it was apparent that the minister’s allegations were borne out of malice and animosity, the judge said.However, since the allegations were of serious nature, pertained to Wankhede’s official duties, and had even resulted in inquiries being initiated by the Maharashtra government and the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) against the officer, the court could not impose a blanket prohibition on Malik, the HC said.The HC’s judgement came on an interim prayer for injunction sought by Wankhede’s father Dnyandev against the state minister.The high court, however, directed Malik to ensure that in the future, all statements against Wankhede and his family be made only after “reasonable verification of facts.” The court referred to the copy of Wankhede’s birth certificate that Malik secured from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation in response to his RTI query and submitted in the court to show that the NCB officer was born a Muslim but had falsely claimed to belong to a Scheduled Caste to secure his central government job.The HC also noted that serious allegations against Wankhede had been made by Prabhakar Sail, a ‘panch’ witness in the drugs-on-cruise case in which Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan is one of the accused.“At the prima face stage, it cannot be said allegations are totally false,” the HC said.“Although the plaintiff (Wankhede’s father Dnyandev) has a fundamental right to privacy, the defendant (Malik) has a right to freedom of speech and expression. There has to be balancing of both fundamental rights,” the judge said.The court further said a citizen’s right to privacy was implicit in his or her right to life and that a citizen had every right to protect his or her right to privacy.However, Wankhede was a government officer so the larger public, too, had a right to examine his conduct but that must be done with reasonable verification, it said.“Prima face, defendant’s act is out of malice but no blanket injunction is possible. But the defendant directed to make statements only after reasonable verification,” it said.The court’s order came on an application seeking injunction against Malik in a defamation suit filed by Wankhede’s father Dnyandev.Last week, Malik submitted before the HC, a letter by the Public Health Officer of the BMC with a copy of the declaration pertaining to the change of name of Sameer Wankhede, and two school leaving certificates issued for Wankhede by St Joseph’s High School and St Paul High School in the city in the 1980s.All of these documents, Malik claimed, showed Wankhede was born a Muslim and that his father’s real name was not Dnyandev but Dawood.As per Malik’s  claims made before the HC, Dnyandev’s name was Dawood K Wankhede and it was only in 1993 that he got it changed to Dnyandev Wankhede.Dnyandev Wankhede, however, countered Malik’s  claims.He submitted through his counsel, Arshad Shaikh, a digitised birth certificate issued by the BMC for Sameer Wankhede and Dnyandev’s caste certificate to show his name had always been Dnyandev and that the NCB Zonal Director had been born a Hindu and belonged to the Mahar community, which falls under the Scheduled Caste category.Dnyandev Wankhede has also sought damages worth Rs 1.25 crore.Sameer Wankhede and his family have repeatedly denied all allegations made by the state minister.

22-11-2021||New Delhi||Centre launches first ever All India Survey of Domestic Workers||The Centre on Monday launched the first ever All India Survey of Domestic Workers (DWs), which will be undertaken by the Labour Bureau.The Labour Ministry said the result of the survey is expected within a time-span of one year.Union Labour and Employment Minister Bhupender Yadav, who flagged off the survey, said: “All India surveys and the E-shram portal will be game changer and set new standards in data driven policies.”The DWs constitute a significant portion of total employment in the informal sector. However, there is a dearth of data on the magnitude and prevailing employment conditions of these workers. On the occasion, Yadav also released an instruction manual with a questionnaire for the survey, which will cover 37 states/ UT’s and 742 districts across the country.The survey is aimed to estimate the number and proportion of domestic workers at national and state level, percentage distribution of domestic workers with respect to live-in/live-out, formal/ informal employment, migrant/non-migrant, their wages and other socio-economic characteristics.It will also provide the household estimates of live-in/live-out domestic workers and average number of domestic workers engaged by different types of households.The survey’s parameter include: Household characteristics such as HH size, religion, social group, usual monthly consumption expenditure, nature of dwelling unit.Demographic characteristics such as name, age, relation to head, marital status, general education level, usual principal activity status, subsidiary activity status and status of DWs.In addition to this, it also collects information on DWs such as their age of entry, social group, migrant status, vocational training/education, number of HHs served by DW, activities performed by them, and number of days worked, duration of work, type of remuneration and its frequency, type of contract, distance travelled, engagement as DW before and after Covid-19 pandemic and its effect on wages and job, living conditions and social security benefits received.Information on employers such as their preferences of DW regarding gender and marital status, mode of payment of wages, number of days worked, mode of engagement, whether DW services were availed during Covid-19 pandemic, medical support given to DWs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-launches-first-ever-all-india-survey-of-domestic-workers-341519
22-11-2021||New Delhi||SC asks IIT-Bombay to adopt humanitarian approach and allot seat to Dalit boy in 48 hours||Asking IIT, Bombay, to adopt a humanitarian approach, the Supreme Court on Monday directed the premier engineering institute to allocate within 48 hours a seat to a young Dalit boy, who missed out, as he could not deposit his fees due to the non-functioning of his credit card.The apex court exercised its plenary powers to direct the IIT, Bombay for allocating a supernumerary seat to the young boy from Allahabad, saying it would be a travesty of justice if he is turned away from the portals of the Supreme Court.A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and AS Bopanna said, “This court has before it a young Dalit student, who is on the verge of losing a valued seat which has been allocated to him at IIT, Bombay. The travails of the appellant has taken him from Allahabad, where he is currently studying to Kharagpur and Bombay and eventually to the national capital. Having regard to the facts of the case, it would be a grave travesty of justice to the young Dalit student who has to finally move this court, is turned away from its portals…”The bench noted that if the petitioner Prince Jaibir Singh, who has secured 864 All India ranks in the SC category in the IIT entrance exam, is not admitted in this academic year, he will be ineligible to appear for further entrance examinations as he has appeared in two consecutive attempts.“Hence, we are of the view that this is a fit and proper case where the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 142 of the constitution is warranted at the interim stage, in the facts which have appeared before the court. We accordingly direct the first and second respondent (IIT, Bombay) to ensure that the seat which is allocated to the appellant shall be allotted to him at IIT, Bombay. This shall be done without disturbing any other students, who have already been admitted”, the bench said. The top court said that the creation of supernumerary seats in the facts of the present case shall be subject to the admission of Singh being regularised if any seats fall vacant as a result of exigencies, which may arise in the course of the admission process. “Parties shall act on the certified copy of this order and implement these directions within a period of 48 hours that is by November 24,” the bench said.During the hearing, the bench was informed by advocate Sonal Jain, appearing for Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JOSAA) and IIT, Bombay that there are no more seats available in any of the IITs across the country as the admission process is complete and the court can pass an order under Article 142 for allocating a seat to Singh.The bench said, “Look at the background of the child. He has to borrow money from his sister after his credit card malfunctioned. Don’t be wooden like this. We can pass an order under Article 142 but that may not be favourable for IITs. You can adopt a humanitarian approach and explore the possibilities. Explain this to the chairman”.The top court said many seats get vacant after students take admission in different institutes to further their career in better options and IIT should look and allocate one such seat to this student. “Something has to be done for this student. It is elementary common sense, which students would not like to get into IIT, Bombay and not pay Rs 50,000 fees. It is obvious that he has some financial problems. He has to borrow money from his sister. These students study years after years for this exam. Look at their background,” the bench said.Jain said that there are seven other students, who despite being allocated the seats could not pay their fees and the court must consider this fact.The bench added that IITs should have a robust system in place to rule out any such situation in the future because students from even rural parts of the country study hard to make it through this examination.“Ordinary person, do not have multiple credit cards with them. They have limited options to make payments. Otherwise, you will only have students from metropolitan cities and not from rural parts of the country,” it said.On November 18, the top court had come to the aid of the boy and said that “the court must sometimes rise above the law” as “who knows 10-20 years down the line he may be the leader of our nation”.The top court directed the counsel appearing for the Centre to procure details of admissions in IIT, Bombay, and explore the possibility that he could be admitted.The petitioner has claimed that he was allocated a civil engineering seat in IIT, Bombay but he could not make payment for the seat acceptance fee as his credit card did not work on October 27 despite several efforts.In his plea, filed through advocate Pragya Baghel, Singh said that on the next day, he had tried to book the seat after his sister sent the money but could not do so.Thereafter, he wrote several emails and made calls to the management authorities of IITs but did not receive any response.Failing to get any relief, he then approached the Bombay High Court seeking directions to IIT, Bombay but his plea was dismissed on technical grounds.

22-11-2021||New Delhi||No move to invite Myanmar ruler for Republic Day parade: MEA||The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) scotched reports that New Delhi is considering inviting leaders of the BIMSTEC grouping which would have meant giving Myanmar ruler Gen Min Aung Hlaing an opportunity to share the international stage.The Chairman of Myanmar’s State Administration Council who dissolved the Myanmar Parliament, threw a large number of politicians in jail and brutally put down protests against army rule is currently being shunned by the international community.The last ASEAN summit saw Myanmar’s representation being downgraded so as to avoid inviting the General.In response to reports regarding the Chief Guest for next year’s Republic Day, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said, “We have seen a speculative media report regarding the Chief Guest for Republic Day 2022. The report is inaccurate and has no factual basis.”The report said the plan was to invite all the leaders of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC). India has tried to promote this grouping rather than SAARC because Pakistan is not its member. Besides India, the other six members are Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Nepal, and Bhutan.The news broke weeks before India is to participate in a Meeting of Democracies to be hosted by US President Joe Biden. In his recent speeches to external audiences, PM Modi has emphasised why democracies should cooperate in the development of critical technologies for they alone can account for the ethical aspects.All the BIMSTEC leaders attended Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s second swearing-in as prime minister in 2019 but at that time Myanmar was a democracy.Even though some leaders have changed, all the members remain well disposed towards India on a personal basis. They include Sheikh Hasina (Bangladesh), Sher Bahadur Deuba (Nepal), Prayut Chan-o-cha (Thailand), Gotabaya Rajapaksa (Sri Lanka), Lotay Tshering (Bhutan) and Gen.

After that, a decision on booster dose would be taken based on expert recommendation, he had said.“The government cannot take a direct decision in such a matter. When the Indian Council of Medical Research and expert team will say that a booster dose should be given, we will consider it then,” he had said, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always depended on expert opinion, be it vaccine research, manufacturing or approval.According to officials, around 82 per cent of the eligible population in India have received the first dose of the vaccine while around 43 per cent have been fully inoculated.The total number of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the country has exceeded 116.87 crore, according to provisional reports till 7 am. The government has launched a month-long ‘Har Ghar Dastak’ campaign for house-to-house Covid-19 vaccination of those who are yet to take a dose and for people whose second dose is overdue.According to officials, over 12 crore beneficiaries are overdue for their second dose of Covid-19 vaccine after the expiry of the prescribed interval between the two doses. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-scientific-evidence-to-support-need-for-booster-vaccine-dose-against-covid-icmr-chief-341498
22-11-2021||New Delhi||Jairam Ramesh gives dissent note to joint panel on Personal Data Protection Bill||Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Monday gave his dissent note to the Joint Committee of Parliament on the Personal Data Protection Bill after the committee adopted its report at its meeting here.The former Union Minister also lauded the democratic manner in which the committee functioned under the chairmanship of PP Chaudhuri for the past four months.The report was delayed by the panel as its former chairperson Meenakshi Lekhi was elevated a minister and a new chairperson of the committee was appointed.The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, was referred to the Joint Committee of Parliament (JCP) for scrutiny before it was taken up by Parliament for consideration and passage.“Finally, it is done. The Joint Committee of Parliament has adopted its report on the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019. There are dissent notes, but that is in the best spirit of parliamentary democracy. Sadly, such examples are few and far between under the Modi regime,” he said after submitting his dissent note on the proposed legislation.The Congress leader said he is compelled to submit a detailed dissent note on the Bill as his suggestions have not been accepted and he is unable to convince the members.“But that should not detract from the democratic manner in which the Committee has functioned. Now, for the debate in Parliament,” he said on Twitter.Ramesh, who is also the chief whip of the Congress party in Rajya Sabha, in his dissent note said he had suggested amendments to Section 35, which is the most crucial provision of the Bill as well as to Section 12.He has argued that Section 35 gives almost unbridled powers to the Central Government to exempt any government agency from the entire Act itself. “Under the amendment I had suggested, the central government will have to get Parliamentary approval for exempting any of its agencies from the purview of the law. Even then, the government must always comply with the Bill’s requirement of fair and reasonable processing and implementing the necessary security safeguards,” Ramesh said.“This would bring about greater accountability and transparency, but even that was not found acceptable. Section 12(a)(i) creates certain exceptions for governments and government agencies from the provisions of consent.Ramesh has in his dissent note said that the JCP’s report allows a period of two years for private companies to migrate to the new data protection regime, but governments and government agencies have no such stipulation.He argued that the design of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 assumes that the constitutional right to privacy arises only where operations and activities of private companies are concerned.Governments and government agencies are treated as a separate privileged class whose operations and activities are always in the public interest and individual privacy considerations are secondary, the Congress leader said. “The idea that the August 2017 Puttaswamy judgment of the Supreme Court is relevant only for a very, very, very tiny section of the Indian population is, in my view, deeply flawed and troubling and is one that I totally reject,” he asserted in his note.

22-11-2021||New Delhi||President confers Vir Chakra on Abhinandan Varthaman||Group Captain Abhinandan Varthaman, who downed an enemy jet during an aerial combat with Pakistan in 2019 and was held captive for three days in that country, was on Monday honoured with the Vir Chakra award by President Ram Nath Kovind.The fighter pilot of the Indian Air Force has been decorated with India's third-highest wartime gallantry medal for displaying an "exceptional sense of duty" during the dogfight, the award citation said.The award ceremony, held at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, was attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and several other dignitaries.Several other military officers were also honoured at the event.Earlier this month, the Indian Air Force approved the rank of Group Captain for Varthaman."President Kovind presents Vir Chakra to Wing Commander (now Group Captain) Varthaman Abhinandan. He showed conspicuous courage, demonstrated gallantry in the face of the enemy while disregarding personal safety and displayed exceptional sense of duty," the Rashtrapati Bhavan tweeted.Wing Commander Varthaman (now Group Captain) downed the Pakistani jet on February 27, 2019, before his MiG 21 Bison jet was hit. Pakistan launched retaliation against India for the Balakot airstrikes a day before.The citation read out at the ceremony said a large force of the Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft, consisting of advanced fourth-generation F-16 and JF-17, was detected heading towards the Line of Control (LOC) at around 9.55 am that day.It said Wing Commander Varthaman, displaying exceptional air combat acumen and knowledge of the enemy's tactics, scanned the low-altitude airspace with his Airborne Intercept (AI) radar and picked up an enemy aircraft that was flying low to ambush the Indian fighter-interceptor aircraft.It said he alerted the other formation pilots about the "surprise threat", and then consolidated the riposte against the hostile Pakistani aircraft that were attempting to drop weapons on the Indian Army positions."This audacious and aggressive manoeuvre forced the enemy aircraft into tactical chaos. All the enemy aircraft thereafter turned back including the rear echelon aircraft that were yet to launch their air to ground weapons," the citation said.Wing Commander Varthaman then pursued a retreating enemy fighter bomber aircraft, and in the ensuing aerial combat, shot down an F-16 aircraft with his onboard missile, it said."However, in the melee, one of the enemy aircraft fired multiple advanced BVR (beyond visual range) missiles, one of which hit his aircraft forcing him to eject in enemy territory," it said.The citation said despite being captured by the enemy, he continued to display exceptional resolve in dealing with the adversary in a brave and dignified manner till he was repatriated on March 1, 2019."His actions raised the morale of the armed forces in general and the IAF in particular," it said.The strike by India's warplanes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Balakot and the Pakistani Air Force's subsequent retaliation the next day triggered fears of a war between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.The government had announced its decision to confer the Vir Chakra on Varthaman in 2019.

22-11-2021||New Delhi||Navy officer arrested in information leak case gets bail||Serving Naval Commander Ajit Kumar Pandey, arrested by the CBI in the alleged leak of confidential information on maintenance and purchase of naval equipment, received default bail from a special court, officials said.The court granted bail to Pandey, who was arrested on September 3, as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had filed an “incomplete chargesheet” against him and others with regards to the probe under the Official Secrets Act.The chargesheet filed before the court is incomplete in as much as there is no mention regarding the investigation being carried under the Official Secrets Act (OSA), though the same was being carried in this case itself, Special Judge Anuradha Shukla Bhardwaj said in an order.“The chargesheet thus is incomplete for the purposes of section 167 (2) of CrPC (default bail),” she said.The court has already released other accused, including retired naval officers Commodore Randeep Singh and Commander Satwinder Jeet Singh, on the same grounds.An accused becomes eligible for default bail if the investigating agency does not file a chargesheet within a stipulated period of 60 days or 90 days, depending on the charges pressed.The defence counsels had argued citing the Delhi High Court judgment that limitation for filing chargesheet under the OSA is 60 days not 90 days as wrongly mentioned by the CBI.The judge said although the agency had filed its charge sheets within 60 days, on November 2, they are “incomplete” as they do not mention anything about the probe under the Official Secrets Act, making the arrested accused eligible for bail.The CBI had carried out raids on retired naval officers Commodore Randeep Singh and Commander Satwinder Jeet Singh on September 2 after getting information that the latter was going to share crucial details related to a meeting in the Navy on the procurement. Both were arrested on the same day.The agency is probing allegations into the leak of confidential information pertaining to procurements and maintenance of naval equipment for pecuniary benefits and bribery in deal for the Mine Laying Saddle from Hyderabad-based company Allen Reinforced Plastics Limited, they said.

The situation in the state is very volatile and it has gone from bad to worse. The situation is worsening day by day,” he said.The plea for contempt action has been filed as there are repeated incidents of violence and false cases are being lodged against their members, he added.When the Bench asked whether the petition has been filed, Dave said it is in the process being filed and once it is numbered, he will provide it to the court.“Ok, we will hear it on Tuesday.

India has the capacities that we need,” he said.The UN Peacekeeping chief said India had the “capacity to help us” with qualified peacekeepers, both police and military, and the country “obviously" had the capacity to “help us to further increase the number of women in peacekeeping, both in the military and the police".“We would also expect to have more senior officers, female senior officers,” he said.India, Lacroix said, had also a number of significant technologies that could really help UN peacekeepers, often referred to as Blue Berets or Blue Helmets because of their light-blue berets or helmets."So in all these areas, I believe that in addition to what India is already doing, which is a lot...we strongly believe that there's a great potential for more in terms of our cooperation” with India, he asserted.As of September, India is the third-highest contributor of personnel to UN peacekeeping, with 5,481 troops serving in 12 UN missions across the world.

It hasn’t accepted the verdict, but has launched negotiations with five other countries—Brunei, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines—which were part of the dispute.India, as a responsible maritime stakeholder, is a supporter of consensus-based principles and a peaceful, open, rule-based and stable maritime order, the Defence Minister said, adding that “arbitrary interpretations” of the law create obstacles in the path of a rule-based maritime order.The primary objective of the Indian Navy was the need to keep the Indo-Pacific region open, safe and secure, Rajnath Singh said, adding, “We envision a rule-based Indo-Pacific, with freedom of navigation, free trade and universal values, in which the interests of all countries are protected.”The role of the Indian Navy becomes important in the entire Indo-Pacific region as the security of sea lanes is needed in the present era of globalisation to ensure stability, economic progress and development.The Defence Minister asserted that India’s interests were directly linked with the Indian Ocean and the region was crucial for world economy.

The three laws were passed by the Lok Sabha on September 17, 2020; by the Rajya Sabha on September 20 and assented to by the President on September 27 last year. The farmers’ anti-law agitation on Delhi borders started on November 26, 2020, leading to a movement that remained largely peaceful, but for the R-Day tractor march that turned violent and sparked accusations that anti-national elements had infiltrated the movement.The government held 11 rounds of talks with farmers starting December 3, 2020, but failed to break the deadlock.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act provides for a mechanism to enable farmers to sell their produce outside the physical limits notified under state agriculture produce marketing committees (APMCs).The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act allows farmers to go in for contract farming by entering into a direct agreement with buyers to sell the produce at prices agreed on mutually. It’s, however, silent on MSP.The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act amended the parent law and did away with the Centre’s power to impose stock-holding limit on food items, except under extraordinary conditions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cabinet-nod-to-agri-laws-repeal-likely-on-nov-24-341240

It indicated the norm would be applicable from December 1. —TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pak-further-eases-norms-for-pilgrimage-to-kartarpur-sahib-341243

There have been many attempts to drop ammunition and drugs in border villages by using drones.Prime Minister Narendra Modi participated in the discussions and gave suggestions during the conference. In the run-up to the conference, core groups of DGPs were formed for holding discussions on key aspects of national security such as development of border villages, prison reforms, terrorism, left wing extremism, cyber-crimes, narcotics trafficking, foreign funding of NGOs, drone-related risks, etc.Addressing the valedictory session of the conference on Sunday, the PM called for analysis of all police-related incidents and developing case studies, to make it an institutionalised learning mechanism.

Besides, Yogi was then handpicked to propose the BJP’s political resolution, something Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had done over the previous two years.Defending the choice of Yogi as proposer of the resolution, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had clearly said, “Yogi is the CM of India’s biggest state. Why should we not invite him to propose the resolution?”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cm-yogi-posts-photos-with-pm-sends-out-message-to-electorate-341246

There is no factionalism in the state. I am ready for any role that Gandhis will give me. — Sachin Pilot, Congress LeaderRajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra administered the oath of office to the ministers who include five from the camp of former deputy CM Sachin Pilot, who had been awaiting accommodation of his supporters.Among Pilot loyalists, Hema Ram Chaudhary, Vishvendra Singh and Ramesh Meena were sworn in as Cabinet ministers, while Brijendra Ola (son of late union minister Sis Ram Ola) and Murarilal Meena were inducted as Ministers of State.The return of Vishvendra Singh and Ramesh Meena to the state Cabinet is significant. The duo had been sacked by the Congress along with then deputy CM Pilot when the camp rebelled against Gehlot in 2020.Mahendrajit Singh Malviya, Ramlal Jat, Mahesh Joshi, Mamta Bhupesh Bhairwa, Bhajanlal Jatav, Tikaram Juli, Govind Ram Meghwal and Shakuntala Rawat were among the other 11 Cabinet ministers to take oath.Four MoS to be sworn in were Zahida, Ola, Rajendra Durha and Meena.

22-11-2021||New Delhi||Prolonged school closure poses threat to gender equality: Study||Educational disruption due to prolonged closure of schools across the globe will not only have alarming effects on learning loss, but also poses threat to gender equality, a new study by UNESCO has pointed out.1.6 bn students hitAt the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, 1.6 billion students in 190 countries were affected by school closures — Stefania Giannini, UNESCO OfficialThe global study titled “When schools shut: Gendered impacts of Covid-19 school closures” brings to the fore that girls and boys, young women and men were affected differently by school closures, depending on the context.“At the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, 1.6 billion students in 190 countries were affected by school closures. Not only did they lose access to education, but also to the myriad benefits of attending school, at an unparalleled scale,” said Stefania Giannini, UNESCO, Assistant Director-General for Education.“Educational disruption of this extent has alarming effects on learning loss and school dropout. Beyond this, it poses threats to gender equality, including effects on health, well being and protection that are gender specific,” Giannini said. Drawing on evidence from 90 countries and in-depth data collected in local communities, the report shows that gender norms and expectations can affect the ability to participate in and benefit from remote learning.“In poorer contexts, girls’ time to learn was constrained by increased household chores. Boys’ participation in learning was limited by income-generating activities. Girls faced difficulties in engaging in digital remote learning modalities in many contexts because of limited access to internet-enabled devices, a lack of digital skills and cultural norms restricting their use of technological devices,” the report said.The study pointed out that digital gender-divide was already a concern before the Covid-19 crisis. “The in-depth studies on Bangladesh and Pakistan in the global report revealed its gendered effects on remote learning during school closures. In the study on Pakistan, only 44 per cent of girls in participating districts reported owning mobile phones for their personal use, whereas 93 per cent of boys did so. Girls who did not own mobile phones reported that they relied on their relatives’ devices, typically those belonging to their fathers,” it said.“While some of the girls were able to use family members’ phones, they were not always able to do so. Their access was restricted since some parents were concerned that providing girls with access to smartphones would lead to misuse and could result into romantic relationships. From April to September 2020, the share of girls reporting that they did not study at all increased from 1 to 10 per cent,” it added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prolonged-school-closure-poses-threat-to-gender-equality-study-341250

We are not fond of sitting on the streets. We too desire that after resolving these other issues as soon as possible, we return to our homes, families and farming. If you want the same, then the government should immediately resume talks with the Samyukt Kisan Morcha on the above six issues. Till then, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha will continue this movement,” the SKM said in their letter to PM.Noting PM “unilateral declaration (address to the nation) rather than a bilateral solution”, the SKM said repeal of the three laws was not the only demand of the movement and there were other issues.Among the demands listed in the SKM’s letter are – legal guarantee for MSP, withdrawal of the draft “Electricity Amendments Bill, 2020/2021” proposed by the government; removal of the penal provisions on farmers in the “Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Act 2021”; immediate withdrawal of cases against farmers implicated in hundreds of cases in Delhi, Haryana, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh and several other states; sacking of MoS Home Ajay Mishra whose son is an accused in Lakhimpur Kheri killings and land at Singhu border to build a memorial honouring the memory of 700 farmers who died during the agitation.“During this movement, so far about 700 farmers have given their lives to the cause, as their supreme sacrifice. There should be compensation and rehabilitation support for their families. To build a martyrs’ memorial in the memory of the martyr farmers, land should be given at Singhu Border,” SKM said expanding the ambit of their demands to cover withdrawal of criminal cases against farmers, land for a memorial and the sacking of junior home minister Ajay Mishra.On Mishra, the letter said, “Ajay Mishra Teni, the mastermind of Lakhimpur Kheri murder case and accused of section 120B, is still roaming freely and remains a Minister in your cabinet. He is also sharing the stage with you and other senior ministers.

22-11-2021||New Delhi||Half of my heart belongs in India, says former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon in his book||Former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon’s first diplomatic posting was in India and he developed such a special connection that even 50 years later, he tells the Indian people that half of his "heart belongs in their country".Ban also mentions in his autobiography that his three years in India was "such an exciting time in my life".In ‘Resolved: Uniting Nations in a Divided World’, published by HarperCollins India, Ban goes on to describe how he became a "man of peace" from a "child of war".Born in 1944, just one year before the United Nations itself, Ban's earliest memories are haunted by the sound of bombs dropping on his Korean village and the sight of fires consuming what remained.As a six-year-old boy, he fled with his family, trudging for miles in mud-soaked shoes, suffering from incessant hunger, and wondering how they would survive - until the United Nations rescued them. Young Ban grew up determined to repay this lifesaving generosity.On his days in India, he writes: "India was my first diplomatic posting, and Soon-taek (wife) and I arrived in Delhi in October 1972. I served there for almost three years, first as vice consul of the Korean Consulate General, and once a full diplomatic relationship was established between Korea and India in December 1973, I served as second secretary of the Korean Embassy."His daughter Seon-yong was then just eight months old and his only son, Woo-hyun, was born in India on October 30, 1974."I used to joke with Indian people that my balance sheet with India is perfect because my son was born in India and my youngest daughter, Hyun-hee, is married to an Indian man. Even now, nearly fifty years later, I tell the Indian people that half of my heart belongs in their country," he writes.He says his work in India was challenging but fascinating to a young diplomat."Our primary goal was to win full diplomatic recognition by India, a leader of the nonaligned group, which we did in December 1973. Koreans and many other diplomats felt that elevating consular relations to the ambassadorial level was a turning point in diplomatic relations. India was among the largest non-aligned states that recognised both Koreas," he says.Ban performed what has been called the "most impossible job on this earth" with a genuine belief in collective action and global transformation. Meeting challenges and resistance with a belief in the UN's mission of peace, development and human rights, Ban steered the United Nations through a volatile period that included the Arab Spring, nuclear pursuits in Iran and North Korea, the Ebola epidemic, and brutal new conflicts in Central Africa.As Secretary General, he also forged global agreements to fight extreme poverty and address the climate crisis.In the book, Ban also talks about his election to the top UN post in 2006, in which India's Shashi Tharoor was also a contender."Thailand's candidate, Surakiart Sathirathi, was the only one that felt like a real rival to me at that time. Tharoor and (Sri Lankan diplomat Jayantha) Dhanapala did not have the strong support of their governments," he claims.In the first two straw polls, an informal voting held at the 15-member UN Security Council to gauge support enjoyed by the candidates, Ban emerged victorious with Tharoor coming second."The results (of the first straw polls) exceeded my expectations. I was the latecomer, but I was now the frontrunner. The path to the UN secretary-general's thirty-eighth floor office began to glimmer into focus. But I could not get rid of the worry that the negative vote had come from a permanent member of the Security Council. It was rumoured that Shashi Tharoor did not enjoy the Indian government's support, but the fact that he received 10 votes made me anxious," Ban recalls.But he says the results of the third straw poll, conducted on September 28, were a disappointing surprise."I received only 13 'encourage' votes and one each for 'discourage' and 'no opinion expressed'. I could not understand what had happened. However, I was the only candidate who received more than the nine-vote minimum to win. The other candidates had lost votes: Shashi Tharoor had eight votes, losing two positive votes, and Surakiart, stung by his support of Thailand's recent military coup, received only five votes," he writes.Finally, he was elected to "what was widely known as the most impossible job on earth" and then re-elected to a second five-year term in June 2011.In the book, Ban also hails India for "raising the bar" and providing the United Nations’ first all-female Formed Police Unit (FPU) for service in 2007 in Liberia, which was then beginning to recover from a violent two-decade power struggle.The sight of 125 women drilling in formation in peacekeeper blue was an electrifying role model in a country where women had paid heavily during back-to-back civil wars. During night patrols, the unit has deterred sexual violence and helped rebuild safety and confidence among the population," he writes.

22-11-2021||Aditi Tandon||Union Cabinet likely to approve on Wednesday bills for withdrawal of farm laws||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 21The Union cabinet is likely to consider and approve bills for the repeal and withdrawal of the three controversial farm laws on Wednesday paving the way for their introduction and passage in the winter session of Parliament commencing November 29.Top government sources said the withdrawal bills were expected to be taken up in the very first cabinet meeting to be held on Wednesday after the PM’s address to the nation.The cabinet approval would clear the way for introduction of bills to withdraw the three farm laws once the Parliament session starts on November 29.The opposition Congress was the first to ask the government on Friday why it couldn’t bring ordinances to repeal the laws like it did to extend the service tenures of CBI and ED directors.The government, however, is already working on formalities for repeal and the Cabinet meeting will take up the agenda on Wednesday even as farm union leaders pledge to continue their sit-in on Delhi borders with focus on MSP legalisation now.The three laws were passed by Lok Sabha on September 17, 2020; Rajya Sabha on September 20 and assented to by the President on September 27 last year.Farmers’ anti law agitation on Delhi borders started on November 26, 2020, leading to a movement that remained largely peaceful but for the Republic Day tractor march which turned violent and sparked accusations that the anti-national elements had infiltrated the movement.Delhi police reacted with FIRs against several farmers even as the government held 11 rounds of talks with farmers starting December 3, 2020 but failed to break the deadlock.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-cabinet-likely-to-approve-on-wednesday-bills-for-withdrawal-of-farm-laws-341059

After this, some decisions were taken. SKM's pre-decided programmes will continue as it is. Kisan panchayat will be held in Lucknow on November 22, gatherings at all borders on November 26 and march to Parliament on November 29".The SKM also said it would address an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi listing their demands, such legal guarantee for the minimum support price for farm produce, cancellation of criminal cases against farmer leaders and their supporters.SKM, an umbrella body of the agitating unions, met earlier on Sunday to decide on the next course of action, including on the MSP issue and the proposed daily tractor march to Parliament during the upcoming Winter Session.Farmer leaders have been maintaining that the protesters will stay put at border areas of Delhi until the Centre formally repeals these laws in Parliament after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's surprise announcement on Friday and have indicated their stir for a statutory guarantee of MSP and withdrawal of the Electricity Amendment Bill will continueFarmer leaders have said the protests will continue until the government makes a law on minimum support price (MSP) and removes Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra.In a tweet in Hindi on Sunday, Bhartiya Kisan Union national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait said: “Chalo Lucknow Chalo Lucknow (let's go to Lucknow) for MSP Adhikaar Kisaan Mahapanchayat. The agriculture reforms being talked about are fake and cosmetic. The farm reforms are not going to stop the plight of the farmers. The biggest reform for the farmers and agriculture will be to make a law pertaining to the MSP”. Vice-president of Uttar Pradesh unit of BKU Harnam Singh Verma told PTI, “The Prime Minister has announced the repeal of the three farm laws, but he did not say when the MSP law will be made. Until a law is made on the MSP, and Union Minister of State for Home Ajay Mishra is removed, the agitation will continue”.Verma also said a number of other issues will also be discussed at the farmers’ mahapanchayat. “The BJP had said (during the previous Assembly elections in UP) that once it forms the government in the state, payment will be made to the sugarcane farmers within 14 days, but this mechanism could not be implemented in the state. In a span of four-and-a-half years, the increase in sugarcane price was barely Rs 25,” he said.Violence had erupted in Lakhimpur Kheri district on October 3 when farmers were protesting the visit of Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to Mishra’s native place. Four agitating farmers were run over by a vehicle while four others, including a journalist and two BJP workers, were also killed in the ensuing violence. --- TNS/Agencies||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/samyukt-kisan-morcha-to-go-ahead-with-planned-march-to-parliament-lucknow-mahapanchayat-341048

Why should we not invite him to propose the resolution? Of course, we will.”Further stamping Yogi’s rise in the BJP, Union Home Minister Amit Shah during his recent UP visit went to thr extent of telling the electorate, “Elect Yogi as CM in 2022 if you want Modi as PM in 2024.”The symbiotic relationship between Modi and Yogi—which has been taking shape in the BJP for a while—got endorsed publicly on Sunday by way of two powerful frames that tell the story of new beginnings in the BJP—beginnings with the potential of profound impact on UP’s and on India’s future trajectory.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/weve-resolved-to-build-a-new-india-yogi-posts-2-photos-with-pm-signalling-new-winds-in-bjp-341041
22-11-2021||Mumbai||Indian Navy’s stealth guided missile destroyer 'Visakhapatnam' commissioned||Taking a dig at China, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said "some irresponsible nations" with their narrow partisan interests and hegemonic tendencies are coming up with wrong definitions of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).It is a matter of concern that UNCLOS is being repeatedly weakened by arbitrary interpretation of its definition by some nations, Singh said, after commissioning of Indian Navy's destroyer Visakhapatnam here.As a responsible maritime stakeholder, India supports consensus-based principles and a peaceful, open, rules-based stable maritime order, Singh said.India envisages Indo-Pacific having freedom of navigation, free trade and universal values where all stakeholders' interests are protected, he said."Some irresponsible nations, with their narrow partisan interests and hegemonic tendencies are coming with wrong definitions of international laws," Singh said without naming China.China has been militarising islands in the South China Sea, a move that has attracted global criticism. The area has over-lapping claims of several East and Southeast Asian nations.In 2016, an international tribunal rejected China's argument that it enjoys historic rights over most of the South China Sea - a region known to be rich in hydrocarbons and also hosting an important Sea Lane of Communication.Following the order, China said the award is "null and void and has no binding force" and it neither accepts nor recognises it.Singh said that as an important country in the region, the Indian Navy's role assumes a more crucial role for the region's security.He said countries the world over are working towards making their military power strong and modern due to global security reasons, border disputes and importance to maintain maritime dominance.There is a rising demand for military equipment. Reports suggest that the world over the cost for security is expected to reach USD 2.1 trillion. In 5-10 years, this is expected to rise manifold, Singh noted."We have an opportunity to use all our capacity, take advantage of the policies, and make the country a hub in indigenous ship building," Singh said.Indigenously-built stealth guided missile destroyer Visakhapatnam, packed with an array of missiles and anti-submarine rockets, was commissioned in the presence of top naval commanders.Visakhapatnam is equipped with lethal weapons and sensors, including supersonic surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, medium and short-range guns, anti-submarine rockets and advanced electronic warfare and communication suits, officials said.Admiral Karambir Singh, Chief of the Naval Staff, said the ship is a shining example of self-reliance.

22-11-2021||Moradabad (UP)||'Dead' man found alive after 7 hours in mortuary freezer in UP||In a bizarre incident, a 40-year-old man was kept in a mortuary freezer for almost seven hours before he was taken out alive.According to reports, Srikesh Kumar, an electrician, was hit by a speeding motorbike following which he was taken to the district hospital on Thursday night. The doctors had declared him dead.The following day, the hospital staff put the body in the freezer.Nearly seven hours later, when a 'panchnama' or document, signed by family members after identifying the body and agreeing to an autopsy - was to be filed by the police, Kumar's sister-in-law Madhu Bala noticed that he was showing signs of movement.In a video that went viral, Bala can be heard saying: "He's not at all dead. How did this happen? Look, he wants to say something, he is breathing." Moradabad's chief medical superintendent Dr Shiv Singh, said: "The emergency medical officer had seen the patient at 3 a.m and there was no heartbeat. He had examined the man multiple times. Thereafter, he was declared dead but, in the morning, a police team and his family found him alive. A probe has been ordered. Our priority is now to save his life." Singh said it was one of those "rarest of rare cases... We can't call it negligence".Kumar is now undergoing treatment at a health centre in Meerut where his condition has improved.According to his sister-in-law, "he is yet to regain consciousness"."We will lodge a complaint against the doctors for negligence as they almost killed Srikesh by putting him in a freezer," she added.— IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/dead-man-found-alive-after-7-hours-in-mortuary-freezer-in-up-341027
