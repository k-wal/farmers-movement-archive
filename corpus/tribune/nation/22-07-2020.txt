22-07-2020||Patna||Bihar floods: Close to five lakh people affected||Close to half a million people in nearly a dozen districts in Bihar have been affected by the flood that has cut a swath of destruction across the northern parts of the state, the disaster management department said on Wednesday.A total of 4.6 lakh people in 245 panchayats of 10 districts have been affected by the deluge that has displaced more than 13,000 people.So far, 4,845 people have been put up at 16 relief camps, according to a release issued by the department.However, there has been no report of any loss of life so far, it stated.According to the state’s water resources department, the Kosi, Budhi, Gandak, Kamala Balan and Lal Bakeya rivers, flowing above the danger mark at many places, have been showing a receding trend or were stable.Water Resources Minister Sanjay Kumar Jha asserted in a statement that “all embankments in the state are safe” despite an increase in water pressure because of heavy rainfall in areas along north Bihar’s border with Nepal earlier this month and again in the last 24 hours.The minister claimed the embankments were “in better shape than ever” on account of the use of sheet pile while repair works were on before the calamity struck.“We are fully prepared. All repair works were complete before the floods came. Surveys of the flood-prone areas have been made beforehand with the help of drones. Personnel are involved in relief and rescue work, and engineers have been deployed in areas deemed to be vulnerable,” he added.Life was affected in large parts of Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Supaul, Kishanganj, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Gopalganj, East Champaran, West Champaran and Khagaria districts due to the flood.Large parts of Areraj sub-division in East Champaran have been marooned, Sub Divisional Officer Dheerendra Mishra said.“About 25,000 people from 18 villages have fled their homes and are taking shelter, along with their livestock, at nearby school buildings.”            NDRF Ninth Battalion commandant Vijay Sinha said in a statement that 21 teams have been pressed into service in 12 districts, taking people to safety and distributing food and other essential items.A 10-year-old girl in East Champaran was rescued by a team led by ASI Kaushal Kishore from her remote flood-hit village where she suffered a snakebite. She was carried NDRF personnel to a safe place where medical help was available, he said.Meanwhile, the floods caused the state’s political temperature to rise further.Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav, who toured districts such as Darbhanga and Madhubani and distributed food among the flood-hit people at many places, accused the ruling dispensation of having left the populace to fend for themselves.“I was appalled to see that these people have been compelled to take shelter in cramped surroundings, throwing to the winds social distancing which is still necessary in Bihar on account of the explosion of COVID-19 cases,” Yadav told reporters at one of the spots visited by him.The RJD leader drew flak from the BJP, a partner in the ruling alliance in the state, which accused the former deputy chief minister of “himself being in a hurry for electoral gains”.“Tejashwi Yadav’s antics show that he is himself in a hurry for electoral gains. Instead of cooperating with the state machinery, he is holding gatherings which could potentially lead to a fresh spurt in coronavirus cases,” BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand said.The BJP spokesperson’s accusation was a rebuttal to the charge by the RJD leader who has been advocating postponement of state assembly elections, due in a few months, and alleging that the ruling coalition led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar wanted polls to be held on time, “unmindful” of the health risks involved.

22-07-2020||New Delhi||Delhi govt plans more monthly sero-surveys, next to be done in August; 1,227 fresh cases reported||A fresh sero-survey will be conducted in the national capital from August 1-5 and such exercises will be conducted every month to formulate better policies to tackle COVID-19, Health Minister Satyendar Jain said Wednesday.The decision comes after the city government analysed the results of the latest sero-survey which showed nearly 23 per cent of the people here had exposure to the novel coronavirus.The national capital recorded 1,227 fresh coronavirus cases, a bulletin issued by the Health Department said, taking the tally in the city to over 1.26 lakh.The active cases tally was 14,954, down from 15,288 on Tuesday.On Monday, the fresh cases count had dipped to 954, and it increased the next day to 1,349.Twenty-nine fatalities have been recorded in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 3,719, the bulletin said.On the sero-survey, the minister said a strategy is being made for the next survey, and more samples will be taken than in the previous exercise.“The results of the sero-survey conducted from June 27-July 10 came out yesterday, and it shows that nearly one-fourth of people had developed antibodies, meaning they had got infected and recovered. Most of these people who were sampled did not know that they were infected earlier,” Jain told reporters.The Delhi government has now decided to conduct more monthly sero-surveys to find a greater percentage of such people who had got infected and recovered, so as to formulate better policies for tackling COVID-19, he said.On reports of some people trying to indulge in monetary transactions for convalescent plasma, Jain warned that “strict action” will be taken if anyone tries to buy or sell plasma.The sero-prevalence study was done by the Delhi government in association with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).The study has found that around 23 per cent of the people surveyed in Delhi had an exposure to the novel coronavirus, the Central government said on Tuesday.According to NCDC Director Sujeet Kumar Singh, the remaining 77 per cent are still vulnerable to the disease and containment measures need to continue with the same rigour.The study, conducted from June 27 to July 10 by the NCDC in collaboration with the Delhi government which involved testing 21,387 samples, also indicated that a large number of infected persons remain asymptomatic, according to the Union Health Ministry.When asked about the need for more such surveys, Jain said, earlier a survey was undertaken in containment zones, then entire Delhi was represented with random sampling, and the results are coming out for the population sample which was infected 14 days ago or earlier.“It takes 14 days to develop antibodies, so the result that has just come out, represents the situation of people who got infected, say around June 15 and recovered. The next survey will represent the picture for later days,” he added.A sero-survey involves testing of blood serum of individuals to check for the prevalence of antibodies against infection.For the survey, blood samples were collected from selected individuals after taking written informed consent and then tested for IG antibodies and infection using COVID KAVACH ELISA approved by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).It was one of the largest sero-prevalence studies conducted in the country using the ELISA testing.“The population that was sampled was diversified, from young to old, men and women, and across various areas, both with and without containment zones, and with successive surveys, the results will help us formulate better strategies. However, people must continue to practice safety norms, use masks, practice social distancing and wash hands regularly,” Jain said.As per the latest survey, southeast district of Delhi was found to have sero-prevalence of 22.12 per cent, Shahadra 27.61 per cent, northwest 23.31 per cent, New Delhi 22.87 per cent, central 27.86 per cent, southwest 12.95 per cent, northeast 27.7 per cent, east 23.9 per cent, north 25.26 per cent, south 18.61 per cent and West 19.13 per cent.The total number of COVID-19 tests done till June 21 in Delhi stands at 8,71,131.The number of tests done per million to detect infection, as on Wednesday was 45,861, while the number of containment zones stood at 693.From July 11-19, fresh cases were being reported in the range of 1000-2000. The number of fresh cases reported on July 19 stood at 1,211.On June 23, the national capital had reported the highest single-day spike of 3947, till date.In a related development, the Jain announced ex-gratia of Rs 1 crore to Dr. Javed Ali who was working with Delhi’s National Rural Health Mission and died of COVID-19 earlier this week.“Dr Javed Ali working as a doctor with Delhi Govt NRHM, had succumbed to Covid. Hon CM @ArvindKejriwal has announced that he will be given Corona Warrior status. Delhi govt will give 1 cr compensation to the family,” Jain tweeted.

22-07-2020||Islamabad||Pakistan files petition in court for appointment of legal counsel for Jadhav: Report||In a unilateral move, the Pakistan government on Wednesday filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court seeking appointment of a “legal representative” for Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, according to the Pakistani media.However, the main parties, including the government of India, have not been consulted ahead of the filing of the application by the Ministry of Law and Justice under a federal ordinance.The Pakistan government, in the petition, has asked the court to appoint a legal representative for Jadhav so that Pakistan can fulfil its responsibility to see to the implementation of the International Court of Justice’s decision, the Pakistani media, including the Geo News, reported.Jadhav, the 50-year-old retired Indian Navy officer, was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of espionage and terrorism in April 2017. India approached the International Court of Justice against Pakistan for denial of consular access to Jadhav and challenging the death sentence.The Hague-based ICJ ruled in July 2019 that Pakistan must undertake an “effective review and reconsideration” of the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.Pakistan enacted an ordinance called the ‘International Court of Justice Review and Reconsideration Ordinance 2020’ on May 20 under which a petition for the review of a military court’s decision can be made to Islamabad High Court through an application within 60 days of its promulgation.The Pakistan government has claimed that Jadhav refused to file a review petition or an application to reconsider the verdict.Pakistan on Thursday provided second consular access to Jadhav, but the Indian government said the access was “neither meaningful nor credible,” and the death row prisoner appeared visibly under stress.Though the Pakistan foreign ministry had assured India that the consular access on Thursday would be unimpeded, unhindered and unconditional, it turned out that the arrangements of the meeting were not in accordance with the assurances made by Islamabad, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said.The first consular access under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations 1963 was earlier provided by Pakistan on September 2 last year.In the current petition, the Advocate General Branch (AG) of General Headquarters (GHQ) and the Ministry of Defence have been made parties.

22-07-2020||Jaipur||Gehlot writes to PM Modi over bid to ‘topple’ his govt, names Union minister Shekhawat||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging attempts to topple his government and naming Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat.In the letter written on Sunday, he accused Shekhawat, other BJP leaders and some “overambitious leaders” of his own party for being involved in the alleged attempt to bring down his Congress government.“I am not aware to what extent this is in your knowledge or if you are being misled,” Gehlot said in the letter released to the media on Wednesday. “History will not forgive those who participate in this deed.”Gehlot is caught in a power tussle with Sachin Pilot, now sacked from his post as deputy chief minister.He said the alleged attempt to bring down the Congress government in the state insulted the people’s mandate and was an open violation of constitutional values.He cited the examples of Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, the two states where Congress lost power over the past year while alleging horse-trading of MLAs by the BJP.Gehlot said for some time there have been attempts to bring down elected governments, ignoring the spirit of the anti-defection law brought in by the Rajiv Gandhi government and the amendment introduced by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.He said protecting lives is the only priority during the COVID-19 pandemic and in such a situation attempts are being made to topple the elected government in Rajasthan.“In this act, Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, other BJP leader and some overambitious leaders of our party are involved,” he said.He also named dissident Congress leader Bhanwarlal Sharma who he said had tried to bring down Bhairon Singh Shekhawat’s BJP government in Rajasthan.Gehlot said he had at that time protested against the move.The Congress has suspended Bhanwarlal Sharma and another MLA, Vishvendra Singh, from the primary membership of the party for their alleged involvement in the conspiracy.Gehlot said he is saddened that a ruling party at the Centre could ignore its priority of managing the coronavirus pandemic and is instead play the “main role” in bringing down a Congress government.He said similar allegations were levelled in connection with Madhya Pradesh and “your party was defamed across the country”.The chief minister said he firmly believed that healthy democratic and constitutional values will finally win and his government will complete its tenure while delivering good governance. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/gehlot-writes-to-pm-modi-over-bid-to-topple-his-govt-names-union-minister-shekhawat-116502

It is surprising that you had remained silent for a period of over seven months and suddenly raked up the bunch of lies solely with a purpose to malign the impeccable reputation of my client,” the notice said.The MLA told reporters on Monday that he had alerted Gehlot about the “conspiracy” to topple the Congress government in the state after Pilot allegedly made the offer.Malinga, who is holed up at a hotel along with other MLAs in the Gehlot camp, said he has not received any notice so far.“I will not comment anything on the matter,” he said.Malinga was one of six Bahujan Samaj Party MLAs who joined the Congress as a group after the 2018 assembly polls.

22-07-2020||Washington||Recent clashes initiated by PLA example of ‘unacceptable behaviour’ of CCP: Pompeo||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday said the recent clashes “initiated” by the Chinese military against India in eastern Ladakh are the latest examples of the “unacceptable behaviour” of ruling Chinese Communist Party.He also praised India’s decision to ban 59 Chinese apps, including TikTok, which he said are “security risks” to the Indian people.“It’s important that democracies like ours work together, especially as we see more clear than ever the true scope of the challenge posed by the Chinese communist party.“Our infrastructure projects, our supply chains, our sovereignty, and our people’s health and safety are all at risk. If we get it wrong,” Pompeo said in his virtual keynote address to the annual ‘India Ideas Summit’ of the US India Business Council.“The recent clashes initiated by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are just the latest examples of the Chinese Communist Party’s unacceptable behaviour. We were deeply saddened by the deaths of 20 Indian service members. I’m confident that with our concerted efforts, we can protect our interests,” he said.The troops of India and China are locked in a standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated last month following the Galwan Valley clashes that left 20 Indian Army personnel dead.Pompeo commended India’s recent decision to ban 59 Chinese mobile apps, including TikTok that present serious security risks for the Indian people.He said he was happy to report that India is a “rising US defense and security partner, in the Indo-Pacific and globally,” he said.Asserting that the United States has never been more supportive of India’s a security, he said New Delhi too, is an important partner and a key pillar of President Donald Trump’s foreign policy.“We work closely together to make sure that the world intellectual property organisation election was won by someone who respects property rights. It seems pretty basic.Pompeo noted that the so-called quad compile comprised that the US, India, Japan and Australia has been revived. “India is also part of a group of like-minded nations that I’ve convened regularly to advance shared interests,” he said.He also noted that the US has also invited Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi to the next G-7 (summit), where the leaders will advance the economic prosperity network.The G-7 is a group of countries and organisations that the US considers natural partners because they share values like democracy and transparency and the rule of law.India, Pompeo said, has a chance to attract global supply chains away from China and reduce its reliance on Chinese companies in like telecommunications, medical supplies and others.“India is in this position because it has earned the trust of many nations around the world, including the United States,” he said.“We also had to work with India to advance the blue.network, an initiative to promote high quality, transparent infrastructure development,” he said, adding that this effort is crucial to adopt because free markets are the best way to lift people out of poverty. India has seen that in its own recent past, he noted.He said that is an especially vital truth to remember today because the private sector will be indispensable and overcoming the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic that began in Wuhan, China.“But as I said last year to achieve these worthy goals, India will need to encourage an environment that is more open to increased trade and investment.“I know that’s possible because Indians and Americans share a spirit of hard work and entrepreneurship, and I’m confident our partnership is only getting stronger,” Pompeo said.The United States, he said, desires a new age of ambition in its relationship with India.“We don’t just interact on a bilateral basis. We see each other for what we are great democracies, global powers and really good friends. India is one of a few trusted like-minded countries whose leaders I call on a regular basis for counsel and collaboration on issues that span continents,” Pompeo added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/recent-clashes-initiated-by-pla-example-of-unacceptable-behaviour-of-ccp-pompeo-116493
22-07-2020||New Delhi||Rajasthan crisis: Where things stand for BJP||Perhaps the Bharatiya Janata Party had expected an easier run in Rajasthan after a rather smooth take-over in Madhya Pradesh and earlier in Karnataka---although it claims to have no hand in what it attributes to Congress’ internal problems and issues.  However, the breather for rebel Congress leader Sachin Pilot and his supporters by the high court is an advantage for the BJP, observers say. The saffron strategy depends upon Pilot's ability to save what he has and wean away some more MLAs from the Ashok Gehlot camp till Friday, when the court delivers its order on a petition filed by him and 18 other MLAs on the disqualification notices to them The saffron party is hoping the prolonged stalemate will give the former deputy chief minister more time to engineer defections and help it form the government---provided, of course, he joins the BJP, which he claims he will not.  However, if Pilot does shift to the saffron side, they can together claim 96 MLAs in the 200-member House, including 72 MLAs from the BJP, 18 Congress' rebels, three of Hanuman Beniwal's RLP and three Independents. Once MLAs of the Gehlot camp move out of the hotel they are lodged, many things can happen on the floor of the House, sources say. Senior state BJP leaders, including Om Mathur and Satish Poonia, are in regular touch with the central leadership they say. The Gehlot camp may have the edge for now but the situation might change if it "over-stretches" and this despite senior BJP leader and former chief minister Vasundhra Raje “not playing” with her party at the moment.The observers say Raje is one reason why the BJP has not been able to move as smoothly in Rajasthan as in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. Another difference, they say, is the "politically-smarter" Gehlot, who is now focusing on keeping his flock together---unlike former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath, who was chasing those who had already made up their mind to leave the Congress and join the BJP. However, it remains to be seen how long the Gehlot camp manages to hold its own against the added "pressure" from agencies like the Enforcement Directorate and the Income Tax. If Pilot and his MLAs are disqualified, the House strength will come down to 181, making 91 the halfway mark and easier for Gehlot to survive longer.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-crisis-where-things-stand-for-bjp-116491

22-07-2020||New Delhi||Can final-year exams be based on MCQ, assignments: HC asks UGC to clarify||The Delhi High Court Wednesday asked the UGC to clarify that can final-year examinations by the universities be conducted based on Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ), open choices, assignments and presentations, instead of long form exams.Justice Prathiba M Singh asked the University Grants Commission (UGC) to explain the import of its guidelines issued in April, which mentioned the type of examinations that can be held by a college, for conducting final-year exams.However, the guidelines issued by the UGC on July 6 mention only about the three modes of conducting examinations—online, offline and blend of both.The high court, which observed that unlike universities across the world, DU has not been helping its students, listed the matter for further hearing on July 24.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the UGC, assured the high court that there was no divergence internally between HRD Ministry and UGC.During the hearing, the UGC submitted that the guidelines do not permit internal assessment for evaluating final year students as it puts credibility of the system at stake.The high court was hearing a plea challenging Delhi University’s decision to hold Open Book Examination (OBE) for final year undergraduate courses which will be in long form exams.The Delhi University contended that they were holding online exams as the UGC guidelines make it mandatory to hold final year examinations.Advocate Akash Sinha, appearing for petitioner Anupam, said he was challenging the manner in which exams are being conducted and sought that there should be an alternative method of exams and OBE is not the only option with the DU as per the UGC guidelines.Advocate Apoorv Kurup, also representing the UGC, said there was no option of graduating final year students on the basis of past performance and they have to appear in a timed exam.“When we say online, we mean timed examination. When people take assignments home, sanctity is not maintained,” he said.To this, Justice Singh said at the end of the day, the percentage of people who would cheat would be minimal. “People who would cheat, can do so even in hard exams.”“You cannot presume that students will cheat. Three hours is not enough, from where will students cheat. OBE has so many problems,” the judge said.When the UGC counsel said DU can undertake a blended form of examination, the judge shot back, “Look at the condition. ICMR says that COVID-19 is going to be at its peak in November. How do you expect them to conduct the offline exam by September?”The petitioner’s counsel pointed out that many universities have opted for a creative mode of examination, including MCQs and assignment-based exams and the traditional mode is very time taking and OBE is prima facie troublesome.He submitted that the marksheet of even last semester of Physics department has not been released by the DU yet and it will take a long time to complete the final year exams process.The high court observed that it failed to understand why UGC was insisting on conducting the final exams and added “imagine the number of writ petitions that are going to come here due to the number of reasons after OBE in August. DU will be struggling with it for years. I think the administration has collapsed and students are suffering. OBE is not going to work”.“It is completely impractical to have timed examinations. We live in the heart of Delhi and there was no electricity or connectivity for hours due to the rain. You have to adopt the method for exams which is practical. There is a connectivity issue, the Internet goes, electricity goes in our country. So this proves my point,” the judge said.To this, senior advocate Sachin Dutta said he will differ with the court and claimed that OBE will be better than MCQ.“You don’t need the Internet continuously. You just need it to download and upload. We are working day and night. There is no other way,” he said.He maintained that the Ministry of Human Resource Development asked DU to postpone the exams and he has also said so in an affidavit filed before a division bench of the high court.When the court said the online exams require a minimum of 4G Internet connectivity, Dutta refuted it and said 3G speed will be fine.“Your (DU) own FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) on your website says 4G is recommended and 2G speed will not be sufficient,” the court pointed out.On being asked by the court as to why did the HRD ministry gave a direction to DU to postpone the exams, advocate Sunita Ojha replied that there was a meeting and only an advisory was given to postpone if they were not ready and DU has to examine its own preparedness.The Delhi University is scheduled to hold final year undergraduate online OBE from August 10-31 and the students who will be left out of online exams will be given an opportunity to appear in physical examinations, to be held sometime in September. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/can-final-year-exams-be-based-on-mcq-assignments-hc-asks-ugc-to-clarify-116480

22-07-2020||New Delhi||Prepare White Paper on strategy towards China, former Foreign Secretary Rao||Underscoring the end of a four-decade old phase of India-China engagement, former Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao on Wednesday advocated New Delhi bring out a White Paper on its strategy towards Beijing from here on.Drawing lessons from the development, India should look at  its interest, shape a partnership to provide more balance and come up with a White Paper on the strategy towards China which needs to be deliberated, the country’s former top diplomat said in a webinar, “India-China Relations; The End of a Chapter”, organised by the Institute of Chinese Studies.Characterising June 15 Galwan incident as a watershed, she said, it ended the turnaround in bilateral ties that came after the 1988 visit of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to China following which both sides  built upon this with a series of agreements, maintaining peace and tranquillity on the border, growth in trade ties and engagement of leadership at multiple levels.Rao who also served as Ambassador in China and the United States said while India seeks disengagement at Ladakh, it should built countervailing coalition not just from the military and security point of view but also on trade, investment and technology like 5G.Balancing the country’s core interests, she said has to go along with “sober, calibrated” diplomacy which can achieve more than conflict. While India cannot turn its back, it needs to manage across the spectrum.While aggressive rhetoric would not help, she said India could deploy its diplomatic assets and display its partnership with the United States as a valuable asset.The India-US ties, she said, have strong institutional undergirding which should stand good. Other areas include maritime cooperation with friends and democracies in the region.Adding a note of caution, she said, while building a global coalition the United States should be careful not to assume leadership but work to win support of the countries in the region.  On trade and economic relations, Rao said India’s frustration with China is not new. Besides the trade deficit, New Delhi has grievance with Beijing over its approach in IT and Pharmaceuticals.China, however, made greater inroads in both manufacturing sector and investments in India as the country looks for long-term presence.As for India wooing multinationals companies to relocate from China, the country it has a long way as it has to develop infrastructure, ports, labour, ease of doing business while the accent on economic nationalism gave contradictory signals.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/prepare-white-paper-on-strategy-towards-china-former-foreign-secretary-rao-116465
22-07-2020||Patna||Bihar MLA caught and bowled for attending cricket match amid lockdown||It was a mistimed shot by an RJD MLA in Bihar, in more than one sense of the word.Shambhu Nath Yadav, who belongs to the opposition party and represents the Brahmapur assembly segment in Buxar district, stumbled on the ground while trying to strike the ball and also ended up being booked, for violation of restrictions in place on account of the state-wide lockdown.The incident took place on Sunday when Yadav was in his constituency as a “chief guest” at a village-level cricket tournament.Videos of the MLA, missing the ball but getting thrown off balance on account of the full-blooded shot he attempted, went viral on the social media.Vishnudev Kumar, in-charge of the Ramdas Rai ke Dera outpost, said Wednesday “we learnt about the gathering, organised without permission from the local authorities and where the number of people was apparently far greater than what is allowed”.“An FIR was, thus, lodged on Monday against more than 20 people, including the legislator. Investigations are on and further action may follow”, he added.A state-wide fortnight-long lockdown was clamped on Bihar from July 15 following a massive spike in COVID 19 cases.Those who have been infected by the dreaded coronavirus in the recent past include many top political leaders, including two members of the state cabinet and the acting Chairman of the state legislative council.One sitting BJP MLC also lost his life on the previous evening at a Patna hospital where he had been admitted upon testing positive.Nonetheless, politicos of various levels routinely end up, wittingly or unwittingly, violating social distancing norms.At Teghra in Begusarai district, BJP leader ended up being booked on the count recently, along with his supporters who had congregated to celebrate his recovery from COVID 19.Ram, the state convener for the BJP’s Mahadalit cell, was among the 24 people who had tested positive after getting their samples collected at the party’s Bihar headquarters in Patna.According to inspector in-charge of Teghra police station Himanshu Kumar, Ram is among 15 people named in an FIR lodged in this connection, along with 30 unnamed ones.Meanwhile, in Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s home district of Nalanda, some villagers have been booked for hosting a party, which violated social distancing norms and where liquor also allegedly flowed in flagrant violation of the complete prohibition that has been in force in the state for nearly four years.According to DSP (law and order), Nalanda, Sanjay Kumar, the party was hosted at Bokana village late Monday night and videos purportedly of the event show the villagers gyrating alongside dance girls to the tune of lewd numbers, displaying firearms and drinking alcohol.

He was 34.In its initial probe, Mumbai Police said no suicide note was found on the spot.Rajput’s death sparked a discourse around mental health, struggle of survival for outsiders in films and monopoly of power structures, which has now been reduced to a blame game on social media.Balan said it was unfortunate that a “bright” mind like Rajput made such a choice.“I feel that someone chose to end his life and he didn’t leave a note, outlining why he did that. So we have no business to speculate and disrespect that person’s choice because he is not even here to corroborate facts. He made a choice and it’s really unfortunate, because what a bright guy,” she told PTI.The 41-year-old star said though she didn’t know Rajput personally, she believes there was much more to him than just being an actor.“... what a flourishing career. I personally feel, I’m no one to say what’s right or wrong. But I feel whatever prompted him to end his life we don’t know and we will never know. So the only way to show respect is by keeping quiet,” Balan added. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/we-have-no-business-to-speculate-vidya-balan-on-sushant-singh-rajputs-death-116453

We have gone through the petition,” the bench said and referred to one of the tweets “made against the CJI”.It also referred to another tweet by Bhushan on June 27.During the hearing, senior advocate Sajan Poovayya, appearing for Twitter, told the bench that Twitter India has wrongly been made a party in the matter and it should have been Twitter INC.He also told the bench that if the top court directs, then Twitter would disable the alleged contemptuous tweets.The bench noted in its order that Poovayya has “submitted that the Twitter Inc., California, USA is the correct description on which the tweets were made by Prashant Bhushan.” “Let the reply be also filed by them,” the bench said and posted the matter for further hearing on August 5.Bhushan has been raising issues pertaining to judiciary and recently he was critical of the way in which the top court handled the matters related to migrant workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Earlier also, the apex court in November 2009, had issued contempt notice to Bhushan for allegedly casting aspersions on some sitting and former top court judges in an interview to a news magazine.The matter which was not heard by the apex court as per the record available on the top court’s website since May 2012 is now listed for hearing on July 24.It is schedule to be heard by a bench headed by Justice Mishra on Friday (July 24) as per the list of business uploaded on the apex court website. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/contempt-proceedings-sc-issues-notice-to-activist-lawyer-prashant-bhushan-116445

All sentences would run concurrently, the court said.The court also ordered payment of Rs 30,000 to the next of kin of each of the deceased and Rs 2,000 to the four injured persons, Vijai Singh, Chandan Singh, Nawab Singh and Babu Lal, in the encounter.Out of 18 persons sent up for trial by the CBI, three policemen, Sita Ram, Neki Ram and Kuldeep, had died during its pendency and the case was abated against them.The three ex-policemen who were acquitted of charges of shielding their colleagues by creating false records are former inspector Kan Singh Shirvi of Bharatpur Crime Branch and head constables Hari Kishan and Govind Prasad.   One former policeman, Mahendra Singh, was discharged in the case. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/all-11-ex-cops-guilty-of-killing-bharatpur-royal-scion-his-2-colleagues-given-life-term-116439

But things got worse with the arrival of monsoon and he was left with no safe shelter,” Sheikh said.At one point, the elderly man fell very ill due to the weather and had to be taken to a civic-run hospital nearby, he said.However, a hospital staffer again brought Shinde back to the streets after giving him some medicines, Sheikh said.Shopkeepers in the area are now trying to get help from local activists to shift Shinde to an old age home, where he can remain safe during the present health crisis.

Bar bodies have been asked to respond as why they can't receive donations from members of the Bar other legitimate institutions to help needy lawyers.The matter will be taken up for hearing after two weeks.Currently, advocates are not allowed to be on payroll of any employer and those indulging in such activities face action for violating professional ethics.Earlier, Bar Council of India -- which regulates the legal profession in the country -- and other Bar bodies had raised the issue of dwindling sources of income of lawyers due to COVID19 lockdown and restricted functioning of courts across India.On July 14, the top court had issued notice to BCI on a PIL seeking a direction to BCI to allow them to advertise to get work and to take up other assignments to survive during COVID19 crisis asking it to respond in two weeks.As common lawyers find it difficult to earn a decent living during COVID19 pandemic, a PIL had sought a direction to BCI to allow them to advertise to get work and to take up other assignments to survive.Filed by advocate Chanderjeet Chanderpal, the petition requested the top court to direct BCI to relax rules of professional conduct that debarred advocates from advertising.Advocates should be allowed to be employed at companies on monthly retainers and earn a livelihood through other sources in these trying times, submitted Chanderpal."Advocates are dying, landing in depression, are not having money for medical expenses for their dependents etc, there are also reports of suicides and this has happened due to closure of Courts and other legal activities as a result of COVID-19 lockdown," the petition submitted.The PIL had sought a direction to BCI to amend its Rules to allow advocates to get employed as legal advisors on a retainer basis and permit them to advertise through limited and specific sources to solicit chamber work with an undertaking that it shall not continue beyond March 2021.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lawyers-facing-tough-time-sc-issues-notice-to-bar-bodies-on-alternative-jobs-116413

22-07-2020||The colour of Lonar lake water in Maharashtra's Buldhana district turned pink due to a large presence of the salt-loving 'Haloarchaea' microbes||Lonar lake turned pink due to 'Haloarchaea' microbes: Probe||Salt-loving microbesHaloarchaea or halophilic archaea is a bacteria culture that produces pink pigment and is found in water saturated with salt.The oval-shaped Lonar lake, formed after a meteorite hit the earth some 50,000 years ago, is a popular tourist hub.The colour of the lake water recently turned pink, which has not only surprised locals, but scientists too.The state forest department informed the Bombay High Court last month that it had already collected the lake water samples and sent them for probe to the Nagpur-based National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEER) and the Agharkar Research Institute in Pune."Initially, we thought it was because of the red- pigmented Dunaliella algae due to which the water might have turned pink. But during the investigation of the lake water samples, we found the water turned pink due to the large presence of Haloarchaea population in the lake," Agharkar Research Institute Director Dr Prashant Dhakephalkar said."And since it (Haloarchaea) produces a pink pigment, it formed a pink colour mat on the water surface," he said.The increased salinity and pH facilitated the growth of halophilic microbes, mainly Haloarchae, he said.The other scope of the investigation was to find out whether the colour attributed to the water was permanent."So, we allowed the sample water to stand still for some time and we found out that the biomass settled at the bottom and the water became clear and transparent," he said. "So basically, it was the biomass of these microbes and because of that the surface of the water turned red or pink and as soon as the biomass subsided, the colour disappeared," he explained.The scientist said the colour of the lake is now returning to original as the rainy season has kicked in, allowing dilution of the water. Because of that, the salinity and pH/alkalinity levels have also come down and green algae have started growing in the water body.Dhakephalkar said during the investigation, they also came across an interesting incidental finding related to flamingos that visit the lake. The plumage of the bird is pink or reddish in colour because of ingestion of carotenoids-rich food, he said."This bacteria, which produces a pink pigment, is ingested by these birds and they get carotenoid-rich food, because of that their plumage is pink in colour. So before we noticed it, these flamingos might have noticed the red colour at the lake and landed there," he said. He said this would be another interesting aspect to find out.

A raid was also conducted at the residence of former MP Badriram Jakhar, they said.The Opposition BJP in Rajasthan had earlier accused Agrasen Gehlot of being involved in a scam during the UPA regime and alleged that his company exported subsidised fertiliser.The ED’s raids come at a time when the Rajasthan Congress is in crisis following simmering differences between Ashok Gehlot and his former deputy Sachin Pilot.

22-07-2020||Washington||China cannot threaten countries and bully them in Himalayas: Pompeo||Attacking China for its aggressive moves against its neighbours, including "instigating" a deadly confrontation with India in eastern Ladakh, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that Beijing cannot threaten countries and bully them in the Himalayas.Speaking at a news conference in London on Tuesday, Pompeo said China was one of the important parts of his discussions with his British counterpart Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.“You can't go make claims for maritime regions that you have no lawful claim to. You can't threaten countries and bully them in the Himalayas. You can't engage in cover-ups and co-opt international institutions like the World Health Organisation,” Pompeo said.Pompeo's comment on Chinese bullying of its Himalayan neighbours came in response to a question if the US would like the UK to do more to confront China.“I don't think about it that way; we don't think about it that way. We think that the entire world needs to work together to ensure that every country, including China, behaves in the international system in ways that are appropriate and consistent with the international order,” he said.“We talked about how we've seen Hong Kong's freedoms crushed. We've watched the CCP bully its neighbours, militarise features in the South China Sea, and instigate a deadly confrontation with India,” Pompeo said.The troops of India and China are locked in a standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated last month following the Galwan Valley clashes that left 20 Indian Army personnel dead. China recently staked claim over the Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary in Bhutan at the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Council and opposed funding to the project.China claims almost all of the South China Sea as its sovereign territory. China has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.The discussions between Pompeo and Raab came hours after the UK suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong in response to a controversial security law imposed by China in the former British territory.He praised the UK for its recent decision on China in particular those related to Hong Kong and banning Huawei from the UK's 5G networks.

22-07-2020||Washington||US lawmakers pass legislation urging China to de-escalate situation with India along LAC||The US House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan legislation, urging China to peacefully de-escalate the situation with India along the Line of Actual Control.The legislation on Tuesday came a day after the House unanimously passed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), slamming China’s aggression against India in the Galwan Valley and its growing territorial assertiveness in and around disputed areas like the South China Sea.The troops of India and China are locked in a standoff in several areas along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh since May 5. The situation deteriorated last month following the Galwan Valley clashes that left 20 Indian Army personnel dead.The resolution, sponsored by Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi along with eight others, was passed by the House along with National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for the fiscal year 2021 and condemned Chinese aggression towards India along the Line of Actual Control.“Through the passage of today’s bill, the House has sent a clear, bipartisan message that the government of the People’s Republic of China must peacefully de-escalate the situation along the Line of Actual Control with India,” Krishnamoorthi said in a statement.“China’s military provocations of India are unacceptable, and the peaceful resolution of their border standoff will help restore greater security to the Indo-Pacific region,” he said.Through this vote, the US House of Representatives has reaffirmed the readiness of the US to stand with its allies and partners like India against Chinese military aggression, Krishnamoorthi said.Other co-sponsors of the resolution are Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna and lawmakers Frank Pallone, Tom Suozzi, Ted Yoho, George Holding, Sheila Jackson-Lee, Haley Stevens and Steve Chabot.In the months leading up to June 15, along the Line of Actual Control, the Chinese military reportedly amassed 5,000 soldiers; and is trying to redraw long-standing settled boundaries through the use of force and aggression, the Congressional resolution says.Noting that India and China have reached an agreement to de-escalate and disengage along the Line of Actual Control, the resolution says that on June 15, at least 20 Indian soldiers and an unconfirmed number of Chinese soldiers were killed in skirmishes following a weeks-long standoff in Eastern Ladakh, which is the de facto border between the two countries.“The Government of the People’s Republic of China should work toward de-escalating the situation along the Line of Actual Control with India through existing diplomatic mechanisms and not through force,” it said.It is the sense of the Congress that there is significant concern about the continued military aggression by China along its border with India and in other parts of the world, including with Bhutan, in the South China Sea, and with the Senkaku Islands, as their aggressive posture towards Hong Kong and Taiwan.China claims almost all of the South China Sea as its sovereign territory. China has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.China has impeded commercial activity like fishing or mineral exploration by countries like Vietnam and the Philippines.Ties between China and Japan have been strained by a territorial row over a group of islands in the East China Sea, known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China. A day earlier, the House had passed a similar NDAA amendment moved by Congressman Steve Chabot and Indian-American lawmaker Ami Bera which said that India and China should work towards de-escalating the situation along the LAC and also expressed concern about Chinese aggression in an around disputed territories like the South China Sea.The resolution comes days after the House of Representatives Caucus on India and Indian-Americans in a letter to India’s Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, said that over the last few months, the Chinese authorities have been acting with impunity and have attempted to transgress on the LAC, which resulted in diplomatic discussions to implement a process for de-escalation along the LAC on July 6.It was led by Congressmen Holding and Brad Sherman and signed by seven other lawmakers. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/us-lawmakers-pass-legislation-urging-china-to-de-escalate-situation-with-india-along-lac-116378

Justice Bobde asked him to approach the court’s Registry.Pilot and 18 rebel Congress MLAs have challenged before the high court the disqualification notices issued to them by the assembly Speaker.On Tuesday, the high court said it would deliver its order on July 24 on rebel Congress MLAs’ petition and asked Joshi to defer the disqualification proceedings till then.Contending that the disqualification process was a part of the assembly proceedings, Joshi said the high court could not have asked him to defer it till Friday, particularly because he had already extended twice the deadline to receive replies of rebel Congress MLAs.The disqualification proceedings under anti-defection law i.e. paragraph 2(1)(a) of the 10th Schedule of the Constitution was initiated against the 19 MLAs after the Congress Legislature Party complained to the Speaker that the they had defied a whip to attend two meetings last week.The rebel MLAs contended that a party whip applied only during assembly session.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-speaker-moves-sc-against-hc-order-to-postpone-disqualification-proceedings-against-rebel-cong-mlas-116375

22-07-2020||Washington||US leading world in Covid testing, India second: Trump||The United States is leading the world in terms of Covid-19 testing and India is at second position, President Donald Trump said while giving an update on his administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic.So far, more than 140,000 Americans have died due to coronavirus and 3.8 million have tested positive. While the US economy is slowly coming back to normal, the pandemic is now spreading in the Sun Belt of the country.“As one family, we mourn every precious life that's been lost. I pledge in their honour that we will develop a vaccine and we will defeat the virus. We're doing very well with vaccine development and therapeutic development,” Trump said at a White House news conference on Tuesday, his first on coronavirus after weeks.Trump said his administration would stop at nothing to save lives and shield the vulnerable.“We've learned so much about this disease. And we know who the vulnerable are, and we are going to indeed shield them,” he said.Trump assured that the vaccines against the novel coronavirus would be coming a lot sooner than expected.Replying to a question, Trump said the US is “leading the world" in terms of COVID-19 testing."We're going to be over 50 million tests," he said, adding that "second country is India with 12 million (tests). Then you have seven million, six million, and four million. I think that we are doing a tremendous amount of testing.” The "China virus", Trump said, is a vicious and dangerous illness.“It's a nasty, horrible disease that should've never been allowed to escape China, but it did. It infected the world, and the world is suffering. But we're going to get it taken care of, and we're helping lots of other countries,” the US President said.On tackling the virus, Trump said his administration is developing a powerful strategy."We've learned a great deal about it (COVID-19) and who it targets. We are in the process of developing a strategy that's going to be very, very powerful," he said.“Some areas of our country are doing very well; others are doing less well. It will probably, unfortunately, get worse before it gets better,” Trump said.He said the median age of those who succumb to COVID-19 infection is 78, adding that roughly half of all deaths have been individuals in nursing homes or in long-term care.“Young adults may often have mild or even no symptoms. They won't even know they're sick. They won't have any idea that they have a virus. They won't have any idea at all,” he said, adding that youth will act responsibly.Trump said the data shows children have the lowest fatality risk as 99.96 per cent of all virus fatalities are adults.“By understanding these risk profiles and learning how to treat the disease, we've been able to greatly reduce mortality in the United States,” Trump said.Several treatments are already available in the US that can significantly reduce the severity and duration of the disease, including remdesivir, he said.“We've learned best practices for treatment of the virus at every stage and have shared these findings with medical providers, and we've shared them all over the world. The relationship with other countries has been very strong. We're all working together," Trump said.

22-07-2020||Ajay Banerjee||China’s LAC stance expansive, goes beyond its1960 claim line||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, July 21China’s actions along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh seek to alter whatever is the approximate alignment at the undemarcated border, aiming to create fresh tussles in addition to the 10 known points of dispute or differing perception.The four fresh disagreements—Galwan, patrol points (PP) 15 and 17A and Finger-4 at Pangong Tso—have separate implications. While Galwan is a fresh claim, the other three fall in gray areas, implying these are geographically located between the multiple self-claimed boundaries of China and the Indian perception of the LAC. Any construction or holding onto territory in disputed (or gray areas) is barred under agreement between the two countries.It is clearly an attempt to push India westwards to “fix” a fresh LAC that partly adheres to the 1962 war-time position of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and partly to China’s own claim line of 1960, said a senior functionary. The disengagement process that started some two weeks ago has hit a hurdle as the PLA is yet to fully pull back to points agreed upon by the two sides.The PP-15, PP-17A and Finger-4 disputes are geographically located between China’s own claim line of 1960 and Indian perception of LAC. Then there is an overlapping claim also, stemming from the conflict of October-November 1962. Post the war, the PLA retreated to its own 1960 claim line in certain pockets and at other places, it remained west (towards India) of the 1960 claim line.In 1996, a joint working group identified Trig heights in northern Ladakh and Demchok in southern Ladakh as the two points of dispute.No maps have been exchanged but an Indian assessment, based on activities of the PLA patrol parties, is that there are eight other pockets of differing perceptions of the LAC. Starting from the northern-most point, these are Sumar Lung Pa, Depsang plains, point 6556 (that is height of the peak in metres), Chang Lung Nullah, Kongka La, Spanggur, Mount Sajjam and Domchelle.A source cited that at Pangong, the 1960 claim of China was at Srijap, post-1962 it advanced to Finger- 8. In 2020, the PLA is at Finger-4. One of the preconditions India wants is that China moves back to Finger-8 before further de-escalation. At PP-17A, the PLA is keen to hold onto a vantage height.Naval aircraft headed NorthThe Indian Navy’s Poseidon 8I anti-submarine warfare aircraft have been deployed in eastern Ladakh to carry out surveillance along the LAC and some of its MiG-29K jets are likely to be stationed at key IAF bases in the northern sector amid the border row with China, sources said. The Indian Navy has some 45 MiG 29K jets from Russia. It also has some 60 of the land-based jets called MiG 29.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/chinas-lac-stance-expansive-goes-beyond-its1960-claim-line-116154

Defiance of the whip can lead to action against rebel MLAs, thereby exerting pressure on at least some of them to return to the Congress fold. The schedules of the session were still being discussed, it is learnt. The CM had called a legislature party meet earlier today and again slammed Pilot.Meanwhile, Pilot has sent a legal notice to Congress MLA Giriraj Malinga over his allegation that he was offered money by the former Deputy CM.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajasthan-high-court-puts-off-verdict-on-rebels-till-july-24-116132
