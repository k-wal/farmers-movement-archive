29-11-2020||Lucknow||BJP government has no sympathy for farmers, only worried about corporates: Akhilesh||Hitting out at Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday alleged that developmental works have stalled and the farmers were feeling agitated while the state government has its “head bowed down before criminals”.“Instead of discharging constitutional duties, his (Adityanath’s) mind is more engaged in going to other states as a star campaigner (for polls) and changing the name of cities,” a statement issued by the Samajwadi Party quoted Yadav as saying.Addressing a rally for Hyderabad municipal elections, Adityanath on Saturday said that if Faizabad and Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh can become Ayodhya and Prayagraj, Hyderabad could again become ‘Bhagyanagar’.The Samajwadi Party chief claimed the BJP government does not care for the farmers.“The government does not have any sympathy for the farmers. It is only worried about the corporate houses and how to fill their coffers and hold hostage the resources of the state,” Yadav said.“Insulting farmers by calling them terrorists shows the narrow mindset of the BJP. The BJP, which favours the rich, is conspiring to mortgage farms, farming, small business, trading, roads, transportation and everything else to the rich,” he said.If farmers are terrorists for the BJP, the BJP leaders and workers should pledge not to consume the food grown by them, Yadav added. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/bjp-government-has-no-sympathy-for-farmers-only-worried-about-corporates-akhilesh-177599

In such situation, the contesting candidates should be considered as rejected and not be allowed in the fresh election. Right to reject and elect new candidate will give power to the people to express their discontent. If voters are dissatisfied with the background of the contesting candidate, they will opt NOTA to reject such candidate and elect a new candidate,” the plea said.The plea said the percentage of candidates with criminal antecedents and their chances of winning has actually increased steadily over the years.“The injury caused to public is extremely large and continue till date, as the right to reject is an integral part of Article 19, but the Centre and ECI did nothing to declare the election result invalid and hold a fresh election if maximum votes are polled in favour of NOTA,” it added.

Apart from the other seven SCO members (Kazakhstan, China, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan), four observer states---Afghanistan, Belarus, Iran and Mongolia---will also participate. Turkmenistan will be invited as a special guest.India’s engagement with SCO started in 2005 as an Observer State and India became a full member at the SCO’s Astana summit in 2017.The meeting will come out with a Joint Communique containing major proposals of Member States on issues of trade and economic cooperation.  There will also be a report on the implementation of the SCO Multilateral Trade and Economic Cooperation prepared by the SCO Secretariat.During its Chairmanship, India has particularly focused on creating three new pillars of cooperation: Startups and Innovation, Science and Technology and Traditional Medicine and also proposed many other concrete initiatives.“By hosting the 19th meeting of the SCO CHG, India hopes to further strengthen trade, economic and cultural cooperation within SCO,” said a MEA press release.India considers SCO as an important regional organisation to promote cooperation in the areas of peace, security, trade, economy and culture and is committed to widening cooperation by playing a proactive, positive and constructive role in the organisation, it added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sco-heads-of-govt-chg-slated-to-discuss-vaccines-by-india-russia-china-177591
29-11-2020||New Delhi||Centre should hold talks with farmers immediately, unconditionally: Kejriwal||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday asked the Centre to immediately and unconditionally hold talks with the farmers who continued to protest against the new agriculture laws staying put at the Singhu and Tikri border points of the national capital for the fourth consecutive day.The Aam Aadmi Party has supported the farmers’ protest and its national convenor Kejriwal asked the Centre to immediately meet the farmers.“The central government should talk to farmers immediately (and) unconditionally,” he said in a tweet.AAP leader Sanjay Singh said that his party demands that Home Minister Amit Shah should first resolve the issues of the farmers by listening to them.“The Aam Aadmi Party under the leadership of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is standing beside the farmers. We welcome the farmers to Delhi, we will fight shoulder to shoulder with them,” he said.At a press conference on Sunday, senior AAP leader and chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said his party believes that Shah has shown “utter irresponsibility” by leaving the national capital to campaign for Hyderabad municipal elections when lakhs of farmers were waiting at the Delhi border to talk to him.Bhardwaj said on one hand, Amit Shah was telling the farmers that coronavirus cases might increase due to their protest and on the other, he was claiming that in his Hyderabad roadshow there was massive public participation which shows “no social distancing was maintained”.“The Aam Aadmi Party believes that this is the utter hypocrisy of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and we condemn such irresponsible act. The AAP believes that such a home minister is very dangerous for India,” he said.“In this serious situation, the home minister of our country is not in Delhi but in Hyderabad and he is holding a press conference regarding the issues related to Hyderabad municipality. He is taking out massive roadshows,” Bhardwaj said.At another press conference, party MLA and spokesperson Atishi alleged that the Centre was “intolerant” towards thousands of farmers sitting at the border of Delhi.“Posing conditions for the farmers, the government is saying that it will not talk to the farmers unless the farmers concede to its demands of moving to a particular place to hold a dialogue,” she said.AAP leader Raghav Chadha hit out at Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh over the farm laws, holding him “equally responsible for crushing” the farmer protests.“There is a nexus and friendship between PM Narendra Modi and Captain Amarinder Singh. Together they are duping and deceiving the farmers,” Chadha claimed.The Congress’ 2019 election manifesto had the proposal of the abolition of APMC markets and also these three “black laws” brought by the Modi government.“Amarinder Singh is acting on behalf of the BJP and has become the Chief Minister of BJP. He is instructing the farmers of Punjab to accept the terms and conditions of Union Home Minister Amit Shah,” Chadha alleged. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/centre-should-hold-talks-with-farmers-immediately-unconditionally-kejriwal-177590

While one pilot was rescued, the second one, identified as Commander Nishant Singh, has been still missing.After the incident, the Navy launched an extensive search and rescue operation to locate the missing pilot.“Some debris of the aircraft including landing gear, turbo charger, fuel tank engine and wing engine cowling have been located,” Indian Navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said.Apart from warships and aircraft of the Navy, the coastal police were on the lookout for the missing pilot, he said, adding nearby fishing villages had also been sensitised about the incident.A high-level inquiry has already been ordered to investigate the incident. It was the third accident involving the Mig-29K aircraft in the last one year.A MiG-29K twin-seat fighter aircraft had crashed in South Goa district on November 16 last year and both the pilots had ejected safely. Another MIG-29K crashed into the Arabian Sea off the Goa coast on February 23 this year after taking off from INS Hansa, a prominent naval air station at Vasco in Goa. The pilot of the aircraft had managed to eject safely.The MiG-29K is an all-weather carrier-based multirole fighter aircraft developed by Russian aerospace company Mikoyan (MiG). The Indian Navy had procured a fleet of 45 MiG-29Ks from Russia at a cost of around USD 2 billion to operate from INS Vikramaditya.INS Vikramaditya was part of the second phase of the Malabar exercise involving navies of India, the US, Australia and Japan.The MIG-29K fleet onboard the aircraft carrier was also involved in the mega naval drill that took place from November 17 to 20.

He volunteered to join the special unit last year after he had a stint with the special duty group that secures the Parliament in Delhi,” a senior CRPF officer told PTI as he remembered the commando.Bhalerao had joined the Chhattisgarh unit in June.He was a decorated officer as he won combat competitions and participated in all-India police commando duty meets. He was very close to his mother who raised him after he lost his father very early, the officer said.Bhalerao, who would have celebrated his 34th birthday on December 21, was very fond of his six-year-old daughter Vedangi, he said.“Bhalerao was a very committed trooper and this was evident from the fact that he joined the CRPF in 2010 as a sub-inspector but he worked hard and cleared exams to be appointed as a gazetted officer in 2018,” the officer added.His last rites will take place on Sunday at his home town in Nashik in Maharashtra.A total of 10 commandos including Bhalerao were injured in the blast, including the team leader and second-in-command rank officer Dinesh Kumar Singh.While seven personnel are under treatment at a hospital in Raipur, two are being treated at a field hospital at Chintalnar in Sukma, about 450 km from the Chhattisgarh capital.The officer said that all nine are out of danger.A joint team of the CoBRA and the local police was out for an area domination exercise when the blast took place.The team was scouting the area for the proposed induction of some new battalions of the CRPF and establishment of new camps when the IED went off, official sources said.Five fresh CRPF battalions are expected to be inducted in the south Bastar region of Chhattisgarh for anti-naxal duties after the Union Home Ministry recently gave its approval. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/kill-the-beast-crpf-commandos-last-message-to-his-colleague-177587

After a long time the farmer is going to come out of a locked system.Whoever wants to oppose it politically let them do it. I have never said the farmers protest is political and would never say (that it is political)."Shah has already appealed to the protesting farmers to shift to the Burari ground in the national capital to stage their protests and said the Centre was ready to hold discussions with them as soon as they move to the designated place.Replying to a query, Shah also criticised AIMIM chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi over his reported remarks on what action the NDA government had taken over charges that Pakistanis, Rohingyas and Bangladeshis were illegally staying in Hyderabad.Shah demanded Owaisi to give in writing on removing those staying illegally to initiate government's action against them."When I take action they (Owaisi and other parties) create ruckus in the Parliament. Have you not seen?" he asked."Let them once give me in writing to expel Rohingyas and Bangladeshis.. then I will initiate action. It should not just be a speech limited to elections.When there is discussion over the matter in the Parliament, who takes their side? the people of the country know it," Shah added.During the poll campaign for December 1 city civic body polls, both AIMIM and BJP had engaged in heated exchange of statements over alleged presence of illegal migrants inthe Old City here. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/never-said-farmers-protests-were-political-says-amit-shah-177584

The vaccine had led to a virtual neurological breakdown in him.”The notice said it is impossible to “quantify monetarily, the sufferings, trauma, pain and humiliation (of hands, legs and body being tied and fastened firmly to the bed), which he and his family have undergone and are likely to undergo for a long time to come”.When contacted, a spokesperson for Ramachandra said, “We also have got the notice,” but declined to elaborate.According to the legal notice, the information provided in the ‘Participant Information Sheet (PIS)’ was absolutely certain that Covishield, the vaccine developed by Oxford University, is safe and the man was hence led to believe it.Hence, he decided to become a volunteer and signed the informed consent on September 29 and the test result for antibodies against coronavirus turned negative the same day.On October 1, he was administered the vaccine.Though there were no side effects for the first 10 days, he subsequently had episodes like severe headache and vomitting.A doctor suggested investigations like a CT-scan as the man was oblivious of what was happening around him and could not respond to questions.Detailing the sequence of events since October 11 when he was admitted to the Ramachandra Hospital and as narrated by the man’s wife, the notice said he showed behavioural changes.He could neither recognise anyone nor speak and was totally disoriented and was shifted to the ICU and was on October 26, “discharged at our (family’s) request”.     At home, he seemed quite disoriented at times and was unable to relate to things or work.He would not have volunteered for the test vaccine if all the potential risk factors of the test vaccine had been known to him.But on the other hand, there was a clear assertion of the safety nature of the test vaccine in the PIS which made him to become a volunteer, the notice said.The legal notice has also been addressed to the Drugs Controller General of India, Professor Andrew Pollard, chief investigator, Oxford vaccine trial, The Jenner Institute Laboratories of the University of Oxford and Astra Zeneca UK.'Malicious'Serum Institute of India however rejected the volunteer’s allegations as malicious, and threatened to sue for damages.“The allegations in the notice are malicious and misconceived. While the Serum Institute of India is sympathetic with the volunteer’s medical condition, there is absolutely no correlation with the vaccine trial and the medical condition of the volunteer,” Serum Institute of India said in a statement.The volunteer is falsely laying the blame for his medical problems on the COVID vaccine trial, it added.“It is evident that the intention behind the spreading of such malicious information is an oblique pecuniary motive. The Serum Institute of India, will seek damages in excess of 100 crore for the same and will defend such malicious claims,” Serum Institute said. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covidshield-vaccine-trial-participant-alleges-neuro-breakdown-impaired-cognitive-functions-177565
29-11-2020||New Delhi||PM hailing farm laws shows govt ‘drunk with power’, ‘rigid’ in face of protests: Congress||Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for reiterating that the new agri-laws are beneficial for farmers, the Congress on Sunday has said the insistence in support of the legislations shows that the government is “drunk with power” and is rigid even in reconsidering the laws.The Opposition party also demanded that Prime Minister Modi should immediately announce the suspension of the three “anti-agriculture” laws.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked the government over the protest by farmers, alleging “promise was to double farmers’ income, the Modi government did double income, but that of Adani-Ambani”.“Those who are still defending the black farm laws, what solution will they find in favour of farmers?” he said in a tweet in Hindi, adding that, “Ab hogi (now there will be) #KisaanKiBaat”.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the Prime Minister’s “obduracy, arrogance and rigidity in dealing with 62 crore farmers and farm labourers of India is writ large” over his insistence in the ‘Mann ki Baat’ that the three “anti-farmer, anti-agriculture” laws are correct.“For the Prime Minister to say that these three laws are absolutely right when lakhs and lakhs of farmers are sitting around Delhi agitating, demanding their withdrawal, shows that the Modi government is drunk with power and Prime Minister Modi does not at a press conference at the AICC headquarters here.It shows that a government “drunk with power” is rigid even in re-contemplating and reconsidering the three “anti-agriculture black laws”.Surjewala’s remarks came hours after Prime Minister Modi, in his monthly ‘Mann ki Baat’ broadcast, asserted that these reforms have opened doors of new opportunities for farmers and bestowed on them new rights.Modi also said the farm laws had begun mitigating the troubles of farmers in a short period of time since their enactment in September as he cited the example of a Maharashtra farmer who used their provisions to get the money a trader had promised but not paid to him in time.Surjewala also hit out at Union Home Minister Amit Shah for attending a political event in Hyderabad but not reaching out to farmers immediately.“If the Home Minister of India has time to travel 1,200 km to Hyderabad to attend a public meeting, why does Amit Shah does not have the time to go 15 km to the borders of Delhi and talk to the agitating farmers, why is it that the agriculture minister has taken out a date of December 3 before which no conversation can be held, have they consulted an astrologer for this purpose,” the Congress leader said.Posing several questions to the Modi government, Surjewala asked why “12,000 FIRs have been lodged against farmers” and why was that that no dialogue was taking place with them.He accused the BJP leaders and Chief Ministers of branding farmers as “terrorists” and asked why was it that select TV channels “aided and abetted by the Modi government are out to prove 62 crore farmers are anti-nationals”.Surjewala alleged that the three farm laws tantamount to finishing the minimum support price mechanism which he said “will be a death knell for the interest of the farmers”.“Prime Minister Modi wants to barter the interest of the farmers at the alter of four to five crony capitalist friends of his and ensure that Rs 20-25 lakh crore commodity market is controlled by his four to five crony capitalist friends,” he alleged.“But the Prime Minister has bitten more than he can chew because when 62 crore farmers rise in unison, the ‘Delhi darbar’ will be unseated and that is not a warning, that is a challenge to the prime minister,” he said.The Congress demands that Prime Minister Modi should immediately announce the suspension of the three anti-farming laws and all the “12,000 cases” against farmers be unconditionally withdrawn, Surjewala said.He said the Prime Minister and Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar should apologise for the treatment meted out to farmers and Modi should personally speak with the delegation of farmers.After spending another night in cold, thousands of farmers continued to protest against the Centre’s new agri laws on the fourth consecutive day on Sunday staying put at the Singhu and Tikri border points, with farmer leaders deliberating upon their future course of action about proposed talks with the government.The three farm laws are — The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation); The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance; and Farm Services and The Essential Commodities (Amendment).Farmers say they are apprehensive that the laws will pave way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporates.

29-11-2020||New Delhi||PM’s visit to vaccine hubs: Anand Sharma counters Surjewala||Divisions in the Congress over the nature of political opposition to the Bharatiya Janata Party became even more pronounced on Sunday with veteran Anand Sharma contradicting Congress chief spokesman Randeep Singh Surjewala on the latter’s comments about Prime Minister’s visits to vaccine hubs on Saturday.Surjewala, while backing the farmers’ protests on Saturday, had said the Prime Minister should engage the farmers instead of visiting corporate offices of vaccine manufacturers.“मोदी जी कम्पनियों के दफ़्तर जा फ़ोटो खिंचा रहे हैं और लाखों किसान दिल्ली के सड़कों  पर कराह रहे हैं।““How we wish the PM stood on the land and spoke to farmers instead of flying in his jets. COVID vaccine will be discovered by researchers and scientists while the country’s food security will be ensured by farmers. The PM and the BJP will meanwhile just manage the television,” Surjewala had said on Saturday.Former minister and senior Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma however countered the party line on the issue on Sunday saying, “Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s visit to Serum Institute, Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadilla was a recognition of Indian scientists and their work to produce the vaccine for COVID-19 That alone will lift morale of frontline warriors and reassure the nation”.Sharma said the PM’s visit was about respecting the Institutions that India has built over decades that have expertise and potential making India world’s largest vaccine manufacturer.“Urging PM to ensure that an efficient and equitable platform is functional as the vaccine arrives,” he said.Sharma is part of the group of 23 leaders who have sought radical changes to party organisation and a considered and deliberated view on policy issues rather than an anti Modi narrative which a section of the Congress believes is boomeranging.Within the Congress, Rahul Gandhi is the leader of the anti PM narrative and that’s the broad party line on issues.Sharma’s open rebuttal today of the Congress line shows some leaders May voice opinions independent of the party line on major issues in the coming days.Sharma had recently opposed India’s decision not to join the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership trade block, even when Rahul Gandhi’s public position has been against the pact.Sharma had called the move a step backwards.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pms-visit-to-vaccine-hubs-anand-sharma-counters-surjewala-177563
29-11-2020||Indore||MP: Farmers dump guavas in garbage vehicle as prices crash||A video showing a group of farmers dumping freshly-harvested guavas into a civic garbage collection vehicle here has gone viral on social media, with the experts saying that a bumper crop of the fruit this year has resulted in its prices falling.The wholesale prices of this vitamin C-rich fruit at Devi Ahilya Bai Holkar Fruit and Vegetable Market in Indore currently ranges between Rs 4 and Rs 10 per kilo, sources in the market said on Sunday.Farm sector experts said the prices of guava have nosedived due to its abundant crop, which is ultimately causing losses to the cultivators.Due to the falling prices, disappointed farmers are leaving behind the fruits in the market after finding that they are not getting enough returns.The farmers know that transporting the fruits back was not beneficial due to the costs involved, they added.Talking to PTI, Rajesh Patel, who grows this fruit in Madhya Pradesh’s Ratlam district, said, “The bumper guava harvest in Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and other states has sent its prices crashing.”The wholesale market of guava in Delhi, which supplies this fruit to the northern part of the country, has been hit hard due to the coronavirus situation there, he said.Country guavas perish in three-four days after being plucked, he added. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mp-farmers-dump-guavas-in-garbage-vehicle-as-prices-crash-177562
29-11-2020||Mumbai||MVA govt ‘natural’, will stay on: Sanjay Raut||Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Sunday slammed the BJP for calling the MVA government in Maharashtra as “unnatural”, and said a government is natural till it exists.In his weekly column ‘Rokthok’ in the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, Raut recalled that during alliance talks last year, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge had a heated argument over the Assembly Speaker’s post.“He (Pawar) collected his papers and left the room in anger. I have never seen Pawar so angry,” he said.Raut said the situation changed after that and the next day at dawn (on November 23) BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis and NCP’s Ajit Pawar took oath in a ceremony at Raj Bhavan.Their government collapsed within 80 hours.Last week, former Maharashtra Chief Minister Fadnavis termed the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), which comprises the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress, as an “unnatural alliance”, and said the day this tie-up breaks, his party will give a strong government to the state.Reacting to it, Raut said, “The BJP has been predicting the government’s downfall and how it will be done depends on the secret activities and the central investigating agencies. Whatever the ED does, I say with responsibility that the MVA government will stay on.”In politics, “no one is a saint” and no government is natural or unnatural, the Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson said.“A government is natural till it is there. To destabilise it, agencies like the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) are being used. Those doing illegal constructions and accused of abetment to suicide are being protected,” he alleged.“If these political pressure tactics are natural, then the ‘Thackeray sarkar’ is also natural. The government has proved its majority on the floor of the House and is within constitutional norms,” Raut said.He said if there were no COVID-19 outbreak, floods, cyclones and lockdown difficulties, the situation in the state would have been different in the last one year.After the Maharashtra Assembly polls last year, the Shiv Sena snapped ties with long-term ally BJP over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post in the state.Recalling last year’s hectic parleys between the Sena, NCP and Congress to form a non-BJP government in the state, Raut said Sharad Pawar and Kharge had a heated argument over the Assembly Speaker’s post in a meeting at Nehru Centre here. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mva-govt-natural-will-stay-on-sanjay-raut-177558

29-11-2020||New Delhi||DCGI and institutional ethics committee investigating claim of adverse event in COVID vaccine trial: Officials||The Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) and the institutional ethics committee at the implementation site are investigating if the adverse event as claimed to have been suffered by a COVID-19 vaccine trial participant in Chennai are related to the shot administered to him.A 40-year-old Chennai-based business consultant, who was a volunteer for the third phase of the vaccine trial conducted by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), has sought Rs 5 crore compensation for allegedly suffering serious neurological and psychological symptoms after taking the dose.He was administered the shot at Chennai’s Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (SRIHER), one of the trial sites on October 1.A law firm on his behalf has now sent a legal notice to the ICMR Director General; the Drugs Controller General of India; the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation; CEO, Astra Zeneca UK; Professor Andrew Pollard, chief investigator, Oxford Vaccine Trial; and Vice Chancellor of Sri Ramachandra Higher Education and Research.The man has sought a compensation of Rs 5 crore and that the testing, manufacturing and distribution of the vaccine be stopped immediately.Dr Samiran Panda, who heads the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases (ECD) division of the ICMR, said the causal link, if any, of the serious adverse events with the investigational product was objectively assessed in any clinical trial following a pre-defined scientific pathway and within a stipulated period.“Any hurried inquiry or inference is prone to be wrong. Both the institutional ethics committee and the DCGI are investigating the causal links, if any, between the adverse events and investigational product, which is an anti-coronavirus vaccine,” Dr Panda said.The SII has partnered with British-Swedish biopharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca for manufacturing the Oxford vaccine candidate for COVID-19.The DCGI had on September 11 directed Serum Institute of India (SII) to suspend any new recruitment in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of the Oxford COVID-19 vaccine candidate till further orders in the backdrop of pharma giant AstraZeneca pausing the clinical trials in other countries because of “an unexplained illness” in a participant in the study.However, on September 15 it permitted the Serum Institute of India to recommence the trial.The notice given on November 21 by the law firm said: “Our client states that he must be compensated, in the least, for all the sufferings that he and his family have undergone and are likely to undergo in future.”“He further states that he is still far from being all right and has to be under medical care for a long time to come. Therefore, for all the trauma he is undergoing and with an uncertain future in his health, he should be given a financial compensation of Rs 5 crores within two weeks from the receipt of this notice,” it said.The notice also said testing, manufacturing and the distribution of the vaccine should also be stopped immediately, “failing which he has no other option except to take appropriate legal action against all the concerned parties, who would be made responsible for all the costs and consequences”.

It is up to the Centre to step in and help them," the Rajya Sabha member said.Replying to a query, Raut claimed farmers were being dubbed as "divisive" because they come from Punjab."Do you want to create instability by reminding the Punjab farmers of the Khalistan movement period?" he asked the Centre.Thousands of farmers continued their protest for the fourth consecutive day on Sunday, staying put at the Singhu and Tikri border points, with farmer leaders deliberating upon their future course of action about proposed talks with the government.With many roads and entry points of Delhi being blocked, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had appealed to the farmers to shift to the Burari ground, and said the Centre was ready to hold discussions with them as soon as they move to the designated place.

29-11-2020||Vibha Sharma||Has the Centre underestimated Punjab farmers?||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, November 29A couple of weeks ago, two senior ministers of the Narendra Modi government held “off-record” briefings for media persons to highlight the merits of the three Central farm Acts and give the government side of view on the persisting farmers’ agitation in Punjab. In one such meeting, when the ministers were asked about the upcoming ‘Dilli Chalo’ call of farmers, they dismissed the agitation as “politically driven”, adding: “You saw what happened to the ‘chakka jam’…this too will fizzle out.”On how long they expected the agitation to continue, they said “not long”. As farmers on Sunday rejected Home Minister Amit Shah’s offer of “talks with the condition of moving to Burari”, observers say it is evident that the Narendra Modi government not just “underestimated” the agitation but also determination and resolve of Punjab farmers who reached Delhi despite so many hurdles, adding that “it is also evident the Punjab BJP leaders did not give the correct feedback on the state”.“It is a remarkable movement which is not driven by religion or politics. To give it anti-national/Khalistan label is a huge mistake. Farmers have conveyed their message loud and clear…quite clearly the Narendra Modi government has limited understanding of Punjab and its people,” analysts say.They also point to the way Punjab rejected BJP’s two top contenders, late Arun Jaitley and Union Minister Hardeep Puri, in the 2014 and the 2019 Lok Sabha elections despite the Narendra Modi wave sweeping the country, to stress their point.“To judge Punjab as a Hindi heartland state is a mistake. Punjab is not like Uttar Pradesh or even like Haryana. It cannot be polarised with the Hindu-Muslim fear. Punjabis don’t fear Muslims or anyone for that matter. If the aim is to give Hindu-Sikh colour or try to paint is as another Shaheen Bagh, then God help them,” said a Punjab-based expert.With Prime Minister Narendra Modi praising farm laws again today, it appears the government is in no mood to roll back on the three contentious Acts. While speculations are that the government may advance the December 3 meeting to persuade farmers to clear the highways, the question is will farmers agree to “another set of just talks”.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/has-the-centre-underestimated-punjab-farmers-177526
29-11-2020||Lucknow||UP registers first case under anti-conversion law in Bareilly district||Uttar Pradesh has registered its first case under the new anti-conversion law in Bareilly district based on a complaint from the father of a young woman.The case was registered at the Devarniyan police station in Bareilly district on Saturday, officials said.In a statement issued here on Sunday, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi said a case was registered by Tikaram, a resident of Sharif Nagar village under Devarniyan police station (in Bareilly), who accused a man—Uvaish Ahmed—of the same village of trying to convert his daughter through “allurement” (bahla-phuslaakar).The case was registered against Uvaish Ahmed under the IPC and the new anti-conversion law.Senior Superintendent of Police Rohit Singh Sajwan said four police teams have been formed to arrest the accused.According to the complaint, Tikaram’s daughter and Ahmed studied together in Class 12.Three years ago, the accused started exerting pressure on her to undergo religious conversion and perform ‘nikaah’ (marriage). But when the woman opposed, he threatened to kidnap her, Tikaram alleged.Tikaram got his daughter married to someone else in June this year. However, Ahmed continued to harass her family members, the complaint said.Ahmed went to Tikaram’s house on Saturday and asked him to bring his daughter back from her in-laws’ house.Threatening her family, the accused said the woman will have to undergo religious conversion and marry him, according to the complaint.Tikaram approached police and a case was registered against the accused.On Saturday, Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel gave assent to an ordinance against forcible or fraudulent religious conversions that provides for imprisonment up to 10 years and a maximum fine of Rs 50,000 under different categories.The promulgation of the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, came four days after the Yogi Adityanath government approved the draft of the legislation which also curbs religious conversions only for the sake of marriage.Under the law which deals with different categories of offences, a marriage will be declared “null and void” if the conversion of a woman is solely for that purpose, and those wishing to change their religion after marriage need to apply to the district magistrate.The ordinance mainly envisages that no person shall convert, either directly or indirectly from one religion to another by use or practice of misrepresentation, force, undue influence, coercion, allurement or by any fraudulent means or by marriage nor shall any person abet, convince or conspire such conversion.

Their small population have hugely contributed to the beauty- growth and economy of this nation."Taking sides with the late music composer's wife, Kangana posed a question to Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding how our nation is protecting minority communities like the Parsis, which do not seek sympathy by creating tension and which are decreasing in numbers.The actress wrote: "She is my friend's widow a Parsi woman who is being harassed by her family for conversion. I want to ask @PMOIndia minority that don't do sympathy seeking drama, beheadings, riots and conversions, how are we protecting them? Parsis shockingly decreasing numbers.""Reveals India's own character as a mother, child who does most drama unfairly gets most attention and advantages. And the one who is worthy, sensitive most caring and deserving ends up being a nanny to the one who keeps throwing fits.... we need to introspect," the actress further wrote using the hashtag #anticonversionbill.She is my friends widow a parsi woman who is being harassed by her family for conversion. I want to ask @PMOIndia minority that don’t do sympathy seeking drama, beheadings, riots and conversions, how are we protecting them? Parsis shockingly decreasing numbers ( cont.)Music composer Wajid Khan passed away on June 1 this year.Almost six months after his death, his wife Kamalrukh has taken to social media to open up about her bitter experience with her inter-caste marriage and alleged that the "scare tactics" used by Wajid's family to force her into conversion included taking her to the court seeking divorce.Kamalrukh further wrote that, even after Wajid's untimely death, the "harassment from his family continues"."I stand fighting for the rights and inheritance of my children which have been usurped by them. All this because of their hatred against me for not converting to Islam. Such a deep rooted hatred that even the death of a loved one could not move. I truly wish this anti-conversion law is nationalised, reducing the struggle for women like me who are fighting the toxicity of religion in inter caste marriages," Kamalrukh wrote in her unverified Instagram account post.

29-11-2020||Mumbai||We are providing sipper, straw to Stan Swamy: Jail authorities||Tribal rights activist Father Stan Swamy, an accused in the alleged Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case, is being provided sipper and other facilities in the Taloja prison from the day second of his arrest, a senior prison official said on Sunday.Swamy, 83, who is suffering from various health issues including Parkinson's disease, was arrested on October 8 and has been lodged at the Taloja prison near here in Navi Mumbai.Talking to PTI, a senior prison official said the allegation that prison authorities were not providing sipper and straw to Swamy were "baseless"."Not just sipper and straw, we are providing him other facilities too like wheelchair, walking stick, walker, and two attendants were also provided to him," the official said."We know he is a patient, he suffers from Parkinsons disease. Why would we not provide him things which he requires," the official said.Meanwhile, some Delhi-based lawyers have also sent straws and sippers for the activist in a parcel along with a letter to the Taloja prison on Saturday."As lawyers, we were pained by the situation as all jail manuals provide for special facilities for inmates who have special needs," said Nandita Rao, one of the advocates who have signed the letter sent to the jail.  "We felt if someone does not even have a right to dignified drinking water in judicial custody, then the basic values of our Constitution and humanity are being disrespected," she added.Swamy had earlier filed a plea in a special NIA court here, seeking that he be provided straw and a sipper.The court on Thursday rejected his previous application seeking a direction to the National Investigation Agency to return the straw and sipper allegedly seized from him during the arrest.Swamy had said he needs a straw and sipper as he has trouble eating and drinking because his hands shake due to the Parkinson's disease.On Thursday, the National Investigation Agency, which is probing the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links' case, denied that it had confiscated Swamy's straw and a sipper.Swamy's lawyer Sharif Shaikh then filed a fresh application to obtain these things, besides winter clothing.The activist on Thursday also filed a bail plea in the special NIA court.As per the NIA, Swamy was involved in the activities of the banned CPI (Maoist) and had received funds through an associate for furthering Maoist agenda.He was also the convener of the Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee (PPSC), a frontal organisation of the CPI(Maoist), the NIA claimed.Swamy in his bail plea denied the allegations and said that the prosecution had failed to bring on record any evidence.

29-11-2020||New Delhi||New farm laws have begun mitigating farmers' problems in short span of time: PM||Amid protests by a section of farmers against the recently enacted farm laws, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted on Sunday that these reforms have opened doors of new opportunities for peasants and bestowed on them new rights.In his monthly ‘Mann ki Baat’ broadcast, Modi said the farm laws have begun mitigating the troubles of farmers in a short period of time since their enactment in September as he cited the example of a Maharashtra farmer who used their provisions to get the money a trader had promised but not paid to him in time.New dimensions related to agriculture and related fields have emerged as the recently enacted farm reforms have opened doors of new possibilities for farmers, he said.“The demands, which were made by farmers for years and regarding which every political party at some point of time had made promises, have been fulfilled... These reforms have not only freed them of various shackles but also given them new rights and new opportunities. These rights have begun mitigating farmers’ problems in a very short span of time,” he said.The prime minister’s remarks come at a time when thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, have dug in their heels at Delhi’s border points and hundreds have gathered at the city’s Burari ground to protest against the new farm laws.The central government has reached out to them, underscoring its willingness to hold talks with them. It has also asserted that concerns expressed by some farm bodies about the new laws are misplaced, asserting that existing support measures like the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and state-run ‘mandis’ will remain in place.In his address, Modi said “correct information, away from rumours and confusion of any kind” is a big strength for people in any field, as he spoke about a couple of farmers involved with innovative practices in the field.He touched upon various other topics in his nearly 30-minute address, ranging from the idol of goddess Annapurna, stolen in 1913 from Varanasi, being brought back to India from Canada, to urging educational institutions to harness the strengths and talents of their alumni by engaging with them with innovative methods and active platforms.“Just like the idol of Mata Annapurna, a lot of our invaluable heritage has suffered at the hands of international gangs. These gangs sell them at a very high price in the international market. Now not only are they being subjected to heavy restrictions; India has also increased efforts for their return,” he said.India has been successful in bringing back lots of such idols and artifacts in the past few years because of such efforts, he added.Remembering Guru Nanak Dev, whose birth anniversary is on Monday, Modi lauded his noble ideals and added that he considered himself to be fortunate for his involvement in various works related to Sikh gurus and gurudwaras.He also hailed the opening of the Kartarpur Sahib corridor in November last year as historic.In his remarks, Modi also talked about a gurudwara in Kutch, which is considered very sacred and special.Noting that it is now almost a year since the first COVID-19 case was reported in the world, he said showing any negligence regarding the pandemic remains very serious, and people should continue to fight the disease strongly.Referring to the death anniversary of B R Ambedkar on December 6, he said it is an occasion to reaffirm commitment to the country and abide by duties as envisaged by the Constitution.In the broadcast, Modi remembered the work of noted ornithologist and naturalist Dr Salim Ali, and said he has always had admiration for bird-watchers.“There are many clubs and societies that are passionate about bird watching. I hope you all discover more about them,” Modi said.He also noted that the culture of India is gaining popularity all over the world.“One such effort is by Jonas Masetti, who is based in Brazil and popularises Vedanta as well as the Gita among people there. He uses technology effectively to popularise our culture and ethos,” Modi said.The prime minister also lauded Gaurav Sharma, the MP for Hamilton West, New Zealand, for taking his oath of office in Sanskrit.Noting that the death anniversary of Sri Aurobindo falls on December 5, he said his philosophy of swadeshi shows us the way ahead and asked people to study his ideals.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/new-farm-laws-have-begun-mitigating-farmers-problems-in-short-span-of-time-pm-177513
29-11-2020||New Delhi||Protesting farmers not 'properly understood' new farm laws: Niti Aayog member||Niti Aayog Member (Agriculture) Ramesh Chand has said protesting farmers have not fully or properly understood the new farm laws, asserting that these legislations have potential to increase farm income in a big way.He further said that the motive of the three new farm laws is exactly the opposite of what the protesting farmers have understood.In an interview to PTI, Chand said, "The way, I am reading these farmers, who are protesting, it looks like that they have not fully or properly understood these three laws.""If these new farm laws are allowed to be implemented, there are very high chances of big increase in income of the farmers and in many states, it may even double," he said while replying to a question on whether the government is still confident of doubling farm income by 2022.The Narendra Modi-led NDA government has set a target of doubling farmers' income by 2022.On September 27, President Ram Nath Kovind gave assent to the three farm bills—The Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020; The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020.Elaborating further on farmer contentions, the Niti Aayog member said protesting farmers are saying that the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) has been removed and full freedom has been given to stockists, black marketers, etc."If you look at what actually has been done is, there is a modification done in the Essential Commodity Act. According to that modification, a criterion has been laid when Essential Commodities Act can be imposed, and that is if there is a 50 per cent increase in prices of cereals, oil seeds and pulses, then it can be imposed," Chand explained."Or if there is 100 per cent increase of price of onion and potato then Essential Commodities Act can be imposed," he added.Citing an example, the Niti Aayog member said that on October 23, the Centre had invoked the Act when onion prices were rising.It was required, he said adding “states were told to put stock limit".Similarly, allaying fears of protesting farmers about contract farming, he pointed out that there is a big difference between corporate farming and contract farming."Corporate farming is not allowed in any states in India... and contract farming is already happening in many states and not even a single incidence has come where land of farmers has been taken over by private companies,” Chand said.The Niti Aayog member asserted that the new Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Act has been tilted in favour of farmers.To a question on farm sector growth, Chand said," In this fiscal year (2020-21), I expect the growth of agriculture to be slightly more than 3.5 per cent." Agriculture and allied sector's growth stood at 3.7 per cent during the 2019-20 fiscal year.On frequent ban on exports of onion, he said whenever prices go beyond a band, the government intervenes and it happens everywhere in India, the US and the UK.Noting that prices are always maintained within a band, Chand said in some situation, the government protects interests of farmers by stopping imports, and sometimes, it protects interests of consumers by banning exports."We can't allow onion prices to go to Rs 100 that too when farmers are not selling onions. 60-70 per cent of onions reach market in the month of April and May and it does not reach market at this time," he said.Chand argued it is not that by imposing ban on exports the government is doing something terribly wrong against the producers."It is done only in a particular situation, never in normal situation," he explained.Thousands of farmers, mainly from Punjab and Haryana, have been protesting against the three new laws. They say the intention of these laws is to dismantle the minimum support price system.

29-11-2020||Chandigarh/New Delhi||Farmer unions reject Amit Shah’s Burari protest site offer; decide to stay put at Delhi borders||Farmers protesting against the Centre's three farm laws on Sunday decided not to shift to the Burari ground in the National Capital and stay put at the Delhi borders.Thousands of farmers continued to protest at the Singhu and Tikri borders on the fourth consecutive day on Sunday.Union Home Minister Amit Shah had on Saturday appealed to the farmers to shift to the Sant Nirankari ground in Burari that was offered to them for peaceful protests and said the Centre was ready to hold discussions with them as soon as they move to the designated place.“We have decided that we will stay put at the Delhi borders. We will not go to Burari,” Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda) president Buta Singh Burjgill said over the phone.The decision was taken by representatives of several farmer organisations, he said.Farmer leader Harmeet Singh Kadian, who is the president of BKU (Kadian), too said that the protesters will not shift to the Burari ground.Reacting to the Union home minister's appeal, Kadian told reporters near the Singhu border that the Centre should not impose any condition for holding talks with the farmers.“We do not want any pre-condition. We want a meeting be held without any condition. We are ready for talks,” Kadian said.Farmer leaders later said that they would continue to block roads and close off five highways as part of their protest. They also said no political party would be allowed to share stage with them.“Had the same government that is telling us to vacate the roads received us with a big heart, farmers would not have become aggressive,” some union leaders said on Sunday evening.Thousands of farmers meanwhile continued to hold protests at the Singhu border on National Highway 44 for the third straight day on Sunday.Several continued to pour into the swelling crowds, and still more were expected to join them with tractor trolleys, a leader, Darshan Pal, said.Pal, a member of the All India Kissan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) and president of Krantikari Kissan Union, said protesters had unanimously decided to stay on at at singhu as well as Tikri, both areas that border Delhi.“Some farmers of Uttarakhand who reached at Burari ground in Delhi also reached here while UP farmers have also reached at border and stages dharna there,” he said.The All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, Rashtriya Kisan Mahasangh and various factions of Bharatiya Kisan Union had given the call for the 'Delhi Chalo' march.Farmers protesting against the Centre's three farm laws have expressed apprehension that these will pave a way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the "mercy" of big corporates.The Centre has invited several Punjab farmer organisations for another round of talks in Delhi on December 3.  Never called it political, says Amit ShahOn the defence in the face of escalating criticism his government faces, Home Minister Amit Shah claimed he never called the protests political. “I never called farmers’ agitation political, nor do I want to say that ever. I never gave any such statement that it is a political agitation,” Shah said at a press conference in Hyderabad.He also defended the three laws saying they were meant for the welfare of farmers.“After a long time the farmer is going to come out of a locked system,” he said in Hyderabad. Several BJP leaders, including Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, have called the farmers’ agitation either “political or driven by the Congress”. 'Move to Burari ground'Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said in a letter sent to 32 farmers organisations on Saturday that a high-level team of Union Ministers is ready to hold talks with them at the capital's Vigyan Bhavan once they move to the designated place.The latter was sent on Saturday, the same day Union Home Minister Amit Shah promised to talk to them as soon as they shift to the ground.In his letter in Hindi, Bhalla cited the cold conditions and the COVID-19 outbreak and said the farmers should move to the Burarai ground where adequate facilities have been made for them. He said that the farmers' organisations have called for the 'Delhi chalo' programme on November 26 and 27 following which a large number of farmers from Punjab and other parts of the country have reached the borders of Delhi.He said the farmers have gathered along two major highways connecting Punjab and as a result, normal life and travel of common people have been affected.Bhalla said the farmers are also inconvenienced due to the cold, and because of the Coronavirus outbreak, there is a possibility of the spread of the virus as there is a large congregation of people.The home secretary said keeping in mind all these issues, the central government has made arrangements for a big ground at Burari so that proper facilities could be made for the farmers. “I request you to take all the farmers from the borders of Delhi to the ground at Burari where facilities have been created for them and they can hold their demonstration peacefully and police will permit it," he saidBhalla said a delegation of the farmers has been invited on December 3 by the central government for detailed discussions on their problems. “Some farmers and farmers unions have demanded that the meeting should take place earlier than December 3."As soon as you shift to the ground at Burari, the very next day a high-level committee of union ministers will hold talks at Vigyan Bhavan with the representatives of all farmers unions, with whom dialogue had taken place earlier,” he said in the letter.Bhalla also said detailed discussions were held in New Delhi on November 13 regarding farmers' problems, which was attended by Union Ministers for Agriculture and Railways.--- With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/farmer-unions-reject-amit-shahs-burari-protest-site-offer-decide-to-stay-put-at-delhi-borders-177501

29-11-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air quality remains ‘poor’, likely to deteriorate further||Delhi’s air quality remained “poor” on Sunday and is likely to deteriorate further amid a dip in the mercury and the wind speed.The city’s air quality index (AQI) was 245 at 9 am.The 24-hour average was 231 on Saturday, 137 on Friday, 302 on Thursday and 413 on Wednesday.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.The maximum wind speed was 15 kmph on Saturday. It is likely to be 8 to 12 kmph on Sunday and Monday, according to the India Meteorological Department.                    Winds are predicted to slow down on Sunday. Therefore, Delhi’s air quality is likely to deteriorate further and remain in the “poor” to “very poor” category over the next two days, it said.The minimum temperature was 7 degrees Celsius on Sunday and the maximum is predicted to settle around 26 degrees Celsius, the weather department said.Calm winds and low temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, while favourable wind speed helps in their dispersion.The share of stubble burning in Delhi’s pollution has also reduced significantly as the harvesting season has ended.The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring states to Delhi’s PM2.5 levels was 4 percent on Saturday, 2 per cent on Friday and just 1 per cent on Thursday, according to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor, SAFAR. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhis-air-quality-remains-poor-likely-to-deteriorate-further-177496
29-11-2020||Bhopal||MP loses 26 tigers in 2020; govt says birth rate more than deaths||Madhya Pradesh, which is known as the 'tiger state' of India, has lost 26 striped animals so far this year, as per the National Tiger Conservation Authority.Reacting to it, Madhya Pradesh Forest Minister Vijay Shah told PTI that the average death rate of tigers was less compared to their birth rate in the state in the last six years.According to the National Tiger Conservation Authority's (NTCA) website, out of the 26 tiger deaths reported since April this year, MP lost 21 felines inside the tiger reserves, including 10 in the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve.No tiger death was reported in the first three months of this year, as per the data.In 2019, the state lost 28 tigers while three cases of seizures of body parts due to poaching were also reported.Karnataka, which is on the second position in the number of tigers in the country, registered eight deaths and two seizures of tiger body parts this year, as per the data.The southern state lost 12 big cats last year."Right now, MP has 124 tiger cubs. The cubs were not counted during the last census (in 2018). In the next count, we are going to have more than 600 tigers," Shah said."We have more tigers than the area for them. Take the example of Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve-it has 125 tigers whereas it has the territory to house only 90," he said.The minister attributed the big number of tiger deaths in Bandhavgarh to the territorial fight among the big cats for space and dominance.Earlier, MP had lost the 'tiger state' tag to Karnataka in the all India tiger estimation exercise for 2010, primarily due to alleged poaching in the Panna Tiger Reserve.That time, MP had 257 tigers compared to 300 in Karnataka.In the 2014 tiger census, MP slipped to no.3 position in the country with 308 striped animals after Uttarakhand (340) and Karnataka (408).However, MP regained the tag in the 2018 census with 526 big cats, two more than in Karnataka.Wildlife activist Ajay Dubey said Madhya Pradesh lacks a special tiger protection force."We have filed a petition in the high court for the formation of the special force which is pending. Karnataka has such a special force, thus tigers there are protected," he said.The Centre in 2006 asked states to form the special force and offered to bear its expenditure, but MP has not formed it, he noted.Karnataka has five tiger reserves and the number of striped animals there (as per the last count) was just two less than Madhya Pradesh, which has around six tiger reserves."MP should learn from this," he said.A tiger was allegedly killed and buried in Shahdol district earlier this month, he said, noting that some people have been arrested in the case.The recovery of a severed tiger head in the Panna Tiger Reserve last month suggests that poachers are operating in the wildlife areas, he said.

For India, Tokyo Olympics-bound Avinash Sable smashed the national record with a time of 1:00:30.The 26-year-old Sable, from Maharashtra, was 10th overall.According to the Athletics Federation of India’s official records, the earlier national half marathon record stands at 1:03:46 in the name of Kalidas Hirave of Maharashtra.This year’s race course was radically different from the last two years due to health protocols and the elite athletes ran under unprecedented circumstances due to the pandemic with the organisers providing them with a bio-secure zone.In the men’s elite race, last year’s silver medallist Walelegn beat compatriot and defending champion Andamlak Belihu in a nail-biting finish for the gold in a course record time of 58.53 seconds. Walelegn had won a bronze at the World Half Marathon Championships last month.Belihu, who had won the title in 2018 and 2019, settled for the silver medal with a time of 58.54sec in the 21.09km distance. Uganda’s Stephen Kissa was third among the elite runners with a timing of 58.56 seconds.The 21-year-old Walelegn bettered the earlier course record of 59:06, which was in the name of compatriot Guye Adola, set in 2014.India’s Avinash Sable, who qualified for the Tokyo Olympics in 3000m steeplechase, emerged winner among Indian elite runners, clocking 1:00.30. This was the first time an Indian ran below 61 minutes in the ADHM.Srinu Bugatha, who won the race last year, was second this time among the Indians with a time of 1:04:16 while Durga Bahadur Budha was third after clocking 1:04:19.In the star-studded women’s elite race, Yehualaw surged ahead after the halfway mark to win in course record time of 1:04:46, bettering the earlier mark of 1:06:00 in the name of compatriot and defending champion Tsehay Gemechu, who could not finish on podium this time.Kenya’s Ruth Chepngetich was second in 1:05:06 while another Ethiopian and world half marathon record-holder Ababel Yeshaneh was third in 1:05:21.Like her male counterpart Walelegn, the in-form Yehualaw had finished second in last year’s ADHM and third in the World Half Marathon last month.Yeshaneh was the leader of the pack at the 5km mark but was behind eventual winner Yehualaw by the 10km distance.Defending champion Gemechu fell off the leading pack by then. Kenya’s world marathon record holder Brigid Kosgei pulled out before the halfway mark.Among Indians, Parul Chaudhary, who had finished second last year, took the gold in 1:12:18 while Sanjivani Jadhav (1:13:00) and Komal Jagadale (1:14:04) were second and third respectively.To comply with COVID-19 pandemic protocols, the runners covered around 4.5km, starting at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, and then ran on two loops of approximately 6km, before returning to the finish line outside the stadium by the same route.The ADHM is one of the first global sporting events to be hosted in India during the pandemic and had Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju and Olympic gold-winner shooter Abhinav Bindra in attendance.

29-11-2020||Washington||Continuing Chinese construction activities along Indian border ‘provocative measure’: US lawmaker||An influential US lawmaker has expressed concern over reports of China’s continuing construction activities along the Indian border in Ladakh, saying if the reports are true, it is a “provocative measure” on the part of Beijing and fits the pattern of its conduct in the South China Sea.India and China have been locked in a military standoff, which began in May, along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.Armies of both countries have deployed a large number of troops along the LAC. Multiple rounds of talks between the two sides to resolve the standoff have not yielded any concrete outcome.“If it (reports) turns out to be true, it would be yet another provocative measure by the Chinese military to change the facts on the ground,” Democratic Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi told PTI.“It would also fit the pattern of their conduct in the South China Sea, where they build islands, where they try to change the facts as we previously understood them, and they would be deeply disturbing, to say the least,” said Krishnamoorthi, who is the first-ever Indian-American to be on the US House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.China claims almost all of the 1.3 million square mile South China Sea as its sovereign territory. It has been building military bases on artificial islands in the region also claimed by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.Beijing has also impeded commercial activity like fishing or mineral exploration by countries like Vietnam and the Philippines in the resource-rich region, claiming that the ownership of the territory belonged to China for hundreds of years.Krishnamoorthi, who was recently re-elected to the House of Representatives for the third consecutive time, said the US stands with India.The Congressman from Illinois said reports including satellite images are his source of information about Chinese construction activities.“I have to say that we currently in the US Congress, but also the Trump and the incoming Biden administration stand by our Indian partners and the Indo-Pacific region,” he said.The recently concluded Malabar exercise of QUAD countries—India, Japan, Australia and the United States—is a signal that the democracies in the Indo-Pacific region will continue to stand with each other and push for a rules-based international order, the Congressman said.Responding to a question, Krishnamoorthi said US President-elect Joe Biden has been a longtime friend of India, and he along with Indian-origin vice president-elect Kamala Harris will stand with New Delhi.“I think his selection Kamala Harris only cements a relationship given her own Indian roots. Secretary of State-nominee Anthony Blinken is also a longtime friend of India. He knows the region extremely well. I trust that incoming Secretary Blinken is going to take the relationship to new heights, along with President Biden and vice president Harris,” he said.“They are going to continue the approach that has largely been taken by Democratic and Republican presidents, which is we stand with India in the region, and opposing any kind of militaristic action on the part of any neighbour, including China,” he added.Krishnamoorthi also said addressing COVID-19 needs to be the number one priority for India and the US.“A global health partnership that involves India, the United States, and all of our partners and allies around the world, and others, is crucial for defeating the pandemic,” he said.“I’m confident it’s going to happen, especially with Joe Biden as one of the world’s premier preeminent leaders pushing this change.“I also am glad that he and his administration will once again engage with the WHO and the World Health Organisation will play an important part in distributing vaccines and the logistics of killing this virus. That’s the number one priority for both of our countries. I really look forward to the partnership that emerges on that front,” he said.The US has the highest number of coronavirus infections in the world, followed by India.The US’ death toll is now more than 264,000. And nearly another 60,000 people could lose their lives over the next three weeks, according to an ensemble forecast published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this week.India’s COVID-19 tally stood at 93,51,109 on Saturday. A total of 1,36,200 people has succumbed to the contagious respiratory disease in the country.

The sacrifice won’t go waste. We would carry forward the mission with more vigour and synergy and not let adversaries succeed in their dastardly acts,” he said on his Twitter handle.Bhalerao, a resident of Nashik in Maharashtra, was a decorated commando and had been adjudged the best in various combat competitions, a senior officer of the force said.He joined the CRPF in 2010 and had come to CoBRA last year.    He is survived by his mother, wife and a six-year-old daughter, they said.His mortal remains will be taken by an aircraft that is expected to land in Nashik this evening, a CRPF spokesperson said.The CoBRA was raised by the CRPF in 2009 as a special guerrilla combat commando unit for undertaking anti-Naxal operations as well as combating insurgents in the northeast.

High Courts should also take into account if there existed a reasonable apprehension of the accused tampering with the witnesses or being a threat to the complainant or the witnesses and he possibility of securing the presence of the accused at the trial or the likelihood of the accused fleeing from justice, the antecedents of and circumstances peculiar to the accused, it said. However, the top court said, “The High Court must exercise its power with caution and circumspection, cognisant of the fact that this jurisdiction is not a ready substitute for recourse to the remedy of bail under Section 439 of the CrPC.” It criticised the Bombay High Court for abdicating its role, functions and jurisdiction while denying bail to the TV news anchor.

Rejecting the offer to shift the protest to the Nirankari Ground at Burari, some demanded to be heard either at the Jantar Mantar or the Ramlila Ground.Joginder Singh Ugrahan of BKU Ekta Ugrahan claimed that Home Minister Amit Shah called him to go to Burari, but they decided against it.Meanwhile, leaders from other states and organisations countered the “general belief” that the “protest is mainly Punjab-centric”. The government had extended invitation for December 3 talks only to Punjab farmer unions, pretending and arguing that other farmers are happy with their reform.“It is clear by now from the fact that farmers from Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh are attempting to go to Delhi that the resistance is pan-India. Agitations are underway in Odisha, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand,” said AIKSCC’s Samyukt Kisan Movement.Either the government should give an assurance that it will take back the farm laws or promise to enact the fourth one on MSP, appears to be the common consensus among various groups.Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar again appealed to farmers to stop the agitation and come for talks on December 3. “There is nothing that cannot be resolved through talks,” Tomar said, asking the Congress to “stop politicising the protest and misleading” the farmers.Facing criticism over their handling of the situation, the Centre is also under attack for “underestimating the determination and resolve of Punjab farmers reached Delhi who despite so many hurdles”.“It is not just the movement of Punjab farmers. The entire nation is watching. The ball is in the Centre’s court now.

It now remains to be seen if the LJP, which continues to be a part of the NDA at the Centre, is given any assignment in the Narendra Modi Cabinet. After the exit of the Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal, Ramdas Athawale of the Republican Party of India (Athawale) is the only NDA ally in the Central council of ministers.The seat had fallen vacant following the death of LJP patriarch Ram Vilas Paswan, who was a Cabinet minister in the Modi government. With the LJP out of Bihar NDA after its decision to contest separately, the BJP’s decision to reclaim the seat has put a question mark on the future of Chirag Paswan.Ram Vilas Paswan was elected to the Upper House by the NDA under the ‘seat-sharing formula’ finalised during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls by three parties.LJP wanted it for Paswan’s widow||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/jdu-had-role-in-rs-seat-denial-to-ljp-177351
