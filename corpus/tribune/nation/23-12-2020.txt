The proposed mosque in Ayodhya violates this Act. It violates the Shariat law as the Waqf Act is based on the Shariat,” said Jilani, who was also the convener of the Babri Masjid Action Committee.Countering Jilani’s allegation that the land for the upcoming mosque in Dhannipur village was given to Muslims in exchange of the Ram Janmabhoomi site in Ayodhya, Sunni Central Waqf Board (SCWB) chairman Zufar Farooqi told PTI that it is not a bartered piece of land.He pointed out that the land in Dhannipur village was allotted to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board in pursuance of the Supreme Court order and to take its possession the Waqf Board had to pay stamp duty.“The Waqf Board has paid a stamp duty of Rs 9,29,400 to take possession of this land,” he said.He also said “the land is the property of the Waqf Board but it itself is not a Waqf”.Elaborating the concepts of Waqf and Waqf Board, the SCBA chairman said Waqf comprises a property denoted in name of Allah by a believer in Islam working for charitable purposes.Thus only a believer of Islam can create Waqf, he said, adding Waqf Board is not an individual and it cannot create any Waqf on its own.“The Supreme Court has not accepted Babri Masjid as Waqf, if it had accepted the land as Waqf, we would have won the case but the court clearly said the donation is not valid,” Farooqi said.He added that 5 acres of land given to the Waqf Board is not in the lieu of the Babri Masjid land but as a “restitution” or relief by the apex court.“There is no shifting of the then Babri Masjid as the Babri Masjid premises was given to Hindu party by the Supreme Court order last year. The Dhannipur land was given in ownership to Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board by same apex court order and it is not a Waqf land,” he explained.Farooqi is also the chairman of the Indo-Islamic Cultural Foundation (IICF) which had unveiled in its Lucknow office on Saturday the blueprint of the mosque and a hospital to be built on a 5-acre plot of land in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur village.Athar Hussain, the secretary of a trust formed to build the mosque in Ayodhya, however, refuted Jillani’s allegations, asserting that everyone interprets the Shariat in his own way.When the land has been allotted under the directive of the Supreme Court, it cannot be illegal, he said.“The power for interpretation of Shariya does not lie in the hands of some limited people. The mosque is the place for offering namaz. So what is wrong if we are building a mosque?” asked Hussain.Countering Jilani’s allegations, Hussain also accused him of spreading misinformation.“Jilani Sahab is such a competent lawyer. If we are violating any Act like the Central Waqf Act, why does he not challenge it in a court of law and get our supposedly illegal acts stopped?” he asked.“If he is not doing so, he is simply spreading misinformation and doing what is against the Shariat and teachings of Quran,” he asserted.Another executive member of AIMPLB SQR Ilyas too earlier termed the upcoming mosque as only of symbolic value, while accusing the Sunni Central Waqf Board of working under the government pressure.“We have rejected the proposal to accept the land for the mosque at any other place. We lost the title suit and so we don’t need land for a mosque,” he said.“The Muslims have rejected this land at Dhannipur given in compensation. The mosque being built by the trust constituted by the Sunni Central Waqf Board is just a symbolic one,” he said.The issue was first raised by MP Asaduddin Owaisi at a meeting of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board’s executive committee held on October 13.All the members were of the view that the exchange of land for the mosque was not permissible under the Waqf Act and in turn “illegal” under the Shariat law.The Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid disputed structure was demolished in December 1992 by “kar sevaks” who claimed that the mosque in Ayodhya was built by demolishing an ancient Ram temple.After a protracted legal tussle, the Supreme Court, on November 9 last year, ruled in favour of the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya and directed the Centre to allot an alternative five-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a new mosque at a “prominent” place in the holy town in Uttar Pradesh.On the directive of the apex court, the Uttar Pradesh government allotted the five-acre plot in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur for the construction of the mosque.

23-12-2020||New Delhi||Delhi’s air ‘severe’ for 2nd day; hot mix plants, stone crushers to remain shut till January 2||Delhi’s air quality remained “severe” for the second day on the trot on Wednesday amid slow wind speed and lowering temperature, prompting the CPCB to order closure of hot mix plants and stone crushers till January 2.No major improvement is predicted till December 26, said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the India Meteorological Department’s regional forecasting centre.           The city’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) was 433. It was 418 on Tuesday, 332 on Monday, 321 on Sunday and 290 on Saturday.Air pollution in the neighbouring cities of Faridabad (428), Ghaziabad (472), Greater Noida (476) and Noida (462) also remained in the “severe” zone.An AQI between zero and 50 is considered “good”, 51 and 100 “satisfactory”, 101 and 200 “moderate”, 201 and 300 “poor”, 301 and 400 “very poor”, and 401 and 500 “severe”.Srivastava attributed the dip in the air quality to slow wind speed, low temperature, and high humidity due to a Western Disturbance.Low temperature makes the air heavier, trapping pollutants close to the ground, he said.On Wednesday, the minimum temperature was 4 degrees Celsius and the maximum wind speed 8 kmph.With the air quality persisting in the “severe” zone, the CPCB directed that hot mix plants and stone crushers will remain closed “all the time” till January 2.It also directed agencies concerned to increase the frequency of mechanised cleaning of roads and water sprinkling to control dust pollution.Agencies must ensure strict compliance of court orders banning sale and use of firecrackers and strict action must be taken against violators of dust pollution control norms, it said.The central government’s Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi said the city’s ventilation index---a product of mixing depth and average wind speed---was 2,500 m2/s on Wednesday and is likely to be 3,000 m2/s on Thursday.Mixing depth is the vertical height in which pollutants are suspended in the air. It reduces on cold days with calm wind speed.A ventilation index lower than 6,000 sqm/second, with the average wind speed less than 10 kmph, is unfavourable for dispersal of pollutants. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhis-air-severe-for-2nd-day-hot-mix-plants-stone-crushers-to-remain-shut-till-january-2-188460
23-12-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai court dismisses Kangana plea against demolition notice||A civil court has dismissed a plea filed by actor Kangana Ranaut against Mumbai civic body’s 2018 notice for demolition of “unauthorised constructions” at her residential apartment in suburban Khar, according to an order made available on Wednesday.Judge L S Chavan on Tuesday dismissed the “notice of motion” filed by the actor.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had in 2018 issued a notice to the actor for demolishing “unauthorised constructions” at her residential apartment in Khar.Ranaut had challenged the demolition notice in the Dindoshi civil court in January 2019.She had also requested the court to restrain the civic body from carrying out demolition at her apartment.The court had then ordered status quo till the hearing of Ranaut’s petition.Judge Chavan, after hearing both the sides, dismissed the notice of motion filed by the actor, but gave her six weeks’ time to approach the Bombay High Court against the verdict.On September 9, the BMC had demolished parts of Ranaut’s bungalow in the Pali Hill area of suburban Bandra calling them “unauthorised”.Last month, the high court, in its order on Ranaut’s petition challenging the BMC’s action, had said it was a “mala fide act” done to cause substantial loss to the actress.

23-12-2020||New Delhi||Farm laws: Petitioner seeks to implead over 40 protesting farmer unions as party in SC||One of the petitioners, who has approached the Supreme Court for direction to the authorities to remove farmers protesting at several border points of Delhi against three new farm laws, has sought to implead over 40 farmer unions as party in the pending case.A Bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde, which had on December 17 said that farmers' agitation should be allowed to continue “without impediment” and the apex court would not interfere with it as the right to protest was a fundamental right, had given liberty to the petitioner to serve the impleaded farmer unions.Law student Rishabh Sharma, one of the petitioners in the case, has now filed an amended memo of parties in the top court in which he has impleaded over 40 farmer unions, including Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), as respondents in the matter.Some other farmers’ unions which are sought to be impleaded as respondents by the petitioner are – BKU-Sidhupur, BKU-Rajewal, BKU-Lakhowal, BKU-Dakaunda, BKU-Doaba, Jamhoori Kisan Sabha and Kul Hind Kisan Federation.The top court had on December 16 permitted impleading of these eight unions as respondents in the matter.Sharma, in his petition filed through advocate Om Prakash Parihar, has sought a direction to the authorities to remove the protesting farmers from several border points in the national capital saying commuters are facing hardships due to the road blockades and the gatherings might lead to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases.He has also sought directions to authorities to open the roads at Delhi's borders, shift the protesters to the allotted place and provide guidelines on social distancing and use of masks at the protest site in order to curb the spread of COVID-19.While acknowledging the right to non-violent protest of farmers, the apex court had last week observed that farmers' right to protest should not infringe the fundamental rights of others to move freely and in getting essential food and other supplies as right to protest cannot mean blockade of the entire city.“We clarify that this court will not interfere with the protest in question. Indeed the right to protest is part of a fundamental right and can as a matter of fact, be exercised subject to public order,” the court had said on December 17 while hearing a batch of pleas on the issue.The top court had told Bharatiya Kisan Union (Bhanu) group, which was the only farmer organisation represented before the court on December 17, that they cannot keep on protesting without talking to the government.

The results are still to be peer reviewed though.“In phase 1 trial, the vaccine (BBV152) produced high levels of neutralising antibodies that remained elevated in all participants three months after the second vaccination. In the phase 2 trial, BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced cell-mediated immune responses,” the latest data show.(Click here for the latest developments on Covid-19 epidemic)The researchers are going with the 6 µg formulation for phase 3 efficacy trial after trying the 3 ug formulation in the first two stages.The phase 2 trial of COVAXIN was a double-blind, randomised, multi-centre, clinical trial involving 380 healthy children and adults who received two vaccine formulations -- 3 µg and 6 µg. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered four weeks apart.“In a follow-up of the phase 1 trial, the vaccine candidate produced high levels of neutralising antibodies that remained elevated in all participants three months at day 104 after the second vaccination. Based on these results, we hypothesise that the vaccine can generate antibodies that may persist for 6-12 months,” the research shows.Bharat Biotech is among the three companies, including Pfizer and Serum Institute, to have sought emergency use approval in India. The drug regulator has asked it for additional data from phase 3 trials.Serum Institute has now submitted additional data the regulator had sought last week.No mutant strain in India yet: CentreThe Centre today dismissed reports of some UK returned travellers showing the mutant COVID 19 strain reported by the UK, and said genome sequencing of samples collected from COVID positive travellers was still underway at government accredited labs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/covaxin-produces-immunity-no-serious-side-effects-in-phase-2-trials-188430

By joining this Facebook account, Khan came in contact with Singh and Nijjar, the NIA officials said.Nijjar motivated Khan by discussing about atrocities committed against the Muslims and Sikhs in India and convinced him to work for separate ‘Khalistan State’, the officials said, adding that in furtherance of conspiracy, Nijjar directed Khan to purchase a pistol and ammunition in 2018 and to carry out their nefarious designs.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/nia-arrests-absconding-khalistani-terrorist-gurjeet-singh-nijjar-188423
23-12-2020||New Delhi||Ready for talks, but govt should send concrete proposal: Farmer unions||Asserting that the ball is in the Centre’s court, protesting farmer unions on Wednesday asked it to come up with a new concrete proposal for resumption of talks, even as Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar underscored that dialogue was the only way to reach a resolution and the government was committed to reforms in the farm sector.As the stalemate between the government and the protesters, who are demanding a repeal of the three new agri laws, continued without any signs of a breakthrough, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to interact on Friday with farmers from six states during which they will share their experience on various initiatives taken by the Centre, in yet another outreach attempt.The farmer leaders, who have rejected a proposal for amending the agri laws, said that they are waiting for the Centre to come to the table with an open mind, adding “if the government takes one step, farmers will take two”.It was ‘Kisan Diwas’ (National Farmers’ Day), the birth anniversary of former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh, on Wednesday and opposition parties like the Congress, TMC, Shiv Sena, and the Left used the occasion to target the government, alleging that it was only interested in benefiting the corporates while the farmers were forced to stage protests on streets.The BJP hit back, alleging that the farmers were being misled and provoked by the opposition parties which had exploited them when in power.The government reiterated its commitment to the welfare of farmers and expressed the hope that the unions will withdraw their agitation.From a ‘yagna’ in Sambhal, Uttar Pradesh to pray for the government’s “change of heart” on the agri laws to a letter purportedly written in blood by Bharatiya Kisan Union (Lok Shakti) chief Sheoraj Singh to Prime Minister Modi, various organisations and activists continued to express solidarity with the farmers who have been camping on Delhi’s borders since November 26 demanding a repeal of the laws.Govt should come to table with ‘open mind’: Farmer leadersReading out a reply to the government’s talks offer during a press conference, farmer leaders said that they are ready for dialogue with an open mind but asked the government not to repeat the proposal of “meaningless” amendments that they have already rejected, Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav said the government should stop writing “love letters” and instead come up with a “concrete” offer in writing for the talks.After a meeting of union leaders that lasted for over three hours, farmer leader Shiv Kumar Kakka told reporters that the government should “abandon its stubbornness” and create a conducive environment for talks.In a letter to Union Agriculture Joint Secretary Vivek Aggarwal, Sankyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of 40 agitating unions, alleged that the government is treating the farmers as its “political opponents”.“Farmer unions are ready to hold talks with the government and that they are waiting for the government to come to the table with an open mind,” said Yadav, who is also a member of Morcha.“We urge you (government) not to repeat those meaningless amendments that we have already rejected but come up with a concrete proposal in writing that can become an agenda for fresh talks,” Yadav said while reading out the reply sent to the Centre’s letter dated December 20.Yadav alleged that government wants to project that the farmers are not ready to hold talks, adding that the ball is in the government’s court as peasants are ready for the same, but only after a concrete proposal.In the letter to 40 union leaders, Joint Secretary Aggarwal had on Sunday asked protesting farmer leaders to specify their concerns over its earlier proposal of amendments in the laws and choose a convenient date for the next round of talks so that the ongoing agitation could end at the earliest.The sixth round of talks on December 9 was cancelled following a deadlock with the farmer unions refusing to budge from their demand for repealing the three laws.Several farmers visited ‘Kisan Ghat’ here on Wednesday morning to pay tributes to Chaudhary Charan Singh, who was known for his farmer-friendly policies.Earlier in the day, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government will continue with reforms in the farm sector as it is committed to strengthening it.Stressing that a solution can be reached only through dialogue, Tomar said, “History is witness to this fact. However old and strong the protest is, the end and the solution to a protest are reached through dialogue only.”Farmer unions should discuss the government’s draft proposal and inform them if they want to add or delete anything, he said.“I am fully hopeful that our farmer unions will discuss... If they give a date and time, the government is ready for the next round of talks... I am hopeful that we will move towards resolving the issue,” Tomar told reporters.Enacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the central government as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell anywhere in the country.However, the protesting farmers have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of Minimum Support Price and do away with the ‘mandi’ system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.The government has repeatedly asserted that the MSP and ‘mandi’ systems will stay and has accused the opposition of misleading the farmers.

23-12-2020||Ballia (UP)||Abul Kalam Azad did not believed in ‘Bhartiyata’: UP minister Anand Swarup Shukla||In a controversial remark, Uttar Pradesh minister Anand Swarup Shukla has claimed that the country’s first education minister Abul Kalam Azad did not believed in “Bharat and Bhartiyata”.“I have no hesitation to say that in first education minister Abul Kalam Azad’s heart there was no ‘Bharat aur Bhartiyata” (India and Indianness),” Minister of State for Parliamentary affairs Shukla said while addressing a programme in Jannayak Chandrashekhar University here on Tuesday.“When Kashmiri Pandits requested Guru Tegh Bahadur to help them from Aurangzeb when he pressed them for accepting Islam and when Guru went there, he was beheaded by Aurangzeb. These facts were removed from history. Only thing which is there was that Akbar was great despite the fact that Ain-i-Akbari and historians of that time never considered him great,” he alleged.Shukla said those who wanted to make “Bharat Akhand” (India undivided) had “pain in their hearts” that India’s first university Takshila is in Afghanistan.“Such people are called communal,” he added.

23-12-2020||New Delhi||Union Cabinet approves Post Matric Scholarship for SC students||The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday approved changes in the Centrally Sponsored Scheme ‘Post Matric Scholarship to students belonging to Scheduled Castes (PMS-SC)’.This will benefit more than four crore SCs students in the next five years and enable them to successfully pursue their higher education, sources said.It is seen as Modi government's major outreach to the socially and economically poor sections of society."This is a major and transformatory changes which will have far reaching effect in uplifting the students among the poorest  SCs families," Union Social Justice Minister Thaawar Chand Gehlot said."The Union government  is committed to give further impetus to this effort so that the higher education of SCs would reach up to the national standards within the five year period."The Cabinet gave approval to a total investment of Rs 59,048 crore of which Union government would spend Rs.35,534 crore (60 per cent) and the balance would be spent by the state governments.This replaces the existing 'committed liability' system and brings greater involvement of the Centre in the scheme.The PMS-SC allows students to pursue any post matric course starting from standard 11th and onwards, with the government meeting the cost of education.It is estimated that 1.36 crore such poorest students, who are currently not continuing their education beyond 10th standards would be brought into the higher education system in the next five years.A salient feature of the scheme is that starting from 2021-22 the central share (60%) under it would be released on DBT mode directly into the bank accounts of students.The amount will be deposited from accounts of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to those of the benefeciaries as "per fixed time schedule", after ensuring that the concerned state government has released their share.Monitoring mechanism will be further strengthened through conduct of social audits, annual third party evaluation, and half-yearly self-audited reports from each institution.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/union-cabinet-approves-post-matric-scholarship-for-sc-students-188413
23-12-2020||New Delhi||Cabinet approves ordinance to protect Delhi’s unauthorised colonies from punitive action||The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved an ordinance extending protection from punitive action to unauthorised colonies, JJ clusters and constructions in Delhi’s rural areas built on agriculture land for another three years, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said.The NCT of Delhi (Special Provisions) Amendment Ordinance 2020 is an extension of a similar law first passed in 2011. When the 2011 law had expired, the government had in 2014 enacted the law again to grant a fresh extension.Since the law re-enacted in 2017 was ending soon and there was no winter session of Parliament, an ordinance was approved to extend the protection for another three years (till December 2023), Javadekar told reporters after the Cabinet meeting.He said Delhi’s unauthorised colonies, JJ (Jhuggi Jhopri) clusters and structures in rural areas built on agriculture land would get protection from the ordinance.The ordinance has to be signed by the President before it comes into force, the minister pointed out.

23-12-2020||New Delhi/Lucknow||Two dead, 16 injured in ammonia leakage at IFFCO plant in UP||Two people died and 16 others were injured in a major ammonia gas leak at IFFCO’s Phulpur fertiliser plant in Uttar Pradesh’s Allahabad, the firm said on Wednesday.The gas leakage that took place on Tuesday night around 10.30 pm, however, was restricted and stopped in a short time, the fertilizer cooperative major said in a statement. The two persons who died in the accident were identified as IFFCO Deputy Manager Abhay Nandan and Assistant Manager V P Singh.Out of the 16 injured IFFCO employees, including three contract labourers, two have been discharged while 14 others are undergoing treatment in different hospitals, the firm said.IFFCO said the accident took place as tie rods of an ammonia plunger pump suddenly broke and got detached leading to heavy ammonia leakage.Following the leakage, IFFCO ordered a technical investigation into the cause of the gas leakage while Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also ordered an administrative probe into the accident. “We deeply regret the sad and unfortunate accident happened yesterday night around 10.30 pm due to mechanical failure at #IFFCO #Phulpur Ammonia Urea unit in #Prayagraj. Our employees at the site fought bravely to handle the situation,” IFFCO CEO and Managing Director U S Awasthi tweeted on Wednesday.“Our emergency response group, fire and safety team and plant operating staff bravely fought with the emergency situation and restricted the leakage to small area within the plant and normalized it in a short time,” the IFFCO later said in its statement.Out of the 16 injured, six were shifted to a hospital in Allahabad, while remaining 10 were admitted to IFFCO township hospital, the IFFCO said in its statement.“Two of them have been discharged. The condition of the remaining fourteen is stable,” it added.A technical enquiry committee, headed by an executive director rank officer, has been set up to find out the cause of the incident which took place on Tuesday night, the statement said.Taking note of the accident, Chief Minister Adityanath also ordered a probe into the incident while announcing a financial help of Rs 4 lakh each for the family members of those who died in the incident.While condoling the death of two IFFCO officials, CM Adityanath directed to provide financial help to each to their families.He also ordered a probe into the matter to ascertain its cause and directed officials to provide the best treatment to those admitted in the hospital.

23-12-2020||New Delhi||DDC poll results victory for Modi's 'larger narrative' for J&K: BJP||Asserting that the DDC poll results in Jammu and Kashmir are a victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "larger narrative" for the union territory, the BJP on Wednesday claimed that the verdict was a "resounding slap" by people on the face of extremists, separatists, terrorists and their patrons.Law Minister and senior party leader Ravi Shankar Prasad also rejected the contention that the District Development Council poll results were a win for People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD), noting that the BJP has emerged as the single largest party and that it has got more votes than the total votes of the National Conference, the PDP and the Congress put together.The PAGD is an amalgamation of parties, including the NC and the PDP, which have been fiercely opposed to the Modi government's measures like abrogation of Article 370 and scrapping of Jammu and Kashmir's statehood.Addressing a press conference, Prasad noted that the BJP had won 74 seats against the NC's 67, PDP's 27 and the Congress' 26 and claimed that many of 39 independent winners had his party's support.The PAGD in total won 110 seats.      While the BJP put up a strong show in the Jammu region, Prasad noted that lotus, a reference to his party's poll symbol, had bloomed in the Valley as well.The Gupkar alliance was formed because its constituents knew that they could not fight the BJP on their own, he said."This is a victory for India, democracy, hope, development and people of Jammu and Kashmir. This is a victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's larger narrative for Jammu and Kashmir," Prasad told reporters.Development work was ushered in under the Central rule in the region, and people in Kashmir have now distinguished between those who rule and those who serve, he said."People have seen how democracy can bring them development. Their faith in democracy has been strengthened," said the Union Minister, noting that many militancy hotbeds like Pulwama, Kulgam, Shopian and Sopore in Kashmir saw much more polling in the DDC polls than the Lok Sabha elections.He said the PAGD also lost from the area of Burhan Wani, a Hizbul Mujahideen terrorist whose social media posts and subsequent killing in an encounter in 2016 had gained a lot of publicity.This is important as Wani's killing was "made an issue of international campaign by these elements" with Pakistan also raising the matter, he said.Noting that the BJP has won a string of polls across the length and breadth of the country in the last few months, Prasad said the habitual critics of the Prime Minister should take note of people's faith in him.

23-12-2020||Vibha Sharma||PM plans mega outreach to farmers on December 25||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, December 23Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mega outreach to farmers on December 25, the birth anniversary of late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Wednesday again expressed hope for an early resolution to the ongoing agitation, reiterating that the government is ready for a discussion at a time and date as per “convenience” of farmers’ unions.“I am hopeful that farmers’ unions will discuss our request. Whatever they want to add and subtract from the government’s proposal, they should tell us. We’re ready for a discussion at the time and date of their convenience. I am hopeful for a solution,” Tomar said on a day the Confederation of NGOs of Rural India presented him “letters of support to the three Farm Acts signed by 3,13,363 farmers, including 12,895 from Punjab and 1,27,653 from Haryana”.   PM Modi will release the next installment of financial benefit under Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) on December 25, which is observed as ‘Sushasan Divas’.“With the push of a button, the Prime Minister will enable the transfer of more than Rs 18,000 crore to more than 9 crore beneficiary farmer families,” Tomar said.The Agriculture Minister said that they had estimated about 14 crore farmers in the country but so far 11.04 crore had registered for the scheme.    While the Centre is firm the laws will not be scrapped and has proposed amendments, farmer 'jathebandis' and unions continue to be equally firm on their stance demanding a total repeal of the laws. They are also accusing the government of "maligning" their agitation.However, according to CNRI Secretary General Binod Anand who presented the letters of support to the Agriculture Minister, of the 3,13,363 signatories, 12,895 are from Punjab and 1,27,653 from Haryana.“There are 14 crore farmers in India out of which around 1.6 crore farmers are from Punjab and Haryana. Those sitting at Singhu border do not represent all farmers in the country.“We went to several places in Mansa, Bathinda, Ludhiana, Taran Tarn, Amritsar district and contacted several farmers and BKU unions, took their views and learned many things. Farmers in different places have different issues but are scared to come out in open. Despite that, they have given their support to us, around 12,895 are from Punjab,” said Anand.On December 25, the Prime Minister will also interact with farmers from six different states. “They will share their experiences on PM-KISAN and also on various other initiatives taken by the government for the welfare of farmers,” said the Agriculture Minister.Under the PM-KISAN Scheme, a financial benefit of Rs 6,000 per year is provided to the eligible beneficiary farmers, payable in three equal four-monthly installments of Rs 2,000 each. The fund is transferred directly to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/pm-plans-mega-outreach-to-farmers-on-december-25-188403
23-12-2020||New Delhi||India told to pay Rs 10,500 crore to Cairn Energy of UK as govt loses international arbitration over levy of taxes||India has been ordered to return up to USD 1.4 billion to Cairn Energy plc of the UK after the government lost an international arbitration over the retrospective levy of taxes.The three-member tribunal, which also comprised a nominee of the Indian government, unanimously ruled that India's claim of Rs 10,247 crore in past taxes over a 2006-07 internal reorganisation of Cairn's India business was not a valid demand.India, it said, "failed to accord the claimants' (Cairn Energy's) investments fair and equitable treatment" under the bilateral investment protection pact the nation had with the UK, it said in a 582-page order.The tribunal ordered the government to return the value of shares it had sold, dividends seized and tax refunds withheld to recover the tax demand.The government was asked to compensate Cairn "for the total harm suffered" together with interest and cost of arbitration, according to the order.While the order does not contain a provision for challenge or appeal against the award, the government said it would study the arbitration award and "will consider all options and take a decision on the further course of action, including legal remedies before appropriate fora"Cairn, according to people aware of the matter, can use the arbitration award to approach courts in countries such as the UK to seize any property owned by India overseas to recover the money if the award is not honoured.In a statement, Cairn Energy said it had been awarded USD 1.2 billion damages plus interest and costs.Sources said that including USD 200 million of interest and USD 20 million of arbitration cost, the total amount payable by the Indian government is USD 1.4 billion (about Rs 10,500 crore).This is the second loss the government has suffered in three months over the retrospective levy of taxes. In September, UK's Vodafone Group won an international arbitration against the demand of Rs 22,100 crore in taxes.However, Cairn was the only company against which the government took action to recover retrospective taxes. During the pendency of the arbitration, the government sold Cairn's near 5 per cent holding in Vedanta Ltd, seized dividends totalling Rs 1,140 crore due to it from those shareholdings and set off a Rs 1,590-crore tax refund against the demand.Besides Cairn Energy, the government also slapped a similar tax demand on its erstwhile subsidiary Cairn India (which is now part of Vedanta Ltd). Cairn India too has challenged the demand through a separate arbitration.In the case of Vodafone, the government took no such action.Confirming the award, Cairn in a statement said: "The tribunal established to rule on its claim against the Government of India has found in Cairn's favour."Cairn had challenged the Indian government seeking taxes over an internal business reorganisation using the 2012 retrospective tax law, under the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty."The tribunal ruled unanimously that India had breached its obligations to Cairn under the UK-India Bilateral Investment Treaty and has awarded to Cairn damages of USD 1.2 billion-plus interest and costs, which now becomes payable," it said.Commenting on the issue, Ministry of Finance in a statement said the government would be studying the award and all its aspects carefully in consultation with its counsels."After such consultations, the government would consider all options and take a decision on the further course of action, including legal remedies before appropriate fora," it said.Sources said the government had so far not appealed against the arbitration loss in the Vodafone case and the Cairn arbitration award may hasten a decision on it.The government, which does not have to pay any monetary compensation to Vodafone, had till December 24 to challenge the award before a court in Singapore - which was the seat of that arbitration.Cairn Energy, which gave the country its biggest oil discovery, was in March 2015 slapped with a tax demand of Rs 10,247 crore over alleged capital gains it made by reorganising its India unit into a separate subsidiary for listing on local stock exchanges.Cairn Energy in 2010-11 sold Cairn India to Vedanta but held a small stake in the firm, which was sold by the tax department to partly recover the tax demand.In September 2020, international arbitration court ruled that the Indian government seeking Rs 22,100 crore in taxes from Vodafone using retrospective legislation was in "breach of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment" guaranteed under the bilateral investment protection pact between India and the Netherlands.The government has to reimburse Vodafone 60 per cent of its legal costs and half of the 6,000 euros cost borne by Vodafone for appointing an arbitrator on the panel.Sources said the Government of India's liability came to Rs 85 crore in legal cost.Vodafone International Holding in February 2007 bought 100 per cent shares of Cayman Island-based company CGP Investments for USD 11.1 billion to indirectly get 67 per cent control of Hutchison Essar Ltd - an Indian company.The Tax Department felt the deal was designed to avoid capital gain tax in India and so imposed a tax demand, which was rejected by the Supreme Court in 2012.To stop abuse and plug the loophole of such indirect transfer of Indian assets, the government in 2012 amended the law to make such transfers taxable in India, they said.

23-12-2020||Chandigarh||Khalsa Aid sets up free 'Kisan Mall' at Tikri border||Farmers at Tikri border will no longer have to jostle in a crowd in search of relief material provided by voluntary organisations as Khalsa Aid on Wednesday set up a 'Kisan Mall' at the border to provide farmers items of daily use for free.The mall is providing blankets, toothbrushes, toothpaste, thermals, sweaters, jackets, vests, blankets, oil, Vaseline, socks, washing soap, bathing soap, shampoo, comb, muffler, Odomos, dry milk, sanitary pads and shoes. Heating pads, towels, ’Loai’, slippers, garbage bag, knee caps, tarpaulin, nail cutter, ENO and washing brushes are also available at the mall.Previously stalls for relief material witnessed crowds which prevented protestors from getting the right size, while others struggled to make it due to their age.Director of the Asia chapter of the Khalsa Aid project, Amanpreet Singh, said: “Taking note of farmers' problem in receiving the right kind of material in the crowd, we came up with the idea of setting up a mall. The relief material which came earlier wasn't of the specific size required by the beneficiaries. Also, there was a big section of farmers who thought it was below their dignity to join the crowd and seek help. The elderly, particularly women, found it very difficult to get the material of their choice."A 70-year old farmer from Barnala, Ajmer Singh, said: “I have been trying to get hold of a few blankets from many days but could not. There is a different group coming and distributing the relief material but it is not systematic. This Mall is very organized and will definitely allow farmers to stay comfortable for longer if needed.”A student of Punjabi University, Udham Singh, said “We are providing material with help of the money that the ‘sangat’ is offering to help farmers sustain their energy for the protest. We are only giving farmers the privilege of choosing what they need."A young farmer from Faridkot, Sehajdeep Singh Gill, said: “We witnessed many undeserving people coming and grabbing the relief material. We have now started the system of going to the camps ourselves and giving tokens to farmers. These farmers come to our mall and fill a form to list their requirements which are provided on the spot. It is helping the aid to reach the right people."||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/khalsa-aid-sets-up-free-kisan-mall-at-tikri-border-188395

China has also deployed an equal number of troops, according to officials.Lt Gen PGK Menon, the commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, popularly known as 'Fire and Fury' Corps, briefed the Army chief on various aspects of the situation in eastern Ladakh.Sources said Gen Naravane reached Ladakh at 8.30 am on a day-long visit with an aim to review the ground situation in the region that is experiencing harsh winter."General MM Naravane #COAS visited forward areas of #FireandFury Corps including Rechin La and undertook a first-hand assessment of the situation along the LAC. He was briefed by #GOC #FireandFury Corps and other local commanders on the operational preparedness of our forces," the Army tweeted.The Army said Gen Naravane interacted with the troops deployed in forward areas and exhorted them to continue working with the same "zeal and enthusiasm".He also distributed sweets and cakes ahead of Christmas.Around three-and-half months ago, Indian troops had occupied a number of strategic heights in the Mukhpari, Rechin La and Magar hill areas around the southern bank of the Pangong lake in eastern Ladakh after the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) attempted to intimidate them in the area on the intervening night of August 29 and 30."General MM Naravane #COAS undertook on-the-spot inspection of the state of #habitat of troops on the forward line of defences at #RechinLa. He appreciated the efforts made by the formation to make troops comfortable along the #LAC," the Army said in another tweet.It said the Army chief also visited the forward base of Tara and interacted with the local commanders and troops. He appreciated their high morale and state of readiness. The military face-off erupted on May 5 following violent clashes between the Indian army and the PLA in the Pangong lake area. The clashes were followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.Last week, India and China held another round of diplomatic talks during which they agreed to continue work towards ensuring complete disengagement of troops in all friction points along the LAC in eastern Ladakh at the "earliest".It was agreed at the talks that the next round of military dialogue should be held at an early date so that both sides can work towards an early and complete disengagement of troops in accordance with the existing bilateral agreements and protocols.India and China have held several rounds of diplomatic and military talks in the last few months to resolve the standoff. However, no concrete breakthrough has been achieved so far. PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/army-chief-visits-forward-posts-in-ladakh-reviews-situation-amid-military-standoff-188392

23-12-2020||Thiruvananthapuram||Eminent poet-activist Sugathakumari no more||Eminent Malayalam poet, conservationist and women's activist, Sugathakumari, who had tested positive for COVID-19 and was undergoing treatment, died at the government medical college hospital here on Wednesday.She was 86 and leaves behind daughter Lakshmi Devi, family sources here said.The octogenarian poet rarely made any public appearance in recent days due to old age difficulties.Fondly being called as 'Sugatha Teacher' by her hundreds of admirers and followers, the activist-poet had been admitted to the intensive care unit of the medical college after being diagnosed with the viral infection on December 21.Though she was first admitted to a private hospital, she was rushed to the government health facility after she tested positive.As her condition remained critical without any change and her body failed to respond to medicines, the poet was on ventilator support, medical college authorities said.Besides the severe bronchial pneumonia, an after-effect of COVID-19, the condition of her vital organs also deteriorated and the end came at around 11 am.One of the most celebrated Malayalam poets of the contemporary era, Sugathakumari was known for her unique poems filled with compassionate empathy, human sensitivity and philosophical quest.In her poetic career spanning over six decades, she, through her subtle and sublime lines, fought against the injustices in this world especially against the ruthless oppression of women and indiscriminate exploitation of nature.A fearless and tireless fighter in real life, she led several agitations for the environmental cause and conservation of nature.She had spearheaded the fiercest environmental campaign witnessed by Kerala--against a proposal to set up a hydel project in the Silent valley in the Western Ghats three decades ago and was also in the forefront of the recent agitation against the construction of an airport at Aranmula.The poet had been a constant presence and invitee wherever there was an environmental issue in the state until some years ago before she became physically weak due to age-related issues.Always been a constant supporter and solace for destitute and molested women, Sugathakumari had been running for over three decades 'Abhaya', an organisation for the deprived women, including financially poor, rape survivors, domestic violence victims and drug addicts.Born as the second daughter of freedom fighter and poet, Bodheswaran and wife Karthiyayini Amma on January 22, 1934, Sugatha had entered into the world of poetry in 1960 with her first collection of poems- Muthuchippikal.Since then, she had captured the Malayali consciousness through her soft but hard-hitting verses in a handful of poetry collections including Pathirapookkal, Krishna Kavithakal, Ratrimazha, Ambalamani, Radha Evide, Thulavarshapacha and so on.Though her early works concentrated more on subjective themes and personal quests, her poetry, in course of time, broadened its peripheries assimilating social concerns and philosophical voyages into it as its themes.Also the first chairperson of the Kerala State Women's Commission, Sugathakumari had been a recipient of several honours and recognitions.The country had bestowed her with Padma Shree in 2006 while the higher literary award Saraswati Samman reached her in 2013 for her poetic collection "Manalezhuth" (The Writing on the Sand).She also bagged almost all prestigious literary awards in the state including Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award, Ezhuthachan Puraskaram, Vayalar Award, Odakkuzhal Award, Ashan Prize and so on.The poet also won the union government's first 'Vriksha Mitra' award.Writer and scholar, late K Velayudhan was her husband.Noted writers and academicians, late Hridaya Kumari and Sujatha Devi were siblings.

Politics can wait, society can wait, but the country’s development cannot wait,” he added.Though he did not refer to the farmers’ stir, analysts read hints towards it in his observations as the AMU students have extended support to the farmers. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/keep-nation-before-ideology-pm-188265
23-12-2020||New Delhi||Cases below 20K after 6 months||India today reported 19,556 new infections in 24 hours, the daily cases dropping below 20,000 after a gap of 173 days. The active cases (2, 92,518) have also fallen below 3 lakh after 163 days and now make up less than 3 per cent of all cases.The government, meanwhile, said the highly transmissible mutant strain reported by the UK had not been seen in India so far. It said all passengers who arrived from the UK or transited through it over the last four weeks starting November 25 would be put under surveillance and tracked. Advising vigilance but ruling out panic, NITI Aayog Member, Health, VK Paul said the new strain increased the transmissibility of Covid, but did not increase the propensity for death, hospitalisation or severity of disease nor did it negatively impact the potential of vaccines being developed in India or available elsewhere.Contacts of passengers who test positive will be put in institutional quarantine, tested and handled as per new SOPs. Contacts are defined as “co-passengers seated in the same row, three rows in front and three behind along with the identified cabin crew.”Preliminary reports suggest 13 passengers who arrived from the UK in different flights since yesterday had tested positive. Their samples have been sent to NIV-Pune for genome sequencing. WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan however did not rule out the possibility of the mutant strain circulating in other countries. “I suspect as more countries look at their data they might find that this variant or a related variant may already be there,” Swaminathan said.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/cases-below-20k-after-6-months-188268

The quantum of sentence will be pronounced on Wednesday.A second year college student who was staying at the convent, 22-year-old Abhaya’s body was found in the well of St Pius convent. Another accused in the case, Fr Jose Poothrikkayil, was discharged due to lack of evidence. The CBI, which took over probe on March 29, 1993, filed three closure reports, saying though it was a case of murder, the culprits could not be found. On September 4, 2008, the Kerala High Court came down heavily on the CBI, saying the agency was “still a prisoner of those who wielded political and bureaucratic power”. It directed the Delhi CBI unit hand over the probe to its Kochi counterpart. Following this, the CBI arrested the two priests and the nun in 2008. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/priest-nun-found-guilty-in-sister-abhaya-murder-case-188271
