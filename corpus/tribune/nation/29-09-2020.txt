But it is the first known case of a Western government prosecuting a Tibetan accused of espionage,” read the newsletter.It said that ostracising the suspects and fear-mongering should be the last resort as the Tibetan community would then play into China’s hands.The need is to challenge the Chinese Communist Party not their paid spies. The next time, do welcome a new Tibetan into the circle ``if you have to, but remain alert at all times so that our movement continues unhindered'', it advised.Sweden was the first country in Europe to close all Chinese government-established Confucius Institutes and Classrooms by May this year.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said Washington would close down all Confucius centers by year-end.Tibetans allege that China engages heavily through these Confucius institutes and alumni to monitor voices that run contrary to Beijing’s official narrative.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/tibetans-welcome-conviction-of-chinese-spy-from-their-midst-148464

The AIIMS and CBI are in agreement and on the same page in the matter,” AIIMS’ forensic chief said.He added, “We don’t confirm any speculation running in the media and request all media to refrain from referring to AIIMS’ name in any news content.”These remarks by Dr Gupta come amid conflicting media reports about the contents of the medico-legal opinion. While some news reports claimed that the expert panel has said there is no proof of poisoning, some others said it has not ruled out murder or homicide.The CBI had on Monday said it has not reached any conclusion in the death of Sushant Singh Rajput and all aspects are under investigation.“The Central Bureau of Investigation is conducting a professional investigation related to the death of Sushant Singh Rajput in which all aspects are being looked into and no aspect has been ruled out as of date,” a CBI spokesperson said in a statement.Rajput, 34, who made his silver screen debut in the critically acclaimed ‘Kai Po Che’ seven years ago, was found dead in his apartment in suburban Bandra in Mumbai on June 14.The CBI had taken over the probe from Bihar Police into the alleged abetment to suicide case filed by the actor’s father K K Singh in Patna against Rajput’s girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty and her family.K K Singh, in his complaint to the Bihar Police, had alleged that Chakraborty along with her family members had misappropriated Rajput’s wealth. The allegation was denied by Chakraborty in TV interviews.Last week, K K Singh’s lawyer Vikas Singh had expressed “helplessness” over the “slow pace” of the CBI probe into Rajput’s death.“The pace of the CBI probe into Sushant Singh Rajput’s death has suddenly slowed down and all attention is being diverted to drugs-related issues with the NCB conducting fashion parade of Bollywood stars,” the late actor’s family lawyer Vikas Singh had alleged on Friday. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/medical-board-gave-conclusive-medico-legal-opinion-on-sushants-death-to-cbi-aiims-forensic-chief-148463

29-09-2020||New Delhi||Lufthansa says cancelling flights connecting India and Germany till Oct 20||Lufthansa said Tuesday that it will have to cancel all “planned flights” between India and Germany from September 30 to October 20 because of an “unexpected rejection” of its flight schedule by the Indian authorities.The German carrier said it had applied for continuation of the special flights it was allowed to operate until the end of September but will now have to cancel the flights because of the “unexpected rejection” of its flight schedule by the Indian government.Scheduled international passenger flights have been suspended in India since March 23 due to the coronavirus lockdown. However, special flights have been permitted under “air bubble” arrangements India has formed with 13 countries, including Germany.Aviation regulator DGCA said India formalised an air bubble with Germany in July this year. “However, there are restrictions in place for Indian nationals desiring to travel to Germany which was putting Indian carriers at a significant disadvantage resulting in inequitable distribution of traffic in favour of Lufthansa,” the DGCA stated.“As against Indian carriers operating 3-4 flights a week, Lufthansa operated 20 flights a week. In spite of this disparity we offered to clear 7 flights a week for Lufthansa which was not accepted by them. Negotiations continue,” it noted.Lufthansa said in a statement its application process to operate flights beyond September 30 was necessary since India has so far not accepted Germany’s invitation to discuss details regarding a temporary travel agreement between both countries.“It is important to note that the October flight schedule would essentially have been an extension of the already limited number of flights between India and Germany that Lufthansa has been reintroducing to the Indian market since June,” it added.Lufthansa said it had scheduled flights for October in order to continue connecting Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore with Europe and other regions in its worldwide network.“The October schedule would also have seen the addition of flights to and from Chennai, one of the most important cities in southern India,” the airline said.Lufthansa said it “sincerely urges” Indian authorities to work together with the German government to establish a temporary travel agreement between both countries.“As visa issuance is restarting and demand for flights to and from India is increasing, it is regrettable that Lufthansa is currently being unnecessarily restricted,” it noted. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/lufthansa-says-cancelling-flights-connecting-india-and-germany-till-oct-20-148452

29-09-2020||Satya Prakash||Sex on pretext of marriage: SC rules incident can’t be stretched over years||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 29Amid rising incidents of sex on the pretext of marriage, the Supreme Court has ruled that misrepresentation of facts to obtain a woman’s consent for sex has to be close to the incident and not stretched over years.A three-judge Bench headed by Justice Rohinton F Nariman acquitted a tribal man from Jharkhand who was held guilty of raping a Christian girl after allegedly obtaining her consent for sex fraudulently on the pretext of marriage.Due to differences between the two families, the man couldn’t marry the woman who went on to file a rape case against her ex-boyfriend, barely a week before he was to marry another woman. The trial court held him guilty of rape and Jharkhand High Court upheld the conviction.However, the top court set aside his conviction, saying: “We have no hesitation in concluding that the consent of the prosecutrix was but a conscious and deliberated choice, as distinct from an involuntary action or denial and which opportunity was available to her, because of her deep­seated love for the appellant leading her to willingly permit him liberties with her body, which according to normal human behaviour are permitted only to a person with whom one is deeply in love.”Clarifying the legal position, the Bench said, “Under Section 90 of IPC, a consent given under a misconception of fact is no consent in the eyes of law. But the misconception of fact has to be in proximity of time to the occurrence and cannot be spread over a period of four years.”It said, “We… are of the considered opinion that the appellant did not make any false promise or intentional misrepresentation of marriage leading to establishment of physical relationship between the parties,” it said on Monday reversing the Jharkhand High Court’s verdict.“The prosecutrix (girl) was herself aware of the obstacles in their relationship because of different religious beliefs. An engagement ceremony was also held in the solemn belief that the societal obstacles would be overcome, but unfortunately differences also arose whether the marriage was to solemnised in the Church or in a Temple and ultimately failed. It is not possible to hold on the evidence available that the appellant right from the inception did not intend to marry the prosecutrix ever and had fraudulently misrepresented only in order to establish physical relation with her,” it said. “They were both smitten by each other and passions of youth ruled over their minds and emotions. The physical relations that followed was not isolated or sporadic in nature, but regular over the years. The prosecutrix had even gone and resided in the house of the appellant,” the top court noted.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sex-on-pretext-of-marriage-sc-rules-incident-cant-be-stretched-over-years-148448

29-09-2020||New Delhi||Govt refutes Amnesty's claim of 'witch-hunt', calls it a ploy to divert attention from illegalities||The Union Home Ministry on Tuesday strongly refuted Amnesty International’s allegation that it was being subjected to an “incessant witch-hunt”, saying India, by settled law, does not allow interference in domestic political debates by entities funded by foreign donations.Coming down heavily on the organisation, the ministry also said all the “glossy statements” about humanitarian work and speaking truth to power are nothing but a “ploy to divert attention” from their activities which were in clear contravention of laid down Indian laws.The Amnesty International’s statement was “unfortunate, exaggerated and far from the truth”, the Home Ministry said.“Such statements are also an attempt to extraneously influence the course of investigations by multiple agencies into the irregularities and illegalities carried out over the last few years,” the Home Ministry said in a detailed statement.The Home Ministry said the Amnesty International had received permission under the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) only once and that too 20 years ago, on December 19, 2000.Since then the organisation, despite its repeated applications, has been denied FCRA approval by successive governments since as per law it is not eligible for it.However, in order to circumvent the FCRA regulations, Amnesty UK remitted large amounts of money to four entities registered in India by classifying it as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).A significant amount of foreign money was also remitted to Amnesty (India) without MHA’s approval under the FCRA.“This mala fide rerouting of money was in contravention of extant legal provisions,” it said.Owing to these illegal practices of Amnesty, the previous government had also rejected the repeated applications of Amnesty to receive funds from overseas, the Home Ministry said.This had led Amnesty to suspend its India operations once during that period as well.The Home Ministry said this bipartisan and purely legal approach towards Amnesty, under different governments, makes it clear that the entire fault lies in the dubious processes adopted by Amnesty to secure funds for its operations.“The stand taken and the statements made by Amnesty International are unfortunate, exaggerated and far from the truth,” the Home Ministry said.The Home Ministry said Amnesty is free to continue humanitarian work in India, as is being done by many other organisations.“However, India, by settled law, does not allow interference in domestic political debates by entities funded by foreign donations.“This law applies equally to all and it shall apply to Amnesty International as well,” the Home Ministry statement said.India has a rich and pluralistic democratic culture with a free press, independent judiciary and a tradition of vibrant domestic debate, it said.The people of India have placed unprecedented trust in the current government, the Home Ministry said.“The Amnesty’s failure to comply with local regulations does not entitle them to make comments on the democratic and plural character of India,” it said.Earlier in the day, the Amnesty International said it is halting all its activities in India due to freezing of its accounts and claimed that it is being subjected to an “incessant witch-hunt” over unfounded and motivated allegations.The Amnesty India said the organisation has been compelled to let go of staff in India and pause all its ongoing campaign and research work.“The complete freezing of Amnesty International India’s bank accounts by the Government of India which it came to know on 10 September 2020, brings all the work being done by the organisation to a grinding halt,” the Amnesty said in its statement.

29-09-2020||Beijing||China says it is opposed to India’s infrastructure development at borders in Ladakh||China on Tuesday voiced its opposition to India undertaking infrastructure development for military purposes in the border areas of Ladakh, and maintained that both countries should avoid any activities that might complicate the situation upsetting the consensus reached between them to ease the situation.“China has not recognised Ladakh Union Territory illegally set up by the Indian side,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a press briefing here while replying to a question by a western media journalist that India was prioritising construction of high altitude road network on its border with China in the Ladakh region.It may be recalled that when China first expressed its opposition to India’s move to create a separate Union Territory of Ladakh, a day after the state of Jammu and Kashmir was bifurcated into two union territories on August 5, 2019, the then External Affairs Ministry spokesperson had said India does not comment on the internal affairs of other countries and similarly expects other countries to do likewise.“We are opposed to conducting infrastructure development for military purposes in the border area. Based on the two sides’ consensus no side should engage in the border areas in any activities that might complicate the situation to avoid undermining efforts by the two sides to ease the situation”, Wang said.To another question on reports that China has carried out massive development of border infrastructure, Wang said reports released by “some institutions” stating that China has built new military bases on its side is “completely false”.“First some institutions once released the so-called information on new military bases or facilities China has built on its side. Such reports are completely false. They are driven by ulterior motives,” he said.“Second China consistently and strictly abides by the agreements signed with the Indian side. We are committed to maintaining peace and stability along the border with India and at the same time we firmly safeguard our sovereignty, territorial integrity and security,” he added.Wang said for a long time China has been conducting activities on its side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and they have always complied with relevant agreements.“We hope the Indian side to work for the same purpose, together with China to achieve the cooling of temperature on the ground and to prevent adding complex factors to the concerted efforts by the two sides to ease the situation,” he said.India and China are locked in a nearly five-month-long border standoff in eastern Ladakh.After marathon 14-hour talks between India and China at the Corps Commander level on September 21, both sides released a joint statement saying the two countries had decided to stop sending more troops to the frontline in eastern Ladakh.The joint statement had also stated that both sides will enhance communication to avoid misunderstandings and also implement the five-point consensus reached by their foreign ministers S Jaishankar and Wang Yi on the sidelines of the SCO meet in Moscow on September 10. — PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/china-says-it-is-opposed-to-indias-infrastructure-development-at-borders-in-ladakh-148425

This time they (people) will not come under the influence of anyone,” she said.The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said Bihar needs a government that follows the principle of “Sarvjan Hitay, Sarvjan Sukhay” (government for everyone’s interest and welfare).The three-phase Bihar Assembly polls are scheduled to be held on October 28, November 3 and November 8 while the results will be announced on November 10.

29-09-2020||Naveen S Garewal  ||Andhra farmers to get free bore wells, motors||Tribune News Service  Hyderabad, September 29 Andhra Pradesh will dig 2 lakh bore wells for the state’s farmers as part of the ‘YSR Jala Kala’ scheme over the next four years.The bore wells will be hand over to the farmers along with pipes that will help them irrigate parts of their land, free of cost.The scheme that will cost Rs 2,340 crore was launched by Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Monday.  “We have launched ‘YSR Jala Kala’ that was part of our election manifesto. My government will stand in support of farmers who do not have irrigation water source other than bore well water across the state,” said Reddy.  “The bore wells will be dug up using hydrogeological information and the entire cost will be borne by the government,” he said.The Chief Minister said that he had seen various facets of a farmer’s life and the difficulties they faced during his 3,650-km padayatra prior to the elections and it was his duty to mitigate their sufferings.The scheme started with the drilling of 163 bore wells on Monday, one each in the 144 rural constituencies and 19 semi-urban constituencies, he informed.The CM announced that the farmers could apply online or take the help of volunteers in village secretariats without any charge to apply for the bore wells.The state has created a dedicated website for farmers to avail the free bore well drilling service at www.ysrjalakala.ap.gov.in besides they can also use a toll-free number 1902 to enroll under the scheme, Reddy said.Hydrogeological expertise will determine the best spot on the farmland for drilling a bore well with good quality water and in case a bore well failed to yield water, the government will try to drill one more for such farmer, the Chief Minister added.The government has also decided to install free electric motors on the land of eligible small and marginal farmers along with the scheme.“For small and marginal farmers, not only drilling bores, but we will also go a step ahead and fix motors. Officials said this will cost another Rs 1,600 crore,” Reddy said, adding that around 5 lakh acres of farmland in Andhra was expected to benefit from this scheme.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/andhra-farmers-to-get-free-bore-wells-motors-148417

29-09-2020||New Delhi||Hathras gangrape: Cong questions ‘silence’ of PM, BJP women leaders; terms UP ‘crime capital’||Hitting out at the BJP over the Hathras gang rape incident, the Congress on Tuesday questioned the “silence” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and women leaders of his party, and alleged Uttar Pradesh under the Yogi Adityanath government has become the “crime capital” of the country.The Opposition party’s attack on the Centre and the state government came after a 19-year-old Dalit woman from Hathras died at Safdarjung hospital in Delhi on Tuesday morning, days after she was allegedly raped by four men.The Congress also protested at the Vijay Chowk over the incident, demanding justice for the victim. The party said its leaders PL Punia, Udit Raj, Amrita Dhawan along with other functionaries were detained at Mandir Marg police station for the protest.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked the government over the incident, saying the “class-specific jungle raj” of UP has killed another young woman.“The government said that this is fake news and left the victim to die. Neither was this unfortunate incident fake, nor was the death of the victim and the mercilessness of the government,” he said in a tweet in Hindi.Congress general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government, alleging there is “no semblance of security” for women in the state.“A Dalit girl who was victim of demoniac behaviour in Hathras has passed away at Safdarjung Hospital. For two weeks, she struggled between life and death in hospitals,” she said in a tweet in Hindi.She said incidents of rape one after another, in Hathras, Shahjahanpur and Gorakhpur have shaken the state.                 “Law and order in UP has deteriorated beyond limits. There is no semblance of safety for women. Criminals are committing crimes in the open,” Priyanka Gandhi said.The killers of this girl should be punished severely, she demanded.“You are accountable for the safety of women in UP,” the Congress leader tweeted, tagging Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.At a press conference, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate alleged that for eight days no gang rape charges were pressed in the matter and only after the media reported it, the police registered a case.She also alleged that the UP chief minister’s information advisor and the Agra police, up until September 24, kept calling this “fake news”.“Questions still remain. Why did it take eight days for the UP Police to register a gang rape case on her complaint, why was she immediately not transferred to a premier institute like AIIMS, and instead was left to die in UP? Why is it that these men who brutally assaulted, raped and murdered her, do not face NSA (National Security Act) charges and why is it that the UP chief minister is absolutely quiet on this?” Shrinate asked.Claiming that there is no law and order in UP, she alleged the police are “hand in glove” with criminals and the government extends them “political patronage”.“I will also raise questions on the absolute conspicuous silence of the prime minister, and women leaders of the BJP who had at one point in time said it is their moral duty to raise their voice on crimes against women and today when they are in charge of those departments, they do not utter a word,” she said.If one does not condemn this, then one is very much “hand in glove” with the criminals, Shrinate said.The Congress demands justice for the rape victim and the culprits should be brought to book, she said. It should be a speedy trial, and the UP government should apologise to her family for calling it “fake news” for as long as they did, Shrinate added.Citing that crimes against women had taken place in various cities in the state such as Hathras, Unnao, Shahjahanpur, Gorakhpur, Barabanki and Lakhimpur, Shrinate alleged that women are subjected to brutal rape, assault and murder in the state and the government “keeps quiet and turns the other way”.“UP is today the crime capital of the country not just in murder and extortion, but in rapes and molestation. When will this end? The reason that it is not ending is because the UP government has tainted members,” she said.“Will the members who face criminal charges of rape and murder” be responsible for enforcing law and order in the state, she asked.Out of about 312 BJP MLAs, 83 face serious charges such as murder and rape, Shrinate claimed.“We stand in solidarity with the victim’s family. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the family,” she added.The woman was allegedly gang-raped on September 14 following which she was admitted to the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital in Aligarh. She was referred to the Delhi hospital on Monday after her condition showed no signs of improvement.On September 14, the woman had gone to the fields with her mother and had gone missing soon after.She was later found brutally injured, with her tongue having a serious cut as she bit it while the accused attempted to strangulate her, an SP had said, while giving details of the incident.

29-09-2020||Mumbai||We don’t agree with what Kangana said, but is this way to react: Bombay HC to Sanjay Raut||Referring to an alleged threat given by Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut to actor Kangana Ranaut in an interview, the Bombay High Court on Tuesday asked if this was the way a parliamentarian should react.Raut has been made a respondent to the petition filed by Ranaut against the demolition carried out at her bungalow here by the Shiv Sena-controlled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on September 9.“Even we don’t agree with a word of what the petitioner (Ranaut) has said. But is this the way to address?” the court said.“We are also Maharashtrians. We are all proud Maharashtrians. But we don’t go and break someone’s house.Is this the way to react? Don’t you have any grace?” asked a division bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and R I Chagla.The high court, which stayed the demolition, is now conducting a final hearing on the actor’s petition which has sought damages of Rs 2 crore for the ‘illegal’ action.Earlier during the hearing on Tuesday, Raut submitted an affidavit where he denied that he had threatened Ranaut.While he had made a reference to Ranaut, it “wasn’t in the way that the petitioner had alleged”, it said.At this the court said that at least Raut accepted that he had been talking about Ranaut in the interview, as at an earlier hearing, his lawyer had denied that Raut had made any reference to her at all.In an interview to a newschannel, Raut had allegedly used an objectionable word while referring to the actor, and further said “What is law? Ukhad denge (we will demolish it)”.“You are a parliamentarian. You have no respect for the law? You ask what is law?” the bench said.Raut’s lawyer conceded that the Rajya Sabha member should have been more responsible.“He should not have said that. But there was no threatening message. He only said that the petitioner is very dishonest....That was a remark made after the petitioner said that Maharashtra is not safe,” she said.The BMC’s ‘H’ ward officer Bhagyawant Late, also made a respondent to the case, stated that Ranaut’s allegations of malice against him and the BMC were an attempt to divert the attention from the illegal construction at her Pali Hill bungalow.Senior counsel Anil Sakhre, who appeared for Late, said the officer was only performing his statutory duty in carrying out the demolition.But the court asked what the BMC was doing when the alleged illegal construction going on. “Why did you wait to take any action until September 5 or September 7? You had turned a blind eye to it,” the bench said.Ranaut’s counsel Dr Birendra Saraf reiterated that the actor had not constructed anything illegally, and even if there were some irregularities, those could have been regularised by the civic body.Saraf had alleged earlier that the BMC carried out the demolition out of malice and vendetta after Ranaut made some comments against the Mumbai police that irked the Shiv Sena- led government in Maharashtra.The court adjourned the hearing to October 5.

29-09-2020||New Delhi||1 in 15 Indians estimated to be exposed to COVID; over 90% still susceptible: ICMR survey||One in 15 individuals over the age of 10 years were estimated to have been exposed to COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 by August 2020, the second sero survey by the Indian Council of Medical Research has found.Chief of the ICMR Balram Bhargava on Tuesday said the second sero survey collected blood samples from 29,082 individuals across the same 700 villages and urban wards from 70 districts in 21 states which were covered in the first survey.“The prevalence of COVID-19 among individuals aged 10 years plus was found to be 6.6 per cent. The prevalence was not different by age group and gender. Urban slum showed the highest risk gradient with the prevalence of 15.6 pc as against 8.2 pc in urban non-slums and 4.4 pc in rural areas. The prevalence in adults – more than 18 years – was found at 7.1 per cent which is more than 0.73 per cent prevalence found in the 18 years plus category in the last sero survey that ascertained the prevalence of the infection until May end,” Bhargava said.The survey results mean more than 90 per cent of Indians are still vulnerable to the virus because they have not yet been exposed to it.The sero surveys detect the presence of antibodies in the blood samples of people. Presence of antibodies reveals past exposure to the virus.Bhargava said since a large proportion of the population is yet susceptible, prevention fatigue to be avoided using the five Ts strategy—Test, Track, Trace, Treat and Technology.Member Health NITI Aayog VK Paul commenting on the findings of the ICMR survey said the upcoming festive and winter months would present fertile ground for the spread of the virus.“People need to check this. We all know that respiratory viruses are winter viruses. They like winter months. So as the festive season comes, we all have to observe a Diwali, Dusehra, Eid and other festivals wearing masks and have to avoid large gatherings. Small group celebrations have to be encouraged lest we lose the edge we have gained over the past 11 days,” Paul said.In the last 11 days starting September 19, India saw higher daily recoveries than daily cases except on two days.The government is hoping these trends will hold and the COVID graph will start declining.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/1-in-15-indians-estimated-to-be-exposed-to-covid-over-90-still-susceptible-icmr-survey-148411

These include 162 by the Army, 56 by the Air Force and 8 by the Navy according to information placed in Parliament by the defence ministry this month. In addition to other government agencies, including the Coast Guard, some other countries have also inducted this helicopter.While the Dhruv is a transport helicopter capable of ferrrying up to 14 passengers, it also has an armed variant called the Rudra.Speaking on the occasion, R Madhavan, Chairman-cum-Managing Director, HAL, said that the ALH never looked back from the day when the prototype took its maiden flight on August 30, 1992, and has since evolved into a world class helicopter with its unparalleled performance. “The evolution from ALH Mark-I to Mark-IV has been phenomenal and is a boost to the indigenous design and development of helicopters”, he stated.The roll-out certificate of the 300th helicopter was handed over to GVS Bhaskar, Chief Executive Officer, Helicopter Complex by YK Sharma, Additional Director General (South Zone), Directorate General of Aeronautical Quality Assurance (DGAQA).“Rolling out of the 300th ALH is a testimony to the capabilities HAL has built over the years with concerted efforts of employees and customer support,” Bhaskar said “With more ALH getting inducted into the services our focus on customer support is ever increasing. With over 2,80,000 flying hours ALH has proven to be a multirole helicopter for Any Mission, Any Place, Any Time”, he added.Currently, HAL is producing 73 ALHs contracted by the services. This includes 41 for the Army, 16 for the Indian Navy and 16 for the Indian Coast Guard. Out of this, 38 ALHs have already been produced and the remaining will be rolled out by 2022.On this occasion, the ‘Ground Run’ of the first Limited Series Production (LSP) of Light Combat Helicopter, was also carried out.

29-09-2020||---||India again rejects China’s 1959 claim line||New Delhi, September 29India again rejected a Chinese statement affirming a “1959 claim line” as the border between the two countries in Ladakh.India has been consistently rejecting the Chinese offer to settle the border in Ladakh according to a line espoused by then Chinese Premier Chou en-Lai in 1959.The MEA official spokesperson said on Tuesday India has never accepted the “so-called unilaterally defined 1959 Line of Actual Control (LAC)”, a position that is consistent and well known, including to the Chinese side.India also pointed out that Chinese furtherance of the so-called 1959 line proposal ran counter to several agreements that were framed to reach a common understanding of the alignment of the LAC. After engaging in an exercise to clarify and confirm the LAC, the process could not proceed after 2003 as the Chinese side did not show a willingness to pursue it, the MEA regretted.The MEA pointed out that at the last high-level meeting between the two Foreign Ministers in Moscow on September 10, China has reiterated its commitment to abide by all the existing agreements. These include the the 1993 Agreement on Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility, the 1996 Agreement on Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) in the military field, 2005 Protocol on Implementation of CBMs and 2005 Agreement on Political Parameters and Guiding Principles for settlement of the India-China Boundary Question.All these pacts commit India and China to clarification and confirmation of the LAC to reach a common understanding of its alignment. “Therefore, the insistence now of the Chinese side that there is only one LAC is contrary to the solemn commitments made by China in these agreements,” noted the MEA statement.Making it clear that the Indian side has always respected and abided by the LAC, the MEA said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had stated in Parliament that Chinese troops had tried to transgress the LAC in several parts of the Western Sector in an attempt to unilaterally alter the status quo.As China has repeatedly said the current situation should be resolved in accordance with the agreements signed between the two countries, “we, therefore, expect that they will sincerely and faithfully abide by all agreements and understandings and refrain from advancing an untenable unilateral interpretation of the LAC,” added the MEA statement.Incidentally, China had last spoken of the 1959 line after troops had scuffled along the Pangong Lake in August 2017.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-again-rejects-chinas-1959-claim-line-148403

29-09-2020||New Delhi||Victims of Mumbai, Pathankot terror attacks are yet to get justice due to Pakistan’s unwillingness: India||India has said that the victims of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks and the 2016 Pathankot strike are yet to get justice because of the “unwillingness” and “non-cooperative” attitude of a particular country, in a clear reference to Pakistan.At a virtual ministerial meeting of the ‘Group of Friends of Victims of terrorism’, India has strongly pitched for concerted global actions to effectively deal with terrorism and said it continues to pose a critical threat to international peace and security even in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.Representing India at the meeting on Monday, Secretary (East) in the Ministry of External Affairs Vijay Thakur Singh also called for “redressing deficiencies” in the international efforts to ensure that perpetrators of terrorism are brought to justice.“I would like to highlight that, for example, the victims of 2008 Mumbai terror attack and 2016 Pathankot terror attack are yet to get justice. This is due to the unwillingness and non-cooperative attitude of a particular country,” Singh said.The meeting was organised by foreign ministers of Afghanistan and Spain, the two co-chairs of the grouping, and the UN office of Counter Terrorism (UNOCT).In her address, Singh said acts of terrorism not only violate the rights of individual victims but they also deeply affect the enjoyment of a range of rights by the families of the victims and society as a whole.“Even, amidst the ongoing pandemic, terrorism continues to pose a critical threat to international peace and security,” Singh said in an oblique reference to Pakistan.Notwithstanding the coronavirus pandemic, Pakistan has not stopped pushing terrorists to Jammu and Kashmir in the last few months, according to military officials.Singh also talked about the danger of terrorists stepping up the use of information and communication technology networks for propaganda and for issuing threats, further exacerbating the stress on victims of terror.She highlighted the pain and suffering of the innocent victims of terrorism across the world and said while terrorists can never succeed in achieving their “nefarious objectives”, they leave behind a trail of death and destruction.“Measures aimed at addressing the needs of the victims of terrorism, therefore, should factor in the sensitivities of these vulnerable sections of the society. Efforts should also be made to work with the victims to build a counter narrative against the hateful propaganda of terrorism,” she said.The Secretary (East) appreciated the UN for establishing August 21 as the ‘International Day of Remembrance of and Tribute to the Victims of Terrorism’, and hoped the UN would continue its work related to addressing the needs of victims of terrorism.

29-09-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt will last full term, no mid-term polls: Sanjay Raut||The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will complete its five-year term, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said on Tuesday while ruling out possibility of mid-term elections in the state.Raut told reporters that people of the state do not want polls now.His comment came a day after Maharashtra BJP president Chandrakant Patil said that “there will be no option if no combination works out”, while replying to a query on possibility of mid-term polls in the state.“Nobody wants mid-term polls. But one also cannot figure out a solution to instability. Hence, something may happen one fine morning. All will try to see nothing happens but if no combination works out, then there will be no option,” Patil had told reporters, adding that no party wanted polls now.Addressing media persons here, Raut sarcastically said the Election Commission, which announces poll schedule, might have given Patil “some responsibility” and the latter might be having more information in this regard.“But I take Chandrakant Patil’s comments positively. He said people of Maharashtra don’t want polls. I am also saying there should be no elections. Hence, the Thackeray government will run for five years and there will be no elections,” Raut said.To a question about former Bihar DGP Gupteshwar Pandey joining the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) after taking voluntary retirement last week, Raut said one has the right to join politics after resigning from service.“We had no personal enmity with Pandey saheb, who was Bihar DGP. We were against the statements made against Mumbai Police while he was on the post. You don’t insult the Mumbai Police,” Raut said.Pandey came under attack from leaders of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadai government after he sought a CBI probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death at a time when the Mumbai Police was investigating the matter.“Now, the CBI is here (investing the matter). The entire country is waiting to see what the CBI does in this case. I think Pandey too should wait for some time,” the Sena chief spokesperson said.He also asked news channels “which raised questions over Mumbai Polices probe” to now ask questions to the CBI.The central agency has been probing the actor’s death for over a month now.“Channels questioned us. They should now ask questions to the CBI, Pandey, Nitish Kumar,” he said, alleging the charges were part of a conspiracy to defame the Shiv Sena.The CBI on Monday said it had not reached any conclusion in the death of Rajput and that all aspects are under investigation.Asked whether the MVA government will not implement new farm laws, Raut said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is holding discussions on the issue with the NCP and Congress.“It is being discussed at the government’s level. Let the government talk about it,” the Rajya Sabha member said and added the Sena had opposed the Bills in Parliament during the monsoon session.Raut, whose meeting with BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis caused flutter last Saturday, said he will again meet the former chief minister to finalise the schedule for the latter’s interview (to Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’).He also said no discussion was held between himself and Fadnavis on upcoming Bihar Assembly elections during that meeting.“However, I expressed joy that a Maharashtra leader got charge of Bihar polls,” Raut recalled.He said Sena workers from Bihar wanted to contest the Assembly polls in the eastern state and added he will hold discussions with CM Thackeray, who heads the party, on the issue.

29-09-2020||New Delhi||Farm laws have to be opposed for country’s future: Rahul||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said the new farm laws would have to be opposed not just for farmers but for the future of the country, as he alleged that they were like a “stab in the farmers’ hearts”.Interacting with a group of farmers from across the country, he said the GST and the ‘notebandi’ were also attacks on farmers but these three laws would prove to be more detrimental.Gandhi also claimed that the new farm laws would foster an East India company-like culture and this time, a “West India company” had come in.“There is no difference between GST, noteban and these three laws. The only difference is that this is directly stabbing your heart with a knife,” he said during the virtual meeting with the group of farmers.“But I have clarity that this has to be opposed. Not for farmers, but for the future of India,” he told the farmers in a nearly 11-minute long video shared on social media.किसानों के दिल की आवाज़ #KisaanKiBaat https://t.co/zIklGplT9B  The Congress has opposed the new farm laws and party leaders and workers are protesting across the country, even as farmers' unions have launched a stir in Punjab and Haryana.“The voice of farmers has a lot of strength. It is with the help of this voice that India attained independence and once again India will become independent through the farmers’ voice,” Gandhi said.The former Congress chief said he had seen in Uttar Pradesh’s Bhatta Parsaul village during his ‘padyatra’ in 2011 that big businessmen wanted the farmers’ land as well as their farm produce.कृषि क़ानून हमारे किसानों के लिए मौत की सज़ा हैं। उनकी आवाज़ संसद के अंदर और बाहर कुचल दी गयी है।ये इस बात का प्रमाण है कि भारत में लोकतंत्र मर चुका है। pic.twitter.com/2q1fyQ4wiP  “The first fight I fought was of land acquisition and the entire media attacked me,” he said.“They said this is a fight against black money but it was not true. The purpose was to weaken our unorganised sector and the poor, farmers and labourers,” Gandhi alleged.Talking to him, Dhirender Kumar, a farmer from Champaran in Bihar, said farmers are being exploited in the name of these laws and they will be forced to commit suicide due to hunger.He said the 2006 bill abolishing the APMC Act in Bihar should be brought back and be implemented in the state once again.Ashok Bootra from Yavatmal in Maharashtra feared that no one would buy the farm produce at minimum support price (MSP).“I feel any farmer who protests will be put in jail. In 1840, the East India company used to put out the price of cotton from England and the entire world would buy at that rate. But the businessmen would know of the price in advance,” he said.“The way the East India Company used to do business, I feel the same pattern is being followed again. Farmers and small businessmen will be looted. When farmers will not get the rates for their produce, suicide rate will increase,” Bootra said.Replying to this, Gandhi said: “You want to say earlier it was East India Company, now a West India company has come in.”The Congress leader alleged that during the COVID-19 pandemic, money was being given to big businessmen instead of the poor.A farmer from Jhajjar said the farmers would not get anything in any case and they were just being “harassed”.“The government is trying to finish farmers, labourers and small businessmen,” he claimed.When Gandhi asked them about their future plans, Om Parkash Dhankar said: “We will sell everything and handover the entire system to big businessmen like Adani and Ambani, and we will have to do labour.”“They will bring back the British rule and will destroy the country as they are privatising everything,” he alleged.A farmer from Vashim in Maharashtra told the Congress leader that today if Mahatma Gandhi was alive, he would have opposed these laws.On being asked by Rahul Gandhi about the government's claims that the MSP system will not be discontinued, Sunil Singh, a farmer from Pathankot in Punjab said: “This is all ‘jumlebaazi’ and they are doing fraud with farmers.” “This party has been for the rich and it will never think about the poor or small farmers,” he alleged.

29-09-2020||New Delhi||Polls in Gilgit-Baltistan attempt to camouflage ‘illegal’ occupation of region by Pakistan: MEA||India on Tuesday said it has conveyed its strong protest to Pakistan over the announcement of elections to the “so-called Gilgit-Baltistan” legislative assembly next month, holding that the “cosmetic exercises” are intended to camouflage the "illegal" occupation of the region by Islamabad.The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said actions like holding of elections in the region can neither hide the “illegal occupation” of parts of Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh by Islamabad nor the “grave human rights violations and exploitation” of people in Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir.Pakistan has announced that elections for the legislative assembly of Gilgit-Baltistan will be held on November 15.“The government of India has conveyed its strong protest to the government of Pakistan and reiterated that the entire Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, including the areas of so-called Gilgit and Baltistan are an integral part of India by virtue of its accession in 1947,” the MEA said in a statement.The MEA said Pakistan has no locus standi on territories “illegally and forcibly occupied” by it.“Action such as these can neither hide the illegal occupation of parts of Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh by Pakistan nor the grave human rights violations, exploitation and denial of freedom to the people residing in Pakistan occupied territories for the past seven decades,” it said.“These are cosmetic exercises intended to camouflage its illegal occupation. We call upon Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation,” the MEA said.The MEA also asked Pakistan to immediately vacate all areas under its illegal occupation.In a ruling earlier this year, the Pakistan Supreme Court allowed Islamabad to amend a 2018 administrative order to conduct general elections in the region. The Gilgit-Baltistan Order of 2018 provided for administrative changes, including authorising the prime minister of Pakistan to legislate on an array of subjects.Following the verdict, India issued a demarche to a senior Pakistani diplomat here and lodged a strong protest over the apex court ruling.The polls in Gilgit-Baltistan were to be held on August 18, but Pakistan's election commission on July 11 postponed them due to the coronavirus pandemic.

29-09-2020||Lucknow||Special court set to pronounce verdict in Babri mosque demolition case on Wednesday||A special court here will deliver the much-awaited judgment on Wednesday in the 1992 Babri Masjid demolition case in which BJP veterans L K Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi are among the accused.CBI judge SK Yadav had on September 16 directed all the 32 surviving accused to remain present in the court on the day of the judgment.The accused include former deputy prime minister Advani, former Union ministers Joshi and Uma Bharti, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh, besides Vinay Katiyar and Sadhvi Rithambara.With both Bharti and Singh convalescing in separate hospitals after coronavirus infection, it was not immediately known if they would be present in the court at the time of pronouncement of order.Singh, during whose tenure as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh the disputed structure was demolished, was put on trial in September last year after his tenure as governor (of Rajasthan) came to an end.Champat Rai, the general secretary of the trust in charge of constructing the Ram temple, is also among those accused.With the Supreme Court setting August 31 as the deadline and later extending it by a month for the CBI court to give its verdict, the trial court started day-to-day hearing to complete the task in time.The central agency produced 351 witnesses and 600 documents as evidence before the court. Charges were framed against 48 people, but 17 have died during the course of trial.The trial under the serious criminal conspiracy charges commenced against them after having been dropped by the trial court in 2001. The verdict was upheld by the Allahabad High Court in 2010, but the apex court ordered restoration of the conspiracy charge against them on April 19, 2017.The top court ordered daily hearing in the high profile case and directed the special judge to conclude it in two years.The charge of conspiracy is in addition to the existing charges against them for promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion for which they are already facing trial.The accused are also facing charges of having made assertions "prejudicial to national integration and injuring or defiling a place of worship".The other charges against them include indulging in "deliberate and malicious" acts intended to outrage religious feelings, uttering statements leading to public mischief, rioting and unlawful assembly.The CBI argued that the accused conspired and instigated 'kar sevaks' to demolish the 16th century mosque.         But the accused pleaded innocence maintaining that there is no evidence to prove their guilt and claimed they were implicated by the then Congress government at the Centre as a political vendetta.The Babri Masjid was demolished in December 1992 by "kar sevaks" who claimed that the mosque in Ayodhya was built on the site of an ancient Ram temple.In a significant judgment last year, the Supreme Court allotted the disputed site in Ayodhya for construction of a Ram temple, while calling the demolition of the mosque a violation of the rule of law.An alternative five-acre site was marked in the city for building a mosque.Before the 2017 verdict of the apex court, two sets of cases were being heard in Lucknow and Raebareli.The trial of the first case involving unnamed 'kar  sevaks' was going on in a Lucknow court, while the second set of cases relating to the eight VVIPs, including Advani, Joshi, Vishnu Hari Dalmiya, Ashok Singhal, Katiyar, Uma Bharti, Giriraj Kishore and Sadhvi Ritambhara, were going on in a Raebareli court.The apex court, had while restoring the charge of criminal conspiracy, directed clubbing of two cases relating to the demolition and had also ordered that the trial be concluded in two years.

The state government has not yet taken a call on reopening the schools.

29-09-2020||Mumbai||Google doodle pays tribute to Zohra Sehgal||Google on Tuesday paid tributes to the legendary actor-dancer Zohra Sehgal by dedicating a special doodle to her that perfectly captures the screen icon's joie de vivre.On this day in 1946, "Neecha Nagar", starring Sehgal, was released at the Cannes Film Festival and won the Palme d'Or prize. The movie, according to Google is Indian cinema's first international critical success.Illustrated by guest artist Parvati Pillai, the doodle shows the late actor's sketch replacing the O of 'GOOGLE' and showing one of her iconic dance step from the song 'Jiya Jale' from Mani Ratnam-directed "Dil Se".Born on April 27, 1912 in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh in a traditional Muslim family, Sehgal grew up in Chakrata, Uttarakhand and was sent to Lahore for higher education.Sehgal started her career as a dancer with Uday Shankar in 1935. She had appeared in many Bollywood films as a character actor as well as in English language films besides television series and plays.Considered the doyenne of Indian theatre, Sehgal worked with Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA) and Prithviraj Kapoor's Prithvi Theatre for 14 years.She moved to London on a drama scholarship in 1962 and built an international profile with roles in British television classics “Doctor Who“ and “The Jewel in the Crown" among others.In the mid-1990s, she returned to India and continued acting on the stage and in Bollywood films.Sehgal went on to feature in hits like "Cheeni Kum", "Dil Se", "Veer Zaara", "Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam", "Bend It Like Beckham", among others.Her last big screen appearance was Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 2007 movie "Saawariya".As a dancer, she performed across Japan, Egypt, Europe and the US. She choreographed for a few Hindi films as well, including classics like Guru Dutt's "Baazi" and the dream sequence song in Raj Kapoor's film "Awaara".Sehgal was honoured with India's highest honours—the Padma Shri (1998), the Kalidas Samman (2001), and the Padma Vibhushan (2010)—for her contribution to art and cinema.She died in Delhi in 2014 at the age of 102.

29-09-2020||New Delhi||Delhi HC asks Centre about steps on Rakul’s complaint over media connecting her to Rhea drug case||The Delhi High Court asked the Centre, the Press Council of India (PCI) and National Broadcasting Association (NBA) on Tuesday as to what steps they had taken on its order to treat as a representation actor Rakul Preet Singh’s plea to stop media reports from connecting her with the Rhea Chakraborty drug case and take a decision on it.Justice Navin Chawla directed the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, the PCI and the NBA to file status reports indicating all steps taken by them pursuant to the court’s September 17 order to treat the contents of the actor’s petition as a representation.The court issued notice to them and sought their replies on a fresh application moved by the actor seeking interim directions to them to ensure that the media does not broadcast any programme or publish any article connecting her with the case.The court declined to pass any interim directions but asked the NBA to take up her representation on October 3.It also told the Ministry that merely because the probe in the drug case was “sensitive” or “at a crucial stage”, the government could not say it would not look into the alleged false reporting by the media.The court directed the Ministry, the PCI and the NBA to file their replies to the application and the status reports on action taken before the next date of hearing on October 15.The actor, in her application, has sought an interim order against the media till the time the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), Mumbai, completes the investigation in the drug case and files an appropriate report before the competent court.During the hearing via video conferencing, advocate Aman Hingorani, appearing for the actor, told the court that she was in Hyderabad for a film shoot and on the evening of September 23, she was shocked to see media reports that NCB has summoned her to appear before it in Mumbai the next morning in connection with the drug case.However, till then she had not received any summons either on her Hyderabad address or Mumbai address and remained in Hyderabad, he said.Subsequently, the media started running fake news to the effect that she reached Mumbai on September 23 evening for the NCB investigation and was holed up in her house, he argued in court.Hingorani also told the court that the media allegedly falsely reported that she named others in connection with the case and that she also told the NCB that she stocked and supplied drugs and was also a conduit.He said the media continued to allegedly maliciously broadcast and published fake news against her in relation to the case.The high court on September 17 had said the leaks to the media need to be investigated as “someone’s reputation is totally destroyed by this”.It had also expressed the hope that “media houses would show restraint in their reports and would abide by the cable TV regulations, programme code and various guidelines, statutory and self-regulatory while making any reports with regard to the petitioner”.The application has been filed in the main petition by the actor to stop media reports from connecting her with the Rhea Chakraborty drug case.In her petition, she has claimed that Chakraborty had already retracted the statement in which she was allegedly named and yet the media reports were connecting her to the drug case.The NCB probe has stemmed from the investigation into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death case.She has contended that based on unsubstantiated allegations defamatory programmes were being run in the media against her which was causing irreparable harm and injury to her.The petition had also alleged that the Ministry, the PCI and the NBA “have failed to discharge their statutory functions of ensuring compliance of their own directives, which has resulted in the flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of the petitioner”.

29-09-2020||New Delhi||Caught in worries of today, corona and health distant thoughts for pregnant daily-wagers||Carrying bricks and cement by day and jerry cans of water when their shifts get over, the workday continues without end for thousands of pregnant labourers forced to live life on the precipice with little time to spare on thoughts of what the future holds – for themselves or their unborn child.Uncertainty has always been a subtext of their lives and the pandemic has only sharpened it. But thoughts of COVID-19 and the risks of stepping out to work as the disease rages are a luxury for these women, many of them migrants eking out a precarious existence as construction workers hundreds of miles from home.Some like Marjina, who is seven months pregnant, have taken a loan to tide over the difficult times when jobs and money are both scarce, others like Lalitha, approaching full-term pregnancy, continue to work with truncated wages because they have no other choice.Living in slums that have come up in the shadows of the high-rise buildings they are helping construct in Raj Nagar Extension in Delhi’s satellite town of Ghaziabad, the women know that regular doctor visits and medical check-ups are not on the anvil at a time when even two square meals are difficult.They are lucky to just find work when they can, say the women, most in their 20s or even younger and in frail health after multiple pregnancies at a young age.Recounting her day, 27-year-old Marjina said she gets up earlier in the morning, cooks, finishes the household work and heads to the construction site with her eight-year-old daughter Marish and husband Mazru. The family eats just once a day.She gets tired but there is no option.“I have been working with my husband for six years. We always had two meals a day but can’t afford it anymore,” Marjina told PTI.While Marjina makes Rs 250 a day, her husband gets Rs 300.“We have cut down our meals to one a day because we have taken a loan from a relative and need to repay it,” she said.Living one day at a time as jobs dwindle, the women are forced to step up to help their husbands bring in money and there is little thought for what will happen tomorrow.Not far away from Marjina’s tenement is Lalitha’s home.Emblematic of the still widespread practice of girls being married when barely in their teens, Lalitha, just 18 years old, is nine months pregnant and already has two children.She would earn Rs 300 a day and her husband Sanjay Rs 450 before the pandemic struck. The money was sufficient to feed their family of four. Now a third child is on its way and the couple is frantic about how they will manage.Lalitha got an ultrasound done in the early days of the lockdown but the savings have dwindled as have the daily wages and the work. She goes to the construction site but sometimes there is no work.“I have not been going to work for the past several days. Lalitha may have to be taken to the hospital anytime. These days are so difficult for everyone so we can’t even borrow from anyone and the contractor refuses to advance us any,” said Sanjay helplessly.Life was anyway a struggle and the last few months have just made things so much worse, added Saroj who also lives close by. She is 25 and is expecting her fifth child.Malnourished and weak, Saroj, who is five months pregnant, said she and her husband Pappu together made almost Rs 25,000 a month as daily wage masons. After the lockdown in March, the money has been cut by almost 60 per cent and now there isn’t enough to eat.But Saroj goes to work gamely in the hope that a day’s work will get some money in.The last few months have extracted a terrible toll on the families of the labourers.Gudiya, 19, is six months pregnant and exhausted. Soon after the lockdown, she went to her village in Aligarh but there was no work so she returned to Ghaziabad.Her husband Ravi and she manage to work for about four days a week as construction labourers, earning about Rs 400 a day.“But there is no money for medicines and there are days we go to sleep hungry,” she said. The couple has one child.Their stories find echo several kilometres away in the Red Fort area in Old Delhi, not new and upcoming like Raj Nagar Extension but old and historic where generations have lived.Sukhwati, who will be expecting a baby in three months, works at a construction site in the area. While she earns Rs 300 a day, her husband Kashiram gets Rs 400.“It is getting difficult to survive. The contractor doesn’t give us enough work,” the 21-year-old from Bihar who is expecting her fourth child said.How will these young women, battling ill-health and already burdened with debt and worries about feeding their children cope when another baby comes along?

In contrast, a party which had been in power for long, and a family whose three-four generations had been at the helm, are feeling the pinch of being out of power for a few years, he said.Referring to the farm laws, he said they would free the farmers from middlemen and brokers as they give them the freedom to sell the produce in the open market. The MSP regime would simultaneously continue, he said. Those opposing the laws did not want the farmer to sell his produce in the open market, he said.Regarding the agitation against the laws, he said it was engineered by Congress leaders.He said Aatma Nirbhar Bharat is in the interest of the country, and would continue.He said the project to clean the Ganga during earlier governments had loopholes.Under the Jal Jeevan Mission, he announced a project to connect all schools and anganwadi centres in the country with piped water within 100 days. The six projects inaugurated by Modi are mainly new and upgraded sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Hardwar and Rishikesh, besides a museum on the Ganga at Chandi Ghat (Hardwar). The STPs have been planned keeping needs of Uttarakhand till 2035.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/those-opposing-farm-bills-dont-want-farmers-to-have-freedom-of-selling-produce-in-open-market-modi-148351

She died at a hospital in Delhi where she was undergoing treatment on Tuesday morning.“A Dalit girl, who was a victim of demoniac behaviour in Hathras, has passed away at Safdarjung Hospital.

29-09-2020||Palghar||Maharashtra: Palghar district on alert over Congo fever||The Palghar administration on Tuesday asked authorities to remain alert against a possible spread of the Congo fever in the Maharashtra district.The Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), commonly known as the Congo fever, spreads in humans through ticks.The district administration said in the wake of the outbreak of COVID-19, this is a matter of concern for cattle- breeders, meat-sellers and animal husbandry officials, and it is necessary to take timely precautions as there is no specific and useful treatment for the CCHF.Palghar animal husbandry department's deputy commissioner Dr Prashant D Kamble in a circular said the CCHF has been found in some districts of Gujarat, and is likely to spread to border districts of Maharashtra.Palghar is close to Gujarat's Valsad district.The department has instructed authorities to take all necessary precautions and implement preventive measures."This viral disease is transmitted from one animal to another by a specific type of tick...the disease is transmitted to humans through contact with the blood of infected animals and by eating the meat of infected animals," the circular said."If the disease is not diagnosed and treated in time, 30 per cent of patients die," it said.The CCHF is a widespread disease caused by a tick- borne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family. The virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10 to 40 per cent, as per the World Health Organisation (WHO).There is no vaccine available for either people or animals against the disease, it said.Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons.Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilisation of medical equipment, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies, according to the WHO.PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-palghar-district-on-alert-over-congo-fever-148347
29-09-2020||Aditi Tandon||Amnesty ends India operations over 'govt reprisal'||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, September 29In a sudden move on Tuesday morning, Amnesty announced the halting of India operations over what it called reprisal by the government.Amnesty said the government has frozen its bank accounts bringing the organisation to a grinding halt.“The complete freezing of Amnesty International India’s bank accounts by the Government of India, which it came to know on September 10, 2020, brings all the work being done by the organisation to a grinding halt. The organisation has been compelled to let go of staff in India and pause all its ongoing campaign and research work,” Amnesty said in a statement.It alleged that freezing of bank accounts was the latest among incessant witch-hunts of human rights organisations by the Government over unfounded and motivated allegations.“The continuing crackdown on Amnesty International India over the last two years and the complete freezing of bank accounts is not accidental. The constant harassment by government agencies including the Enforcement Directorate is a result of our unequivocal calls for transparency in the government, more recently for accountability of the Delhi police and the Government of India regarding the grave human rights violations in Delhi riots and Jammu and Kashmir. For a movement that has done nothing but raise its voices against injustice, this latest attack is akin to freezing dissent,” said Avinash Kumar, Executive Director of Amnesty International India.Amnesty International India said it stood in full compliance with all applicable Indian and international laws.“For human rights work in India, it operates through a distinct model of raising funds domestically. More than four million Indians have supported Amnesty International India’s work in the last eight years and around 1,00,000 Indians have made financial contributions,” said the NGO claiming that these contributions evidently cannot have any relation with the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010. “The fact that the Government is now portraying this lawful fundraising model as money-laundering is evidence that the overbroad legal framework is maliciously activated when human rights activists and groups challenge the government’s grave inactions and excesses,” Amnesty said.The halt of Amnesty operations comes days after the Parliament passed the FCRA Act making conditions for working and funding of NGOs receiving foreign contributions more stringent and mandating submission of Aadhar identifications by all NGO office bearers in case they need licences to get foreign funds.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/amnesty-ends-india-operations-over-govt-reprisal-148346

He was admitted to a hospital on September 27 and had tested positive for COVID-19," State Surveillance Officer, Dr Lobsang Jampa said.Nine Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) personnel and three Army men are among the new patients, he said.Four prisoners in West Siang district and a health worker in Lower Subansiri also contracted the disease, he said.The Capital Complex region reported the highest number of new cases at 117, followed by Papumpare (86), West Siang (24) and Lower Siang (21), the official said.As many as 97 more people were cured of the disease and discharged from hospitals, taking the recovery rate among COVID-19 patients in the state to 70.63 per cent, he said.Arunachal Pradesh now has 2,725 active coronavirus cases, while 6,592 people have been cured of the disease so far, the official said.The Capital Complex region, comprising Itanagar, Naharlagun, Nirjuli and Banderdewa areas, has the highest number of active coronavirus cases at 1,446, followed by Papumpare (221), West Siang (145), Changlang (130) and East Siang (100), he said.A total of 2,42,948 samples have been tested for COVID-19 so far, including 3,048 on Monday, Jampa added.

29-09-2020||Mumbai||Rhea, Showik ‘active members of drug syndicate’: NCB to HC||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has opposed the bail pleas filed by actress Rhea Chakraborty and her brother Showik Chakraborty in the Bombay High Court following their arrest in a drugs case related to actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death.The siblings were “active members of a drug syndicate that was connected with high society personalities and drug suppliers”, the NCB said in an affidavit filed before the HC on Monday.The NCB further said both Rhea Chakraborty and her brother had “abetted and financed” drug transactions.Therefore, the agency had booked them under the stringent Section 27A of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, it said in the affidavit.Section 27A provides punishment for up to 10 years for financing drug trafficking and harbouring offenders and also carries a bar on the grant of bail.On previous hearings, the actress and her brother opposed the application of the above section in their case.Their counsel Satish Maneshinde last week argued that the section did not apply in the present case as Rhea Chakraborty occasionally paid for drugs that were consumed only by her boyfriend, late actor Sushant Singh Rajput.He had further argued that the drugs seized by the NCB so far in the case amounted to just 59 grams, which wasn’t a commercial quantity, therefore, Section 27A should not be applied in their case.On September 24, a bench of Justice Sarang Kotwal suggested that the NCB file its reply to the bail pleas of Rhea Chakraborty and her brother, who were arrested earlier this month and are currently in judicial custody.The court had also said that the NCB must elaborate on the provisions of Section 27A and its applicability in the present case.NCB’s zonal director Sameer Wankhede on Monday submitted two separate affidavits in the HC wherein it said: “Electronic evidence such as WhatsApp chats, records were retrieved from mobile, laptop and hard-disk and it indicated payment made for drugs.”“Thus, there is ample evidence to show present applicant Rhea has not only regularly dealt with but also financed illicit trafficking of drugs,” the NCB said.The NCB further said in the affidavit that Rhea Chakraborty was aware of the fact that Rajput was into the consumption of drugs and yet she had “harboured and concealed” it.“This would tantamount to harbouring. Rhea also allowed her residence for drug storage and consumption by Rajput,” the affidavit said.“It is clear from the statements and electronic evidence gathered by the NCB that the applicant is an active member of the drug syndicate connected with high society personalities and drug suppliers. There is sufficient evidence that she is involved in drug trafficking,” it said.It also said that Rhea Chakraborty and her brother used to facilitate drug deliveries and payment through credit cards, cash and other payment gateways.If the siblings were released on bail, they could hamper the probe that is currently in a “crucial stage”, the NCB said.The high court will hear the bail pleas of the actress and her brother along with the bail pleas of co-accused Samuel Miranda, Abdul Parihar and Dipesh Sawant on Tuesday.Rajput (34) was found hanging in his home in suburban Bandra on June 14.

Our defence forces are prepared for any eventuality as you are aware,” the Chief of Air Staff said.Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria said the recent induction of Rafale jets along with previous acquisitions of C-17 Globemaster aircraft as well as Chinook and Apache helicopters had provided the IAF with substantial tactical and strategic capability enhancement.“Airpower will be a crucial enabler in our victory in any future conflict. It is, therefore, imperative that IAF obtains and maintains a technological edge over our adversaries,” he said at the conference on energising the Indian aerospace industry.Five French-made multi-role Rafale fighter jets were inducted into the IAF on September 10.The fleet has been carrying out sorties in eastern Ladakh in the last couple of weeks.The IAF chief also said that the raising of two squadrons of light combat aircraft Tejas and integration of some indigenous weapons on Su-30 MKI combat jets in a very reduced time frame had been the “most promising” development, reflecting the country’s capabilities to develop indigenous military hardware.

29-09-2020||Bhopal||IPS officer like father, calls me 'beta', says news anchor||The news anchor of a regional TV channel here has filed a police complaint against the wife and son of an IPS officer, accusing them of tarnishing her reputation.Purushottam Sharma, a 1986 batch IPS officer, was transferred following a viral video which showed him thrashing his wife, soon after she confronted him at the anchor's flat.The anchor submitted a complaint against Sharma's wife and son at the Shahpura police station, and claimed that the IPS officer is "like a father" to her and calls her 'beta'."The complaint states that her privacy and image has suffered a lot in the society and caused disrepute to her name," Shahpura police station in-charge Jitendra Patel said.The anchor has demanded that police take appropriate action in the matter and protect her from undergoing "mental torture.""As I am associated with journalism, I keep meeting officials and politicians quite often," she said in her complaint."On Sunday (September 27), DG Purushottam Sharma called me around 7 pm, saying he is near my place (residence), so I invited him over for a cup of tea," she said.The anchor said some time later, Sharma's wife also reached her flat and rang the doorbell. "I dont know her but I opened the door out of courtesy, after which she forcibly entered the flat," she added.Sharma and his wife had a fight, after which the IPS officer went out of the house," she said.She claimed that Sharmas wife stayed back and asked her "unnecessary questions" and also made a video-recording of her bedroom, which was made viral on social media by Sharma's son, making "baseless allegations" against her."DG Saab (Sharma) is like my father and he used to call me 'beta'," the anchor said."I never realised that his coming to my home for a cup of tea will become such a big issue. It has tarnished my image and compromised my privacy," she said in the complaint.The police station in-charge said that as this is a matter of causing disrepute to someones image, a complaint can be filed only in court.The order to remove Sharma from the post of Director Public Prosecution and transfer him to the state secretariat without assigning him any post was issued by the state home department Under Secretary Annu Bhalavi on Monday."Two videos related to you went viral on social media in which prima facie you are seen engaging in immoral behaviour and domestic violence with your wife," a show-cause notice issued by Bhalavi to Sharma had said."Your actions are in violation of the All India Services rules and therefore, you are directed to give your clarification on why disciplinary action should not be taken against you for your acts," it had said.The government has asked Sharma to submit his reply by 5.30 pm on Tuesday, failing which it will be construed that he doesn't have any response to file and accordingly action will be initiated against him, the order said.Sharma's son Parth, a deputy commissioner in the Income Tax Department, sent the video to state Home Minister Narottam Mishra and some senior bureaucrats, and requested that a complaint be registered against his father.Sharma, who has been married for 32 years, had said, "This is a family matter, not a crime...I am not a criminal.My wife stalks me wherever I go. I am dealing with this." The state women's commission has summoned Sharma on October five and also directed it to provide security to his wife.

29-09-2020||Mumbai||NCB denies producer Kshitij Ravi Prasad's claim of 'physical ill treatment'||The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) on Monday denied ill-treating arrested drugs case accused Kshitij Ravi Prasad, a former Dharmatic Entertainment executive producer, in its custody.The drug law enforcement agency termed the allegations in this regard as "mischievous and completely untrue".In a press release, the NCB said it has come across a news item, purportedly quoting Satish Maneshinde, the advocate for Prasad, about the accused being "ill-treated" in its custody.Prasad was arrested by the NCB on Saturday after questioning in drugs case linked to Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death.On Sunday, a city court remanded Prasad, a former executive producer at Dharmatic Entertainment (sister concern of filmmaker Karan Johar's Dharma Productions), in the NCB's custody till October 3.The news item alleged humiliation and mistreatment of Prasad at the hands of NCB officers."It is very unambiguously stated here that the news item in circulation is mischievous and completely untrue. The NCB arrested Prasad as some incriminating evidences were recovered from him."When the involvement of Prasad in offences under the NDPS Act was revealed, he was placed under arrest after following due process of law. His lawyer and his family (mother) were informed as per procedure," the release said.He was also allowed to meet his wife and father-in-law at the NCB office in south Mumbai, the central agency said."As Prasad was not cooperating with the investigation, this fact was brought to the notice of the court with a request to grant NCB custody on Sunday when he was produced for remand after a medical check-up. He was sent to the NCB custody till October 3," the release said.The court has observed in its order on Sunday that no physical ill-treatment has been given to the accused, it said and quoted from the judge's observation."From the submission of the accused, it reveals that, no physical ill-treatment (was) given to him during the course of his custody with the NCB authority."Furthermore, he has no complaint about the physical ill-treatment," the NCB release said, quoting from the court observation.The NCB reiterates that the allegations circulating in the news item are baseless and devoid of any truth, the release said.Prasad's name had cropped up during the NCB's wider probe into the alleged Bollywood-drugs nexus.The probe agency had told the court on Sunday that Prasad, in his statement, said he had procured drugs from co- accused Karamjeet Singh Anand and his associates.

Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent Parliament from enacting any law with respect to the same matter, including a law adding to, amending, varying or repealing the law so made by the state legislature," Ramesh said.The Congress feels it has a solid legal ground to go against the farm laws as agriculture, marketing and pricing are listed as state subjects in the seventh schedule of the Constitution. — TNSSidhu holds function at ancestral villageSangrur: Navjot Sidhu, MLA, held another function at his ancestral village Manwala in Sangrur.

29-09-2020||New Delhi||MoD tweaks purchase rules, drops offset clause for deals||Less than a week after the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) slammed the existing offset policy for foreign military equipment makers, the Ministry of Defence has altered the policy for certain categories of purchases.The “offset policy”, introduced in 2005, required foreign suppliers to reinvest a certain percentage – usually 30 per cent — of the deal into the Indian market.The new Defence Acquisition Policy (DAP-2020) announced on Monday removed the need for reinvesting for three types of purchases. The policy comes into force from October 1 and will apply to future deals.Purchases exempt from offset policyDirector General, Acquisitions, Apurva Chandra told mediapersons: “All government-to-government deals, all inter-governmental agreements (IGAs) and purchases made when there was a single vendor will be exempted from the offset policy.”The CAG in its report on September 23 had said “it did not find a single case where the foreign vendor had transferred high technology to the Indian industry. Thus, the objectives of the offset policy remain largely unachieved”.The new DAP will also allow the armed forces to take military equipment from global or Indian suppliers on lease. “This opens new avenues and will meet operational requirements and save huge capital investment,” Chandra said. Also, the parameters of buying new equipment called “staff qualitative requirement” will be made more realistic after seeing what all is available globally and domestically. The DAP has been aligned with the Atmanirbhar Bharat vision, the Ministry of Defence said. — TNS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/mod-tweaks-purchase-rules-drops-offset-clause-for-deals-148108
29-09-2020||---||India inks 1st green pact with Denmark||New Delhi, September 28India and Denmark on Monday decided to elevate their bilateral ties to a “green strategic partnership”, the first of its kind, during a virtual summit between Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Mette Frederiksen.Niche pollution control solutions being offered by Denmark include those to curb stubble burning. “Danish companies are already talking to Indian companies to take it forward,” said MEA’s Joint Secretary (Central Europe).PM Modi in his address indicated that Indian expectations from Denmark went well beyond pollution control initiatives and partnerships. Mentioning the extensive reforms in the manufacturing, labour, regulatory and taxation sectors, he recalled Denmark’s constant attendance at the Vibrant Gujarat Summit since 2009 and cautioned against the risks of overdependence on a single source.The Covid-19 pandemic showed the risk involved in excessive dependence of the global supply chain on any single source. —Narendra Modi, PMThe PM then spoke of virtual conferences with India, Japan, Australia and France to diversify supply chains and invited other like-minded democracies to join this endeavour.PM Modi observed that India and Denmark could set up energy parks where a large number of Danish companies were present. India had recently intensified its conversation with Denmark and the groundwork for this summit was laid during talks between the two Foreign Ministers in January, followed up with more online interactions.India & Denmark have agreed to collaborate in several sectors on basis of an action plan that will set targets for next few years. —Mette Frederiksen, Denmark PMBesides tapping Denmark for technology and manufacturing, another reason for India’s attempt to build closer ties is strategic. Denmark is a leading player in the group of five Nordic countries — Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland — which, like Russia, are interested in the opportunities in the Arctic Sea.Denmark is the only Nordic country that has made a maritime foray in the Straits of Hormuz along with seven other countries with active assistance from the UAE with which India enjoys close ties.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/india-inks-1st-green-pact-with-denmark-148169
