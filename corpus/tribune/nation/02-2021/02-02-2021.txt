Both the Centre and the EPFO had filed petitions requesting the top court to review its decision.On Friday, a Bench headed by Justice Uday U Lalit allowed the review petitions and decided to reconsider the previous order that permitted grant of Provident Fund pension proportionate to salary.The Bench posted the matter for preliminary hearing on February 25 when it will hear all the parties and examine afresh the 2018 Kerala High Court judgement requiring the organisation to pay full pension to retiring employees on the basis of their total salary instead of capping the amount on which a pensioner’s contribution is calculated at Rs 15,000 a month.The High Court had then noted that some workers made more contributions voluntarily towards the EPFO but their pension calculation was on Rs 15,000 salary ceiling, which was not fair on workers post their retirement.Attorney General KK Venugopal and senior advocate CA Sundaram, representing the Centre and the EPFO respectively, questioned the legality and viability of the High Court verdict.The Kerala High Court’s verdict wasn’t implemented as the matter was pending before the top court.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-recalls-2019-order-on-higher-pension-for-employees-206987

The accused/applicant is proper person to explain the meaning therefore, face to face investigation is required to be necessary,” Judge Bhosale said in his order.The court also noted that the investigation in the case was ongoing and that there was a possibility of tampering of evidence if Dasgupta was let out on bail.Earlier in the day, Dasgupta’s counsels Abad Ponda and Shardul Singh told the high court that the former BARC CEO suffered from a spinal problem and needed a medical attention.“He (Dasgupta) is not dying but it (health) is precarious and he needs a medical attention,” Ponda said.Special Public Prosecutor Shishir Hire, however, asked the HC to grant some time since he was appointed to the case only on Monday.He told the high court that a similar bail plea filed by Dasgupta was pending hearing in the Supreme Court.Dasgupta’s counsels, however, assured a bench presided over by Justice PD Naik that they will not go ahead with the plea in the apex court.Justice Naik took the statement on record and adjourned the hearing till February 9.Dasgupta had told the HC last week that Arnab Goswami was the prime accused in this scam.Last month, Dasgupta had been rushed to the state-run JJ hospital in Mumbai from the Taloja prison in Navi Mumbai, after his blood sugar levels went up and he fell unconscious.He was discharged from the hospital ICU on the evening of January 22.Following his discharge, Dasgupta’s lawyers had moved the HC seeking an urgent hearing on his bail plea. ---PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/ex-barc-ceo-partho-dasgupta-mastermind-of-trp-scam-court-206976
02-02-2021||New Delhi||No decision on countrywide roll-out of NRC, MHA tells parliamentary panel||The Centre has not taken any decision on the roll-out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) for the whole country, the Ministry of Home Affairs has told a parliamentary panel."It has been clarified at various levels in government time and again that till now no decision has been taken to create National Register of Indian citizen," the ministry told the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs headed by Congress leader Anand Sharma, according to a report tabled in Parliament on Tuesday.The update of the NRC was carried out in Assam to identify bona fide Indian citizens living in the state but the initiative had created a nationwide uproar.A total of 3.3 crore people in Assam had applied to be included in it. Of them, 3.11 crore have been included in the document and 19.06 could not find place in the NRC, according to the final report published in August 2019.There were statements by several BJP leaders seeking a nationwide roll-out of the NRC.The parliamentary committee had earlier observed that there was a lot of dissatisfaction and fear among the people regarding the National Population Register (NPR) and Census.In the action taken by the government on the committee recommendations with regard to the fear associated with the National Population Register (NPR) and Census, the Home Ministry said all individual-level information collected in Census are confidential.In Census, only aggregated data are released at various administrative levels. Like the earlier censuses, wide publicity measures would be taken up for creating proper awareness among public so as to conduct and complete the Census 2021 successfully.The ministry said questionnaires for Census along with that of the NPR had been tested at drive conducted successfully across the country.The committee was also of the view that Aadhaar data should be used in the upcoming Census to reduce the duplicity and wastage of expenditure. To this, the government has replied that the NPR and Aadhaar were separate exercises with the former collecting more detailed data."Aadhaar number has been developed as a separate database which is being used only for de-duplication purpose and authentication of beneficiaries of various government schemes," said the Home Ministry.The committee in its final observation noted that Aadhaar already has biometric information of the individuals and so the already stored Aadhaar metadata of the individuals may be used in creating a family database for the upcoming Census.

An induced cyclonic circulation also lies over central Pakistan and adjoining west Rajasthan.These systems are likely to affect weather over northwest Himalayan region from the night of February 2.“The confluence of southwesterlies, in association with the western disturbance and lower level southeasterlies, are very likely over the plains of northwest and adjoining areas of central India during February 3-5,” the IMD said.Under the influence of above systems, scattered to fairly widespread, light to moderate rain/snow with isolated thunderstorm, lightning and hail (is) very likely over the western Himalayan region from February 2 night to February 5.“Isolated heavy rainfall/snowfall is likely over Jammu and Kashmir on February 3 and 4, and over Himachal Pradesh on February 4,” the IMD said.Fairly widespread light to moderate rain/thundershowers with isolated lightning and hailstorm are likely over plains of northwest India during February 3 to 5, over Madhya Pradesh from February 4 to 5 and over east Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand from February 5 to 6. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/parts-of-north-and-central-india-to-witness-rains-from-february-3-to-5-imd-206961
02-02-2021||Vijay Mohan||CSIR develops hybrid solar-biodiesel power plant for renewable energy in remote areas||Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, February 2The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has developed an off-grid solar and biodiesel hybrid power plant that could pave the way for small scale renewable energy generation for uninterrupted power in remote areas, villages and hilly areas.A prototype of the system, having a peak capacity of 50kW, has been installed at the CSIR’s Centre of Excellence for Farm Machinery in Ludhiana for providing round the clock power.Currently, major share of the installed power capacity of the country comes from fossil fuel sources like coal, which have serious implications on country's energy security and environmental pollution. These high power centralised generation systems also warrant heavy investment on expensive transmission and distribution infrastructure leading to higher transmission losses.Prof Harish Hirani, Director, Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CMERI) said that in this scenario, localised and region specific distributed generation systems like mini-grids with small scale renewable sources could be potential generators of electricity located near the load centers and can help in addressing energy needs of local communities.The Centre of Excellence for Farm Machinery is a part of the CMERI.In addition, solar-biodiesel hybrid mini-grid system developed at the CMERI also has application in smart city projects because of their inherent features like integration of different sources. Unlike in rural areas, power requirement of domestic loads in cities are higher along with huge fluctuations due to varied usage patterns, making the power balancing a challenging issue.Besides providing power for domestic consumption, it is also being used to run 5hp and 10hp agricultural pumps. Other sources of energy like wind energy and biogas can also be integrated into this system.Experiments were conducted at Centre of Excellence for Farm Machinery during different times of day, month and in various seasons to understand the performance of the developed system under different conditions of load and solar radiation.Both solar photovoltaic and biodiesel are renewable in nature and can help in reducing pollution. Solar photovoltaic systems installed in the form of solar trees occupy considerably less land, which is of great advantage in urban areas.The recently developed fully automatic biodiesel plant, which has a capacity of one tonne per day, while running for right hours can produce biodiesel from feedstock such as waste vegetable oil, used cooking oil, animal tallow, etc. This type of system also helps in local employment generation.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/csir-develops-hybrid-solar-biodiesel-power-plant-for-renewable-energy-in-remote-areas-206956

Presently, out of the total given coverage of 81.35 crore persons under the NFSA, around 80 crore beneficiaries are receiving their entitled quota of foodgrains through public distribution system (PDS) on monthly basis.“The Department in association with State/UT Governments is implementing ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ (ONORC) plan for nation-wide portability of ration cards under the National Food Security Act, 2O13 (NFSA) “So far, the facility has been enabled in 32 states/UTs covering nearly 69 crore beneficiaries, almost 86% of NFSA population of the country,” Minister of State for Food and Consumer Affairs Danve Raosaheb Dadarao said in a written question to the Lok Sabha.Under the ONORC plan, beneficiaries can lift their entitled foodgrains from any ePoS (electronic Point of sale device) enabled Fair Price Shop (FPS) of their choice by using their same/existing ration cards with biometric authentication on the ePoS device at the time of lifting the foodgrains through portability.“No direction has been given to states/UTs for issuance of new ration cards to beneficiaries under ONORC. However, for the sake of uniformity under ONORC operations, States/UTs have been advised to adopt a standard bi-lingual format for ration cards whenever they decide to issue/print new ration cards under NFSA in the future,” he said.The Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) under NFSA is operated under the joint responsibilities of the central and state/UT Governments. States are responsible for identification of eligible beneficiaries under NFSA, issuance of ration cards to them, lifting of foodgrains from the designated depots, distribution to ration card holders as per their entitlements through ration shops, the minister said.On Monday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said: “I am happy to inform you that One Nation One Ration Card plan is under implementation by 32 states and UTs, reaching about 69 crores beneficiaries – that’s a total of 86% beneficiaries covered. The remaining 4 states and UTs will be integrated in the next few months.” PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/as-many-as-32-states-uts-implementing-one-nation-one-ration-card-206945

02-02-2021||Mumbai||'Illegal' merger of flats by Kangana: Bombay HC continues interim protection||The Bombay High Court on Tuesday continued an interim order passed by a lower court restraining the Mumbai civic body from taking action against alleged irregularities at actor Kangana Ranaut's flats here till February 5.The high court directed her to inform by that date if she would apply to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) seeking regularisation of alleged unauthorised changes.The BMC in March 2018 had issued a notice to Ranaut for alleged illegal merger of three flats owned by her at Orchid Breeze building in suburban Khar.The Dindoshi civil court dismissed her suit against the notice in December 2020, so she moved the high court.The civil court, while dismissing the suit, had noted that there was "grave violation of the sanctioned plan" while amalgamating the three flats.The actor's lawyer Birendra Saraf on Tuesday told the high court that "vendetta" was being pursued against her. The illegal construction had been made by the developer and not Ranaut, he contended.Senior counsel Aspi Chinoy and advocate Joel Carlos, appearing for the BMC, argued that there were at least eight irregularities in the flat.  Advocate Saraf then told the court that he would take instructions from the actor on whether she was willing to approach the BMC seeking regularization. In the meanwhile, the court should grant her protection from any coercive action, he said.The high court asked BMC lawyers if there was any bar for regularization. Advocate Chinoy said an application for regularisation is normally filed within 30 days from receiving the notice.  "In this case, she is already three years late. But the court can condone the delay," the lawyer said.The court then adjourned the hearing to Friday.  "The civil court order dated December 22, 2020, shall remain in abeyance until February 5 and the interim order (about not taking coercive action) shall continue till then," the court said.Ranaut's petition said since she bought the flats in 2013 she had not made any structural changes. She had carried out only "certain cosmetic changes", said the appeal filed through advocates Aseem Naphade, Monisha Bhangale and Prasanna Bhangale.Last year, the BMC had initiated demolition of alleged unauthorised construction at Ranaut's bungalow in Pali Hill area. The high court held the BMC's action illegal and malicious. --- PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/illegal-merger-of-flats-by-kangana-bombay-hc-continues-interim-protection-206937

The people in Telangana were expecting the setting up of a Turmeric Board that has repeatedly been promised by the BJP.After going through the fine print of the budget, local politicians find nothing of substance in it for the two Telugu states. Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (KCR) has been at loggerhead with the centre on various issues, including the release of central funds to the state. During his recent visit to Delhi, he unsuccessfully prevailed upon the centre to release Rs 5,000 crore towards flood relief to compensate people for the loss during rains and floods in October 2020.Andhra Pradesh to views it being ignored in terms of any new projects or funds for development to the see-saw relationship between the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) chief and Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy. BJP is aligning itself with actor turned politician Pawan Kalya and his Janna Sena Party.Among the Southern States, Nirmala Sitharaman allocated Rs 65,000 crore for road and highway projects in Kerala and Tamil Nadu got 3,500 km of National Highway at an investment of Rs 1.03 lakh crore. But infrastructure development for the Telugu states is missing. Telangana has been demanding industrial corridors between Hyderabad-Nagpur, Hyderabad-Warangal and Hyderabad-Ramagundam and also seeking support for the Pharma City and the Warangal Textile Park, but none of this finds mention in the budget.TRS Member of Legislative Council (MLC) Kavitha Kalvakuntla, who is also the daughter of the state chief minister said she was disappointed with the fact that Telangana has been completely ignored. Even otherwise she said she was hoping that the budget benefit those who have been most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns. But this has not happened the way it was expected.Telangana has written several letters to the Union ministers in the recent past seeking allocations for various projects proposed or undertaken by the state. But none of these finds any mention or allocation in the budget.At the same time, the Telangana Congress chief Uttam Kumar Reddy said: “BJP was misusing public exchequer for political gains. More allocations were made for election-bound states while other states were totally neglected”.“BJP government has failed to ensure equitable distribution of resources among all states. This is a wrong practice and if it continues, then all states will get new projects and funds only during election years,” he added.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/telugu-states-accuse-the-centre-of-discrimination-in-budget-206934

Both were arrested from Millennium Park, Outer Ring Road.Ashok Pradhan has an ongoing rivalry with Neeraj Bawana (in jail) and his gang. In this feud, over a dozen persons have been killed in the last 10 years.“Ashok Pradhan’s current obsession was eliminating Neeraj Bawana and his associate Naveen Bali, both of whom are presently in jail, on one of their upcoming court appearances. Since after implementation of the COVID-19 protocols, physical appearances of undertrial prisoners have been stopped, the accused were waiting for its resumption which has just begun.The timely apprehension of these dreaded criminals has scuttled their plans and saved many lives,” said Manishi Chandra, DCP Special Cell.Ashok Pradhan joined neutralised gangsters Neetu Daboda and Kismat in 2001. He marked his arrival on the big crime stage with the murder of a village head in Bahadurgarh, Haryana, closely followed by the murder of a doctor in Bahadurgarh city.Both these murders were executed on the orders of Neetu Daboda and were contract killings. Thereafter he went on a crime spree with Neetu Daboda, Kismat and others and was named in a number of criminal cases including contract killings, murders and kidnapping for ransom.In 2004, while he was behind bars, his brother was murdered by his rival Rajeev, a resident of Ashoda in Haryana. After obtaining bail, Ashok Pradhan eliminated Rajeev and many of his associates one by one. He was again arrested, tried and sentenced for life.In 2009, he got out on parole. After the neutralisation of his mentor Neetu Daboda by the Special Cell in 2013, he took over the reigns of Neetu’s gang and transformed it into the infamous ‘Pradhan gang’.In 2016, he murdered Krishan, a resident of Barahi village of Haryana, who had murdered his second mentor Kismat.After obtaining bail again he went off the police radar and owing to his continued criminal activities a reward of Rs 5,00,000 was  put on his head in Haryana and of Rs 25,000 in Delhi.In the last four months of the previous year, he had masterminded the murder of Neeraj Bawana’s gang member Shakti in October 2020. He also plotted the murder of Rohit, an associate of gangster Kala Jhathedi, in Katewra village in Bawana, Delhi in December 2020. — IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/delhi-haryanas-most-wanted-gangster-finally-falls-in-police-net-206933

The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act has similar provisions.Pointing out that more than 125 countries have a uniform age of marriage for men and women and the National Human Rights Commission—pursuant to the 2018 National Conference on Child Marriage—had also recommended a uniform marriage age for both men and women, Upadhyay urged the top court to declare 21 years to be the minimum age for marriage in India.“The distinction is based on patriarchal stereotypes, has no scientific backing, perpetrates de jure and de facto inequality against women, and goes completely against the global trends,” Upadhyay submitted.The differential bar discriminated against women and contravened the fundamental principles of gender equality, gender justice and dignity of women and offended Articles 14, 15 and 21 (right to equality, right to non-discrimination and right to life and liberty) of the Constitution and international conventions, he said.Contending that a uniform minimum age of marriage for both men and women’ was necessary to “secure gender justice, gender equality and dignity of women”, Upadhyay said he wanted the top court to give an authoritative pronouncement in order to “avoid multiplicity of litigations and conflicting views”.In August 2019, the Delhi High Court had issued notice to the Centre and the Law Commission on his petition demanding uniform marriage age for men and women.Last year, the Rajasthan High Court had asked the Centre and some other parties to respond to a similar PIL filed by one Abdul Mannan.Upadhyay urged the top court to direct the Centre to take appropriate steps to remove the anomalies in the minimum age of marriage and make it “gender neutral, religion neutral and uniform for all citizens” in spirit of the fundamental rights of equality and right to life and International conventions.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/uniform-age-for-marriage-sc-notice-to-centre-on-pil-for-transfer-of-petitions-pending-in-hcs-206930

The police, however, were not helping her, she alleged.“The cops told me that they were looking for my daughter. Sometimes they would shoo me away and cast aspersions on my daughter’s character.

She said she had borrowed money from relatives for the purpose.After video clips of Gudia describing her ordeal went viral, the Kanpur police tweeted saying the police post in-charge under whose jurisdiction the case of Gudia’s missing daughter was registered had been removed.

02-02-2021||New Delhi||India showing declining trend of COVID cases; deaths per million higher than S Asian nations due to multiple factors: Govt||The country is showing a declining trend of COVID-19 cases since the past four months and compared to similarly placed nations, the cases and deaths per million population in India is among the lowest, the government told Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey was responding to a question on the reasons for exponential multiplication of coronavirus cases in the country and whether there was a wrong approach at the initial stage by the government in focusing on testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine management.“The country is showing a declining trend of COVID 19 cases since the past four months. Recovery rate and case fatality rate for the country is 96.94 per cent and 1.44 per cent respectively. Compared to similarly placed countries, the cases and deaths per million population in India is among the lowest (7,778 cases and 112 deaths per million population),” he said in a written reply.The government’s strategy of focusing on testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine-containment was the fundamental approach for managing infectious disease outbreaks of epidemic or pandemic in nature, Choubey said, adding that the strategy had been recommended globally and by the World Health Organisation for suppressing transmission or breaking the cycle of transmission of COVID-19.Such a strategy combined with non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical distancing, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquettes and use of mask or face covers, closure of schools and work places, complemented the containment strategy in preventing the disease from spreading, Choubey said.The government periodically issued guidelines, protocols and standard operating procedures based on existing scientific evidence, Choubey said.To another question on whether geo-tagging was done for areas with high COVID-19 cases, Choubey said all states and Union Territories followed mapping of cases and clusters digitally to demarcate containment and buffer zones.In addition, the Aarogya Setu ITIHAS interface, which uses location data, and the Aarogya Setu analytics to predict emerging hotspots were used effectively to support surveillance and case finding, he said.Meanwhile, Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey also said multiple factors may have contributed to India reporting higher COVID-related deaths per million population than other South Asian countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the government said on Tuesday.According to the minister, comparison of deaths per million may not be apt as there are factors such as varied geography, case definitions, surveillance, testing and reporting protocols.To a question on whether it is a fact that COVID-19 related deaths per million population in India is much higher than that in other South Asian countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, he said in Rajya Sabha, “Yes. Comparison of deaths per million may not be apt as there are multiple factors that may contribute to this observation.”   India has recorded 112 deaths per million population, while the US has reported 1,347, the UK 1,533, Spain 1,247, Brazil 1,044 and Russia 495.

02-02-2021||New Delhi||No blood banks in 63 districts of country||Sixty-three districts in the country are without blood banks as per reports received till September 2020, Rajya Sabha was informed on Tuesday.Responding to a question on whether the government has taken any steps or will take steps to ensure that all districts in the country have at least one blood bank, Minister of State for Health Ashwini Choubey said public health, being a state subject, it is the primary responsibility of state governments to ensure the establishment of blood banks as per their need.              However, support is provided to states and UTs to strengthen their healthcare system including strengthening existing blood banks/establishing new blood banks based on proposals submitted by the states through the National Health Mission, Choubey said in a written reply.The 63 districts include 14 from Arunachal Pradesh, 5 each from Assam and Bihar, 12 from Manipur, 7 from Meghalaya, and 9 from Nagaland.           The National Blood Transfusion Council, MOHFW has formulated the blood bank policy according to which there should be at least one blood bank per district, Choubey said.The adequate infrastructure required for establishing a blood bank is laid down in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules thereunder, compliance to which is mandatory to obtain a license to run a blood bank.                              There are 3321 licensed blood banks in the country which collected 1.27 crore blood Units in 2019-20.    On whether there have been reports of a shortage of blood in those banks currently functional in the country, Choubey said, “No such instances have been reported regarding the shortage of blood supply.”              Some of the measures to ensure 24X7 availability of blood in blood centres include promoting voluntary blood donation through state Blood Transfusion Councils set up in each state and union territory in coordination with non-governmental organizations, Indian Red Cross, Rotary Lions Club and other Civil Society Organization.    The blood banks are mandated to update the daily stock position of blood and blood products according to blood groups in eRaktKosh portal.       They are permitted to transfer blood and blood components between licensed blood bank and blood storage centres to ensure timely supply of blood to patients.     To ensure equitable availability of blood units in the country, the states have been supported with the blood collection and transportation vans with dedicated human resources, Choubey said. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/no-blood-banks-in-63-districts-of-country-206897

We note the ongoing talks between the Governments of India and China and continue to support a direct dialogue and a peaceful resolution to border disputes," Emily J Horne, spokesperson, National Security Council (NSC) of the White House, told PTI on Monday.He was responding to a question on recent Chinese attempts to intrude into Indian territories and occupy it."The United States is concerned by Beijing's pattern of ongoing attempts to intimidate its neighbours," Horne said."We will stand with friends, partners and allies to advance our shared prosperity, security and values in the Indo-Pacific region," he added.This is the first response of the Biden administration on the India-China border clashes. Former vice president Joe Biden, a Democrat, was inaugurated as the 46th US President on January 20.China and India are locked in a military standoff in eastern Ladakh since May 5 last. The two countries have held several rounds of military and diplomatic talks to resolve the face-off, but no significant headway has been made so far. The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its man-made islands in the past few years.

02-02-2021||New Delhi||SC refuses to grant protection to MP Sanjay Singh against NBW issued on FIR lodged in Lucknow||The Supreme Court Tuesday refused to grant protection to Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh against whom a non-bailable warrant (NBW) has been issued on an FIR lodged in Lucknow after his press conference on August 12 last year at which he alleged that the UP government was favouring a certain class of society.The AAP leader has moved the apex court seeking quashing of multiple FIRs lodged against him in various districts of Uttar Pradesh after the press conference, saying they have been “maliciously instituted to unleash political vendetta”.In a separate petition, Singh has also challenged the January 21 order of the Allahabad High Court which refused to quash the FIR in Lucknow.The matter came up for hearing on Tuesday before a bench, comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and R S Reddy, which said it would not pass any order without going through the high court verdict.The top court asked senior lawyer Vivek Tankha and advocate Sumeer Sodhi, who appeared for Singh, to place before it the copy of the high court’s verdict.When Tankha urged the apex court that Singh should be protected as an NBW has been issued against him in the FIR lodged in Lucknow, the bench said he can seek exemption from appearance before the trial court.The bench, which also refused to issue any notice on Singh’s plea at this stage, has posted the matter for hearing next week.In one of his pleas filed in the apex court seeking quashing of multiple FIRs, Singh said, “In the said press conference, the petitioner (Singh) had merely raised certain social issues, namely neglect and apathy of the government towards a certain class of society.”           He alleged that after the press conference, multiple FIRs were registered against him at the instance of BJP’s members at various police stations in different districts of the state.Singh said they are “manifestly attended with mala fides and have been maliciously instituted to unleash political vendetta against the petitioner and to harass him”.                          “The said FIRs have been filed against the petitioner out of the malice and sheer political vendetta with intent to coerce, harass and intimidate the petitioner as a part of larger ploy to muzzle the opposition leaders, from speaking up against the government of Uttar Pradesh,” he said.Singh further alleged that content in the FIRs is same verbatim and they have been filed across several districts across more than 700 kilometres in Uttar Pradesh on the same day within a span of a few hours.He said he is aware of eight FIRs filed in eight districts including at Lucknow, Sant Kabir Nagar, Khiri, Bagpat, Muzaffarnagar, Basti and at Aligarh.He has contended that these FIRs are a threat to his exercise of the right to free speech, right to assemble peacefully; right to move freely throughout the territory of India which are guaranteed under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution. “The press conference was an exercise through which the petitioner was raising pertinent social and political issues, and the said FIRs have been filed with the sole intention to stifle the voice of opposition which is fundamental to a functional democracy,” he said, adding that these FIRs filed against him are “frivolous, baseless, vexatious and are figments of imagination of the complainant and the police department”.He has alleged that sole aim of the state machinery is to prevent him from campaigning in Uttar Pradesh and from carrying out political activities there in the run up to the elections in 2022.“The state machinery in complete derogation of their duties and responsibilities conferred upon it by law have been involved in mounting undue pressure upon the petitioner by threatening to take coercive action against the petitioner in order to make him succumb to their unbridled envy,” he has claimed.“In light of the aforesaid, the petitioner prays that the aforesaid FIRs registered against him be quashed as they are nothing but an abuse of process aimed at stifling the voice of opposition in a democracy and the petitioner’s fundamental rights,” he has claimed.Alternatively, he has sought transfer of the FIRs lodged in connection with the press conference of August 12, 2020 and related political activities of the petitioner outside of Uttar Pradesh.— PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/sc-refuses-to-grant-protection-to-mp-sanjay-singh-against-nbw-issued-on-fir-lodged-in-lucknow-206891
02-02-2021||New Delhi||Naidu calls for disruption-free, orderly discussions in House||Keen to ensure orderly functioning of the Upper House of Parliament, Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday asked MPs to follow rules, maintain discipline and dignity while discussing issues of national and public importance in the House.Making a veiled reference to the ugly scenes witnessed in the House during the passage of farm bills in the last session, Naidu asked members to make the current budget session “more purposeful” where issues are discussed threadbare in “a peaceful, orderly and dignified manner”.“Last time, some unfortunate incidents happened,” he said without going into the details.In September last year, opposition MPs tore the rule book, climbed on the podium and created a ruckus during the passage of three farm sector reform bills.“It is binding on all of us to see that the House functions properly, members follow rules and regulations, maintain discipline and dignity and also participate in debates in a meaningful manner,” Naidu said.“I have all along been appealing to members to prevent any such situation which will affect the interest of Parliament and also the nation,” he said.On the first full-day functioning of the House in the current Budget session which started on Friday, Naidu said the nation had completed 100 years of representative democracy.The first direct elections to the imperial and provincial legislative councils were held during the winter of 1920.“Democracy is all about the participation of people in the management of public affairs and policy-making through their elected representatives,” he said.“The occasion of being a 100-year-old modern representative democracy calls for serious reflection on the state of democracy and the functioning of legislatures in our country,” he said.On this occasion, the House should resolve to enhance the dignity through “disruption-free proceedings as per rules and conventions,” Naidu said.Over 20 hours have been allocated for discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the President for his address to members of both houses and the General Budget for 2021-2022, offering ample opportunities to raise and discuss a wide range of issues of public concern to which the Government will respond, he said and referred to discussions he had with leaders of all parties on Sunday.“I sincerely hope that this important Budget session will turn out to be highly productive in the spirit of the last four sessions,” he said.Naidu said he could sense the enthusiasm on the part of all sections of the House to further move on with this important session with the President presenting the vision of the government to members of both the Houses and the government presenting the General Budget for the next financial year with a focus on post-COVID-19 recovery and health.“I once again reiterate the importance of this Budget session and the need to ensure the smooth and effective functioning of the august House,” he added.Referring to work between two sessions of Parliament, Naidu said eight department-related Parliamentary Standing Committees of the Rajya Sabha worked overtime and held a total of 55 meetings during the inter-session period.“These committees met for a total duration of 110 hours and 4 minutes which comes to an average duration of 2 hours and 7 minutes. This is an improvement over the previous average of 1 hour 54 minutes per each meeting,” he said.The committee on Commerce has reported substantial improvement in holding 10 meetings during the inter-session period for a total duration of 26 hours 18 minutes. The average duration of each meeting has increased to 2 hours 37 minutes against the average duration of only 1 hour 42 minutes earlier.The committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture held the highest number of 11 meetings for a total period of over 22 hours. The committee on Education, Women, Child, Youth and Sports reported the highest average attendance of 53.45 per cent in seven meetings.Six committees of the Rajya Sabha, during the inter-session period, spent 38 hours and 34 minutes discussing various aspects of the outbreak of the pandemic, its consequences and management.“These committees of the Rajya Sabha have examined the pandemic related issues in a bipartisan and constructive manner and not as fault finding so as to provide guidance for such sudden challenges in future. These committees have also complimented the governments, the people and all other stakeholders for rising to the occasion in handling the pandemic challenge,” he said.Noting that the change between the same time last year and now is perceptible, he said India had moved from being a nation with few testing facilities, quality masks and personal protection equipment to one that “successfully contained” the pandemic and has emerged as the hope for other countries with indigenously made vaccines and as the vaccine factory for the world.“This is a remarkable transformation. This House places on record its appreciation of the people and all others concerned for the same,” he added.

02-02-2021||New Delhi||Security beefed up at Delhi borders; traffic congestions on key roads in city||Security has been stepped up with the deployment of extra personnel and strengthening of barricades near farmers’ protest sites at Delhi's borders, leading to traffic congestions on many key roads in the national capital.Taking to Twitter, the Delhi Traffic Police alerted commuters about the closure of borders and suggested alternative roads for travel.Workers under the watch of police personnel on Monday were seen hooking iron rods between two rows of cement barriers on a flank of the main highway at the Singhu border to further restrict the movement of protesters agitating against the Centre's new farm laws at the site.Another portion of the highway at the Delhi-Haryana border is practically blocked now as a makeshift cement wall has come up there.Security has also been tightened at the Delhi-Ghazipur border, where protesting farmers are also camping for over two months."Ghazipur border is closed. Traffic diverted from NH 24, NH 9, Road no 56, 57 A, Kondli, Paper market, Telco T point, EDM Mall, Akshardham & Nizammudin Khatta. Traffic is heavy on Vikas marg, IP extention, NH 24. Pl(ease) commute from other borders," the Delhi Traffic Police tweeted.According to the police, Delhi-Ghazipur border remains closed for traffic due to the farmers' protests. The commuters are suggested to take alternative routes via Anad Vihar, Chilla, DND, Apsara, Bhopra and Loni borders, it added."Singhu, Saboli, Piau Maniyari borders are closed. Auchandi, Lampur, Safiabad, Singhu school & Palla toll tax borders are open. Pl(ease) take alternative route(s)," the traffic said in another tweet.The police said traffic was diverted from NH-44 and suggested commuters to avoid Outer Ring Road, GTK road and NH 44.On Monday, Delhi Police Commissioner SN Srivastava and other senior police officers visited Ghazipur border to take stock of the security arrangements.Security arrangements continue to be strengthened at the Delhi-UP border site, which is galvanising farmers from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, days after an emotional appeal by Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait.Drones have also been deployed to monitor the protesters.Farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh have been camping at Delhi's borders for weeks, seeking a repeal of the three agriculture laws.They claim that the new laws will weaken the minimum support price (MSP) system. But the Centre says the laws will only give farmers more options to sell their produce.

02-02-2021||New Delhi||ED attaches Rs 130-crore assets of Hyderabad-based jewellers||The Enforcement Directorate has attached assets worth over Rs 130 crore of various Hyderabad-based jewellery houses and their promoters in a money laundering probe linked to alleged financial irregularities done during the 2016 demonetisation exercise, the agency said on Tuesday.The action has been taken against Musaddilal Gems and Jewels Pvt Ltd, Vaishnavi Bullion Pvt Ltd and Musaddilal Jewellers Pvt Ltd, according to the Enforcement Directorate (ED).The attached assets, include 41 immovable properties, investments made in shares and jewellery, and bullion worth Rs 83.3 crore, seized in raids conducted some years back. The total value of these properties is Rs 130.57 crore, it said.The attachment has been undertaken under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and the ED case is based on an FIR registered by Telangana Police against the jewellery houses post the demonetisation of two high-value banknotes - Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 - by the government in November 2016.In a statement, the ED said that during probe it was found that the three jewellery and bullion firms had deposited Rs 111 crore worth of demonetised notes in their bank accounts immediately after the note ban was announced on November 8, 2016."They had raised fake cash receipts and sale invoices showing that around 6,000 fictitious customers visited their showrooms to purchase gold jewellery between 8 pm to midnight on November 8, 2016 immediately after the announcement of demonetisation," the ED alleged.The agency claimed that "the companies of Kailash Chand Gupta and his sons (promoters of Musaddilal Gems) in connivance with his chartered accountant (CA) Sanjay Sarda fabricated invoices to justify the fictitious sources of income and the large amounts of cash deposits.""Sarda advised them to raise fabricated invoices below Rs 2 lakh so that there would be no requirement of recording the KYC or PAN of the customers," the agency alleged.The CA also contributed demonetised cash for conversion and also received a "hefty commission" for rendering advice, it claimed.The ED said that immediately after depositing the said amount of cash in their bank accounts, a major portion of these deposits were transferred to gold bullion dealers to buy bullion, which was delivered to various jewellers, individuals and entities."Thus, the demonetised notes were successfully placed, layered and finally integrated into the financial system," it alleged.The ED said the Rs 111 crore was pooled from various jewellers, individuals and entities. "Majority of the jewellers admitted that they had contributed cash," it said."They again claimed that the demonetised notes were sourced from unknown customers. But they could neither provide the list of customers nor explain the reasons for depositing it in the accounts of Mussadilal Jewellers instead of their own," the agency said.The ED said that it was found that by selling the converted gold at an exorbitant profit, the Gupta family derived profits of around Rs 28 crore.The agency has filed two chargesheets in the case, the latest being in September last year.

02-02-2021||Mumbai||How right is it to use budget as ‘tool’ to win polls, wonders Shiv Sena||The Shiv Sena on Tuesday claimed Union Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced big packages in the budget for some poll-bound states, and asked how right is it to use the budget as a "tool" to win elections.Accusing the Centre of setting a new trend of playing "dirty politics" for votes through the budget, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said the allocation of more funds to poll-bound states is a kind of "bribery".It also accused the Centre of ignoring Maharashtra which, it said, contributes highest revenue to the Union government's coffers.Finance Minister Sitharaman presented the 2021-22 Union Budget on Monday."...what is unfortunate is that the (central) government has set a new trend of playing dirty politics of votes through budget," the editorial said.The Assembly polls are due in West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Hence, the finance minister has allocated big packages and projects to these states, it said.The Marathi daily said new projects must be undertaken as they are required for development."But it is a kind of bribery to allocate more funds only to the poll-bound states, eyeing elections there. How right is it to use the budget as a tool to woo the people to win elections?" it asked.The editorial said except for the provisions made for Nashik and Nagpur Metro projects, Mumbai and Maharashtra had got "nothing" in the budget.The Centre has made a provision of Rs 2,092 crore in its budget for Nashik Metro, while the Nagpur Metro phase-2 also got Rs 5,976 crore."Why this discrimination?" the editorial asked, and said the Centre's finance department should think about the entire country.Sitharaman is the finance minister of the entire country and not of some select states, it added.The Shiv Sena also claimed that the budget shows dreams and brings politics in economics."The budget is unjust to states which are not poll-bound. Roads, railways, aeroplanes, petroleum companies and a lot have been sold," it claimed."The government which sold this and that, has now decided to sell the insurance sector as well," it alleged.It noted that Sitharaman did mention in her budget speech the closing down of "thousands" of businesses, unemployment caused during the COVID-19 period and how jobs will be restored.The editorial, however, welcomed the Rs 35,000 crore budgetary provision for COVID-19 vaccination.

02-02-2021||New Delhi||‘Aatmanirbharta’ named Oxford Hindi word of 2020||‘Aatmanirbharta’ implying self-reliance has been named by Oxford Languages as its Hindi word of the year 2020 as it “validated the day-to-day achievements of the countless Indians who dealt with and survived the perils of a pandemic”.The word was chosen by an advisory panel of language experts Kritika Agrawal, Poonam Nigam Sahay and Imogen Foxell.The Oxford Hindi word of the year is a word or expression that is chosen to reflect the ethos, mood, or preoccupations of the passing year, and have lasting potential as a term of cultural significance.In a statement, Oxford Languages said in the early months of the pandemic when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced India’s COVID-19 recovery package, he emphasised the need to become self-reliant as a country, as an economy, as a society and as individuals, in a bid to navigate the perils of the pandemic.There was a massive increase in the usage of ‘aatmanirbharta’ following the prime minister’s address, highlighting its increased prominence as a phrase and concept in the public lexicon of India, it said.One of the standout successes of the entire Aatmanirbhar Bharat campaign is the large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccine in India. During the Republic Day parade, the Department of Biotechnology highlighted the Aatmanirbhar Bharat campaign and showcased the COVID-19 vaccine development process in its tableau at Rajpath.“In an unprecedented year, ‘aatmanirbharta’ found resonance with a wide cross-section of people as it is seen to be an answer to the revival of a COVID-impacted economy,” said Oxford University Press India managing director Sivaramarkrishnan Venkateswaran.Agrawal said amid a number of interesting and topical entries received, ‘aatmanirbharta’ stood out because it validated the day-to-day achievements of the countless Indians who dealt with and survived the perils of a pandemic.This word “gives a voice to the strength displayed by young and old alike in dealing with extended periods of isolation, lack of familial support, loss of livelihoods and other difficulties through sheer determination and self-reliance”, she said.Previous Hindi words of the year are Aadhar (2017), Nari Shakti (2018) and Samvidhaan (2019).While the Hindi word of the year has great resonance for the year in which it was chosen, it doesn’t mean that the word will automatically go into any Oxford dictionaries. —PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/aatmanirbharta-named-oxford-hindi-word-of-2020-206875

02-02-2021||Washington||Thrust on infra will boost growth: US chamber of commerce on India’s budget||A Boston-based India-centric chamber of commerce on Monday said the increase in health-care outlay in the latest annual budget would lead India towards a healthier country and the thrust on infrastructure would boost growth and generate jobs."Overall, these announcements are rightly directed to support the health-care sector not only in terms of expenditure but also to support research and development. The increase in the health-care outlay will lead India towards a healthier India. A healthier workforce will lead to higher productivity, which will drive GDP growth," Karun Rishi, president of the USA India Chamber of Commerce, said.The finance minister has done a remarkable job in presenting a growth-focused budget during the unprecedented Covid pandemic-hit circumstances, he said, adding that the budget is transparent and has rationalised the off-balance-sheet borrowings and headlined fiscal deficit numbers.Fiscal deficit is projected to be high, but these are extraordinary times. India has been fiscally prudent compared to other countries at a time of unprecedented economic pressure due to Covid. The government has stated a glide path of reducing the fiscal deficit over five years. The deficit comes down to four per cent by 2026. Growth has to be aggressively pursued. Sluggish growth can leave open the danger of high debt to GDP ratio, Rishi said."The bold-thinking announcement of an asset reconstruction company that will assume all the stressed assets of banks and sell them to alternative investment funds can help capitalise PSU banks. The thrust on infrastructure will boost growth and generate much-needed employment," he said in response to a question.Observing that technology has been a key focus of the Narendra Modi government, Rishi said in the 2018 budget, the finance minister made a pitch for "technologies of the future" - artificial intelligence, machine learning and blockchain technologies.The finance minister's proposed Ministry of Corporate Affairs' MCA 21 portal, driven by data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning features as well as having additional modules such as for e-adjudication and compliance management, will bring efficiency and improve ease-of-doing business in India. "It is encouraging to see the Indian government using these technologies," Rishi said.Increasing health-care spending by 137 per cent is a remarkable step, he said, adding that this would give a massive boost to India's health sector.The allocation of Rs 35,000 crore for the COVID-19 vaccines shows the Indian government's strong resolve to vaccinate its citizens, an absolute necessity to bring normalcy in the country. The focus on health care with the prime minister's Aatmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana to strengthen the country's primary, secondary and tertiary health infrastructure with an outlay of Rs 64,180 crore over six years shows that health-care capacity building is now a key priority for the Government of India, Rishi said."We applaud Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's proposal to set up a national institution for One Health, a regional research platform for the World Health Organisation South East Asia region, nine biosafety level (BSL) 3 laboratories and four regional national institutes of virology," he added.Announcing the National Research Foundation in the 2019 budget was a "game changer". The additional outlay of Rs 50,000 crore over five years through the foundation will boost research and development in India. This shows the government's resolve to strengthen the research innovation ecosystem in India, Rishi said.

02-02-2021||Ravi S Singh||Rajya Sabha adjourned for the day amidst ruckus by Opposition leaders||Tribune News ServiceNew Delhi, February 2The Rajya Sabha on Tuesday was adjourned for the third time amidst the ruckus created by the Opposition parties over Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu turning down Opposition’s notices to discuss the issue of farm laws.The House has now been adjourned till 9 am on Wednesday.Naidu turned down notices for suspension of the business of the House by the Opposition parties’ leaders to discuss farm laws, saying the issue could be taken up during a discussion on ‘Motion of Thanks’ on President’s address, which will commence from tomorrow.“The President,” Naidu said, “had referred to the farmer’s agitation in his address made at the start of the Budget session of Parliament last week.”Also read: Cong to seek business suspension in LS, Rahul flays Centre for barricading protest sitesHow right is it to use budget as ‘tool’ to win polls, wonders Shiv SenaNaidu calls for disruption-free, orderly discussions in HouseNaidu appreciates use of regional languages during Rajya Sabha sessionThe House was first adjourned for about 40 minutes till 10:30. As soon as the House met again, similar scenes were witnessed leading to another adjournment till 11:30 am.The Congress, the Left, the TMC, the DMK and the RJD members first walked out from Rajya Sabha after their demand for suspension of business of the day for taking up the discussion was rejected by the Chair.Opposition members shouted slogans to disrupt the Question Hour, forcing Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu to adjourn the proceedings till 10:30 am.As the protesting members continued sloganeering, Naidu asked them to return to their seats.“Please go to your seats and allow the House to function. Some of you said the last time that not having question hour is ‘murder of democracy’. This is a statement made outside,” he said.“Members who have walked out and again coming to the Well is not fair,” Naidu said before adjourning the House for the first time.The Opposition parties had given notice under rule 267 calling for the suspension of business of the day to take up discussion on the ongoing agitation by farmers on Delhi borders against three new farm laws.Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad, SS Roy of the TMC, Elaraam Kareem of the CPI(M), Binoy Viswam of the CPI, Manoj Jha of the RJD,Asokh Sidhartha of the BSP and Tiruchi Siva of the DMK had given the notices to the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.Not satisfied with Naidu’s move to turn down the notices, the Opposition leaders staged a walkout in protest, after pressing for discussion on ground that the farmer issue was of national importance.Opposition leaders later returned to the House and raised slogans in protest, disrupting the proceedings of the House while the Question Hour was in progress.The House has been adjourned till 11:30 amdist the ruckus by the Opposition leaders.During the proceedings of the House, Naidu, rejecting the 267 notice, said: “As we are going to start a discussion on Motion of Thanks to President’s Address tomorrow, members can participate and raise their concerns.”He said several rounds of discussions have happened between the government and the farmers’ group.“I understand the concern (of members) for the need to resolve the issue at the earliest date,” he said.Naidu, however, allowed members who gave notices to make very brief mentions.Leader of the Opposition and senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said the farmers had been camping for more than two months and the issue needed to be discussed.Roy said the discussion in the House was important as the Members did not know about the discussions between the government and the protesting farmers, and the House should discuss the issue separately from the Motion of Thanks.“It was an issue of national importance. We want a discussion on a specific issue,” he said.While CPI leader Elamaram Kareem said water and electricity supply to the protest sites had been cut, DMK’s Tiruchi Siva said farmers had been sitting on roads for over two months in the bitter cold and the issue needs to be discussed separately.Manoj Jha (RJD) said Parliament should at least discuss the issue.However, Naidu did not agree to their motion after which the members of the Congress, the Left, the TMC, the DMK and the RJD staged a walkout.Naidu corrected the Members, saying it was wrong to say that no discussions had been held on the farm bills in the House before its passage. He said it was discussed for four hours.“As far as the mode of voting on them was concerned, there may be difference of opinion on it,” Naidu said.“No one is stopping you from discussing the issue tomorrow. Tomorrow, you will get an opportunity,” he said.Naidu said 10 hours had been allocated for discussion on Motion of Thanks to the President’s address and an equivalent amount given for discussion on the Budget.“Please take the opportunity tomorrow,” he said.Some of them also entered the Well of the House.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi intervened to say that the opposition Benches were only interested in disrupting the functioning of the proceedings.“They had asked for Question Hour but they do not want it to happen now,” Joshi said. — With PTI||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rajya-sabha-adjourned-for-the-day-amidst-ruckus-by-opposition-leaders-206853

Congress MPs from Punjab JS Gill, Gurjeet Aujla and Ravneet Bittu carried placards around their neck that read: “Repeal farm laws that are killing farmers.”The Opposition benches wore a thin look with Congress president Sonia Gandhi absent. Rahul Gandhi was seated in the second row. National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah was present. Samajwadi Party’s Mulayam Singh Yadav marked a brief presence.Trinamool Congress was the most aggressive with MPs Saugata Roy and Kalyan Banerjee frequently taunting the FM each time she made an announcement on record MSP procurement, proposed disinvestment and private management of ports. “Adani, Adani” chants resonated on the Opposition side when Sitharaman said the government would permit private players to manage ports.Throughout the speech, the Opposition MPs kept demanding restoration of MPLADs, currently suspended due to Covid.Modi frequently applauded the FM, giving a cue to his colleagues, who reciprocated heartily even as Opposition MPs were heard asking, “What’s there to clap?” With the news of markets surging arriving within an hour of the speech, the PM greeted her for a “good” Budget of the decade.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/repeal-farm-laws-demands-oppn-tmc-most-vociferous-206666

In the last Budget, Rs 1,34,399.77 crore was allocated for various schemes, though the revised estimate stood at Rs 1,16,757.92 crore. The allocation for research and education is higher than Rs 8,362.58 crore last year.The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, which is leading the farmers’ agitation against the three central laws, slammed the government for “reducing” allocation”.“Given the circumstances, one expected the FM will pay special attention to the farmers. But the government has reduced allocation for the sector. Is this the kind of support to agriculture that the PM speaks of? Is this how farmers’ income will be doubled? It’s treachery, a joke,” said Morcha leader Yogendra Yadav.Farm policy expert Sudhir Panwar alleged the government resolve to double farmers’ income lacked budgetary allocations and required policy shift. “The government has slashed allocation for all flagship schemes, including PMKSY, PMBFY and fertiliser subsidy… Increase of Rs 1.5 lakh crore in credit flow is customary and hardly matches the needs of the Covid-stressed farm economy,” he said.Sitharaman said there had been steady increase in the procurement of wheat, rice and pulses. The MSP regime had undergone a change, which ensured the price was at least 1.5 times the cost of production across all commodities, she said. She proposed extending Swamitva scheme to all states and integrating 1,000 more APMC ‘mandis’ with e-NAM. Connecting to sellers via e-NAMTotal allocation Rs1,31,531.19 cr||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rs11-000-cr-cut-for-agri-schemes-206665

These states will go to the polls in April-May this year.The Budget speech steered clear of financial aid to major states, including the cash-strapped Punjab, but offered a bonanza for the above four, attracting the Opposition’s ire. West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee went on to say her state did not require such funds to build roads and the money should be given to farmers.The FM announced several projects, including a national highway covering 3,500 km in Tamil Nadu at an investment of Rs 1.03 lakh crore, 1,100-km national highway for Kerala and Rs 25,000-crore highway among other projects for Bengal.The government said advanced traffic management system with speed radars, variable message signboards and GPS-enabled recovery vans would be installed on all new highways.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/rs2-27l-cr-booster-for-poll-bound-states-206663

The imposition of cess is aimed at ensuring dedicated resources for infrastructure development in rural areas. The Finance Minister also pointed out how the Centre had not only been purchasing more farm produce, but also expanding the ambit to more states and crops.The Budget also proposes to plug the gaps in health infrastructure by effecting 137% hike in allocation as compared with the current year figure. However, a regulatory body to check capriciousness of private hospitals, as suggested by the Economic Survey, remained elusive. A sum of Rs 37,000 crore has been allocated for Covid vaccines in the next fiscal with a promise of more, if required. Those above 75 years of age will no longer be required to file income tax returns, if their income is from pension and interest only.The Budget also provides for cutting the time period for retro-inspection of income tax returns and stepping up the process of faceless interface. However, there is no change in the personal income tax slabs for individuals.Interest on employee contributions to provident fund over Rs 2.5 lakh per annum would be taxed from April 1, 2021.The Finance Minister also proposed to increase foreign direct investment (FDI) limit in the insurance sector to 74 per cent from the present 49 per cent. The move is aimed at attracting greater overseas capital inflows to help enhance insurance penetration in the country.Tense borders have led to an increase of about Rs 25,000 crore in defence expenditure, including the highest ever allocation for purchasing defence platforms.Social welfare projects, including the Jal Jeevan Mission and Swachh Bharat, will continue apace with the addition of Rs 2,217 crore to tackle air pollution in 42 urban centres.The Education Ministry gets 9.5 per cent more allocation this year, along with a promise of 100 sainik schools in PPP mode. There is, however, no separate allocation for the National Education Policy-2020, Operation Digital Board (ODB) outlay remains stagnant, the Mid-Day Meal Scheme will see a Rs 1,400-crore drop and no allocation was made for madrasas and minorities.There were several adjustments in customs duty to promote make-in-India initiative and address complaints of inverted duty structure. The FM suggested a major makeover in the coming days. The Budget speech suggested a large number of legislative amendments as well as new laws to enable the sale of PSUs and insurance companies.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/137-hike-in-health-care-outlay-206662

PTI36% more for Tribal MinistryThe government has set aside Rs7,524 cr for the Ministry of Tribal Affairs in the Union Budget for 2021-22, an increase of 36% over the last fiscal year. A sum of Rs7,411 crore was allocated to the ministry in 2020-21, which was later revised to Rs5,508 crore. Tribal Affairs Minister Arjun Munda said it was the “best budget so far”, as it was prepared under unprecedented circumstances. PTITourism Ministry funding slashed by 19%The budgetary allocation for the Ministry of Tourism has been slashed from Rs2,500 crore in 2020-21 to Rs2,026.77 crore this year, in a blow to the tourism industry which is reeling from huge losses due to the Covid crisis. With the coronavirus crisis restricting not just foreign tourist footfalls into the country but also keeping domestic tourists at bay, the budget has focused on pushing funds for promotion and publicity to help woo tourists back. Out of the Rs668.72 crore allocated towards promotion and publicity, Rs524.02 crore is for the overseas market and Rs144.70 crore has been kept for domestic tourists. PTIUjjwala scheme to cover 1 crore moreThe government said the Ujjwala scheme, which provides free cooking gas LPG, will be extended to one crore more beneficiaries.

She also announced a transport system operator for regulating common carrier capacity in gas pipelines to boost gas-based economy. ptiFramework to choose power service providerThe government will soon put in place a framework to allow electricity consumers choose service providers or discoms. “Discoms are monopolies. There is a need to provide a choice to customers to choose service provider (distribution company).

They are being kept under constant observation. Depending on their condition, we shall consider discharging them on Tuesday evening," VNGMCH Dean Dr Milind Kamble told IANS.On the possible repercussions of oral intake of hand-sanitising liquids, the Dean said that though it is not fatal, it contains around 70 per cent alcohol, which may create health complications, especially among children, as in the present instance.Yavatmal Collector M Devender Singh visited the hospital on Sunday night and enquired about the condition of the children.He ordered the Zilla Parishad CEO Shrikrishna Panchal to visit the village and investigate the incident and after his preliminary probe, three nurses on duty at the time have been suspended.Farmers leader from Yavatmal and Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavlamban Mission President Kishore Tiwari suspects it could be a case of "deliberate sabotage" and plans to visit the affected village on Tuesday for a spot assessment.Panchal said that the nurses apparently mistook bottles of sanitisers placed nearby to be the vaccine drops and administered them to the unsuspecting kids even as another three health workers are under the scanner for the lapse.The incident came a day after the Polio National Immunisation Day (January 31), which was launched by President RN Kovind at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Saturday.IANS||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/maharashtra-horror-12-kids-given-sanitiser-instead-of-polio-drops-3-nurses-suspended-206450

Its exercise was coupled with duties and responsibilities.Maintaining that reach of social media was much wider than traditional media, the petitioner said misuse of such platforms has led to a few communal violence incidents.Last month, the top court had issued notices to the Centre, Press Council of India and News Broadcasters Association (NBA) on another PIL filed by film maker Nilesh Navalakha seeking setting up of an independent media tribunal to adjudicate on complaints against TV news channels.Navalakha had contended that a citizen-led independent Media Tribunal was needed to hear and expeditiously adjudicate on complaints against media businesses."Over the last few years, media trials, hate speech, propaganda news, paid news, have become the order of the day, thereby impeding the right to a fair trial of victims and right to fair and proportionate reporting,” Navalakha had submitted. He had contended that “reckless reportage by the electronic media without accountability can, by no stretch of imagination, be read into the right to freedom of speech and expression enjoyed by the electronic media.”||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/hate-speech-sc-issues-notice-to-centre-on-pil-seeking-to-regulate-facebook-twitter-206424

Upon receipt of requests to withhold content, we will promptly notify the affected account holders (unless we are prohibited from doing so eg if we receive a court order under seal),” the spokesperson added.However, Twitter did not provide details of the accounts/tweets that were blocked.Upon searching for accounts, including Kisan Ekta Morcha (@Kisanektamorcha) and BKU Ekta Urgahan (@Bkuektaugrahan) -- a message saying “account has been withheld in India in response to a legal demand” was displayed.However, these accounts were restored by the evening.Besides these, several other individual and organisation accounts, including one of a media outlet and another of a senior functionary of a separate entity, were also withheld, even as debates started on social media over the development.The development comes in the wake of violence in Delhi on January 26 during a tractor parade of farmers, protesting against the three new central agriculture laws.The Delhi Police is currently probing the Republic Day violence, wherein it has lodged multiple FIRs and booked, among others, several farmer leaders leading the protests at the national capital’s borders since November-end.

We will focus on ensuring increased credit flows to animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries”.The Budget Estimate (BE)-2021-22 for the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare is Rs 131531.19 crore, including Rs 123017.57 crore for its various schemes and Rs 8513.62 crore for agricultural research and education. While BE 2021-22 of Rs 123017.57 crore for schemes is higher that Revised Estimate (RE) or actual spending (Rs 116757.92 crore) in 2020-21, it is much lower than BE of Rs 134399.77 crore, last year. Though for research and education the FM allocated more than the 2020-21 BE, which was Rs 8362.58 crore.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha, which is leading the farmers agitation slammed the government for “reducing agriculture allocation”, calling it a “joke and treachery”. Morcha leader Yogendra Yadav said given the circumstances one expected the “FM will pay some special attention to farmers. But truth is that the government has actually reduced the expenditure on sector”.Also read: Budget 2021: FM unveils budget aimed at boosting pandemic-hit economy“Is that the support to agriculture that the PM talks about? Is it the way towards doubling of farmers incomes? This is a joke, this is treachery farmers will remember and movements will take this message across the country,” Yadav said.Farm policy expert Sudhir Panwar said the government’s resolve of doubling farmers’ income “again lacks budgetary allocations and required policy shift”. “The Government slashed Budget on all flagship schemes, including PMKSY, PMBFY, fertiliser subsidy and market intervention scheme. Budgetary allocations on infrastructure development of APMC ‘mandis’ with linkage petrol and diesel cess is for infrastructure is smart political move to convince farmers and general public on continuation of APMC. Increase in credit flow is customary and increase of Rs 1.5 lakh crore hardly matches needs of Covid-stressed farm economy,” he said.Meanwhile, reiterating the commitment to welfare of farmers, Sitharaman said there has been steady increase the procurement of wheat, rice, pulses from farmers. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) regime has undergone a sea change to ensure price that is at least 1.5 times the cost of production across all commodities, she said making official the increase in support prices of crops like wheat, rice, pulses during the regime of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In her speech she proposed to extend SWAMITVA Scheme to all states; to integrate 1,000 more ‘mandis’ with e-NAM; investments in the development of modern fishing harbours and fish landing centres and five major fishing harbours – Kochi, Chennai, Visakhapatnam, Paradip, and Petuaghat. Apart from inland fishing harbours and fish-landing centres along banks of rivers and waterways, she also proposed a Multipurpose Seaweed Park for Tamil Nadu.||https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/agriculture-fm-proposes-hike-in-farm-loan-credit-agriculture-infra-fund-to-apmcs-206346
